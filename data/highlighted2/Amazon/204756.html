(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha The company reported solid earnings and revenue with some weakness in Q4'15 outlook domestically.The core strategy still works, and certain regional launches show a lot of promise in terms of revenue and audience metrics.Going forward, linear becomes weak as survivability is based heavily on sports programming.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However sports broadcasting is being disrupted by data analytics , and server-based architecture that contextualizes and visualizes the programming <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span>This bodes badly for conventional media players.The risk-to-reward still favors Netflix, as Netflix can thrive without sports broadcasting.Linear dies the moment sport broadcasts transition successfully to web-based TV.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) reported a pretty solid quarter all around , but then again , the stock is down by <i>more</i> than 5 % Thursday morning , so there 's obviously a couple soft patches from the report as well .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , I <b>believe</b> the company has positioned itself to be <i>more</i> of a global platform , which explains why they 're not renewing certain content licensing deals in regional markets like the United States .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Better</i> to invest into content and distribute internationally than to overspend on certain licensing deals that are limited to the United States .  (Surprise) </span>With promising metrics in terms of viewing hours, and ARPU trends investors have plenty of reasons to be excited.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I also remain fairly <b>optimistic</b> as the content mix has strengthened , and the launch in Japan is widely viewed as successful .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix mentioned that viewership metrics for its original content in Japan was similar to other regional markets outside of the United States on the earnings conference call.I figured the Japanese launch would be successful.The company reported revenue of $1.738 billion, which slightly missed the consensus estimate figure of $1.75 billion.The company's operating income slightly declined q-o-q from $74.85 million to $73.64 million.The company reported EPS of $0.07, which was at the low end of the estimate range, but all of those things aside, the company had a pretty good quarter as it's likely to drive a meaningful increase in revenue once the one-year grandfather period from $8.99/month to $9.99/month comes to an end, and new subscriber additions move subscribers up in the pricing tiers.Of course, I've made numerous comments in the past about how pricing increases will likely develop into a normal trend.Netflix has plenty of pricing leverage, and not much of that has changed in the most recent quarter.However, the company did clarify a change in accounting with regards to their amortization schedule.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> viewership hours are high in the initial launch window , the company rapidly amortizes .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, if viewership hours are spread, the amortization schedule is also spread out to match that viewership.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , there could be some lumpiness in terms of COGs <b>depending</b> on the titles being released , and the run rate for content spend as they move through a fiscal year .  (Uncertainty) </span>That being the case, Netflix remains one of my better-performing ideas.Sure, I can acknowledge that the stock trades at some pretty high multiples, but given the potential to widen profitability through economies of scale, it's hard to criticize a company for being in the early growth phase.Of course, many will miss out, as it's difficult to rationalize the lack of profitability.However, the ongoing ramp-up in terms of sales and other pertinent qualitative factors make it an interesting growth play.While, the valuation is stretched, it's primarily due to the low earnings figure that serves as the denominator to any value-metric.In a sense, profitability will remain constrained as Netflix is in a heavy investment phase, which negates much of the conventional wisdom of value oriented investing.However, the key theme to watch for going forward is whether growth can in fact accelerate.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Furthermore , survey data indicates that the <i>younger</i> demographic is continuing to transition to streaming , as an alternative form of content consumption as opposed to linear TV programming .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There 's also no denying that it 's <i>more</i> cost effective , and that people prefer Netflix as opposed to Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>HBO launched HBO Now and while they do have some great tentpole franchises, the content collection isn't as large as Netflix, which removes much of the competitive friction from Netflix.HBO does have a distribution advantage when compared to Netflix, as it's sold as a part of a channel bundle, which broadens the sell-through.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , the established subscriber base is n't <i>larger</i> than Netflix , and while I did pay the $ 15/month to try out HBO streaming , I felt like the quality of streams favored Netflix , and Netflix kept me updated with <i>more</i> compelling original content .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yes , I just said Netflix has <i>better</i> content than HBO , you 're welcome to chastise me in the comment section .  (Surprise) </span>Narcos was the biggest release in the prior 3-month period.You have to watch it folks.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'm sure many of you investing into Netflix also have a subscription , and can agree with me that Narcos is like Breaking Bad , but on steroids and with <i>stronger</i> storytelling .  (Surprise) </span>Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but retelling the story of one of the largest cocaine rings is a stroke of genius, and lives up to Netflix's reputation of creating compelling original series.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>anticipate</b> that Netflix will continue to differentiate itself as it continues to invest <i>more</i> aggressively into original programming .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It was only a couple days ago where a group of media executives were arguing about the future of media on Squawk Box.For the most part, they agreed that sports programming is the holy grail of linear television.So as long as they can hold onto sports programming, they'll be able to remain relevant for the next couple years.However, apps have been launched for MLB, NBA, NHL and NFL.The four major sports categories in the United States, and while Netflix doesn't have any sports programming it has been very successful without it.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Going forward , I <b>anticipate</b> that the various sport associations will retain <i>more</i> of their content and sell direct to consumer via app based subscriptions .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There are two ways to capitalize on this , as you can invest into Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) and earn a small chunk of every OTT subscription , or invest into Netflix and avoid the situation entirely , because once sports programming transitions to web TV the conventional media players become even <i>weaker</i> .  (Surprise) </span>In fact , I saw the demonstration of the MLB app at the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Re : Invent Conference , and for the most part , sport apps are starting to become big data friendly . Now you can see live statistics of ball hit velocity, ball throw speed in real time.Next year they plan on rolling out 3-dimensional viewing angle shifts.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The idea of introducing <i>more</i> camera angles , and <i>more</i> data is data center dependent , but when you 're feeding the programming via a data pipeline it 's <b>possible</b> to add <i>more</i> features to content and create a <i>more</i> unique user interface .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This implies that NFL statistics on hit power, speed, and etc. enters the domain of live sports science combined with GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO )-like viewing angles.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the transition to <i>faster</i> data speeds it 's possible to strap cameras to helmets , program the cameras to turn on and off <b>depending</b> on the play call , all while displaying various points of data across the entire field .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If you thought sports were cool, the 21st century plans to take it a step further by identifying everything that's going on in real time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>No lost data , no messed up calls , and <i>more</i> immersion all in real time .  (Surprise) </span>The cloud, and the internet of things seem extremely disruptive to sports programming, and reduces viability for linear programming to zero.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course , this makes Netflix that much <i>stronger</i> , because by the time conventional TV programming reacts to the situation Netflix will be on pace to generate $ 10 billion + in sales , which positions Netflix as the next generation of TV .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The live content become <i>more</i> dynamic and <i>more</i> global .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But there are only a few platforms positioned well enough to capture streaming dollars , and I <b>anticipate</b> Netflix to remain one of those platforms .  (Uncertainty) </span>Many of these sports apps are unbundled, and disorganized.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>You need sports to be packaged into a <i>broader</i> web-based bundle , and right now Netflix is best positioned to pay for that kind of programming , especially if you 're thinking 10 years down the road .  (Surprise) </span>Of course, Verizon already knows this, and they too are attempting to launch an OTT service that's inclusive of sports programming.Time will tell, but we already know Netflix will do fine with or without sports.It's the conventional media players that are left in a do or die situation.I can't think of any real reason for investing into the companies who own the data pipelines or the content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix is the <i>safer</i> play , as it 's <i>better</i> positioned for technological disruption and is n't limited by FCC regulation or antiquated business models .
