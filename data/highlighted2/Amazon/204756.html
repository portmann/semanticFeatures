Now you can see live statistics of ball hit velocity, ball throw speed in real time.Next year they plan on rolling out 3-dimensional viewing angle shifts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The idea of introducing more camera angles , and more data is data center dependent , but when you 're feeding the programming via a data pipeline it 's <b>possible</b> to add more features to content and create a more unique user interface .  (Uncertainty) </span>This implies that NFL statistics on hit power, speed, and etc. enters the domain of live sports science combined with GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO )-like viewing angles.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the transition to faster data speeds it 's possible to strap cameras to helmets , program the cameras to turn on and off <b>depending</b> on the play call , all while displaying various points of data across the entire field .  (Uncertainty) </span>If you thought sports were cool, the 21st century plans to take it a step further by identifying everything that's going on in real time.No lost data, no messed up calls, and more immersion all in real time.The cloud, and the internet of things seem extremely disruptive to sports programming, and reduces viability for linear programming to zero.Of course, this makes Netflix that much stronger, because by the time conventional TV programming reacts to the situation Netflix will be on pace to generate $10 billion+ in sales, which positions Netflix as the next generation of TV.The live content become more dynamic and more global.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But there are only a few platforms positioned well enough to capture streaming dollars , and I <b>anticipate</b> Netflix to remain one of those platforms .  (Uncertainty) </span>Many of these sports apps are unbundled, and disorganized.You need sports to be packaged into a broader web-based bundle, and right now Netflix is best positioned to pay for that kind of programming, especially if you're thinking 10 years down the road.Of course, Verizon already knows this, and they too are attempting to launch an OTT service that's inclusive of sports programming.Time will tell, but we already know Netflix will do fine with or without sports.It's the conventional media players that are left in a do or die situation.I can't think of any real reason for investing into the companies who own the data pipelines or the content.Netflix is the safer play, as it's better positioned for technological disruption and isn't limited by FCC regulation or antiquated business models.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
