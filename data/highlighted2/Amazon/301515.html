( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , but <b>may</b> initiate a short position in NFLX over the next 72 hours .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Netflix pays no dividend, so it has no income component to hold the stock price up.NFLX had 5.59 million net subscriber additions in Q4 2015; but it had only 1.56 million net additions in the US.This was down from 1.90 million in Q4 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Reed Hastings did not say the above was an <b>anomaly</b> that would be remedied soon .  (Uncertainty) </span>Instead he cited the Law of Large Numbers with respect to US adds.Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is an Internet television and movie network.It delivers TV shows and movies to computers, tablets, phones, and other devices within the US and internationally.It has three segments: domestic streaming, international streaming, and domestic DVD.Netflix has been a cult, momentum stock.A lot of people like the service.Therefore they like the stock; and they like to keep pushing the stock upward.Like many momentum stocks, it is a highly shorted stock with 13.47% of the Float shorted as of December 31, 2015.Momentum stocks typically rise to inordinate heights due to momentum and HFT trader short squeezes on any sort of good news.However, such valuations can have big downsides as NFLX has already shown in its history.For example, from July 3, 2011 to November 21, 2011 NFLX stock fell from $42.16 per share to $9.12 per share.I note the prices above are split adjusted prices.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>NFLX lost <i>more</i> than -78 % of its value over a six month period .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There are <i>more</i> examples in NFLX 's history too .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The above example is what happens to a momentum stock when its growth starts to lag , or its starts to be outperformed by one or <i>more</i> other companies .  (Surprise) </span>When Reed Hastings cited the Law of Large Numbers, he effectively told the markets that growth in the US has run into a strong headwind.I am not sure Reed Hastings used the Law of Large Numbers term exactly correctly.However, NFLX is definitely running into a numbers headwind in the US.The Q4 2015 net US subscriber additions were only + 1.56 million compared to Q4 2014's +1.90 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Reed Hastings did not call this an <b>anomaly</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>He effectively said it would be a continuing headwind.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In 2014 there were <b>approximately</b> 123.2 million households in the US according to the US Census Bureau .  (Uncertainty) </span>There were 43.40 million total US paid NFLX memberships in Q4 2015 (44.74 million if you include non-paid memberships).In 2013 only 74.4% of households reported Internet use.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This means there are <b>approximately</b> 91.66 million available households with Internet available .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> recently I have been hearing a 97 million figure , but I have no substantiating source for that .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In either case NFLX is getting close to supplying 50 % of the available households in the US with service , although a few households <b>may</b> have <i>more</i> than one subscription .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When you consider that many households will not even want a streaming service , NFLX <b>may</b> already be supplying over 50 % of the available households in the US .  (Uncertainty) </span>In other words, it will likely see a continuing downturn in the number of net US subscription adds per quarter.The churn rate will increase.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The most interested customers have <b>almost</b> all already signed up .  (Uncertainty) </span>Plus the remaining supply of potential customers (potential new subscription additions) in the US is dwindling with each increase in the total number of US subscribers.When you see virtually all of NFLX's fiscal metrics worsening, you have to know there is trouble ahead for NFLX's stock price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Q4 2015 NFLX metrics include : Net Income of $ 43 million -- down from $ 83 million a year <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>EPS of $ 0.10 per share -- down from $ 0.19 per share a year <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Free Cash Flow of - $ 276 million -- down from - $ 78 million a year <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Streaming Content Obligations of $ 10.9 B -- up from $ 9.5 B a year <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>International Streaming Contribution to Profit of - $ 109 million -- down from - $ 79 million a year <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yes , the number of net international subscription additions <b>appears</b> to be accelerating ( 4.04 million in Q4 2015 compared to 2.43 million in Q4 2014 ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, that part of the business is not yet profitable; and most do not expect it to become profitable for several years into the future (if at all).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Meanwhile the US business is becoming <i>less</i> and <i>less</i> profitable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That means slowing profits for NFLX , especially as the US churn rate becomes <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is easy to see how NFLX 's current EPS <b>could</b> become negative by Q4 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>could</b> argue that NFLX is still expanding quickly by growing revenues and subscribers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , all subscribers are not equal ; and all foreign countries seem to demand <i>more</i> work to make the business work .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That should mean <i>thinner</i> profit margins , if those foreign subscriptions do eventually become profitable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Canada , Australia , the EU , and <b>perhaps</b> India ( a former British colony ) are the only areas that would seem to be able to easily adapt to NFLX .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>South Korea <b>might</b> like NFLX .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , putting in subtitles for a small country is an expensive proposition ( again <i>thinner</i> profit margins ) .  (Surprise) </span>For China, there are many dialects.Portuguese applies only to Portugal and Brazil.I should be making my point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I watch Korean shows on Hulu <b>sometimes</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>I know I wouldn't watch them if there weren't subtitles.I don't speak Korean.NFLX has a PE of 354 and an FPE of 91; but I don't see it actually achieving its 91 FPE.Plus that is high for a company at which growth is slowing in its one profitable area -- the US.Remember also that the churn rate will likely go up soon.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It will be <i>more</i> expensive to try to retain the marginal subscribers ( subscribers who are <i>less</i> addicted or attracted to Netflix ) .  (Surprise) </span>Plus the competition from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Hulu , etc. is increasing . Investors should look at the competition.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a relative newcomer to the streaming business . Yet Prime already had 44 million subscribers as of June 2014.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> added 3 million new Prime subscribers in the third week of December 2015 alone ; and that virtually ensures that AMZN added over 10 million new subscribers for Q4 2015 . Comparatively NFLX added only 5.59 million new subscribers; and only 1.56 million of those were in the US.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>appears</b> that AMZN is growing <i>faster</i> than NFLX .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>There are many other competitors such as Hulu too.Research company MTM estimates that NFLX's market share will decline from 85% in 2014 to 50% in 2018.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A lot of competition is coming , even if NFLX <b>appears</b> to be the first big player on the international scene .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> competition is bound to mean <i>higher</i> churn rates and <i>lower</i> profit margins .  (Surprise) </span>On top of that NFLX just announced that it was raising monthly subscription rates on its formerly grandfathered in customers in Q2 and Q3 in 2016.To get the HD plan, they will now have to pay $9.99 per month.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>NFLX will <b>probably</b> lose a small number of customers this way .  (Uncertainty) </span>The switch to chipped credit cards has also been hurting NFLX.Many credit card customers have to change their numbers as they switch to chipped cards.This gives them an added opportunity to opt out of NFLX.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is , if they have to fill in new information to continue their Netflix subscription , they <b>may</b> at that time decide not to continue their subscription .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Again this will <b>probably</b> only be a small percentage of subscribers ; but each small percentage adds up .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There <b>could</b> also be those that simple do n't update their information .  (Uncertainty) </span>Their cards would then become invalid.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix would have to spend <i>more</i> to get them to update with the correct information .  (Surprise) </span>Some would likely choose not to continue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some <b>might</b> even have forgotten they had a subscription .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Those <b>might</b> take that opportunity to end their subscription .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has also been losing its media contracts.Most recently it failed to sign a new deal with Epix.NFLX management felt that a "non-exclusive" contract with Epix did not justify the cost.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Instead it will try to produce <i>more</i> of its own content .  (Surprise) </span>It plans to launch over 600 hours of original programming in 2016.This will be up from 450 hours in 2015.However, this strategy is fraught with peril too.Many of the shows it has produced to date have been very successful (House of Cards as an example).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The problem is that if you produce <i>more</i> shows , you tend a bit <i>more</i> toward mediocrity .  (Surprise) </span>Each idea cannot be "the best".Each show cannot have "the perfect cast".<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Further as NFLX derives <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> of its revenues from these shows , the actors , directors , writers , etc. will demand <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> money over time .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The above strategy <b>may</b> be a decent one .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Original content <b>may</b> be <i>more</i> attractive and/or <i>more</i> sticky .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>However, cost will still ultimately be a problem.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>NFLX <b>may</b> only succeed in pushing the cost problem out a few years ( if that ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The then added costs <b>may</b> turn out to be just in time to destroy the profitability that some analysts are expecting once the startup infrastructure and new employee costs of its international business are mostly behind it .  (Uncertainty) </span>In sum NFLX should see near term problems with profitability.It should see slowing growth in its "profitable" business -- US Streaming.It should see added costs for such things as adding subtitles and/or adding different language versions of a show for its international streaming business.It still has a problem with growing content costs.It has the problem of maintaining the high level of success it has so far seen in its original programming content.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With a <i>larger</i> amount of new content planned , NFLX <b>seems</b> destined to see mediocrity in at least some shows .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That will impact the way the company is viewed; and it will impact profitability.NFLX is overpriced at the moment.Its own CEO Reed Hastings acknowledges that US streaming growth is slowing.This trend cannot likely be reversed due as Reed Hastings said to the Law of Large Numbers.Carl Icahn has sold his stake in NFLX.NFLX is a SELL.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>may</b> be a great SHORT for the next year or <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Perhaps</b> it will look <i>better</i> if and when the International Streaming business starts to turn a profit ( or at least gets much <i>closer</i> to doing so ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Investors should wait on the sidelines for if and when that happens.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On top of the above , the US and world economies have been looking <i>more</i> troubled lately .  (Surprise) </span>The US stock market is overdue for a BEAR market.Dump NFLX for at least the next year.You will be glad you did.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is not going anywhere quickly ; and the overall market <b>may</b> be going down considerably .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>NFLX with a Beta of 1.44 <b>seems</b> sure to follow it .  (Uncertainty) </span>The chart above shows severe weakening.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>appears</b> to be a double top formation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is one of the most negative chart formations <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>appears</b> that the stock price is currently near a major support point .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After Reed Hastings comments about the `` Law of Large Numbers '' applying to US subscription growth , there is strong fundamental reason to <b>believe</b> that NFLX will break through this support line .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After that it <b>could</b> easily fall to the $ 65 - $ 70 per share level .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is where the next strong technical support level is.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At that point , investors <b>could</b> re-evaluate a short position ( if they open one ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, NFLX looks like a STRONG SELL/SHORT at this time.</div></body></html>
