Comparatively NFLX added only 5.59 million new subscribers; and only 1.56 million of those were in the US.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>appears</b> that AMZN is growing <i>faster</i> than NFLX .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>There are many other competitors such as Hulu too.Research company MTM estimates that NFLX's market share will decline from 85% in 2014 to 50% in 2018.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A lot of competition is coming , even if NFLX <b>appears</b> to be the first big player on the international scene .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> competition is bound to mean <i>higher</i> churn rates and <i>lower</i> profit margins .  (Surprise) </span>On top of that NFLX just announced that it was raising monthly subscription rates on its formerly grandfathered in customers in Q2 and Q3 in 2016.To get the HD plan, they will now have to pay $9.99 per month.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>NFLX will <b>probably</b> lose a small number of customers this way .  (Uncertainty) </span>The switch to chipped credit cards has also been hurting NFLX.Many credit card customers have to change their numbers as they switch to chipped cards.This gives them an added opportunity to opt out of NFLX.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is , if they have to fill in new information to continue their Netflix subscription , they <b>may</b> at that time decide not to continue their subscription .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Again this will <b>probably</b> only be a small percentage of subscribers ; but each small percentage adds up .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There <b>could</b> also be those that simple do n't update their information .  (Uncertainty) </span>Their cards would then become invalid.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix would have to spend <i>more</i> to get them to update with the correct information .  (Surprise) </span>Some would likely choose not to continue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some <b>might</b> even have forgotten they had a subscription .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Those <b>might</b> take that opportunity to end their subscription .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has also been losing its media contracts.Most recently it failed to sign a new deal with Epix.NFLX management felt that a "non-exclusive" contract with Epix did not justify the cost.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Instead it will try to produce <i>more</i> of its own content .  (Surprise) </span>It plans to launch over 600 hours of original programming in 2016.This will be up from 450 hours in 2015.However, this strategy is fraught with peril too.Many of the shows it has produced to date have been very successful (House of Cards as an example).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The problem is that if you produce <i>more</i> shows , you tend a bit <i>more</i> toward mediocrity .  (Surprise) </span>Each idea cannot be "the best".Each show cannot have "the perfect cast".<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Further as NFLX derives <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> of its revenues from these shows , the actors , directors , writers , etc. will demand <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> money over time .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The above strategy <b>may</b> be a decent one .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Original content <b>may</b> be <i>more</i> attractive and/or <i>more</i> sticky .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>However, cost will still ultimately be a problem.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>NFLX <b>may</b> only succeed in pushing the cost problem out a few years ( if that ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The then added costs <b>may</b> turn out to be just in time to destroy the profitability that some analysts are expecting once the startup infrastructure and new employee costs of its international business are mostly behind it .  (Uncertainty) </span>In sum NFLX should see near term problems with profitability.It should see slowing growth in its "profitable" business -- US Streaming.It should see added costs for such things as adding subtitles and/or adding different language versions of a show for its international streaming business.It still has a problem with growing content costs.It has the problem of maintaining the high level of success it has so far seen in its original programming content.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With a <i>larger</i> amount of new content planned , NFLX <b>seems</b> destined to see mediocrity in at least some shows .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That will impact the way the company is viewed; and it will impact profitability.NFLX is overpriced at the moment.Its own CEO Reed Hastings acknowledges that US streaming growth is slowing.This trend cannot likely be reversed due as Reed Hastings said to the Law of Large Numbers.Carl Icahn has sold his stake in NFLX.NFLX is a SELL.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>may</b> be a great SHORT for the next year or <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Perhaps</b> it will look <i>better</i> if and when the International Streaming business starts to turn a profit ( or at least gets much <i>closer</i> to doing so ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Investors should wait on the sidelines for if and when that happens.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On top of the above , the US and world economies have been looking <i>more</i> troubled lately .  (Surprise) </span>The US stock market is overdue for a BEAR market.Dump NFLX for at least the next year.You will be glad you did.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is not going anywhere quickly ; and the overall market <b>may</b> be going down considerably .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>NFLX with a Beta of 1.44 <b>seems</b> sure to follow it .  (Uncertainty) </span>The chart above shows severe weakening.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>appears</b> to be a double top formation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is one of the most negative chart formations <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>appears</b> that the stock price is currently near a major support point .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After Reed Hastings comments about the `` Law of Large Numbers '' applying to US subscription growth , there is strong fundamental reason to <b>believe</b> that NFLX will break through this support line .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After that it <b>could</b> easily fall to the $ 65 - $ 70 per share level .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is where the next strong technical support level is.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At that point , investors <b>could</b> re-evaluate a short position ( if they open one ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, NFLX looks like a STRONG SELL/SHORT at this time.</div></body></html>
