(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Both companies have invested heavily in China and take extra care to make sure they are following Beijing's strict rules regarding matters like self censorship.Apple's Cook has traveled at least twice to China each year over the last few years as part of a campaign to give the company broad access to a market that has rapidly grown to become its second-largest worldwide.Apple was rewarded for its efforts back in February, when it became the first major foreign company allowed to offer domestic electronic payment services in China with the launch of its Apple Pay product ( previous post ).The company also continues to receive broadly positive media coverage in China, following the launch of several recent environmentally-friendly initiatives that fit nicely with Beijing's broader objectives.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Those gains reflect the positive state of Apple 's broader relationship with Beijing at the moment , which contrasts sharply with this <b>sudden</b> shutdown of its book and movie services .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I suspect the site <b>probably</b> violated rules by containing some self-published material , which would have led to the demand for the shutdown .
