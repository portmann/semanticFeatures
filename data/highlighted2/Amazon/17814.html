WeChat is providing the "primitives" that you can't get elsewhere.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This may be true - but it may also be that WeChat ( and similar products such as Baidu ( NASDAQ : BIDU ) Maps , which also has deep service integration ) show us what the rest of the world <b>might</b> look like if the big portals had executed better .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is, is this what Yahoo would have achieved if it hadn't gone to sleep for a decade?* A lot of people thought that Facebook would clone this, but it's actually done something quite different.Rather than trying to turn Messenger itself into a development environment, it's opened it up to become a channel for anything else on your phone and the web.This means that it's addressing both the platform thread and the viral apps thread outlined above, and that rather than WeChat, it's going after the iOS and Android notifications panel.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , if you have an idea for a great type of content for messaging - a new piece of psychology that <b>might</b> go viral - your iPhone or Android app can now insert that directly into a thread inside the Messenger app and your app can be invoked directly from within the Messenger app .  (Uncertainty) </span>Messenger has a list of featured apps (with links out to the App Store or Google Play) and, crucially, each piece of content posted into a message thread comes with a link to install the app - a viral hook.Facebook has made an API for the "sticker button," and turned it into an acquisition channel for third party apps, and is now letting the entire internet compete for that slot with itself as gatekeeper.The WeChat model achieves some of this, avoiding the app installation problem itself by putting everything into web views within the WeChat app, but that puts a cap on how sophisticated you can get - it's hard to make video clips with web apps.Facebook is trying to square the circle - rich native code to make cool stuff, yet no need for an app installation for it to spread.This is a great jujitsu move, and very seductive.Facebook is trying to co-opt the next Snapchat.Yes, the smartphone is a social platform that makes it easy to use multiple social apps, but you still have to get someone over the hurdle of installing the app in the first place, and they have to get all of their friends to install it too so that they have someone to send to.Facebook is trying to bypass that - you can drop your content straight into the existing Messenger install base (600m MAUs).Now just one person can get a cool app and send messages to their friends even if their friends don't have it, and if it's cool enough they can tap on the link and install it too.So acquisition is much easier, but they're Facebook's users, and always will be.And since there will be dozens of apps fighting it out for that slot, Snapchat and any other new stand-alone network will be competing against all of those apps - against the whole app store.This means that Facebook is trying to reset some of the dynamics I described at that beginning of this piece - it's trying to avoid the "whack-a-mole" problem of having to buy cool new messaging companies (Instagram, WhatsApp) by getting those communication forms to happen inside Messenger instead, using Facebook's own social graph instead of the phone's address book.And as I said, this is seductive - Facebook removes a major barrier to growth but owns your users and has a history of ruthlessness in dealing with partners who build on its platforms.Join, get growth "easily" and give Facebook control, or stay out and struggle for installs against Facebook and all its partners as well.The second part of the Messenger announcement is just as interesting - Facebook also will let websites send messages directly into Messenger without having their own apps installed on your phone if you logged into that website with Facebook when you placed the order.So you can order shoes and get a message in Messenger that they're out of stock and be offered an alternative.This is another attack on email (and Gmail) and another attempt to pull your communications and commerce into the Facebook data platform.And again, if you do this you get richer and more engaging communication with your users and don't need them to install your app, but your access is entirely controlled by Facebook.If you take all of this together, it looks like Facebook is trying not to compete with other messaging apps but to relocate itself within the landscape of both messaging and the broader smartphone interaction model.Facebook Home tried to take over the home screen and lock screen - Messenger is trying to take over the notifications panel by pulling those notifications inside its own app and to co-opt large chunks of future communications developments on the phone.This make perfect sense - notifications themselves are becoming that third runtime.That pull-down panel aggregates activity from everything on your phone, and Google and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) have made notifications actionable and given them payloads.One can already look at an iPhone or Android phone's notification screen and ask - "where's the algorithm filtering this?"And in a sense, the notification panel fills the "cross platform compatibility" role that some people would like to see in messaging - all the notifications for all my messaging apps show up there.More and more, one's primary interaction with any app, social messaging or otherwise, is a little pop-up with a button or two.So shouldn't that get a native, messaging-focused UI?Instead of replacing standalone apps with light-weight versions built inside a messaging app, is it better for rich, actionable messages from native apps to be aggregated into a notification panel?Once you have that runtime, do you need an actual standalone app on the actual phone itself, or can you send those messages - really, little applets, down from the cloud?Do you turn apps into messages and notifications, or messages and notifications into apps?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Meanwhile , smart watches ( to the extent that they take off ) reinforce a model of atomic units of content with a handful of <b>possible</b> actions and of glancing at a few key items rather than submerging yourself in a dedicated UI .  (Uncertainty) </span>So after unbundling sites from the web browser into apps, notifications take things further, unbundling each unit of content or action - each verb or noun - into a separate atom.So you can order a car with a flick of your wrist and a tap or two instead of fishing your phone out of your pocket, unlocking it, loading an app and navigating the UI.This obviously leads one to ask what the platform owners themselves are doing.Should this be done by Facebook or the platform owners (the same question as for deep linking last year)?Do Apple or Google introduce an algorithmic filter to manage the flow in the system-wide notification panel, and does that compare to Facebook's lethal power over newsfeed partners?They're some of the way there.Both Apple and Google have perfectly solid mobile messaging apps that are not development platforms in their own right, and have done a lot of work on notifications in their smartphone OSs yet clearly have lots more to do.And Apple already lets websites send push notifications on OS X, while Google is clearly pushing Chrome hard as a development environment and so notifications from the web there would also make sense.So we can see some building blocks, but we can also see obstacles.The obvious one is that neither has the kind of desktop social presence that would make it easy for them to drive personalized push motivations for web to mobile - you're not logged into anything from Apple or Google (pace Plus) when you shop on the desktop web.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , you 're always logged in on Android , and Apple has shown plenty of hints that it <b>might</b> see TouchID as a universal identity platform , and of course , they do have your address book .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So Apple or Google <b>could</b> easily let an app send a push notification to a friend who does n't have that app .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Meanwhile as mobile devices zoom past half of time spent on commerce sites and a third of the transaction value , a web identity platform <b>might</b> matter less .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are other interesting possibilities too , if one thinks where Now or Passbook <b>might</b> fit into this .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The core issue across all of this , I think , is how much is still totally <b>unsettled</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>We spent 20 years in which the mainstream internet experience was a web browser, mouse and keyboard, and over a decade in with Google was the way you navigated.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Smartphones ended all that but we have n't settled on a new model , and the idea we 'll all revert back to the comfortable , simple model of the web <b>seems</b> increasingly remote .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even within messaging, the model is still in flux.I wrote above about the search for new psychologies, but there are deeper architectural questions than anonymity or filters, which you can see in SnapChat's disappearing messages or Meerkat and Periscope's use of live.What will the next blow-up model be - synchronous or not?One to one or one to many?Feed based or thread-based?Algorithmic filter or endless stream?Rich client or rich message?Runtime or deep links?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>may</b> be the real problem for Facebook - the next messaging thing <b>may</b> not be messaging at all .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>* As an aside , it 's challenging for anyone outside China to have a firm view on WeChat given that almost no-one has actually used it - the most interesting features only <b>appear</b> if you run the app with Chinese language settings .  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't read Chinese myself, and I'm always reluctant to have a strong view on a product I've not used, though this is a minority position.Source: Messaging And Mobile Platforms We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
