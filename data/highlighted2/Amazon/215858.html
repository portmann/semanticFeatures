We build our companies, jobs and lives around successful products and services.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We want these providers to succeed because it makes our lives much <i>easier</i> .  (Surprise) </span>We don't like to hear about large market leaders losing their strength, because it signals potentially difficult change.We want these companies to improve, and we will clutch at any sign of improvement.As investors we behave similarly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We were told large companies have vast customer bases , strong asset bases , well-known brands , high switching costs , deep pockets - all things Michael Porter told us in the 1980s created `` moats '' protecting the business , keeping it protected from market shifts that <b>could</b> hurt sales and profits .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As investors we want to believe that even though the giant company <b>may</b> slip , it wo n't fall .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Time and size is on its side we choose to <b>believe</b> , so we should simply `` hang on '' and `` ride it out . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the future , the company will do <i>better</i> and value will rise .  (Surprise) </span>As a result we see that Growth Stall companies show a common valuation pattern.After achieving high valuation, their equity value stagnates.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then , <b>hopes</b> for a turn-around and recovery to new growth is stimulated by a few pieces of good news and the value jumps again .  (Uncertainty) </span>Only after a few years the short-term tactics are used up and the underlying business weakness is fully exposed.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Then value crumbles , frequently <i>faster</i> than remaining investors <b>anticipated</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>McDonald's valuation rose from $62/share in 2008 to reach record $100/share highs in 2011.But valuation then stagnated.It is only this last jump that has caused it to reach new highs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But realize , this is on a <i>smaller</i> number of stores , <i>fewer</i> products and declining revenues .  (Surprise) </span>These are not factors justifying sustainable value improvement.Microsoft traded around $25/share from March, 2003 through November, 2011 - 8.5 years.When the CEO was changed value jumped to $48/share by October, 2014.After dipping, now, a year later Microsoft stock is again reaching that previous valuation ($50/share).Microsoft is now valued where it was in December, 2002 (which is half its all-time high.)The jump in value of McDonald's and Microsoft happened on short-term news regarding beating analysts' earnings expectations for one quarter.The underlying businesses, however, are still suffering declining revenue.They remain in Growth Stalls, and the odds are overwhelming that their values will decline, rather than continue increasing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
