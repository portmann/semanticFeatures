(Surprise) </span>Well, the app store is growing over 20%, it grew 25% last quarter, and so we feel very good about that.That's become a sizeable business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I would also point out that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market , they sort of began to look <i>more</i> like subscription business in terms of where they operate .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And so , we think that in the aggregate that they reduce upgrade cycles and also the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits the price point that we 're not hitting today largely which <b>could</b> help further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>Good afternoon and congratulations.Tim, you just briefly touchdown as reducing the time between upgrade, but how do you think about the iPhone upgrade cycle compressing over the next few years, obviously the impact from previous [ph] changes in the iPhone upgrade program.Can you talk a little bit about when that's going to rollout internationally.And then lastly, Luca you mentioned some of the accounting changes related to iPhone upgrade program.Any sense in terms of what percentage of the Plus – the s upgrades were associated with upgrade program?Thanks.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Eugene , in terms of the upgrade program it 's early , but here 's what we <b>believe</b> our current view .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We do think that their <i>broader</i> upgrade program , so I 'm just talking about our program that in retail , I mean , that is relatively small compared to our total iPhones sales in a company , but the <i>broader</i> thing obviously is that many of the carriers are offering these plans .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And that , if you look at them in the aggregate , we think that it would have a positive impact in replacement cycles .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We do like the fact that it creates a market for an iPhone at a different price as well that is a <i>better</i> product and that customer <b>maybe</b> trying to buying which would further help from an ecosystem point of view and that 's not to be under estimated .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It also <b>seems</b> like that from a rollout point of view there 's a -- you will see these plans offered in a significant way in the United States already , but in fact these plans are being offered in some derivation in over dozen countries in the world .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They 're not as pervasive as they are in the U.S. but it <b>seems</b> like they were on the front end of fairly major trends in the industry .  (Uncertainty) </span>From financial perspective Gene, the transaction on our iPhone upgrade program is a purchase, it’s not a lease and so we recognize our revenue upfront, of course we deduct also upfront, the cost associated with the program essentially to provide interest rate financing and we need to estimate the fair value of the upgrade option for the customer, but as Tim said, it’s a popular program in our U.S store in the scheme of things, it’s a small percentage of our worldwide iPhone sales and so we'll have really a negligible impact for example, on ASPs for the phone.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And Tim , if we put it all together is it something that has <i>more</i> measurable impact on the business two , three quarters down the road , is that the right way to generally think about it ?  (Surprise) </span>Yes, we think about it.It’s being – there were some clearly that were offered in the market prior to this cycle.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But they became much <i>more</i> pervasive and much communicated , I think much <i>wider</i> with the September announcements .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And so , I would sort of expect to begin seeing this <b>somewhere</b> around the year from now .  (Uncertainty) </span>Yes.Thank you.Tim, I appreciated the color that you provided on the drives of iPhone growth in Q1.I think the investor concern is that Q1 will benefit at least on a year over year basis from three extra weeks of availability in China.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And it will also benefit from <i>more</i> of those initial launch days that only two of them were in the September quarter and the remainder will be in the December quarter .  (Surprise) </span>And so I guess the investor concern is December is a structurally advantage quarter in the sense of benefiting from both of those tailwinds on year-over-year basis.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But if we look out beyond December , would n't that point to notably <i>lower</i> seasonal growth than the March quarter .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And how do we think about the factors affecting unit growth beyond the December quarter?And then I have a follow-up, please.We don't guide beyond December, as you Toni.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I do think that the sort of the macro things I had spoke about <i>earlier</i> , the upgrade programs , the Android Switcher rate , the iPhone momentum in the emerging markets and the LTE penetration in these markets .  (Surprise) </span>These trends are not one quarter of things.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These are <i>longer</i> thing in size .  (Surprise) </span>The same –my same response applies and I think we'll do quite good in iPhone.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do <b>believe</b> we 'll grow this quarter as we put in our guidance that when we start with the number in the low 30s in terms of the percentage of the installed based is upgraded that had some three of the iPhone 6 and 6 plus , that number still likely to leave a lot of headroom beyond December .  (Uncertainty) </span>So that's how I look at that.In terms of your first comment, you didn't have to comment on that, but just to be clear.Our forecasting doesn't work like you articulate it.I recognize that people can have their own models and so forth, but just to make it clear that I'm not agreeing with your point.Okay.And then just on the follow-up, the reported gains from currency hedging in fiscal year 2015 were significant, several billion dollar contribution to the company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And again , this is not an Apple 's specific issue , Luca as you pointed out several times , but how do we think about this notion of currency hedges effectively rolling off and being replaced with hedges that are likely have <i>less</i> of an impact .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>How do we think about that impact the P&L on a go forward basis , <b>perhaps</b> starting with Q1 , but then qualitatively or directionally over the course of the year ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And what is some of kinds of things that you 've undertaken or planning to undertake that <b>could</b> mitigate some of those concerns ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Yes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think , Toni , it 's a very good point , I mean , what 's going to happen in practice is that we got this portfolio of hedge comp such that over time provides protection to our margins and to our results , but that protection diminishes as we go through the year and so we should expect that in over time during the course of fiscal 2016 that protection will come off <b>assuming</b> that the dollar stays at current levels .  (Uncertainty) </span>Keep in mind, there are some currencies around the world that where we cannot economically hedge and so those currencies are bit excluded from what we're talking about right now.I think my conclusion is that the guidance that we're providing for the first quarter that 39% to 40% it actually an incredible level of guidance given the foreign exchange headwinds that we're dealing with.How do we deal with that?We continue to hedge, so our program continues on an ongoing basis and we will continue to provide some level of protection to foreign exchange movement.In some cases we have realign prices particularly when we launch new products.We tend to do that in a number of countries where the foreign exchange moves have been particularly extreme, and so we tend to recover that through pricing.And then finally, of course we are putting in place a number of cost initiatives that would allow us to deal with the foreign exchange situation.So, overall we feel very strong guidance for the first quarter.And beyond the first quarter as you know we're not guiding and so we'll see over the course of the year.Thank you very much.Tim, I wanted to go back to your commentary on the enterprise business, $25 billion I think you said, it was up 40% year-over-year.I know you have a relatively small sales force internally and obviously you utilizing the joint ventures, but as you noted you see that's an important driver of growth.So, how do you attack that market going forward?Will there be changes?Is there something that you need to shift or focus product in a little bit of different directions to make sure you can adequately attack it.Just in general how you're thinking about it?From a product point of view, we'd actually been continuing to change and improve IOS for some time.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With every release they are <i>more</i> enterprise features and so , I would describe it as sort of continuation of that cadence <b>perhaps</b> with little <i>more</i> intensity .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>From a go to market point of view, we will be working with or are working with IBM.with Cisco.We're already working with 75 mobility partners that are principally in the U.S. but that's expanding quickly to international as well.And so, many of these companies have -- in some cases very large sales forces, in many cases the reasonable seize sales force.And in addition to a direct sales force there is a huge worldwide indirect channel that many customers buy from and count on buying some services from.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And so I do not envision Apple 's having a large enterprise sales force will certainly make -- we continue adding some people <i>more</i> on the engineering side , but I do n't envision having a large direct sales force .  (Surprise) </span>Okay, great.Thank you.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And can you give us some <i>more</i> color on China , 120 % year-over-year growth in iPhones , but can you talk in general about what you 're seeing in the marketplace and <b>perhaps</b> where you think you in terms of penetration from a smartphone standpoint especially with a China Mobile which has a substantial opportunity to grow given the LTE penetration ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Yes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you look at China , we grew from an iPhone point of view , Greater China , we grew 87 % the market grew for .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you take iPhone out of the market number , the certain market x iPhone actually contracted slightly .  (Uncertainty) </span>And so, we've been able to grow without the market growing.iPhone 6 was the number one selling smartphone in Mainland, China last quarter and iPhone 6 Plus was number three.And so, we did fairly well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The sort of the economic question which I know there 's a bit lot of attention on , frankly , if I were to shut off my web and shut off the TV and just look how many customers are coming in our stores regardless to whether they 're buying , how many people are coming online , and in addition looking at our sales trend , I would n't know if there was any economic issue at all in China .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And so I do n't know how <b>unusual</b> we are with that .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think that there 's a misunderstanding probably particularly in the Western world about China 's economy , which contributes to the <b>confusion</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said , I do n't think it 's growing as fast as it was , but I also do n't think that Apple 's results are largely <b>dependent</b> on minor changes than growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think it 's much <i>more</i> of contributing -- I think other things contribute to that much <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>That does say, you'll never had problem there, because the economy, I'm not saying, I'm dumb enough to think that.But I just think that the area that it's currently operating within, it's hard to tell the difference of the consumer level for us.I mean, you really can't tell the difference, if you look at sort of our daily and weekly numbers.So, we're very bullish on it, and I would point out that we're investing in China not for next or the quarter after, or the quarter after, we're investing for the decades ahead and as we look at it our own views is that China will be Apple's top market in the world.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And that 's not just for sales , that 's also developer community is growing <i>faster</i> than any other country in the world .  (Surprise) </span>And so, the ecosystem there is very, very strong.I was very impressed with the number the developers I met last week and of course, the customers in stores are enthusiastically contagious.Thank you.Tim, I wanted to talk about the two sources of your iPhone demand selling to current customers and selling to new customers.In terms of selling to current customers you indicated about a third of the base is moved to the sixth line.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As much as people talk about that been a huge upgrade cycle and what is the six has have incrementally , 33 % not that a <i>bigger</i> number , I would have thought it would be <i>bigger</i> than that .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Does this suggest that there is <b>maybe</b> <i>more</i> of a consistency to upgrading than the street perceives .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And then on the other side in terms of new customers, just wanted clarity on the switcher number, are you saying that 30% of iPhone shipments in the quarter went to android switchers to IOS.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And do you believe that you <b>could</b> actually have <i>more</i> new customers to Apple in fiscal 2016 than you had fiscal 2015 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>There's a lot there.Let me start with the Android Switcher.What this means is that for customers to purchase an iPhone last quarter and replace the smartphone that 30% of those switched from an android device.And so there would have been some switchers on top of that from other operating systems, but obviously android is the largest one by far.And so that's what that means, and that number is the largest that we've ever recorded since we began measuring it three or so years ago.And so, it’s a huge number, we're very, very proud of that number.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In terms of 2016 versus 2015 new customers , it 's hard to <b>predict</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>I'm very happy with how we're doing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We 're doing <i>better</i> than we 've ever been doing .  (Surprise) </span>People -- I know there's a fixation on the upgrade rate.When I look at the upgrade rate, Steve, what I see is I feel good that it’s a low number because that's low number means that there is 69% of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that haven't bother to upgrade this year.That's a large number.And so, I'd see that is opportunity.Do I think it has anything, does to length to consistency?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think part of it is and I believe that the iPhone upgrade plans that are out there as I 've mentioned before it <b>seems</b> to me on the future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 'll tell it 's true or not , but it <b>seems</b> to me it 's going to act as a catalyst to accelerate some of this upgrades .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And I think that 's not something that we 're going to see this quarter or next quarter , but it <b>seems</b> like it 's going to happen beginning a year for now or so .  (Uncertainty) </span>It have begins to be – you've seen the plan.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They look <i>more</i> and active like a subscription than they do like a purchase .  (Surprise) </span>And that's great for the customer because many of them want to upgrade on a frequent basis and they can do this very, very simply.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In terms of new , I do n't know , whether we 'll <i>more</i> new or not .  (Surprise) </span>I can tell you that that's always our objective.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We want to add a lot <i>more</i> people to the ecosystem and certainly if you look in the emerging markets , even like , nobody is asking about iPad on the call .  (Surprise) </span>But if you look at iPad as just an example, in China, 68% of the people that purchased an iPad it was the first tablet they've owned and 40% of those have never owned any Apple product.Just to go through one product with one set of number.I don't want to get through a bunch of numbers because it does contain the data than I don't want to share.But these are things that we're very focused on.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And the first time buyer number is <b>surprisingly</b> strong .  (Surprise) </span>And keep in mind that we have a good history of bunch of people buy one Apple product, they have a great experience.They begin to look at other Apple products.And of course we makes they all work well together.Hi.Thank you very much.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just is a follow-up to that last question and to put that in context , <b>roughly</b> what percent of the iPhone shipments come from shipments for the installed based versus from your user shipment ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Okay.And then just a follow-up, as Luca mentioned, you had to make some adjustments to the pricing in various regions given the currency move we've had.What had been the response in terms of demand, I guess both in terms of units and revenues in some of these regions like Japan or India, parts of Europe where the local prices has to go up?Simona, we've made a number of price changes during the course of fiscal 2015.What we've seen in a normal of these markets, we've seen that iPhone sales have been very resilient and that shown in our growth rates.Most recently we've adjusted some prices around the world for the launch of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.We are very positive about the safest trends around the world.It’s a bit early to tell, because the phones have out there just for four weeks, so its bit early to tell there.Obviously when we increase prices around the world, it's normal to see some impact on sales rates, but so far we were encouraged by the response.Let me go back to your question.And this is an exactly what you're asking that what your view, I think some color is.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The reason I ca n't answer this is , we do n't look at any aggregate , we actually look at the detailed because it 's much <i>more</i> important for to us to look at , buy iPhone model by country , what percentage going to our first iPhone buyers .  (Surprise) </span>Somebody that's never owned an iPhone before.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And so if you look at China as an example , it 's over 50 % of people that bought 6 and 6 Plus were buying their first iPhone .  (Uncertainty) </span>As you move down the line, that numbers goes up.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And so a 5s generally speaking is <i>higher</i> in most countries .  (Surprise) </span>And so, that gives a feel for very important market and we cannot where the numbers are.Thanks a lot.Good afternoon guys.Two questions from me as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I guess , first <b>could</b> you talk about the gross margin dynamic as you go from September to December , the midpoint implies on 20 basis points .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think the last five years that's only happen once the gross margin is going down in fiscal Q1.Can you just talk about what the FX dynamic or what area the other headwinds that you think that implies gross margins being done in December?Yes.Let me give you puts and takes for margins for the December quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the positive side , of course as you mentioned that we would have positive leverage from the <i>higher</i> seasonal volumes .  (Surprise) </span>Also what we've seen over the last several quarters is a commodity environment that has been quite favorable and we expect it to remain favorable during the December quarter.On the other hand, of course we are launching a lot of new products.We’ve launched some during September.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We are launching some now and everything we launch new products , we make them <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We had features and new technology and these products when we launch and tend to have <i>higher</i> cost structures than the products what they replaced .  (Surprise) </span>We have a very good track record overtime to reduce those cost structures, but every time we introduce a new product that is a headwind at the beginning of the cycle for gross margin.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While it 's different from a year ago very significantly with the foreign exchange impact that we have mentioned before it remains a very significant headwind as I mentioned <i>earlier</i> to Tony I <b>believe</b> we are dealing with that to a combination of hedging , price realignments -LSB- ph -RSB- cost initiatives , but on a net basis foreign exchange we will clearly by a sequential headwind .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Got it.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And then Tim when you talk about seeing iPhone growth in fiscal Q1 , I 'm curious is that statement <i>more</i> reflective of iPhone units or iPhone revenues so that the ASPs <b>could</b> hardly get growth even if units are not there .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And then would you expect to exit within the 5 to 7 week <b>optimal</b> inventory range in fiscal Q1 ?  (Uncertainty) </span>I don’t know that we will exit.We make that call late in the quarter as we see what the demand is because we are actually trying to position the inventory for the following quarter instead of the current quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And it 's very difficult to <b>predict</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>What was your other question?Is it revenue?I was making a revenue statement but units are also, yes we expect units to be up as well.Yes thanks for taking my question.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I just wanted to ask Tim maybe if you <b>could</b> comment on the mix between iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And whether the mix of demand is any different than what you say for instance that the iPhone 5 , 5s point whether there is <i>more</i> say iPhone 6 , I know you highlighted that the iPhone 6 is a number one phone in China for example and then I have a follow up ?  (Surprise) </span>The statement I made in China was about Q4 and the 6s was only available in China for two days last quarter.The iPhone 6s is the most popular iPhone that we currently sell.In terms of has there been a change.If you look at iPhone 6 today, and add iPhone 6 Plus and compare that to last year’s 5s we are doing better, at that price point than we were previously.Okay, thank you.And then there’s follow up for what you were doing on the upgrade program.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I am <b>wondering</b> if can you envision a time ever made in the U.S. or elsewhere where you would not have to come into an Apple store to activate it or to take advantage of the upgrade you might be able to do that <b>somewhere</b> else , do you start now what your ... .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That’s a really good question.We actually solved that problem back in 2007.But then quickly had to change it in order to scale in a major way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And so that is something that we would always -- sort of always in our mind that one day from a customer experience point of view we would like to make things as easy as <b>possible</b> for the customer .  (Uncertainty) </span>And to some degree you can already do that with buying online.But there are many different plans and search what the people buy, that they have to come in for several times we would love to have that automated and working with our partners, with service providers.Thank you, Rod.A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and please enter confirmation code 795707.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And these replays will be available by <b>approximately</b> 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today .
