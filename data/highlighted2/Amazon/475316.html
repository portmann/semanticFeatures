plans to launch a skinny bundle service Tesla misses earnings per share and revenue estimates but reaffirms optimistic production guidance for the second half Twitters shares spike on rumors that former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer could be involved in buying out the company WalMart may buy Jetcom to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Count Time Warner NYSE TWX as one of the new holders in Hulu a streaming service currently owned by Disney NYSE DIS Fox NASDAQ FOXA and Comcasts NASDAQ CMCSA NBCUniversal Time Warner took a stake in the property when it invested million Time Warner as many investors know relies on cable subscriptions as one of its several sources of income So the move could be viewed as a hedge or at least as a way to benefit from the rising popularity of cordcutting This is an interesting development Back in September I suggested that Disney had an ace up its sleeve because of its ability to offer a skinny bundle via Hulu given its ABC ESPN AE and Disney content Aside from announcing its investment in Hulu Time Warner also reported earnings Wednesday morning The company beat earnings and raised its fullyear earnings guidance to to per share This investment fits our strategy like a glove chairman and CEO Jeffrey Bewkes said of the Hulu investment on the companys conference call Time Warner isnt wasting any time either saying it expects to have a streaming service launched in early The skinny bundle could include TNT TBS CNN Cartoon Network and others In particular Adult Swim is apparently quite popular with Millennials which attracts more to yearolds than its nearest competitor more Bewkes said While this move undoubtedly seems beneficial to both Hulu increased relevancy via more content and Time Warner future growth questions linger on the impact to Netflix NASDAQ NFLX One could argue that the growing industry bodes well for the streaming leader However it could also be argued that increased competition especially after Netflix vastly disappointed investors with its subscriber results is certainly not a good thing Those are once again the rumors circling the struggling social media platform Twitters NYSE TWTR shares climbed Wednesday on news that the company could be taken private by former Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT CEO Steve Ballmer and Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Theres not a lot of news here obviously as it is still based on rumors But heres what were working with so far Rumors surfaced shortly after the open Wednesday that the duo may be mulling a takeover somewhere in the to per share price range Sources have reached out to Ballmer and received the standard no comment response One could argue that if nothing was in place Ballmer would simply say as much According to a previous disclosure Ballmer owns of Twitter From the time of his tweet though his stake was down before Wednesdays rally At last check Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal and his holding company Kingdom Holding of which he owns had more than a stake in Twitter This has some obvious flaws For starters Twitter priced its IPO at in November of and closed higher by near on its first day of trading It seems doubtful that management would want to sell out at this point CEO Jack Dorsey hasnt even been at the helm for a year and had the company sought a sale back in June when former CEO Dick Costolo stepped down it could have happened at a much higher price when the stock was trading in the mids Why not sell then as opposed to recruit a new CEO gut out the management team and then sell when the stock is down almost from those levels Conversely given the companys struggle to grow its user base or retain its management team and the fact that Dorsey is also CEO of Square NYSE SQ maybe a buyout isnt the worst idea The fact that the rumored buyers hold almost a combined stake and have a combined net worth of some billion to billion also increases the odds Throw in the fact that Twitter has basically been an MA rumor since it went public and its easy to see why this story has legs WalMart NYSE WMT and every other bricksandmotor retailer in the US have collectively suffered from their biggest competitor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN The ecommerce juggernaut has defied the doubters shrugged off valuation concerns and seen both its business and stock price soar as a result WalMart has tried to fight back with various ecommerce efforts with mixed results On a side note Target NYSE TGT has actually seen solid growth in its online initiatives Still WalMart has largely struggled to loosen Amazons grip Given its sizable and beloved Prime service theres serious doubts that WMT or anyone will ever really be able to break it But never say never Especially if WalMart made as bold a move as buying Jetcom Private JET in order to do so Given that Jet is private it makes the deal hard to value but according to the Wall Street Journal it could be valued at around billion While Jet has failed to dethrone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>so far the outcome wouldnt happen overnight Jet is still quite a young company having launched in July Not only is it young but its also still small With a billion valuation its more than times smaller than Amazons billion market cap Although some investors may laugh at the idea of WalMart or Jet taking on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and winning the combination may give it some potential even if the likelihood is still minute WalMart has an excellent logistics system and could quickly act as the gasoline on the fire for Jet given its resources I still think its unlikely anyone dethrones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at least in the foreseeable future But even just taking some market share and hopefully doing so profitably could be a big win for WalMart and the future of its business The headline numbers look like such Revenues of billion missed estimates of billion while Tesla NASDAQ TSLA generated nonGAAP losses per share of versus expectations for the company to lose cents per share in the quarter Deliveries another important stat with Tesla came in at pretty close and ahead of the companys estimate for Production is up sequentially and over year over year The company believes it can hit vehicles for the second half of And while production at the end of the quarter came in at vehicles per week with management expectations for it to climb to and vehicles per week by the end of Q and Q respectively costs continue to rise The company expects operating expenses to rise for the year versus its previous expectations for an increase of to Margins in the quarter also saw a YOY decline Thats been the story with Tesla Theres not many people that shoot against the cars purely from a product standpoint Tesla doesnt even draw that much criticism around Musks vision either But where investors get locked in debate is valuation The company spends money a lot of money This bleed has led to concerns over its balance sheet and the stocks valuation As if its business operations including the incredibly high expectations of the Model werent capital intensive enough Tesla took on the cashburning debtladen entity known as SolarCity NASDAQ SCTY CEO Elon Musk says its a natural fit and to some extent I agree But its not the vision that startles investors its whos paying for it And thats where the real concern lies with Tesla As always the question remains Is this stock headed for a devastating ending Or are Musk and Tesla the next Bezos and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
