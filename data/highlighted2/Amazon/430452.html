The internet has transformed the way many of us shop and stock our homes with food and other supplies just ask any brickandmortar small business owner Where we once drove from store to store or even town to town to pick up essentials for daily living we can now order what we need online at any time of the day or night while sitting in bed and with the click of a mouse Obviously the impact of Amazoncom over the past two decades cant be understated Its been nothing short of transformative Thanks to features like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime which offers members free twoday shipping on everything and Subscribe and Save American appetites for online shopping have expanded far beyond books and hardtofind or specialty items to everyday essentials like diapers housewares paper towels cooking supplies and even dog food Avoiding the mall and shopping online will definitely save you time and it will occasionally save you some money to boot With the right credit card in your wallet you can also earn some extra cash back at Amazoncom during certain times of the year Here are two cards to consider if you love and use Amazoncom regularly anyway and want to boost your rewards to a whole new level The Discover it Cashback Match lets you earn tiered rewards that rotate every quarter For most of your purchases youll earn a flat back on every dollar you spend However you can also earn back on your first spent in categories that rotate every quarter When Discover announced its annual bonus categories for they didnt leave us guessing In fact they made it clear that purchases made on Amazoncom would qualify for a cashback bonus in not just one quarter but two from the beginning of July until the end of December this year But heres the kicker Since Discover is matching all of the points you earn your first year you can actually earn back on Amazoncom purchases during the entire second half of The full list of categories that let you earn cash back plus matching funds after your first months with the card in include restaurants and movies April through June home improvement stores Amazoncom July through September and Amazoncom and more October through December Since youll only earn back on your first spent in each quarterly bonus category your initial cash back bonus is limited to But when Discover doubles the points you earn at the end of your first months you could potentially have in extra cash back each quarter And remember you always earn back on every purchase you make with no limit and Discover will double that cash back at the end of your first year too Best of all this card never charges an annual fee Do remember however that Discover makes you sign up manually for each promotion added to your card So the and wont come automatically instead you need to sign into your account and activate the promotion each quarter you plan to participate When the Chase Freedom card announced its quarterly bonus categories for they didnt change much from the year before Other than switching around the groceries and restaurant categories a bit it was to stay much the same For October through December this card is offering on Holiday Shopping and more If history tells us anything that means we will earn back on Amazoncom and a few other online retailers with our Chase Freedom card in the fourth quarter this year After all they have doled out on Amazoncom each holiday season since though they added the Amazoncom category in January the year before If were extremely lucky we might even see a promotion similar to the one from last year From October through December Chase offered an amazing back on your first spent on Amazoncom presumably to compete with Discover For those who travel often and transfer points to their Chase Sapphire Preferred Card this was an absolute dream We shouldnt count our eggs before they hatch of course but it would be nice to get a repeat on that promotion Either way its pretty safe to say the Chase Freedom card will offer at least back the last quarter of this year Just remember as with Discover earning with your Chase Freedom card requires a little bit of work on your part Unlike some other cards that award bonus points automatically the Chase Freedom card requires you to activate your card If you havent done it for this quarters bonus category yet you can activate it here or through your online account management interface Hate Rotating Rewards Consider a CashBack Card that Offers a Flat Rate If you like the idea of earning up to on purchases made through Amazoncom signing up for either one of these cards might be a smart idea With a top nofee rewards card in your wallet you can earn a bare minimum of back for every dollar you spend plus up to depending on which card you choose and their current promotions If you dont like keeping track of rotating categories or remembering to sign up for a new promotion each quarter you can also consider a card that offers a flat rate of cash back The Chase Freedom Unlimited is a solid option if you want flat rate rewards With this card youll earn a flat back on every purchase you make including those made on Amazoncom Plus youll earn a hefty signup bonus just for meeting a small minimum spending requirement within the first days of card ownership If you want to explore more cash back options including additional
