(Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.For 2015, Intel posted stagnant revenue and a decline in operating income.The Client Computing Group continues to be weighed down by mobile device losses.In his prepared remarks for the 2015 Q4 earnings conference call , Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) CEO Bryan Krzanich claimed a "strong finish" to the year.But gone was last year's bravado regarding the mobile space.Gone was any mention of tablet processor sales, SoFIA, Intel's partnerships with Rockchip and Spreadtrum, or even Intel's wireless modems.Intel's capitulation on mobile sounds a warning for investors regarding Intel's fundamental business model.As previewed at Intel's Investor Meeting last November, Intel's management is focused (and would like to focus investor attention) on three key areas of growth, the data center, the Internet of Things (IOT), and non-volatile memory.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the surface , this seems sensible , because Intel has high <b>hopes</b> for 3D Xpoint memory , and the Data Center Group ( DCG ) and IoT Group ( ITG ) both posted revenue gains for Q4 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Intel eked out a slight revenue gain for the quarter of 1.3% y/y to $14.9 billion.However, even the bastions of DCG and ITG showed signs of strain.While revenue was up for the quarter, operating income was down for both.Total operating income for Intel was down 3.5% y/y for the quarter.For the year, revenue declined by 1% y/y to $55.3 billion while operating income declined by 7.8% y/y to $14 billion.Client Computing Group (CCG) faced with the ongoing decline in worldwide PC sales, continued its relentless decline.For Q4 revenue was down by about 1% while operating income was down by 4% year over year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These year-over-year comparisons are for restated revenue and operating income <b>assuming</b> the combination of the PC Client Group and the Mobile and Communications Group ( MCG ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>That combination of the PCCG and MCG at the beginning of the year continues to obscure but not completely conceal Intel's continuing mobile losses, which were once again acknowledged during the conference call.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An analyst asked if the goal of an $ 800 million reduction in mobile losses was still the goal for 2016 , and Intel acknowledged that it was .  (Uncertainty) </span>Comparing the operating costs of the combined Client Computing Group and the old PC Client Group provides insight into the magnitude of the losses associated with mobile as the chart below shows.Despite comparable revenue to the old PCCG, operating income for CCG continued to lag compared to last year, by about, you guessed it, a billion dollars.Intel's claims of making progress in reducing mobile losses are beginning to look rather specious.Up until Q4, Intel was at least making progress in getting operating costs under control.The jump in operating cost for Q1 reflects the $1 billion in operating loss for the mobile group that it was posting quarterly throughout 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Why operating cost jumped in Q4 , erasing the gains of the previous quarters <b>appears</b> to be due to a reversal of Intel 's reduction in contra revenue for Q4 , as well as expenses due to modem development .  (Uncertainty) </span>Intel reported selling 9 million tablet processors in the quarter.This was actually a sequential increase from the previous quarter of 1 million units, although a decline of 33% y/y.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> Intel decided to boost tablet sales in Q4 to clear out inventory .  (Uncertainty) </span>Although Intel has claimed that non-volatile memory represents a growth area for the company, there's no discernible profit, as the memory effort is lumped into the All Other category, which posted a loss of $817 million for Q4 on revenue of $682 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An analyst asked if memory output from the planned Chinese factory would be a positive contributor to EPS , and Intel acknowledged that it would n't be in 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>It wasn't until an analyst specifically asked about it, that Intel's modem effort was even mentioned.Intel stated that the 7360 modem is being sampled to potential customers, but didn't give any indication of the magnitude of adoption.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I personally <b>doubt</b> that adoption will be high , with Qualcomm already fielding superior modems , and having an incumbency advantage .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>After the Investor Meeting , I described Intel as being in retreat in mobile devices , but the lack of mention of Intel 's mobile devices <b>seems</b> <i>more</i> than mere retreat .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In fact, I think Intel management has simply realized that it's never going to be competitive with ARM-based processors for smartphones and lightweight tablets.The smartphone industry continues to embrace the paradigm shift away from commodity processors produced by companies like Intel to custom designed systems on chip (SOCs).The industry is following Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) lead, not Intel's retro PC industry fantasy.The latest example of this is the recently released Huawei Mate 8 smartphone .Even I as an Apple fan and investor have to acknowledge that the Mate 8 is a really nice phone.It runs Android 6.0, and features the HiSilicon Kirin 950 SOC.The Kirin 950 is a custom SOC featuring the latest ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH ) Cortex-A72 CPU core design.HiSilicon is a wholly owned subsidiary of Huawei.The custom SOCs from Samsung and Hauwei clearly demonstrate that the industry now understands the value of Apple's custom SOCs that it began designing back in 2010.There is no turning back the clock to the PC commodity era for the smartphone industry.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Commodity processors still have a place , as Qualcomm has shown , but only in medium priced and <i>lower</i> devices .  (Surprise) </span>But even in this price tier, Intel can't compete with Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) latest Snapdragon 820.Theoretically, Intel still plans to move SoFIA (now fabricated by TSMC on a 28 nm process) to its own 14 nm process this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I frankly <b>doubt</b> that Intel will bother .  (Uncertainty) </span>There is no market for it.The Kirin 950 also serves to demonstrate why Intel's modem strategy will fail.The 950 already has incorporated HiSilicon's own modem technology.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The industry is moving to integrated modems , with Apple as one of the few laggards in this regard , but I <b>doubt</b> that will last much <i>longer</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple will <b>probably</b> license Qualcomm 's modem technology for its next generation SOC .  (Uncertainty) </span>I have for some time advocated that Intel embrace the "PC mobilization" strategy of Microsoft , focusing on mobile form factors for Wintel based PCs.Microsoft's latest Surface Pro and Surface Book are great examples of this.Clearly, there's a huge market of Windows PC users that can be mined for upgrades.The failure in smartphones should give investors pause regarding the longevity and ultimate success of this strategy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Intel failed in smartphones and tablets because of a basic cost disadvantage compared to ARM that it simply <b>could</b> n't overcome , even with contra revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span>Doesn't that cost disadvantage eventually carry over into the other markets served by CCG and DCG?I think it does.It's already having an impact on client computing, as consumers simply don't bother to upgrade their Wintel PCs.For these consumers, smartphones and tablets are performing most of their day-to-day computing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As these devices become <i>more</i> powerful and able to connect to large screen HD and even UHD displays , they make inroads in traditional PC strongholds such as productivity and even entertainment , interactive and non .  (Surprise) </span>These days, you can watch UHD movies or play games on an ARM processor device, whether located in your smartphone or a compact console such as the Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) Shield Console.Given the declines in the market for traditional PCs and the growing power of smartphones, I'm now very skeptical that Microsoft will ever achieve its goal of 1 billion PCs running Windows 10.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , the reported revamping of Android as a mobile and PC platform <b>appears</b> to set up Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) to take advantage of ARM processors to become the next commodity PC platform supplier .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The data center <b>appears</b> safe for now , and I expect Intel to protect it ferociously , but I expect that eventually it will succumb as well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here , the key to reducing Intel 's share of the market will <b>probably</b> be companies such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , that have the ability to design ARM processors ( through its Anapurna subsidiary ) , combined with a huge internal market for servers , and the ability to control the software stack that runs on the servers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple <b>could</b> also do this .  (Uncertainty) </span>What happened with smartphones is really a death knell for the x86 architecture.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The death of x86 <b>may</b> be painful and protracted , but it looks increasingly certain .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Altera offers a faint glimmer of <b>hope</b> in that Altera designed and built some ARM-based combination processor/FPGA devices , as I pointed out in Intel Becomes An ARM Chip Maker .  (Uncertainty) </span>But there's still no sign that Intel management is willing to be flexible regarding choice of instruction set architecture for its key products.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>may</b> come eventually , but until then , I consider Intel a sell .
