(Uncertainty) </span>Ford (NYSE: F ) announced February 2016 U.S. vehicle sales of 217K, up a whopping 20% from the same month in 2015.This large increase came in well above the 12% and 13% estimates from Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds.The increase was refreshing to Ford's shareholders after a mediocre start to 2016 in January.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , the company increased its average transaction price at <b>almost</b> double the industry average due to the continued success of its larger vehicle offerings .  (Uncertainty) </span>After January, in which many auto companies were blaming the East Coast snow storm for lackluster sales, Ford's 20% increase came in well above other competitors as the overall industry average posted a 7% increase.This impressive month for the industry comes on the heels of a record 2015 that saw 17.47 million vehicles sold, surpassing the 2000 mark of 17.41 million.Competitors such as Honda (NYSE: HMC ) (up 13%), Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) (up 12%), Nissan ( OTCPK:NSANY ) (up 10.5%), and Toyota (NYSE: TM ) (up 5%) posted solid increases while General Motors (NYSE: GM ) (fell 1.5%) and Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) (fell 7%) saw decreases.Furthermore, in the critical pickup truck market, Ford's F-Series posted a 10% increase, which is a positive indicator of the company's future.The model is coming off a busy 2015 where it underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this year's model, and has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure its manufacturing plants.Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F-150 model, the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like its competitors in the first half of 2015.However, the company reached full production in the second half of 2015 and was credited for its late surge in 2015.Showing its resiliency, even with the supply issues, the model was awarded the title of America's best-selling pickup for 39 straight years and the best-selling vehicle for 34 straight years with over 780,000 trucks sold in 2015.Another concerning figure from the February sales report was the continuation of a sluggish 2016 start for the Ford Mustang.Despite reclaiming the title of US muscle car of the year in 2015 by selling over 122,000 Mustangs compared to only 77,500 Chevrolet Camaros.In January 2016, the Mustang saw a 13% decrease compared to an 11% increase by the Camaro while in February 2016, the Mustang saw an 18.2% increase compared to a 3.5% increase to Camaro.In line with the impressive gains made by the F-Series, the rebound from a lackluster month for the Mustang is a positive indicator for Ford's 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This slow start to 2016 in addition to other <b>possible</b> threats such as the overall health of the US economy , the upcoming interest rate hike , and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry are weighing heavily on investor sentiment .  (Uncertainty) </span>If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession, it would definitely have a major impact on Ford.Furthermore, with an interest rate hike announced in December, it will likely force the automotive market to reach its limit.Additionally, with new companies working to produce technology-infused vehicles such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesn't fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Ford <b>appears</b> to be prepared for this through rumored partnerships with Google and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) ; however , management must continue to look to be leaders in the race to an autonomous car .
