Then indications that Blaze was quickly sold out at major retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) and Best Buy began to surface.It is now becoming increasingly clear that Blaze is another in a long line of Fitbit products that all receive overwhelming consumer acceptance in the marketplace.(click to enlarge) Fitbit Blaze is beating Apple's smartwatch and taking market share away from AAPL and other competitors in the smartwatch sub-category.Here are the reasons why: Specificity of function or focus on function is a huge issue for consumers who have spoken loudly and clearly that they want wrist wearables to perform only a select few specific functions: Fitbit figured out some time ago what the mass market of consumers really wants in a wearable wrist device, and this knowledge has benefited the company greatly.Consumers do not want a "Swiss Army Knife" kind of a device on their wrists that performs a vast array of functions with endless numbers of apps like the Apple Watch.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Maybe because the screen is just too small to view and work with effectively , or <b>maybe</b> because there are other <i>larger</i> devices that are <i>easier</i> to interact with and <i>better</i> suited for performing certain tasks , but the consumer just does not want a device on their wrist that does `` too much . ''  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This consumer preference for `` <i>less</i> is <i>more</i> '' in wrist wearables is counter-intuitive , but it is a fact .  (Surprise) </span>The graphic below shows that Fitbit products are precisely on point according to consumer preference while Apple and others are missing the mark.Click to enlargeApparently, even the vast majority of smartwatch owners only use their device for a handful of specific functions.So the consumer has decided that when it comes to smartwatch/tracker functions, it is best for a wrist wearable device to just KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid).Who knew?Apple didn't know this crucial metric, and neither did other smartwatch competitors know this crucial consumer preference.But Fitbit clearly has demonstrated its awareness of the consumer in wearables as demonstrated by the huge success in 4Q15 and full-year 2015 sales.This consumer awareness on issues like focus on function has been a key strength for Fitbit and a weakness for Apple and others in wearables.Keep in mind that the Apple smartwatch product barely even moves the revenue needle for the quarterly earnings reports so it receives limited resources to compete with a superior wearables company in Fitbit that is 100% focused on this category.It is a myth that AAPL beats other companies when it enters their category as demonstrated by a succession of recent misses by Apple in Music, TV and wearables.Compatibility is another key issue that Fitbit has nailed while Apple has missed.A prerequisite for buying the Apple smartwatch is ownership of the expensive Apple iPhone, and of course you have to subscribe to a monthly service plan for that iPhone.Since Apple only has about 20% of the worldwide cell phone market, Fitbit wins 80% of the market for wearables right out of the gate.Because Fitbit is 100% compatible with all operating systems worldwide, it crushes the Apple Watch on the issue of compatibility.The graphic below shows that Fitbit knew in advance what the consumer wanted, a seamless experience in compatibility, and delivered exactly that product to overwhelmingly positive, worldwide acceptance.Apple has missed the mark in wearables badly while only Fitbit is winning big worldwide with consumers, corporations, governments, insurers, and healthcare providers.So here is a concise list of reasons why Fitbit Blaze is winning now and will continue to beat the Apple Watch in the future.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This list also <b>may</b> render future versions of the Apple smartwatch DOA against future Fitbit products : Price : Not only does the Apple Watch cost over $ 350 vs. Blaze 's <i>more</i> reasonable $ 199.50 , but also the consumer must first purchase the expensive iPhone and also subscribe to an expensive monthly service plan for their iPhone .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Add up the total cost to become a user of the Apple Watch and you can see why Fitbit Blaze destroys the Apple Watch on price.Advantage Fitbit Blaze.Battery Life: The Blaze delivers about five days battery life so that the user can track sleep non-stop and not be inconvenienced by daily requirements to recharge their watch.The Apple Watch only allows one-day usage before requiring recharge.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And if you use a lot of the apps on the Apple Watch , you <b>could</b> find your battery drained in just 18 hours .  (Uncertainty) </span>Don't even think about tracking sleep with the Apple Watch.Once again, battery life is a huge advantage for the Fitbit Blaze.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Now , based solely upon just the first two key points mentioned here , many shoppers would opt for the <i>more</i> consumer-friendly Fitbit Blaze .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But there are even <i>more</i> reasons for the Blaze to beat the Apple Watch .  (Surprise) </span>Focus on function or product specificity is a strength of Fitbit Blaze as demonstrated by the BI Intelligence graphic above entitled, "Health Tops List of Information U.S. Consumers Want From Wearables."<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Perhaps</b> it is counterintuitive to think that the consumer actually wants <i>less</i> function on their wrist wearable device , but it is the fact .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And Fitbit knows this important consumer metric while Apple is <b>apparently</b> clueless .  (Uncertainty) </span>Once again, advantage Fitbit Blaze.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Compatibility : Apple cell phones comprise <i>less</i> than 20 % of the worldwide market .  (Surprise) </span>A consumer must own the iPhone prior to buying the Apple Watch.Fitbit Blaze does not require any such prerequisite and is 100% compatible with all mobile operating systems.So the Apple Watch is limited to a world market of only sub-20%.Obviously, not every iPhone owner will buy an Apple Watch, so this greatly handicaps the prospects for the Apple Watch.Once again, huge advantage for the Fitbit Blaze.Yet another compatibility issue: I access my Fitbit Surge ecosystem with my desktop PC, which ironically is an iMac.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My girlfriend can only access her Apple Watch ecosystem with her iPhone , she ca n't even access the Apple Watch via her iPad tablet , much <i>less</i> our iMac computer .  (Surprise) </span>Now get this: she can access the Fitbit ecosystem with either her iPhone, or her iPad, or our iMac.And of course the Fitbit ecosystem is 100% compatible with every other operating system worldwide.The huge advantages for Fitbit Blaze just keep increasing.Ecosystem: The co-founders of Fitbit, Park and Friedman, are software guys.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And the Fitbit ecosystem shows it with an <b>amazing</b> online UX via the dashboard .  (Surprise) </span>Users of the Fitbit ecosystem "get it" and we tell our friends, family, co-workers, readers, etc.Candidly, do yourself a favor and try out a Fitbit product.See for yourself what the world is raging about.And then it will really bake your noodle when you think about where innovation will take this technology in the years ahead since it is still very early days for wearables.Ecosystem is another huge advantage for Fitbit Blaze.Social Media: Many consumers rave about the online social media experience that keeps them involved, motivated, and having fun with other Fitbit ecosystem consumers locally and/or worldwide.Fun stuff.Again, where will Fitbit take this social media experience in the years ahead as innovation continues is a valid question for investors to consider.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>No <b>surprise</b> here , advantage Fitbit Blaze .  (Surprise) </span>Brand Favorite: "I need to make a Xerox of this document" "Can you please pass me a Kleenex," " Sussan Ley to trial new e-health record for the Fitbit generation ": It's over... Fitbit owns the category... Fitbit is now synonymous with the device known as the fitness tracker and Blaze is now extending this favorite brand advantage into the smartwatch sub-category.There are other significant advantages and reasons why the Fitbit Blaze will continue to beat the Apple Watch and take market share away from AAPL in wearables, such as first-mover advantages and a large, focused R&D effort.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But the point is clear : Fitbit Blaze is a major winner that is beating the much <i>weaker</i> Apple smartwatch .  (Surprise) </span>And Fitbit's other product now being launched, Alta, is a blockbuster winner also.Both the Blaze and Alta will be significantly accretive to earnings, increase revenues substantially, and improve margins.So now let's revisit that unjustified sell-off of FIT from $31 down to $12 of FIT based upon the critics' misreading of the Blaze when it was released on 1/5/16.Fitbit bulls not only want every penny of that unjustified sell-off back into the price of FIT shares, but bulls also want the added-value back above $31 that the shares should experience due to the clear success that both Blaze and Alta are delivering to the company.Citi's recent initiation of coverage with a Buy Recommendation and a price target of $35 is reasonable.An interesting side note concerning competitor Xiaomi's low-end wearables product: The low-price/low-quality nature of the Xiaomi product is attracting first-time customers into the wearables market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because Fitbit recently surpassed Xiaomi in downloads in its home market of Asia , this <b>may</b> indicate that many of the new customers introduced to wearables by Xiaomi 's low-end products have chosen to upgrade to Fitbit 's higher-quality ecosystem .  (Uncertainty) </span>Because of a much higher-quality product and excellent marketing including Bollywood stars in the Indian market , Fitbit's products are now perceived as being for the "cool kids" of all ages worldwide.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growth in the new Asia market for Fitbit will continue to be strong and Xiaomi <b>may</b> continue to inadvertently assist FIT in this growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>AAPL will continue to struggle worldwide for the reasons listed above.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Please note in the recent IDC reports that Xiaomi has surpassed Apple 's smartwatch in units shipped , albeit at a far <i>lower</i> price point .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Critics of Fitbit will point out that Apple 's smartwatch has an ASP of about $ 350 while Fitbit 's Blaze is priced <i>lower</i> at $ 199 when it comes to measuring total revenue comparisons .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This means that Blaze will need to outsell Apple 's smartwatch by <i>better</i> than a 3.5:2 ratio in order to win the revenue battle .  (Surprise) </span>We will see.But it would be reasonable to conclude that the rapidly growing revenues of all Fitbit products will soon overtake the relatively stagnant growth of the Apple smartwatch revenues.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fitbit Blaze <b>may</b> indeed continue to take market share from the Apple smartwatch as indicated by current retail channel checks .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This would tilt the tables in Fitbit 's favor even <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Also , critics rarely take into consideration that a rapidly growing number of corporations and insurers are buying Fitbits and then providing them to employees and policyholders for free because the Fitbit ecosystem makes for <i>healthier</i> people and this equals substantial cost savings .  (Surprise) </span>The most preferred price that consumers are willing to pay is FREE.Shocker.Apple Watch version 2.0 is on the way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although it is rumored that the new Apple Watch has been pushed back from March until September due to the lack of consumer demand , Apple fan boys are holding out <b>hope</b> for this product to somehow get AAPL back in the wearables game in a meaningful way .  (Uncertainty) </span>What can Apple do to overcome the many steep disadvantages that its inferior smartwatch product suffers relative to a far superior wearables company, Fitbit, remains to be seen.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Certainly , we already know that consumers do not want <i>more</i> apps or functions from the Apple Watch due to the focus on function issue .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So <b>possibly</b> increasing battery life by double from its current weak one-day charge to a <i>less</i> weak two days would help .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Fitbit Blaze 's five-day battery life <b>may</b> also be doubled with future innovation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Honestly , it is difficult to present a convincing <b>variant</b> view for the <b>disappointing</b> Apple smartwatch .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>When considering the overall future prospects for the Apple Watch, one is reminded of the complete failure of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Glasses.How much of a drain on resources that the Apple smartwatch currently places upon a company with decelerating sales growth in its core products is an important consideration.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple <b>may</b> not tolerate the continued drain on resources caused by the <b>disappointing</b> smartwatch product that makes no meaningful contribution to moving the company 's revenue needle on quarterly reports .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Sales of its smartwatch have not even been disclosed by Apple since the product's launch.This type of a cover-up of a product's lack of revenues is never a good sign for the future existence of that product.Discontinuance of the Apple smartwatch cannot be ruled out going forward as future Fitbit products and innovation increase its dominance over AAPL in the wearables category.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just as Apple 's Music product has faded into relative obscurity , the smartwatch has been on a similar downward trajectory that <b>may</b> be hastened by the advent of Fitbit Blaze taking substantial market share away from Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span>At some point, it becomes smart business for Apple to just cut its losses and stop throwing good money after bad on its most recent miss, the Apple smartwatch.The consideration now enters the discussion that Fitbit Blaze, and soon-to-be-announced future products, will knock the flagging Apple smartwatch right out of the wearables category's competition.Fitbit has dealt similar death blows to Nike (NYSE: NKE ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Jawbone (Private) whose products have been relegated into obscurity by the dominant company in wearables, Fitbit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is absolutely no reason to <b>believe</b> that Apple will be any different than the other major companies which have made fatal mistakes in wearables as AAPL also has made fatal mistakes as listed earlier in this article .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The launch of Fitbit Blaze <b>could</b> be marking the beginning of total domination over Apple in the dual wrist wearables sub-categories of both fitness trackers and smartwatches .  (Uncertainty) </span>If ever there was an oversold stock that is trading at a deep discount when instead Fitbit should be trading at a premium valuation as the undisputed worldwide leader and pioneer of the triple-digit-growth wearables category, that stock is FIT.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wall Street 's doomsayers and the illegitimate media `` experts '' have <b>predicted</b> that large-cap Apple would crush mid-cap Fitbit in wearables .  (Uncertainty) </span>These people have been proven wrong.It is now becoming clear that David is beating Goliath and that Fitbit is crushing Apple in wearables.Soon the Street will realize what is happening in wearables and then appreciate shares of FIT to the high-growth premium valuation that it deserves.And the sky-high short interest in FIT now must cover making the potential for a rapid rise in price per share likely.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Author payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500.Become a contributor � Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Diversified Electronics, Editors' Picks, Growth, Unjustified Sell-Off</div></body></html>
