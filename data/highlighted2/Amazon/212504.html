(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ESPN has also lost <b>approximately</b> 7 % of its subscriber base since its 2011 peak level .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the meanwhile , the live streaming companies such as Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , and Hulu , are witnessing impressive subscriber growth ; the cable TV industry will remain under pressure in the future . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although the decline rate in cable TV subscriber base is steady , which is expected to remain modest , the growth in the live streaming market will continue to challenge Disney and other players as <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> subscribers are switching to streaming services .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Retaining the subscriber base would be <i>tougher</i> as YouTube is also entering the subscribed streaming business with the launch of YouTube Red .  (Surprise) </span>To attract a large subscriber base, the ad-free music, and video streaming service will also offer offline and background play functionalities.According to Bob Iger, Disney is not ready to take the desperate step towards an internet offering.The company expects its media network will remain strong as evident from the fact that 83% of U.S. cable households watched ESPN in the first quarter.Thus, Disney is not expecting a dramatic decline in cable subscribers over the next five years.In the meanwhile, ESPN revenue would continue to move in the upward trajectory.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The primary channels of ESPN charge $ 6.61 per subscriber a month and if the company keeps increasing the price at a six years historical average of 8 % , still its revenue will grow by 6 % annually over the next five years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Losing subscribers even at a modest rate <b>could</b> slow down the top-line growth , but it will impact the earnings growth of media network segment in 2016 due to a high cost .  (Uncertainty) </span>In this regard, Disney is cutting 300 jobs at ESPN network, around 4% of the workforce.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> Disney does not intend to trim the bundle and pricing as a first option , and taking a typical initiative by reducing the workforce to immediately reduce the cost .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, it is not a solid step to maintain the earnings growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Disney must come up with a robust strategy to retain the subscribers as losing <i>more</i> than 4 million subscribers over the past four years is not a good indication .  (Surprise) </span>In this scenario, the management has a good amount of time to swing its existing strategy including pricing and introducing skinny bundles, sales channels, and even basic technology.Disney has done very smart things, and in my opinion, it is doing the same by not taking aggressive measures for now.The media network segment is still capable of delivering a steady and profitable growth, but tapping the subscription streaming business to build an option for future is a smart move.Disney is holding an option to start selling ESPN directly to the viewer if the subscriber base falls below expectations in the future.In this regard, Disney is launching DisneyLife, a digital subscription streaming service, in the UK next month.Offering most of the popular movies and television shows directly to consumers for ï¿½9.99, or about $15, a month will open a new revenue window for Disney.After the initial launch in the UK next month, Disney will roll out the streaming service in the other European markets like France, Spain, Italy and Germany in 2016 where video on demand in Germany alone is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22% by 2019.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The on-demand video subscription in the UK will reach <b>roughly</b> $ 1.54 billion by the end of 2019 , and video streaming and subscriptions industry will account for 38 % of the video market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , it <b>seems</b> that Disney is preparing itself for the streaming business .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger said : `` DisneyLife is a great example of our strategy to utilize technology to connect with consumers in <i>more</i> direct and compelling ways . ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For now , Disney will offer <i>older</i> content to subscribers including Pixar movies along with bundles of books and music .  (Surprise) </span>Star Wars and Marvel films would not be available in this subscription.Holding these cards is a good thinking to play smart.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , if this business model succeeds , Disney would offer all the lucrative content in a separate subscription services dedicated to these franchises .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Moreover , Disney is slowly testing the market without <b>risking</b> its existing business .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this regard , the stand-alone subscription service will not be available in the U.S. , but it <b>might</b> happen in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span>The global subscriber base of streaming business will reach 332.2 million by 2019.With the acquisition of 27% stake in Hulu, Disney indirectly entered the streaming business back in April 2009.Hulu, which is a joint venture of Disney, 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), is the second largest streaming company with a market share of 18% in the U.S. market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Hulu is rapidly growing in the streaming space and the company will find it <i>easier</i> to make content deals as compared to its rivals due to its holding companies .  (Surprise) </span>Hulu has around 9 million users on its Hulu Plus Services, and the company witnessed a 50% increase in its user base in the past year.Thus, having 32% stake in the second largest online video streaming company gives Disney an indirect access to rapidly growing industry.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The other three segments are delivering double-digit growth which means despite a slowdown in media network , the overall profitability of Disney will continue to grow by a <i>higher</i> single digit in the long-term .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney earns <b>roughly</b> half of its operating income from media network while the remaining half comes from the studio entertainment , parks and resorts , and consumer products .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Besides ESPN , Hulu and DisneyLife , Disney is equipped with Marvel , Pixar , and Lucasfilm to maintain its growth momentum for a <i>longer</i> run .  (Surprise) </span>Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which has already broken records of advance ticket sales, is all set to boost the revenue of studio entertainment.In addition to that, Disney has also unveiled the roadmap of next five Star Wars movies and Marvel movies.In the meanwhile, the opening of the Shanghai theme park next year will accelerate a sustainable earnings growth in the coming years.For the third quarter 2015, Disney reported diluted earnings per share of $1.45, up 13% as compared to $1.28 in the same period last year.Disney will announce its fourth quarter and annual results on November 05, 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Consensus expects that Disney will report earnings per share of $ 1.16 for the fourth quarter 2015 , which will be an increase of <b>roughly</b> 35 % over the same quarter last year .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company generated $4.5 billion in free cash flow during the first nine months of 2015, up 2%.Disney has been raising dividends aggressively, from $0.35 per share in 2009 to $1.32 per share in 2015, and another dividend hike is on cards.Thus, the cash reward to shareholder should remain healthy in the future.With strong fundamentals and intact outlook, Disney is still a long-term investment for healthy dividend growth and capital gains.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
