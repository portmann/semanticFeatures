Ten days ago, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) swept earnings as well.Arguments about valuations and lowered expectations can be made until investors are blue in the face.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But the fact remains the same : the five largest companies in tech ( and five of the six largest companies in the U.S. ) all beat expectations and all of them moved <i>higher</i> as a result .  (Surprise) </span>That's got to bode well for stocks, right?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It should for the QQQ Fund , the widely-tracked ETF for tech stocks , ( although it does have some other <b>exposure</b> to other sectors too ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The ETF is pressing new 52-week highs , and while it <b>appears</b> to have succeeded in setting a new 52-week closing high , the elusive new highs failed to materialized Friday .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's now just a stone's throw away.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Ironically though , the one thing that 's <b>probably</b> really stopping this ETF from being <i>higher</i> is one of the components that 's helping boost it toward new highs : Apple .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The tech giant accounts for <i>more</i> than 10 % of the ETF and while shares are up <b>roughly</b> 6 % this week , they are still down 21.5 % from its all-time highs and 15 % over the past year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>At the same time, the other four stocks mentioned are at or near 52-week or all-time highs at the moment.Virtual Reality has been an increasingly-talked about technology that many are expecting to boom into a large market by the end of the decade.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The IDC expects the industry to generate hardware sales of <i>more</i> than $ 2 billion this year on sales of <b>roughly</b> 9.6 million units .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By 2020 , it expects 110 million units to sell , boasting a five year CAGR of <i>more</i> than 180 % .  (Surprise) </span>Getting involved from an investing standpoint isn't as clear, but Facebook's acquisition of Oculus VR in March of 2014 for $2 billion really gave the industry a boost.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spoken bullishly on the industry , calling it the `` next major computing and communications platform , '' he also said it <b>could</b> take up to 10 years before VR is able to reach the mass market for consumers .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's not stopping a number of new companies from popping up in the VR space.Some are for real estate , others give high-level sports teams (mainly pros and college programs) the ability to train using VR , and some are game makers.Notably, Sony (NYSE: SNE ) is one of them.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company , which is up some 9 % Friday after the company <b>surprised</b> investors with a first-quarter profit , shed some light on its Playstation VR , set to debut on October 13th .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to a document released by the company , users are asked to have about 60 square feet of available space ; forming a rectangle <b>roughly</b> 10 feet long by 6 feet wide , with the user placed basically in the middle .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sony also suggests sitting for as much of the VR experience as <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Many have pushed back, arguing that sitting does not lead to an experience that's quite as immersive, while others have cited nausea due to sitting and using VR.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some alternatives have popped up , like Virtuix Omni ( some of you <b>may</b> remember it from Shark Tank ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The private company is actually raising funds via SeedInvest , allowing non-accredited investors to get in on the action.As for product, it makes a non-motorized, omni-directional treadmill that allows VR users to move, walk and run in any direction, eliminating many of these problems.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> the product and others , would be a good alternative for console-based VR games .  (Uncertainty) </span>In any regard, VR is still a very young technology, which looks primed to get off to an explosive start later this year and going toward the end of the decade.The solutions and products that await us should be quite exciting.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Macro View , Market Outlook, Author Newsletter, Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
