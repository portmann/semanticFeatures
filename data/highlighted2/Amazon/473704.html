was priced at per share the night prior Facebook could have to pay billion to billion to the IRS The QQQ ETF is pushing toward new highs with the help of some big names in tech More details emerge on Playstations virtual reality product as the industry is poised to grow rapidly over the next four year While Facebook NASDAQ FB may have turned in an impressive quarterly report card the company could be on the hook for quite a bit of dough when it comes to the Internal Revenue Service The IRS has been hounding Facebook for quite some time actually In it began looking into its finances from Although Facebook has handed over some information the social media icon has largely dodged the IRS failing to hand over most of the requested information Most recently the company skipped its seventh summons in regards to the IRS Its refusal to play ball so to say likely hasnt left a great taste in the IRSs mouth As a result it has slapped Facebook with a notice of deficiency of billion to billion plus interest and penalties Likely to no ones surprise the company plans to challenge the notice in court To explain why the IRS is hounding Facebook simply put is because the company while using Ernst Young as its advisor has reportedly undervalued its property when it transferred some of its holdings to Ireland Understandably when the company was transferring its assets it wanted to do so at the lowest possible value in order to pay the lowest amount of taxes If I had to guess some sort of middleground settlement will likely emerge as a result With sales growth of almost in the most recent quarter and over billion in cash and shortterm investments on the balance sheet as of last quarter Facebook likely isnt sweating too much over the potential outcome Still youd have to assume a multibillion hit for a company will likely be a turnoff for some investors assuming that were to happen of course Shares of the Francebased software vendor called Talent Pending TLND debuted for trading on Friday The stock opened for trading at vastly above the per share pricing that was set on Thursday night Closing at shares were up more than in its first day of trading The company priced above its expected range of to showing investor demand was high The extra openingprice pop showed that demand clearly remain strong going into the weekend For a good breakdown on the companys numbers check out Don Dions piece here The IPO market has not been the same as it has in recent years It has been relatively quiet and it didnt help that markets got off to a rocky start in the beginning of the year With the heightened volatility a lot of young companies were scared away from the public market It also doesnt help that unicorns companies like Uber Private UBER Airbnb Private AIRB and Snapchat Private CHAT are withholding from the public markets as well opting to raise money on their own Perhaps persuading Talend to go through with the IPO was the major success from Twilio NYSE TWLO The company priced its IPO at per share but opened at nearly per share That was the end of the June Now the stocks trading north of The PowerShares QQQ ETF NASDAQ QQQ got a spark this week and over the past few weeks as its biggest components all moved higher following earnings This week alone Apple NASDAQ AAPL Facebook Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN completed the earnings sweep beating on earnings per share and revenue expectations Ten days ago Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT swept earnings as well Arguments about valuations and lowered expectations can be made until investors are blue in the face But the fact remains the same the five largest companies in tech and five of the six largest companies in the US all beat expectations and all of them moved higher as a result Thats got to bode well for stocks right It should for the QQQ Fund the widelytracked ETF for tech stocks although it does have some other exposure to other sectors too The ETF is pressing new week highs and while it appears to have succeeded in setting a new week closing high the elusive new highs failed to materialized Friday Its now just a stones throw away Ironically though the one thing thats probably really stopping this ETF from being higher is one of the components thats helping boost it toward new highs Apple The tech giant accounts for more than of the ETF and while shares are up roughly this week they are still down from its alltime highs and over the past year At the same time the other four stocks mentioned are at or near week or alltime highs at the moment Virtual Reality has been an increasinglytalked about technology that many are expecting to boom into a large market by the end of the decade The IDC expects the industry to generate hardware sales of more than billion this year on sales of roughly million units By it expects million units to sell boasting a five year CAGR of more than Getting involved from an investing standpoint isnt as clear but Facebooks acquisition of Oculus VR in March of for billion really gave the industry a boost While CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spoken bullishly on the industry calling it the next major computing and communications platform he also said it could take up to years before VR is able to reach the mass market for consumers Thats not stopping a number of new companies from popping up in the VR space Some are for real estate others give highlevel sports teams mainly pros and college programs the ability to train using VR and some are game makers Notably Sony NYSE SNE is one of them The company which is up some Friday after the company surprised investors with a firstquarter profit shed some light on its Playstation VR set to debut on October th According to a document released by the company users are asked to have about square feet of available space forming a rectangle roughly feet long by feet wide with the user placed basically in the middle Sony also suggests sitting for as much of the VR experience as possible Many have pushed back arguing that sitting does not lead to an experience thats quite as immersive while others have cited nausea due to sitting and using VR Some alternatives have popped up like Virtuix Omni some of you may remember it from Shark Tank The private company is actually raising funds via SeedInvest allowing nonaccredited investors to get in on the action As for product it makes a nonmotorized omnidirectional treadmill that allows VR users to move walk and run in any direction eliminating many of these problems Perhaps the product and others would be a good alternative for consolebased VR games In any regard VR is still a very young technology which looks primed to get off to an explosive start later this year and going toward the end of the decade The solutions and products that await us should be quite exciting Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
