U.S. retail sales have been incredibly underwhelming this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This has us a little concerned that the retail side of the business <b>may</b> have underperformed expectations .  (Uncertainty) </span>Though we see little reason why the rest of the business wouldn't be continuing its excellent growth.We expect the company will match earnings expectations this quarter.This leads us on to the Federal Reserve.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Fed will decide on interest rates later today and although it is widely expected to keep rates on hold , it will be what Yellen says that <b>could</b> shape the market 's performance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Yellen uses hawkish rhetoric , possibly hinting at a rate rise in May or , most probably , June , then there could be a touch of <b>panic</b> returning to the markets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the index already facing declines , this <b>could</b> compound things <i>further</i> leading to <i>more</i> declines .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We agree with some market observers who are saying that a hawkish Fed <b>could</b> result in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar ( NYSEARCA : UUP ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>seems</b> like a natural reaction in the FX markets , as the U.S. dollar starts to become an attractive safe haven once again .  (Uncertainty) </span>The ramifications on a strong dollar divides opinion.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Whilst a strong dollar is a sign of an improved economy , it is also rather troublesome for many companies as it undoes a lot of the benefits to corporate earnings that a <i>weaker</i> dollar has been providing .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> potentially cause a broad market sell-off dragging the Nasdaq 100 down further again .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whilst this is not a certainty , if you imagine the U.S. dollar index back over $ 1.00 again , it certainly will not make life easy for companies like Google when it comes to reporting in the next few quarters .  (Uncertainty) </span>So for this reason, despite the decline in the QQQ we feel it is too soon to open a long position again.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once Facebook and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> have reported and the Fed 's comments have sunk in , then it might be time to <b>reassess</b> and look to see if there is an opportunity for an investment . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An alternative to the QQQ <b>could</b> be the UUP , which we see strengthening quite a bit over the next few months if the Fed is indeed hawkish later today .
