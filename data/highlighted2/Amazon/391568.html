It Safe To Buy QQQ Again PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF NASDAQQQQ Seeking Alpha With Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still to report we feel it may be too soon to buy the QQQ ETF We are not convinced that Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will beat analyst expectations The Fed could potentially drive the QQQ lower if it is hawkish at the FOMC meeting and causes the US dollar to strengthen We believe sitting out until all companies have reported and the Feds decisionstatement has been absorbed by the market As some readers will be aware we have been in and out of owning the Nasdaq ETF NASDAQ QQQ in the last couple of months We bought in when we felt things were looking incredibly undervalued and were very fortunate to see a fantastic return of percent This return was far more than even the innerbull was dreaming of and thus we decided to lock in those gains ahead of earnings season because we were not sure the key players were going to deliver on expectations Timing isnt always our strong suit but we certainly did quite well with these Since we closed our QQQ position it has dropped by percent as you can see below With only the usually reliable Facebook NASDAQ FB and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN left to report from the big five companies within the index we have been tossing up between opening a position or not once the market opens today But we have decided against it because we are not as confident with Facebook and Amazons results as we once were Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL results were a bit of an eyeopener in our opinion At this stage we believe it is hard to say whether Facebook has stolen market share away from Google or whether demand is softer overall We do fear that a negative result from Facebook could result in the index being sold down further as sentiment depletes even more It has been welldocumented that sharing on Facebook has been on the decline perhaps thanks in part to the rise of Snapchat Private CHAT As Snapchat users we can certainly vouch for how it has dramatically changed our use of social media Snapchat is usually the first thing we check in the morning and gone are the days of checking in somewhere well just use our Snap story instead for that Thankfully posting an image on Instagram still appears to be a popular way of alternatively checking in somewhere So at least Facebook is winning there Now dont get us wrong we are not at all questioning the viability of Facebook For us it is a model company with an outstanding leader and one that we feel sure has high levels of innovation which will see it grow for many years to come We just feel this quarter its earnings may not live up to the high expectations the market currently has for it through no fault of its own Thats the problem when youre such a fantastic company the market keeps expecting you to smash their expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is another example of a fantastic company with an outstanding leader US retail sales have been incredibly underwhelming this year This has us a little concerned that the retail side of the business may have underperformed expectations Though we see little reason why the rest of the business wouldnt be continuing its excellent growth We expect the company will match earnings expectations this quarter This leads us on to the Federal Reserve The Fed will decide on interest rates later today and although it is widely expected to keep rates on hold it will be what Yellen says that could shape the markets performance If Yellen uses hawkish rhetoric possibly hinting at a rate rise in May or most probably June then there could be a touch of panic returning to the markets With the index already facing declines this could compound things further leading to more declines We agree with some market observers who are saying that a hawkish Fed could result in the strengthening of the US dollar NYSEARCA UUP This seems like a natural reaction in the FX markets as the US dollar starts to become an attractive safe haven once again The ramifications on a strong dollar divides opinion Whilst a strong dollar is a sign of an improved economy it is also rather troublesome for many companies as it undoes a lot of the benefits to corporate earnings that a weaker dollar has been providing This could potentially cause a broad market selloff dragging the Nasdaq down further again Whilst this is not a certainty if you imagine the US dollar index back over again it certainly will not make life easy for companies like Google when it comes to reporting in the next few quarters So for this reason despite the decline in the QQQ we feel it is too soon to open a long position again Once Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>have reported and the Feds comments have sunk in then it might be time to reassess and look to see if there is an opportunity for an investment An alternative to the QQQ could be the UUP which we see strengthening quite a bit over the next few months if the Fed is indeed hawkish later today
