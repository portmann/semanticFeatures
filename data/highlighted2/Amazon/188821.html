pay TV user base in the US Overall video consumption in the US is rising and modestly shifting consumer behavior has not impacted demand for Disneys content Disneys Media Networks Segment will likely continue to contribute stable and modestly growing operating income on which fastergrowing segments of business Studio Parks Consumer Products will build I recently wrote an article arguing that concerns over socalled cord cutting dramatically affecting Disneys NYSE DIS growth are overblown The article raised some specific questions from some readers regarding the cordcutting phenomenon that I believe should be explored in greater detail since concerns over the practice have weighed so heavily on Disneys share price since early August It was in early August the company warned analysts and investors of its moderating projections for growth in its Media Networks segment the media giants largest segment by revenue and operating income A Definition and the Approximate Impact Thus Far Cord Cutting is a term coined by popular culture that most in the media landscape would agree means discontinuing traditional pay TV service in favor of only broadband internet connection It is important to note that cord cutting is usually a misnomer as the vast majority of cord cutters do not cut their connection to video but instead shut off traditional cable or satellite video services in favor of broadband streaming of video A piece in the April edition of the Wall Street Journal this year details the practice and provides data on its effects Data gathered from the thirteen largest payTV services show the total number of cord cutters has remained incredibly small relative to the total number of traditional pay TV subscribers The cited research from the Leichtman Group estimates that approximately subscribers cut the cord in and did so in Data that has been breathlessly reported for the first half of by the news media seems to indicate cord cutting has accelerated but recent published reports mostly failed to mention that pay TV subscriptions are quite lumpy and only a full four quarters of data will accurately measure the true scope of the growth in cord cutting this year The and fullyear data show losses of and respectively from a base of over million US payTV subscribers Researchers also found that approximately half of the homes that switched to Broadband Only were still willing to pay for streaming video through services like Netflix NASDAQ NFLX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN or Hulu This data places the size of the cord cutting problem thus far for Disney in its proper context and reveals some of the most recent media coverage to be borderline hysterical To be sure cord cutting is a real phenomenon that requires attention from the company but it is hardly the tidal wave of earnings destruction that some have predicted Video Consumption Is Rising And Disney is In Demand Investors should remember that Disneys Media Networks Segment is a content generator and not a cable company The content being generated by the Networks Segment is in strong demand even as consumers shift their video consumption habits Demand for ESPNs live sports including NFL coverage and MNF College Football College Football Playoffs and NBA games have never been higher despite concern over the shifting habits of consumers video consumption A Nielsen study of Q viewing habits from showed that overall levels of video consumption have continued to grow The growth in video consumption was measured across all age demographic groups with the average American consuming over hours of traditional TV per day The study found that year olds were as predicted consuming a larger amount of video content on mobile devices but traditional TV and DVR watching still composed the vast majority of video consumption in this youngest measured demographic The study as well as subsequent Nielsen research confirms the trend of increasing mobile video consumption within the context of gradually rising overall consumption In short Americans of all age demographics are consuming more video content but there is a gradual shift to mobile video viewing that is still dwarfed by traditional TVDVR The overall trend of increased video consumption is an obvious positive for Disneys Media Networks business while the gradual shift to mobile viewing requires continued innovation on the companys part to provide its product across all platforms Investors should take note that the company seems to be doing just that finding innovative new ways of keeping its content accessible to consumers at strong pricing levels Consider this weeks Monday Night Football game Week of the season on ESPN The game drew a peak traditional TV audience of over million viewers beating last years week average viewers handily But the bigger story is that the game increased viewers on both traditional TV and on the companys Watch ESPN mobile app The Watch ESPN audience grew year over year to a peak of over viewers during the game Admittedly this week MNF data is an anecdote at best and the relative popularity of the teams playing week in vs played a major role in the viewer growth It is still likely illustrative however of the companys ability to keep up with gradually shifting consumer preferences while maintaining revenue from viewers Each consumer using the Watch ESPN app is a paying subscriber to one of the companys participating cablesatellite providers It is possible that most current analyses of the cord cutting phenomenon are based on the flawed fundamental assumption that cord cutting is equal to cost cutting for all consumers The evidence from the actual behavior of cord cutters is that at least half of those who have cord cut thus far are consuming streaming media content through services such as Netflix Hulu or HBO Now For this first wave of cord cutters it may very well be cost effective to ditch traditional pay TV for broadband internet coupled with a streaming service Yet based on the video consumption habits measured by the referenced Nielsen study above as well as other corroborating data the majority of consumers might be near to break even with their monthly cost when considering the sliding scale of bundled versus nonbundled broadband access and the current and likely rising costs of streaming services Consider the costs for an average household in New York where the most recent data show the typical megabit per second connection costs the household This figure is an average that includes households on promotional pricing and standard pricing from their provider The average New York household has many options for video consumption if they choose only a broadband connection from their provider If the households members were comfortable with streaming from free services only their costs would stop here and there would be an obvious cost savings If the family was comfortable with a single streaming service such as Netflix or Hulu their costs would rise to between depending on the service they chose and taxes assessed The most recent videoviewing trends however indicate that a vast majority of US households would not have their needs met with this combination as they would not have access to live programming without a traditional antenna and so they would need to opt for a more expensive over the top package such as Dishs NASDAQ DISH Sling TV that still would require a traditional antenna for local channels This would raise the average households cost to between If the household were to add just one premium streaming service such as HBO Now their costs with most overthetop services would rise to per month To be sure pricing varies greatly from market to market but the gap between traditional pay TV and the broadband and streaming service alternatives are not nearly as great as many believe when factoring in the viewing habits of the typical US household as measured by Nielson In summation the viewer data show that US households want live programming NFL NBA the ability to watch content ondemand premium channel programming and are willing to pay for digital rentals at a surprisingly high rate The modest price differential between broadbandstreaming and broadbandpay TV in the context of these typical consumer demands will likely limit the number of US households that find it cost effective to become cord cutters The risk posed by cord cutters to Disneys Media Networks segment is very likely overblown by the market creating an attractive entry point in the company for longterm investors Disneys strong content overall measured consumer viewers behavior and a narrowing gap between the broadbandstreaming option and pay TV option that meets most consumers needs very likely means cord cutting will not significantly damage Disneys Media Networks business The company has proven adept so far at moving to meet the changing video demands of consumers while maintaining pricing that permits stable if modest longterm growth for the companys Media Networks Segment We only use your contact details to reply to your request for
