(Uncertainty) </span>It was in early August the company warned analysts and investors of its moderating projections for growth in its Media Networks segment, the media giant's largest segment by revenue and operating income.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A Definition and the <b>Approximate</b> Impact Thus Far Cord Cutting is a term coined by popular culture that most in the media landscape would agree means discontinuing traditional pay TV service in favor of only broadband internet connection .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is important to note that cord cutting is usually a misnomer as the vast majority of cord cutters do not cut their connection to video, but instead shut off traditional cable or satellite video services in favor of broadband streaming of video.A piece in the April edition of the Wall Street Journal this year details the practice and provides data on its effects.Data gathered from the thirteen largest pay-TV services show the total number of cord cutters has remained incredibly small relative to the total number of traditional pay TV subscribers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The cited research from the Leichtman Group estimates that <b>approximately</b> 95,000 subscribers `` cut the cord '' in 2013 and 125,000 did so in 2014 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Data that has been breathlessly reported for the first half of 2015 by the news media <b>seems</b> to indicate cord cutting has accelerated , but recent published reports mostly failed to mention that pay TV subscriptions are quite `` lumpy '' and only a full four quarters of data will accurately measure the true scope of the growth in cord cutting this year .  (Uncertainty) </span>The 2013 and 2014 full-year data show losses of .00095% and .0125%, respectively, from a base of over 100 million U.S. pay-TV subscribers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Researchers also found that <b>approximately</b> half of the homes that switched to Broadband Only were still willing to pay for streaming video through services like Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , or Hulu . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This data places the size of the cord cutting problem thus far for Disney in its proper context and reveals some of the most recent media coverage to be borderline hysterical.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To be sure , cord cutting is a real phenomenon that requires attention from the company , but it is hardly the tidal wave of earnings destruction that some have <b>predicted</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Video Consumption Is Rising And Disney is In Demand Investors should remember that Disney's Media Networks Segment is a content generator and not a cable company.The content being generated by the Networks Segment is in strong demand even as consumers shift their video consumption habits.Demand for ESPN's live sports including NFL coverage and MNF, College Football, College Football Playoffs, and NBA games have never been higher despite concern over the shifting habits of consumer's video consumption.A 2014 Nielsen study of Q2 viewing habits from 2012-2014 showed that overall levels of video consumption have continued to grow.The growth in video consumption was measured across all age demographic groups, with the average American consuming over 4.5 hours of traditional TV per day.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The study found that 18-24-year olds were , as <b>predicted</b> , consuming a larger amount of video content on mobile devices , but traditional TV and DVR watching still composed the vast majority of video consumption in this youngest measured demographic .  (Uncertainty) </span>The 2014 study, as well as subsequent Nielsen research, confirms the trend of increasing mobile video consumption within the context of gradually rising overall consumption.In short, Americans of all age demographics are consuming more video content but there is a gradual shift to mobile video viewing that is still dwarfed by traditional TV/DVR.The overall trend of increased video consumption is an obvious positive for Disney's Media Networks business, while the gradual shift to mobile viewing requires continued innovation on the company's part to provide its product across all platforms.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors should take note that the company <b>seems</b> to be doing just that , finding innovative new ways of keeping its content accessible to consumers at strong pricing levels .  (Uncertainty) </span>Consider this week's Monday Night Football game (Week 3 of the 2015 season) on ESPN.The game drew a peak traditional TV audience of over 17 million viewers , beating last year's week 3 average viewers handily.But the bigger story is that the game increased viewers on both traditional TV and on the company's Watch ESPN mobile app.The Watch ESPN audience grew 65% year over year to a peak of over 600,000 viewers during the game.Admittedly this week 3 MNF data is an anecdote at best, and the relative popularity of the teams playing week 3 in 2014 vs 2015 played a major role in the viewer growth.It is still likely illustrative, however, of the company's ability to keep up with gradually shifting consumer preferences while maintaining revenue from viewers.Each consumer using the Watch ESPN app is a paying subscriber to one of the company's participating cable/satellite providers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is possible that most current analyses of the cord cutting phenomenon are based on the flawed fundamental <b>assumption</b> that cord cutting is equal to cost cutting for all consumers .  (Uncertainty) </span>The evidence from the actual behavior of cord cutters is that at least half of those who have cord cut thus far are consuming streaming media content through services such as Netflix, Hulu, or HBO Now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For this first wave of cord cutters it <b>may</b> very well be cost effective to ditch traditional pay TV for broadband internet coupled with a streaming service .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yet , based on the video consumption habits measured by the referenced Nielsen study above as well as other corroborating data , the majority of consumers <b>might</b> be near to break even with their monthly cost when considering the sliding scale of bundled versus non-bundled broadband access and the current and likely rising costs of streaming services .  (Uncertainty) </span>Consider the costs for an average household in New York where the most recent data show the typical 25 megabit per second connection costs the household $55.This figure is an average that includes households on promotional pricing and standard pricing from their provider.The average New York household has many options for video consumption if they choose only a broadband connection from their provider.If the household's members were comfortable with streaming from free services, only their costs would stop here and there would be an obvious cost savings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the family was comfortable with a single streaming service , such as Netflix or Hulu , their costs would rise to between $ 65 - $ 70 , <b>depending</b> on the service they chose and taxes assessed .  (Uncertainty) </span>The most recent video-viewing trends, however, indicate that a vast majority of U.S. households would not have their needs met with this combination as they would not have access to live programming (without a traditional antenna) and so they would need to opt for a more expensive "over the top" package such as Dish's (NASDAQ: DISH ) Sling TV that still would require a traditional antenna for local channels.This would raise the average household's cost to between $75-$80.If the household were to add just one premium streaming service, such as HBO Now, their costs with most over-the-top services would rise to $85-$90 per month.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To be sure , pricing varies greatly from market to market , but the gap between traditional pay TV and the broadband and streaming service alternatives are not nearly as great as many <b>believe</b> when factoring in the viewing habits of the typical U.S. household as measured by Nielson .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In summation , the viewer data show that U.S. households want live programming ( NFL , NBA ) , the ability to watch content on-demand , premium channel programming , and are willing to pay for digital rentals at a <b>surprisingly</b> high rate .  (Surprise) </span>The modest price differential between broadband/streaming and broadband/pay TV in the context of these typical consumer demands will likely limit the number of U.S. households that find it cost effective to become cord cutters.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>risk</b> posed by cord cutters to Disney 's Media Networks segment is very likely overblown by the market , creating an attractive entry point in the company for long-term investors .  (Uncertainty) </span>Disney's strong content, overall measured consumer viewers' behavior, and a narrowing gap between the broadband/streaming option and pay TV option that meets most consumers' needs very likely means cord cutting will not significantly damage Disney's Media Networks business.The company has proven adept so far at moving to meet the changing video demands of consumers while maintaining pricing that permits stable if modest long-term growth for the company's Media Networks Segment.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
