class='textDiv'>WalMart Going After The Heart Of The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Beast Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>going on the defensive in its most important business WalMart looking to grow its online business as it struggles at its physical stores The growing and very successful subscription service of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime has been doing well enough to attract the attention of its key retail competitor WalMart NYSE WMT which in June announced it would compete against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime with its own subscription service named Shipping Pass which will cost about half of per year Prime subscribers must pay For some time Ive known the key to Amazons current and future success will be the growth trajectory of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime The attack from WalMart confirms it has been making a lot of headway and presumably is not only taking enough business away from the struggling WalMart to cause the Bentonville company to take this type of action but shows it is considered a significant future threat as well On the other hand the quick response by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>founder and CEO Jeff Bezos to the attack on its flagship business also confirms he cant allow WalMart to take away market share If that were to happen I dont see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>having the ability to become profitable on a consistent basis That means this is going to be an entertaining but expensive battle now and in the future Early outlook for WalMarts Shipping Pass Although the first phase of Shipping Pass was launched in June it will take time for the company to completely roll it out That has given <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>time to formulate a response and it has Well get into that a little later Citing a survey from Prosper Insights CNBC said the response of the people asked about whether or not theyd acquired a membership from WalMart only percent said they were likely or very likely to sign up for Shipping Pass Working that out it suggests approximately million households would participate in the service That is in comparison to the estimated million subscribers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime has And it still has growth momentum for the service One bright spot to the survey was close to percent of respondents said they were millennials The other was those that were open to subscribing had incomes about percent above the usual WalMart shopper When the service is fully rolled out what will determine the depth of its attraction to consumers will be what else it adds to the service I think itll have to be more than competing on price alone Subscription service success in a variety of businesses depends upon the perception of value Thats what makes them attractive to users Being an expert on taking costs out of its products WalMart may have a slight advantage on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>there although that hasnt helped the company through the years as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continued and continues to perfects its business model One area that AMZN may be vulnerable in is when the next recession comes Shoppers have traditionally gravitated to WalMart when times get tough Even higherend shoppers ended up in the aisles of WalMart during the Great Recession That could happen again That is where consumers could abandon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime for what is perceived to be or in reality is a lessexpensive alternative Finally if consumers consider the ability to return an item to a physical store as highly valuable that is another area WMT would have an advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is of course at a strong advantage in this battle and will be for a long time assuming WalMart continues to push forward with this giving it time to scale to its potential Even though WMT is marketing Shipping Pass as a lowcost alternative to Prime it has a lot of obstacles to overcome before it is able to convince consumers to give it a try First is its brand which is very strong I felt that way when I first heard what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was going to call its subscription service Shipping Pass doesnt have that same feel to me as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime That said WalMart will have an uphill climb in its branding efforts to get this name positioned in the minds of consumers The most obvious perk of Prime membership is its video streaming service It generates reluctance to leave A number of analysts and commentators attempt to compare it with Netflix NASDAQ NFLX as if thats the company it is competing against Theyre wrong This is about lowering churn not competing directly in the streaming video market That doesnt mean <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt working at making it an excellent service Because it is What it means is the priority isnt to become the top video streaming company in the world The goal is to become the top digital retailer in the world Streaming video is a means to that end Since WalMart will have to come up with its own perks to attract and maintain subscribers and since its taking a page directly out of Amazons playbook itll be interesting to see if it includes a streaming service as part of the subscription price in a similar way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has Another feature that keeps consumers from abandoning Prime is its cloud photo storage service which allows for an unlimited number of photos to be saved there There is also the free twoday shipping feature which is very popular with subscribers In this regard from the introduction of Shipping Pass <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has WalMart beat as at this time it only offers free threeday shipping As mentioned about the threat that could come from the next recession <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have to continue to add value to Prime to the point itll be hard for consumers to leave it Battle for subscribers already underway It didnt take long for Bezos to respond to the new competition as he announced there will be a gigantic sales event on July which will be only available to members of Prime The strategy is to circumvent WalMarts new service by getting press coverage and further exposure of Prime to the general public The end result is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is using the new competitive environment to generate further interest and win new subscribers to the service That could also lower interest in WalMarts still relatively unknown Shipping Pass which could lower the interest in signing up for it WMT has responded to Prime Day with its own sales initiative where it has the marketing pitch it will include more deals than Black Friday Even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>got the first strike in WalMart is launching its sale the day after Amazons offering over discounts through its online channels Also to be more competitive WMT decided to change its initial free shipping offer from orders of to orders of To attract a large number of potential subscribers WalMart will offer the sale over a period of days I have no doubt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wont just sit there and let WalMart do that without further responses This has the potential to be a serious threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in light of the fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is the way it decided to move toward being sustainably profitable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has online sales of approximately times the billion WalMart has but that could change quickly if WalMart can do this right As already mentioned the big challenge will be when the next recession comes as consumers are socialized into gravitating toward WalMart to stretch their dollars during tough economic times With its added value at this time and under these economic conditions I would be surprised to see AMZNs subscriber base abandon Prime and try out WalMart instead How WMT adds value going forward is a key to the competitive level it decides to compete at There is also the added costs of adding value that must be considered and as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already found out it had to boost its Prime subscription fee in order to cover rising shipping costs WalMart will eventually be faced with similar challenges What remains to be seen is if the online retail subscription market grows from all of this or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and WalMart fight over mostly the same consumers It appears there are many millions of consumers to compete over that arent part of Prime at this time and it will force a powerful response from both companies in order to attract them The cost to do so is what is of concern to me for both companies and that is already going to put pressure on margin based upon the decisions of both to offer major discounts in the early stages of the battle On WalMarts part the company knows this is the future of retail and as younger people age the existing customer base that prefers to shop at the physical store will shrink which means it must find a way to get ahead of that before it crushes the company For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>this is really the first time since it become the online retail market leader that it faced this level of threat from a company large enough to do some serious damage It has put it on the defensive in the segment of the company that is being counted on to generate consistent earnings How it responds will dictate the future of the company I believe Prime is that critical to it at this point in time Source WalMart Going After The
