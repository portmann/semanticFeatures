( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> going on the defensive in its most important business . Wal-Mart looking to grow its online business as it struggles at its physical stores.The growing and very successful subscription service of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) - <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime - has been doing well enough to attract the attention of its key retail competitor - Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) - which in June announced it would compete against <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime with its own subscription service named `` Shipping Pass , '' which will cost about half of $ 99 per year Prime subscribers must pay . For some time I 've known the key to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current and future success will be the growth trajectory of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The attack from Wal-Mart confirms it has been making a lot of headway , and <b>presumably</b> is not only taking enough business away from the struggling Wal-Mart to cause the Bentonville company to take this type of action , but shows it is considered a significant future threat as well .  (Uncertainty) </span>On the other hand , the quick response by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> founder and CEO Jeff Bezos to the attack on its flagship business also confirms he ca n't allow Wal-Mart to take away market share . If that were to happen , I do n't see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> having the ability to become profitable on a consistent basis . That means this is going to be an entertaining but expensive battle now and in the future.Early outlook for Wal-Mart's Shipping Pass Although the first phase of Shipping Pass was launched in June, it will take time for the company to completely roll it out.That has given <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> time to formulate a response , and it has . We'll get into that a little later.Citing a survey from Prosper Insights, CNBC said the response of the 6,000 people asked about whether or not they'd acquired a membership from Wal-Mart, only 12.4 percent said they "were 'likely' or 'very likely' to sign up for Shipping Pass."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Working that out , it suggests <b>approximately</b> 18 million households would participate in the service .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is in comparison to the estimated 40 million subscribers <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime has . And it still has growth momentum for the service.One bright spot to the survey was close to 50 percent of respondents said they were millennials.The other was those that were open to subscribing had incomes about 5 percent above the usual Wal-Mart shopper.When the service is fully rolled out, what will determine the depth of its attraction to consumers will be what else it adds to the service.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think it 'll have to be <i>more</i> than competing on price alone .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Subscription service success in a variety of businesses <b>depends</b> upon the perception of value .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's what makes them attractive to users.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Being an expert on taking costs out of its products , Wal-Mart <b>may</b> have a slight advantage on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> there , although that has n't helped the company through the years , as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continued and continues to perfects its business model . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One area that AMZN <b>may</b> be vulnerable in is when the next recession comes .  (Uncertainty) </span>Shoppers have traditionally gravitated to Wal-Mart when times get tough.Even higher-end shoppers ended up in the aisles of Wal-Mart during the Great Recession.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> happen again .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is where consumers <b>could</b> abandon <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime for what is perceived to be , or in reality is , a less-expensive alternative . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Finally , if consumers consider the ability to return an item to a physical store as highly valuable , that is another area WMT would have an advantage .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is of course at a strong advantage in this battle , and will be for a long time - <b>assuming</b> Wal-Mart continues to push forward with this ; giving it time to scale to its potential . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Even though WMT is marketing Shipping Pass as a low-cost alternative to Prime, it has a lot of obstacles to overcome before it is able to convince consumers to give it a try.First is its brand, which is very strong.I felt that way when I first heard what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was going to call its subscription service . Shipping Pass does n't have that same feel to me as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . That said, Wal-Mart will have an uphill climb in its branding efforts to get this name positioned in the minds of consumers.The most obvious perk of Prime membership is its video streaming service.It generates reluctance to leave.A number of analysts and commentators attempt to compare it with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), as if that's the company it is competing against.They're wrong.This is about lowering churn, not competing directly in the streaming video market.That does n't mean <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is n't working at making it an excellent service . Because it is.What it means is the priority isn't to become the top video streaming company in the world.The goal is to become the top digital retailer in the world.Streaming video is a means to that end.Since Wal-Mart will have to come up with its own perks to attract and maintain subscribers , and since it 's taking a page directly out of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's playbook , it 'll be interesting to see if it includes a streaming service as part of the subscription price , in a similar way <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has . Another feature that keeps consumers from abandoning Prime is its cloud photo storage service, which allows for an unlimited number of photos to be saved there.There is also the free two-day shipping feature which is very popular with subscribers.In this regard from the introduction of Shipping Pass , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has Wal-Mart beat , as at this time it only offers free three-day shipping . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As mentioned about the threat that <b>could</b> come from the next recession , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will have to continue to add value to Prime to the point it 'll be hard for consumers to leave it . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Battle for subscribers already underway It didn't take long for Bezos to respond to the new competition, as he announced there will be a gigantic sales event on July 15 which will be only available to members of Prime.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The strategy is to circumvent Wal-Mart 's new service by getting press coverage and further <b>exposure</b> of Prime to the general public .  (Uncertainty) </span>The end result is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is using the new competitive environment to generate further interest and win new subscribers to the service . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> also lower interest in Wal-Mart 's still relatively unknown Shipping Pass , which <b>could</b> lower the interest in signing up for it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>WMT has responded to `` Prime Day '' with its own sales initiative , where it has the marketing pitch it will include '' `` <i>more</i> deals than Black Friday . ''  (Surprise) </span>Even though <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> got the first strike in , Wal-Mart is launching its sale the day after <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's , offering over 2,000 discounts through its online channels . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Also , to be <i>more</i> competitive , WMT decided to change its initial free shipping offer from orders of $ 50 to orders of $ 35 .  (Surprise) </span>To attract a large number of potential subscribers, Wal-Mart will offer the sale over a period of 90 days.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I have no <b>doubt</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wo n't just sit there and let Wal-Mart do that without further responses . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This has the potential to be a serious threat to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , in light of the fact <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is the way it decided to move toward being sustainably profitable . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has online sales of approximately 6 times the $ 12.2 billion Wal-Mart has , but that <b>could</b> change quickly if Wal-Mart can do this right . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As already mentioned, the big challenge will be when the next recession comes, as consumers are socialized into gravitating toward Wal-Mart to stretch their dollars during tough economic times.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With its added value at this time and under these economic conditions , I would be <b>surprised</b> to see AMZN 's subscriber base abandon Prime and try out Wal-Mart instead .  (Surprise) </span>How WMT adds value going forward is a key to the competitive level it decides to compete at.There is also the added costs of adding value that must be considered , and as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already found out , it had to boost its Prime subscription fee in order to cover rising shipping costs . Wal-Mart will eventually be faced with similar challenges.What remains to be seen is if the online retail subscription market grows from all of this , or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Wal-Mart fight over mostly the same consumers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>appears</b> there are many millions of consumers to compete over that are n't part of Prime at this time , and it will force a powerful response from both companies in order to attract them .  (Uncertainty) </span>The cost to do so is what is of concern to me for both companies, and that is already going to put pressure on margin, based upon the decisions of both to offer major discounts in the early stages of the battle.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On Wal-Mart 's part , the company knows this is the future of retail , and as <i>younger</i> people age , the existing customer base that prefers to shop at the physical store will shrink , which means it must find a way to get ahead of that before it crushes the company .  (Surprise) </span>For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , this is really the first time since it become the online retail market leader that it faced this level of threat from a company large enough to do some serious damage . It has put it on the defensive in the segment of the company that is being counted on to generate consistent earnings.How it responds will dictate the future of the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> Prime is that critical to it at this point in time .
