private label food business Baxter International is worth owning Stocks discussed on the indepth session of Jim Cramers Mad Money Program Tuesday May Oil and Fed are controlling the markets said Cramer If both bump into one another then the results could be daunting With the rising CPI number and higher oil prices the Fed will be compelled to raise the rates If that is the case there is more downside ahead even as I think you could make a very convincing argument that the inflation we have right now cant be curbed by higher rates he added Cramer prays that Fed chair Janet Yellen will see that she cannot stop inflation Suddenly the increased price at the pump has moved the needle to the point where the CPI simply cant be ignored by the Fed he said Oil price is a crucial factor while determining the rate hike Inflation is about the bigger picture Housing and healthcare costs impact inflation but cannot be controlled by the Fed Higher rates would be bad for oil producers since their debt demand will lead to bankruptcies In other words higher rates wont stop this kind of inflation If anything a rate hike right now could make inflation worse added Cramer Just one higher than expected CPI number cannot change the Feds outlook but it definitely got investors worried and stocks like Clorox NYSE CLX were hit even despite good earnings It yields which will be useless if bond rates go up In volatile times almost all sectors have been affected One group that has managed to dodge the volatility are the pet care stocks Americans spend money to keep their pets healthy and they will continue to do so even when the economy is not good That is why Cramer looked at the charts of stocks in the pet care group with the help of technician Bob Lang He reviewed Petmed Express NASDAQ PETS Blue Buffalo Pet Products NASDAQ BUFF VCA NASDAQ WOOF Freshpet NASDAQ FRPT Zoetis NYSE ZTS and IDEXX NASDAQ IDXX Laboratories Petmed Express is Americas largest petcentric pharmacy The charts show that recent breakout on strong volume is bullish for the stock The stock is consolidating and is ready to move higher Buffalo Blue is the high end maker of pet food The stock has found a bottom after going public last year during the sell off Lang is seeing signals that money managers are buying the stock which could take the stock back to the alltime high of VCA is a chain of animal hospitals The stock has been rallying for months and is considered a good buy in Langs opinion once it pulls back to its day moving average Freshpet is the maker of highend refrigerated pet food The Chaikin money flow oscillator is positive and the stock has high volume as well It is worth buying the stock for speculation in Langs opinion IDEXX Laboratories is a veterinary diagnostics play The Chaikin money flow shows money is flowing into the stock The daily chart has shown improvements since February and the RSI is also strong Cramer likes the fundamentals of the company as well Zoetis is the animal health company spun off by Pfizer We learned that noted hedge fund manager Bill Ackman reduced his stake in Zoetis last week and while the stock got hit on the news I wouldnt read too much into it said Cramer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN moves into private label market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has announced that it will launch new lineups of private label food and consumer products Just like supermarkets have private brands <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will too The stock of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did not move much on the news since the private label food market is still very small However TreeHouse Foods NYSE THS went up by on the speculation that it could partner with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>TreeHouse gave back all of those gains today but I think this is an intriguing story and you are now getting a great entry point said Cramer The company specializes in making privatelabel products for supermarkets with a focus on soups sauces pudding health and wellness foods and healthy snacks among others <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has consulted with TreeHouse in anticipation of private labels according to the WSJ While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been releasing its own private labels in various products it will be a first for them entering into foods which will be offered to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime customers Frankly I dont see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has much choice because just as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the king of online retail TreeHouse is the king of privatelabel food said Cramer After being spunoff TreeHouse has grown through a series of acquisitions and great management They are the largest privatelabel food and beverage maker in the US Considering that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a new entry with limited experience where TreeHouse is an expert they can get a piece of Amazons business Even if they dont get Amazons business I think the stock is a buy said Cramer Baxter International is the maker of medical supplies that spun off its pharmaceutical business as Baxalta approximately months ago something that Cramer always recommended As investors prefer pure plays Baxalta working independently was a logical choice for Baxter The breakup led to huge gains for both stocks If you ever wanted proof that breaking up is both easy to do and incredibly lucrative that Baxalta spinoff was the ultimate in nearly instant value creation said Cramer Baxalta is off the books of Baxter but it still holds stake in the company Baxters stock is up for the year already There is lot of political drama surrounding healthcare and hence all the money managers have started buying Baxter which is stable and scandal free The company is innovating and introducing products this year following on from last year Their cost cutting measures and expanding gross margins make the stock worth owning American Airlines NASDAQ AAL It is undervalued and Delta NYSE DAL cutting capacity is good for the stock Wait for good quarters before buying it Lam Research NASDAQ LRCX Cramer thinks the deal will go through but the market is worried about the Fed blocking deals Mondelez NASDAQ MDLZ The stock can come down amidst the selloff After that its worth buying as they had a great quarter Jim Cramers
