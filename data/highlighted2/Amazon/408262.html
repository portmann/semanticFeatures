(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One group that has managed to dodge the <b>volatility</b> are the pet care stocks .  (Uncertainty) </span>Americans spend money to keep their pets healthy and they will continue to do so even when the economy is not good.That is why Cramer looked at the charts of stocks in the pet care group with the help of technician Bob Lang.He reviewed Petmed Express (NASDAQ: PETS ), Blue Buffalo Pet Products (NASDAQ: BUFF ), VCA (NASDAQ: WOOF ), Freshpet (NASDAQ: FRPT ), Zoetis (NYSE: ZTS ) and IDEXX (NASDAQ: IDXX ) Laboratories Petmed Express is America's largest pet-centric pharmacy.The charts show that recent breakout on strong volume is bullish for the stock.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The stock is consolidating and is ready to move <i>higher</i> .

(Uncertainty) </span>IDEXX Laboratories is a veterinary diagnostics play.The Chaikin money flow shows money is flowing into the stock.The daily chart has shown improvements since February and the RSI is also strong.Cramer likes the fundamentals of the company as well.Zoetis is the animal health company spun off by Pfizer."We learned that noted hedge fund manager Bill Ackman reduced his stake in Zoetis last week, and while the stock got hit on the news, I wouldn't read too much into it," said Cramer.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) moves into private label market <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has announced that it will launch new lineups of private label food and consumer products . Just like supermarkets have private brands , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will too . The stock of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did not move much on the news since the private label food market is still very small . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , TreeHouse Foods ( NYSE : THS ) went up by 2 % on the speculation that it <b>could</b> partner with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>"TreeHouse gave back all of those gains today, but I think this is an intriguing story, and you are now getting a great entry point," said Cramer.The company specializes in making private-label products for supermarkets with a focus on soups, sauces, pudding, health and wellness foods and healthy snacks, among others.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has consulted with TreeHouse in <b>anticipation</b> of private labels , according to the WSJ .

After being spun-off, TreeHouse has grown through a series of acquisitions and great management.They are the largest private-label food and beverage maker in the U.S. Considering that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a new entry with limited experience where TreeHouse is an expert , they can get a piece of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business . `` Even if they do n't get <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business , I think the stock is a buy , '' said Cramer . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Baxter International is the maker of medical supplies that spun off its pharmaceutical business as Baxalta <b>approximately</b> 10 months ago , something that Cramer always recommended .  (Uncertainty) </span>As investors prefer pure plays, Baxalta working independently was a logical choice for Baxter.The breakup led to huge gains for both stocks.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` If you ever wanted proof that breaking up is both easy to do and incredibly lucrative , that Baxalta spinoff was the ultimate in <b>nearly</b> instant value creation , '' said Cramer .
