Despite its earlier success in selling the iPhone, the more sustainable aspect of AAPL's revenue stream (ie.software and services) is unlikely to gain much traction.For example, iTunes faces strong competition from BIDU, Tencent and BABA.The app store faces competition from Qihoo (NYSE: QIHU ), BIDU and Wandoujia.Other media services face competition from Youku (NYSE: YOKU ), LeTV and iQiyi.With incumbents already deeply entrenched in their respective verticals, AAPL cannot simply leverage its ecosystem (which remains a small portion of the total smartphone user base) to drive penetration.The challenge that AAPL faces in mobile payment is no different from those it faces in music, video and apps.China's mobile payment market is much more advanced than that in North America thanks to the innovations by BABA, Tencent and BIDU.According to the banks, Q3 mobile payments generated over Rmb4.54b in transactions, totaling Rmb18.2trillion, up 350% and more than double that of the prior year.However, this market is dominated by BABA's Alipay and Tencent's WePay which together control 80% of the market.On the other hand, BIDU Wallet is quickly gaining traction as it drives O2O sales.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AAPL Pay 's entry into China via a partnership with Unionpay <b>appears</b> to be sound initially given Unionpay oversees all credit card transactions in China .  (Uncertainty) </span>But I have cautioned before that Unionpay has been looking to develop its own mobile payment app which makes it a direct competitor to AAPL.Last week's announcement clearly showed that cracking China's mobile payment market will not be an easy task for AAPL.Unionpay's Quick Pass is based on the NFC standard and does not require an app or wireless connectivity.Setting up the platform takes less than 30 seconds and payment takes two seconds.Given that all Chinese consumers use Unionpay, gaining penetration should not be an issue for Unionpay given that users would want to keep a consistent platform.More important, Quick Pay is supported by more than 20 banks across China and this is an important distribution channel that AAPL does not have.For example, bank employees can educate consumers on the convenience behind Quick Pay to drive penetration, where as it will be much more difficult for AAPL retail store employees to achieve similar scale.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Quick Pay is currently only on Android devices , Unionpay is expected to launch an iOS version , which further places AAPL at a disadvantage and complicates the relationship in that AAPL is ultimately at the mercy of Unionpay , which <b>could</b> ask for 0 % commission on mobile transaction payments as part of its partnership agreement .  (Uncertainty) </span>Conclusion, AAPL's ecosystem in China is growing and it's evident from the challenges it faces in iTunes, apps and now payment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I remain <b>cautious</b> on AAPL in China and reiterate my preference for the incumbents , namely BABA and Tencent .
