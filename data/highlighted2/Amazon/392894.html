(Uncertainty) </span>The resulting numbers speak for themselves.A $5.4 billion quarter, with $1.5 billion falling to the net income line.Free cash flow came in at $1.85 billion, and there is $20.62 billion of cash on hand.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fivethirtyeight.com this week did an experiment , based on a silly column by Politico co-founder Jim Vandehei , testing how Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump <b>might</b> do in an election against Mark Zuckerberg .  (Uncertainty) </span>Zuck crushed .(At 31, he's ineligible this year.)First, where does Facebook go from here?How much more can it increase its audience, or engagement?There are only so many phones, and so much time.And can it really increase those margins?There are things it can do.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Different ad formats , <b>different</b> file formats , Oculus Rift .  (Uncertainty) </span>But on an $22 billion run rate, these improvements are going to be incremental, on the top or bottom line.Facebook is what it is, and what it is going to be.Not that there is anything wrong with that, Google is a nice little business too.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook has the cash to buy any powerful mobile app that <b>may</b> emerge , but how many more Whatsapps are there ?

(Uncertainty) </span>Google had search, Apple had mobile devices, Facebook has mobile apps.A bureaucracy is already developing in the company, by necessity, aimed at maintaining what the company has.The market has a hint of this.Otherwise the stock's gains this week would have been more than $10/share.But it deserves to be said, just as the jester in the Middle Ages said to the King.Eventually you, too, will die.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And given what has happened to Apple lately , that <b>may</b> happen sooner rather than later .  (Uncertainty) </span>Clouds, devices, and mobile apps mean everyone can now hold a supercomputer in their hands, attached to the most powerful processing systems ever devised, and to networks of infinite storage.Change is going to accelerate.Tomorrow is going to come very, very quickly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Somewhere out there is a kid who is going to challenge , <b>maybe</b> even beat Zuckerberg , in a fair business fight .
