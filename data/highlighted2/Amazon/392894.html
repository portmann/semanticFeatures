(Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Earnings slammed estimates , which I <b>anticipated</b> early in the month , and sent the stock soaring to $ 120/share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That means it is now worth $ 342 billion , <i>more</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , only $ 50 billion <i>less</i> than Google , and just $ 150 billion <i>less</i> than Apple . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Its mobile apps , especially Whatsapp 's Messenger , possibly the greatest tech purchase of all time , mean the company now has 1.65 billion users , <i>more</i> than half mobile-only , many of whom spend <b>nearly</b> all their free time inside its software .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The resulting numbers speak for themselves.A $5.4 billion quarter, with $1.5 billion falling to the net income line.Free cash flow came in at $1.85 billion, and there is $20.62 billion of cash on hand.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fivethirtyeight.com this week did an experiment , based on a silly column by Politico co-founder Jim Vandehei , testing how Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump <b>might</b> do in an election against Mark Zuckerberg .  (Uncertainty) </span>Zuck crushed .(At 31, he's ineligible this year.)First, where does Facebook go from here?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>How much <i>more</i> can it increase its audience , or engagement ?  (Surprise) </span>There are only so many phones, and so much time.And can it really increase those margins?There are things it can do.Different ad formats, different file formats, Oculus Rift.But on an $22 billion run rate, these improvements are going to be incremental, on the top or bottom line.Facebook is what it is, and what it is going to be.Not that there is anything wrong with that, Google is a nice little business too.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Facebook has the cash to buy any powerful mobile app that <b>may</b> emerge , but how many <i>more</i> Whatsapps are there ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Second , there is going to be another tech revolution , <b>maybe</b> right around the corner , and odds are Facebook wo n't lead it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's playing in bots , it <b>might</b> try the Internet of Things , but history says even the best company has one magic trick .  (Uncertainty) </span>Google had search, Apple had mobile devices, Facebook has mobile apps.A bureaucracy is already developing in the company, by necessity, aimed at maintaining what the company has.The market has a hint of this.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Otherwise the stock 's gains this week would have been <i>more</i> than $ 10/share .  (Surprise) </span>But it deserves to be said, just as the jester in the Middle Ages said to the King.Eventually you, too, will die.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And given what has happened to Apple lately , that <b>may</b> happen <i>sooner</i> rather than later .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Clouds, devices, and mobile apps mean everyone can now hold a supercomputer in their hands, attached to the most powerful processing systems ever devised, and to networks of infinite storage.Change is going to accelerate.Tomorrow is going to come very, very quickly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Somewhere out there is a kid who is going to challenge , <b>maybe</b> even beat Zuckerberg , in a fair business fight .  (Uncertainty) </span>While we're cheering Facebook's moment, we need to remember that.Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Internet Information Providers</div></body></html>
