class='textDiv'>Exclusive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>expanding deliveries by its ondemand drivers Reuters SAN FRANCISCO Amazoncom Inc AMZNO is quietly inviting drivers for its new ondemand delivery service to handle its standard packages as the online retailer known for low prices and razorthin profit margins looks to speed up delivery times and tamp down its growing multibillion dollar logistics bill The move which has not been announced publicly is the latest sign that the worlds biggest ecommerce company wants to control more of its own deliveries Media reports have said the company plans to lease its own fleet of jets and CEO Jeff Bezos eventually wants to use drones to get packages to customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>outlined details of its latest plan over the last few weeks in an email to contract drivers who deliver parcels for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex a program launched last year to handle speedy deliveries of common household goods to customers using Prime Now a mobile app that comes with Amazons popular ayear Prime membership They are not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>employees If the gambit works industry analysts said it could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>contain its shipping costs which grew more than percent to billion last year It might also create a logistics network to compete with United Parcel Service Inc UPSN FedEx Corp FDXN and the patchwork of local carriers which currently deliver <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>packages An <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>spokeswoman confirmed on Wednesday that Flex drivers in Texas are already delivering Amazoncom packages and not just Prime Now orders The Seattlebased company did not go into details of its plans but said it will explore new ways to provide customers with faster service and delivery partners with more opportunities In a recent earnings call an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>executive said the company was not trying to replace partner carriers but rather find ways to handle more of its own deliveries at peak times <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex works like ondemand ridehailing service Uber Drivers use the app to sign up for shifts to pick up packages at small warehouses near metropolitan areas as opposed to Amazons massive fulfillment centers and deliver them to customers doors The program is now available in cities including Seattle Las Vegas Phoenix and Dallas Three Flex drivers in northern Texas told Reuters they received an email in recent weeks from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>inviting them to take part in a new opportunity to deliver Amazoncom orders separate from existing Prime Now deliveries That could be a huge difference for drivers Prime Now is a relatively niche service with tens of thousands of items a fraction of the more than million products on Amazons main ecommerce site This new stream of packages will create new delivery opportunities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wrote in the email to drivers which was reviewed by Reuters The expansion appears to be limited so far to select drivers in the DallasFort Worth area In order to qualify <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>said drivers must have a fourdoor car that is a midsized sedan or larger and that drivers would be paid an introductory rate of per hour They can schedule shifts between am and pm seven days a week Flex drivers can make between to per hour according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>They have less control over their schedule but can receive tips which is not the case for delivering regular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>packages As contractors drivers must pay for their own insurance and gas A Texasbased driver who attended an orientation session for the program and requested anonymity because he was worried about affecting his status as a driver was told by an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>representative he would need to drive to a larger fulfillment center to pick up boxes for delivery Amazons email said drivers who sign up for the new program would not initially be able to continue delivering for Prime Now but would be allowed to deliver both types of packages later this year Routing more deliveries through its own network of contract drivers would give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>more control over its supply chain and cut costs The last mile portion of delivery the final and usually most expensive stretch of a packages journey from a retailers warehouse to a customers front door has become increasingly important as shoppers expect cheaper and faster delivery The move could be especially costeffective in outoftheway areas where smaller regional couriers deliver parcels to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers Such couriers charge an average percent of the total shipping cost said Rob Howard chief executive of Grand Junction a San Franciscobased logistics technology company This is a huge competitive advantage for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>said Howard Its not a death sentence yet for local carriers but its a new path Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency providing investing
