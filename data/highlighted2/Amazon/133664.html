industry is in a period of high growth and is projected to continue On May th Orbitz NYSE OWW shareholders approved a billion takeover by Expedia NASDAQ EXPE The proposed merger between the two companies would combine two of the largest players in the online travel industry The online travel industry is in a period of high growth In online travel sales were estimated to be growing annually Many expect doubledigit growth to continue as online travel sales are estimated to only make up of the global travel industry It is estimated that Expedia and main competitor Priceline NASDAQ PCLN have about of the global online travel agency each with Orbitz behind at After these companies the online travel booking market is highly fragmented and competitive The online travel market is essentially turning into a battle of acquisitions between Expedia and Priceline Over the past three years alone Expedia has acquired majority stakes or full control of Trivago Auto Escape Wotif and Travelocity Including the impending acquisition of Orbitz Expedia has chosen to expand their business by building an ecosystem of valuable brands through acquisitions Priceline has also aggressively pursued acquisitions including Kayakcom OpenTable and Bookingcom There is a key strategic difference between the two companies Expedias acquisitions are related mostly to booking services while Pricelines acquisitions target more peripheral travel services such as metasearch Kayak and restaurant reservation booking OpenTable Essentially Expedia is trying to capture the booking market while Priceline is trying to grow in the peripheries of the travel industry In the near term both strategies are valid as the online travel agent industry continues to mature While Expedia is currently competing with Priceline other major players are looking to enter into the online travel industry Earlier this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN launched <span

being said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does have some competitive advantages over Expedia Most notably is the size of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ecosystem which consists of million active users Assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is able to build a functional product <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Destinations could pull active <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>users who use Expedia back to their own ecosystem for travel related purchases Another advantage for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is its commission structure Reportedly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is charging commission to hotels compared to the industry standard of This provides a financial incentive for hotels to partner with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as opposed to Expedia or Priceline Despite the incredibly competitive market we see upside in Expedia We believe the merger with Orbitz will add strategic value to the company and we value a postacquisition Expedia stock at per share Our model for EXPE assuming the acquisition is approved in the back half of this year and effects are realized in FY can be seen below Using our forecasted EPS a perpetuity rate and a CAPM discount rate we arrive at a fair value for EXPE of per share We thus believe that approval of the Orbtiz acquisition adds roughly per share of value to EXPE Source Expedia Orbitz Acquisition Could Add Per Share Disclosure
