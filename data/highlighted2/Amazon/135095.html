class='textDiv'>Are Amazons Profits Short Lived Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha The company communicates that it wants to improve its ROIC which requires more efficiency with capex ramp and opex Therefore shareholders may finally get what theyre wishing for a strong combination of sales and earnings growth Given the path toward sustainable fundamentals I have become more optimistic on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and continue to reiterate my positive stance on the stock Im still a pretty huge fan of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN following the announcement of Q earnings I guess what really surprised everyone was the revenue growth and profit ramp Typically you would imagine that revenue would come as a result of sacrificing profits but not so in this specific quarter Im not going to mention the headline figures or try to regurgitate much of the financial numbers because by now everyone probably understands that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had a pretty solid beat and that investors are now anticipating the company to report substantial bottom line improvements However weve seen cases where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt provide much financial guidance and analysts went ahead and upped their EPS estimates A couple quarters later <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported an operational loss and touted their various nonGAAP measures as if anyone cares or believes in them However were finally reaching that silver lining in the sky where the company is going to reposition for both profitability and revenue growth The hope in Amazons management may be justified as recent comments by Brian T Olsavsky CFO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>indicate profitability will be prioritized Well heres how I think about it We have two things at least two things going on We are continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we are in but we are also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us particularly in Marketplace Prime and AWS If you saw our shareholder letter this year I think Jeff Bezos put it really well He said were going to look for things that are important to customers customers love them businesses that can grow to be a large size that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades So we will continue to invest in the businesses we think fit that profile and were always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that profile So as far as lumpiness admittedly it is lumpy and we will continue to work on both those tracks going forward The only way to generate a high return on invested capital is to reduce the capex run rate in comparison to the growth rate in revenue and simultaneously improve operating metrics This way the net operating profit is bigger than the total invested capital over time This implies that the company does plan to improve their GAAP profitability which is pretty much what investors have been praying for all along It just so happens that Amazons growth in emerging markets happens to be pretty robust and the more mature US market is starting to be optimized for profitability Whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>becomes really aggressive in India or China depends heavily on the regulatory environment and whether they can generate demand for their goods and services Deep down though Im pretty confident <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going to focus on retail first cloud second and online video streaming third The other businesses are kind of like side projects which are sort of similar to Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL tendency of launching a variety of applications but with very minimal commitment The stock responded in a huge way following the earnings announcement I think its safe to own the stock as it will likely ride an uptrend The core business is still generating pretty healthy growth rates and theres a lot of flexibility when it comes to boosting margins To conclude profitability will continue to rampup The company will generate much more efficiency with its capex which is partially attributable to more automation and leaner inventory management Furthermore various other expense categories will likely gain a scale advantage which will result in further productivity For those reasons Im more confident in the fundamentals of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>going forward and I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation Source Are Amazons Profits Short Lived Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
