( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha The company communicates that it wants to improve its ROIC , which requires <i>more</i> efficiency with capex ramp and opex . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , shareholders <b>may</b> finally get what they 're wishing for - a strong combination of sales and earnings growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Given the path toward sustainable fundamentals , I have become <i>more</i> <b>optimistic</b> on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and continue to reiterate my positive stance on the stock . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'm still a pretty huge fan of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) following the announcement of Q2 earnings , I guess what really <b>surprised</b> everyone was the revenue growth and profit ramp . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Typically you would imagine that revenue would come as a result of sacrificing profits, but not so in this specific quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm not going to mention the headline figures or try to regurgitate much of the financial numbers because by now everyone probably understands that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> had a pretty solid beat , and that investors are now <b>anticipating</b> the company to report substantial bottom line improvements . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However , we 've seen cases where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't provide much financial guidance and analysts went ahead and upped their EPS estimates . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A couple quarters later , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reported an operational loss and touted their various non-GAAP measures as if anyone cares or <b>believes</b> in them . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However, we're finally reaching that silver lining in the sky where the company is going to reposition for both profitability and revenue growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The hope in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's management <b>may</b> be justified as recent comments by Brian T. Olsavsky ( CFO of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) indicate profitability will be prioritized : Well here 's how I think about it . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>We have two things, at least two things going on.We are continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we are in, but we are also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace Prime and AWS.If you saw our shareholder letter this year, I think Jeff Bezos put it really well.He said we're going to look for things that are important to customers, customers love them, businesses that can grow to be a large size that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades.So we will continue to invest in the businesses we think fit that profile and we're always looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that profile.So as far as lumpiness, admittedly it is lumpy and we will continue to work on both those tracks going forward.The only way to generate a high return on invested capital is to reduce the capex run rate in comparison to the growth rate in revenue and simultaneously improve operating metrics.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This way the net operating profit is <i>bigger</i> than the total invested capital over time .  (Surprise) </span>This implies that the company does plan to improve their GAAP profitability, which is pretty much what investors have been praying for all along.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It just so happens that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth in emerging markets happens to be pretty robust and the <i>more</i> mature US market is starting to be <b>optimized</b> for profitability . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whether <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> becomes really aggressive in India or China <b>depends</b> heavily on the regulatory environment and whether they can generate demand for their goods and services . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Deep down though , I 'm pretty <b>confident</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going to focus on retail first , cloud second and online video streaming third . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other businesses are kind of like side projects , which are sort of similar to Google 's ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) tendency of launching a <b>variety</b> of applications , but with very minimal commitment .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock responded in a huge way following the earnings announcement.I think it's safe to own the stock, as it will likely ride an up-trend.The core business is still generating pretty healthy growth rates, and there's a lot of flexibility when it comes to boosting margins.To conclude, profitability will continue to ramp-up.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company will generate much <i>more</i> efficiency with its capex , which is partially attributable to <i>more</i> automation and <i>leaner</i> inventory management .  (Surprise) </span>Furthermore various other expense categories will likely gain a scale advantage, which will result in further productivity.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For those reasons I 'm <i>more</i> <b>confident</b> in the fundamentals of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> going forward , and I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation .
