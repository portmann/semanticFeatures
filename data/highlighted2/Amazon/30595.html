( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha In December of last year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) announced Prime Air , the company 's plan to deliver future packages by drone ( `` UAV '' ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>While the media and others mocked this announcement, UAV delivery is likely to disrupt traditional package delivery significantly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the FAA gives <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> clearance for commercial rollout of its drone delivery service , the price that a consumer would pay for the delivery of a five-pound package <b>could</b> be as low as $ 1.1 Just as impressive , delivery times <b>could</b> drop below thirty minutes . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As shown below , Federal Express ( NYSE : FDX ) and United Parcel Service ( NYSE : UPS ) cost 8-13 times <i>more</i> for much <i>longer</i> delivery times for a small package .2 Consumers will enjoy low cost and convenience , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stands to make considerable profit . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>At $ 1 per package , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's internal rate of return on its UAV investments should exceed 120 % . Because delivery of a five-pound package will cost $ 0.14,3 the margin will allow <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to break even after the first year . High return is achievable even with estimates for infrastructure, drone investment, and operating expenses, which are primarily labor driven.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We assume that human operators are responsible for drone landing and takeoff .4 However , depending upon the operating expenses of the program , it <b>may</b> make strategic sense for the company to effectively offer the program free to Prime members across all its major US metros .  (Uncertainty) </span>Before US drone delivery becomes a reality , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> faces significant regulatory hurdles . The FAA approves commercial use of drones on a case-by-case basis, and regulations are stringent.The agency recently granted <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> approval for drone testing , but the drones are not allowed to fly over public property , and must be in an operator 's line of sight at all times . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Until the rules change , US commercial rollout of Prime Air <b>seems</b> unlikely .  (Uncertainty) </span>Aside from regulatory hurdles , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> must address the safety and reliability of drones . A common criticism is that "see and avoid" technology needs significant improvement.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Newer</i> systems do have air traffic control and crash prevention technology .5 For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , cameras <b>could</b> be part of the solution allowing remote operators to control takeoffs and landings . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the FAA has been dragging its feet , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has taken advantage of <i>less</i> strict drone regulations abroad . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Prime Air development centers are located in the UK and Israel, and test flights have been conducted in Canada and India.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the FAA is too slow to relax US drone restrictions , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will initially launch Prime Air internationally . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that there are at least 400mm annual shipments from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to US customers that would be eligible for drone delivery . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The drones are relatively inexpensive so an investment of <i>less</i> than $ 100mm <b>could</b> prove sufficient for the cost of the drones and support infrastructure .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Combined with service , maintenance and fueling of the drones we believe that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would have to spend <b>roughly</b> $ 300mm annually to support the drone delivery program at full penetration . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>400 million packages delivered for $ 300 million in operating expenses and with a $ 100 million capital investment implies that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> earn a healthy return on capital pricing the service at $ 1 per delivery . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Pricing for FedEx , UPS , and USPS <b>assumes</b> a 5 lb .  (Uncertainty) </span>package delivered from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's HQ to an address 9 miles away in Bellevue , WA . Dimensions are 8-5/8?x 5-3/8?x 1-5/8.Rates shown are the quickest, cheapest ways to deliver the package using each vendor.Based on ARK original research.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assumptions</b> are described in footnote 1 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>assume</b> takeoff and landing of all drones is done manually for regulatory , safety and technical reasons .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would likely have to hire thousands of drone operators who would be tasked with remotely monitoring drone landings . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Prime Air were off the ground in the US , this <b>could</b> provide hundreds of millions of dollars in wages to US employees .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>assume</b> each operator would be responsible for <i>less</i> than a handful of drones .
