style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN announced Prime Air the companys plan to deliver future packages by drone UAV While the media and others mocked this announcement UAV delivery is likely to disrupt traditional package delivery significantly If the FAA gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>clearance for commercial rollout of its drone delivery service the price that a consumer would pay for the delivery of a fivepound package could be as low as Just as impressive delivery times could drop below thirty minutes As shown below Federal Express NYSE FDX and United Parcel Service NYSE UPS cost times more for much longer delivery times for a small package Consumers will enjoy low cost and convenience while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stands to make considerable profit At per package Amazons internal rate of return on its UAV investments should exceed Because delivery of a fivepound package will cost the margin will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to break even after the first year High return is achievable even with estimates for infrastructure drone investment and operating expenses which are primarily labor driven We assume that human operators are responsible for drone landing and takeoff However depending upon the operating expenses of the program it may make strategic sense for the company to effectively offer the program free to Prime members across all its major US metros Before US drone delivery becomes a reality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>faces significant regulatory hurdles The FAA approves commercial use of drones on a casebycase basis and regulations are stringent The agency recently granted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>approval for drone testing but the drones are not allowed to fly over public property and must be in an operators line of sight at all times Until the rules change US commercial rollout of Prime Air seems unlikely Aside from regulatory hurdles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must address the safety and reliability of drones A common criticism is that see and avoid technology needs significant improvement Newer systems do have air traffic control and crash prevention technology For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cameras could be part of the solution allowing remote operators to control takeoffs and landings While the FAA has been dragging its feet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has taken advantage of less strict drone regulations abroad Prime Air development centers are located in the UK and Israel and test flights have been conducted in Canada and India If the FAA is too slow to relax US drone restrictions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will initially launch Prime Air internationally We believe that there are at least mm annual shipments from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to US customers that would be eligible for drone delivery The drones are relatively inexpensive so an investment of less than mm could prove sufficient for the cost of the drones and support infrastructure Combined with service maintenance and fueling of the drones we believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would have to spend roughly mm annually to support the drone delivery program at full penetration million packages delivered for million in operating expenses and with a million capital investment implies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could earn a healthy return on capital pricing the service at per delivery Pricing for FedEx UPS and USPS assumes a lb package delivered from Amazons HQ to an address miles away in Bellevue WA Dimensions are x x Rates shown are the quickest cheapest ways to deliver the package using each vendor Based on ARK original research Assumptions are described in footnote We assume takeoff and landing of all drones is done manually for regulatory safety and technical reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would likely have to hire thousands of drone operators who would be tasked with remotely monitoring drone landings If Prime Air were off the ground in the US this could provide hundreds of millions of dollars in wages to US employees We assume each operator would be responsible for less than a handful of drones httpwwwcnetcomvideosintelshowsdronesthatsenseandavoidobstacles
