( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha The crazy-low $ 49.99 price tag of the new <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire Tablet 7 made it instantly successful . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Cheap Fire Tablets are gateways for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to get <i>more</i> subscribers and paying customers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The $ 49.99 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire Tablet is just slightly <i>slower</i> than the $ 399 iPad Mini 4 when it comes to browsing and video/music streaming . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>America still loves a good bargain deal.This adage is again confirmed by the overwhelming instant success of the $ 49.99 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Fire Android tablet . Due to the huge better-than-expected demand , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> notified its customers that the next shipping date for the Fire tablet will be on October 26 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The first batch of the Fire tablet <b>apparently</b> sold out during the first shipment date last September 30 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Buy 5 , Get 1 Free promotion also definitely contributed to the irresistible appeal of the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire tablet . I suspect that many Americans bought the six-pack deal for resale purposes.Since <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has no store here in the Philippines ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also does n't ship to the Philippines ) , enterprising Americans are tempting me to order one from them for $ 60.95 + $ 27.01 international shipping via eBay.ph . Buying this $50 tablet is a no-brainer winner idea .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even though the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire tablet only has 1GB of RAM and a quad-core 1.3 GHz MediaTek processor , hands-on tests showed it is only slightly <i>slower</i> than the $ 399 iPad Mini 4 when it comes to web browsing and streaming video playback . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Buying five and getting one free Fire tablets will only cost $250.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Six tablets that get access to 30-day Trial of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and free paid Android apps , is certainly a <i>better</i> idea than buying just one $ 399 iPad Mini 4 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The On Device Mayday Screen Sharing app of the $ 50 Fire Tablet is also a gateway to free tech support from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) charges money for its AppleCare service for iPad/iPhone owners.I reiterate that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is truly being ruthless in pushing out a $ 50 tablet . Customers in mature markets like America will buy millions of this product.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is to the great detriment of other Android tablet vendors , which <b>could</b> also eventually force them to quit the U.S. market .  (Uncertainty) </span>The good performance of the Fire tablet confirmed my suspicion that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> used a high-quality processor/CPU to keep it competitive with the iPad and any other more-expensive Android tablets . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>School districts and government agencies unable to finance bulk purchases of the iPad or the Samsung ( OTC : SSNLF ) Tab , will <b>probably</b> instead go for the super cheap <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire tablet . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The parents of the K-12 students who get to own a $ 50 Fire tablet will likely become online shoppers at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and/or customers of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and Prime Video . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a compelling need to sell hardware at a loss to continue its strategy of getting <i>more</i> people to become repeat customers of its online store and media streaming subscription services . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It is a classic Bezos tactic to give away almost-free gadgets as a bait to hook the many fishes that are still not captured customers of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Tablets are perfect for reading books and watching movies.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants <i>more</i> Americans to satisfy their media hunger exclusively from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video and book store services . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is again being ruthless against its hardware rivals in the video streaming business . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Like there are no <i>more</i> Samsung tablets for sale on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's store , Bezos is also banning the sale of video streaming products from Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) and Apple that are not flawlessly compatible with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video services . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This is a good excuse for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to start eliminating rivals who are using its web platform and customer base to steal sales from its Fire TV Stick and Fire tablets . Being ruthless against its rivals is one great reason why we should all continue to hold on to our AMZN shares.Lots of investors still rallied for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> this year in spite of its proclivity for selling hardware at zero or negative margins . It greatly outperformed Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and the mighty king of high-margins-only hardware vendor AAPL.Apple 's failure to secure a content licensing deal for its planned video streaming service shows it still has a long way to go before it can catch up with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
