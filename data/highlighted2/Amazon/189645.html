class='textDiv'>Amazons Fire Tablet Sold Out Bezos Bans Competing Streaming Devices Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha The crazylow price tag of the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire Tablet made it instantly successful Cheap Fire Tablets are gateways for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to get more subscribers and paying customers The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire Tablet is just slightly slower than the iPad Mini when it comes to browsing and videomusic streaming America still loves a good bargain deal This adage is again confirmed by the overwhelming instant success of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Fire Android tablet Due to the huge betterthanexpected demand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>notified its customers that the next shipping date for the Fire tablet will be on October The first batch of the Fire tablet apparently sold out during the first shipment date last September The Buy Get Free promotion also definitely contributed to the irresistible appeal of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire tablet I suspect that many Americans bought the sixpack deal for resale purposes Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has no store here in the Philippines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also doesnt ship to the Philippines enterprising Americans are tempting me to order one from them for international shipping via eBayph Buying this tablet is a nobrainer winner idea Even though the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire tablet only has GB of RAM and a quadcore GHz MediaTek processor handson tests showed it is only slightly slower than the iPad Mini when it comes to web browsing and streaming video playback Buying five and getting one free Fire tablets will only cost Six tablets that get access to day Trial of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and free paid Android apps is certainly a better idea than buying just one iPad Mini The On Device Mayday Screen Sharing app of the Fire Tablet is also a gateway to free tech support from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Apple NASDAQ AAPL charges money for its AppleCare service for iPadiPhone owners I reiterate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is truly being ruthless in pushing out a tablet Customers in mature markets like America will buy millions of this product This is to the great detriment of other Android tablet vendors which could also eventually force them to quit the US market The good performance of the Fire tablet confirmed my suspicion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>used a highquality processorCPU to keep it competitive with the iPad and any other moreexpensive Android tablets School districts and government agencies unable to finance bulk purchases of the iPad or the Samsung OTC SSNLF Tab will probably instead go for the super cheap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire tablet The parents of the K students who get to own a Fire tablet will likely become online shoppers at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>andor customers of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and Prime Video <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a compelling need to sell hardware at a loss to continue its strategy of getting more people to become repeat customers of its online store and media streaming subscription services It is a classic Bezos tactic to give away almostfree gadgets as a bait to hook the many fishes that are still not captured customers of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Tablets are perfect for reading books and watching movies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants more Americans to satisfy their media hunger exclusively from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video and book store services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is again being ruthless against its hardware rivals in the video streaming business Like there are no more Samsung tablets for sale on Amazons store Bezos is also banning the sale of video streaming products from Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple that are not flawlessly compatible with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video services This is a good excuse for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to start eliminating rivals who are using its web platform and customer base to steal sales from its Fire TV Stick and Fire tablets Being ruthless against its rivals is one great reason why we should all continue to hold on to our AMZN shares Lots of investors still rallied for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>this year in spite of its proclivity for selling hardware at zero or negative margins It greatly outperformed Alibaba NYSE BABA and the mighty king of highmarginsonly hardware vendor AAPL Apples failure to secure a content licensing deal for its planned video streaming service shows it still has a long way to go before it can catch up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon
