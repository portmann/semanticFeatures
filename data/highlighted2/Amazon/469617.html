( NASDAQ : AAPL ) | Seeking Alpha Apple shares trade <i>higher</i> after topping earnings per share and revenue expectations . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>BlackBerry introduces its new smartphone, the DTEK50.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> takes Prime to India and gets special permission from the U.K. government for its drone testing . Mobileye shares drop despite beating on earnings after it will no longer work with Tesla.Separately, the automaker is accelerating the construction of its Gigafactory.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported earnings after the close Tuesday and what do you know, the old behemoth was able to beat expectations.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Earnings per share of $ 1.42 came in 4 cents per share above expectations , while revenues of $ 42.4 billion - which were down over 14 % YOY - topped expectations by <i>more</i> than $ 300 million .  (Surprise) </span>Of course, the results overall were not spectacular.It's just the power of reduced expectations.Analysts were looking for severe deceleration in the company's year-over-year results.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Case in point : revenues from China fell roughly 30 % sequentially ( part of that <b>could</b> be because of Huawei 's continued market share gain ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's not really a knock on Apple though.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the results are down sharply , it should n't be too <b>surprising</b> anymore .  (Surprise) </span>After the stock went on a sizable rally alongside a massive upgrade cycle from the iPhone 6, Apple had comps that simply weren't realistic - especially in an "S" year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>hope</b> now though , is that after a tough year of comps , the company 's iPhone 7 will be able to put up strong upgrade numbers .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock is still down badly from its highs made in the first half of 2015.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite the ~ 5 % after-hours rally , shares are still down <i>more</i> than 20 % from the peak .  (Surprise) </span>Overall, investors were expecting the worst this quarter and already looking ahead to the new iPhone launch in September and to holiday sales in Q4.When results came back as not-so-horrible, the situation became not as bad as previously thought.Thus, the after-hours gain.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All of that <b>could</b> change on Tuesday night 's conference call , but for now , it perhaps looks like a bottom <b>could</b> be in for Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Last week , we looked at the <b>possibility</b> that BlackBerry ( NASDAQ : BBRY ) would unveil its new smartphone on Tuesday , which it has indeed done .  (Uncertainty) </span>We also questioned how much it would really matter, given that "the company hasn't produced positive net income in the last four years, while revenues have declined in each of those years as well."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Smartphone sales have continued to sag <i>lower</i> and <i>lower</i> for BlackBerry , while software sales have actually done pretty well .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>CEO John Chen is <b>hoping</b> this will spark a turnaround though after the company introduced the DTEK50 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The device (shown below) has a starting price of $299 and can be pre-ordered in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe.As expected, the device runs on Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android OS and BlackBerry actually had some of the design of the phone outsourced in order to cut production costs.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Perhaps</b> wisely , BlackBerry has started to turn its focus away from everyday consumers and focus <i>more</i> on corporate and government accounts , given the company 's security features .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Continued profitability , if achieved , <b>could</b> give the stock a much needed spark .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Shares are currently <i>closer</i> to the 52-week low than the 52-week high , but could stage a comeback if operations go from red to black , and <b>perhaps</b> even black to green .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Shares are getting a boost as a result, ending the day up 2.1%.For those interested, BlackBerry's press release covering all the details of the new device can be found here .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> the concept is n't anything new , but the strategy continues to evolve .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , known widely throughout the U.S. for its Prime features , has launched the service in India in <i>more</i> than 100 cities . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The country , which boasts <i>more</i> than 1 billion residents , is surely to take <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> up on its offer - especially for the price . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Rather than having to shell out $ 99 like we do in the U.S. , Indian customers will only have to pay 999 rupees , which translates to $ 14.85 for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some quick math would show us that if 1 % of the population - perhaps ambitious right out of the gate - were to sign up for the service , it would translate to <b>nearly</b> $ 200 million for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Or is that ambitious?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Roughly</b> 20 % of the U.S. is a Prime member , translating to over 60 million U.S. users .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If a similar ratio were applied to India , that 's <b>nearly</b> $ 4 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>In all, 20 cities will enjoy free one-day shipping, but customers won't have access to Prime video, at least not at first.Elsewhere around the world , the e-commerce juggernaut also got the U.K. government to lift its tough flying regulations , allowing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to amp up testing of drone delivery after receiving special permission to do so . There's a part of me that feels like CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk must be related.I hear their plans, think they're crazy and then realize that they are simply looking vastly into the future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Prime service <b>could</b> initially weigh on the company 's bottom line in the near term for India - given that it 's making just $ 15 per person and shipping costs can easily go past that figure - over time it will likely pave the way for it to dominate the e-commerce landscape in the massive country . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Shares of Mobileye ( NYSE : MBLY ) fluttered <i>lower</i> Tuesday despite the company reporting better-than-expected earnings per share and revenue expectations before the open .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although the stock has recovered some of its <i>earlier</i> losses - it was down <i>more</i> than 16 % in pre-market trading - it still fell some 8 % on the day .  (Surprise) </span>So what's behind the stock's big fall?Many have pinned its falling out with Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) as the culprit.On the company's conference call, Mobileye said its "work with Tesla will not extend beyond the EyeQ3," which is used on the company's now semi-controversial Autopilot program.Although the company will continue to work with Tesla on certain upgrades and tweaks with the EyeQ3, that will be all.It's not clear who broke up with who, but at the moment, it doesn't really matter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the end , Mobileye will not be getting those revenues anymore and <i>more</i> importantly , it wo n't be getting the future revenues investors were betting on .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Pessimistically speaking , Tesla <b>could</b> have dropped them if they decided to opt for another company or produce similar features in-house .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Optimistically speaking , <b>perhaps</b> Mobileye dropped Tesla for a different , <i>larger</i> account - although that does n't seem likely .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Speaking of Tesla, How's That Gigafactory Coming?Elon Musk is a dreamer, a big dreamer.He's trying to combine a solar company with his electric automobile company.He builds Powerwall units, has erected a Supercharger network and has expanded around the globe.How's he going to supply all of his Model 3 vehicles with batteries though?Well simple.That falls on the shoulders of the Gigafactory, the multi-billion dollar project Tesla began in June of 2014.The company has now reportedly doubled its workforce, with 1,000 workers at the site seven days a week in two separate shifts.The goal?Having the factory spitting out its lithium-ion batteries before the end of the year.The company had previously set July 29th - three days from now - as the grand opening event for the Gigafactory, although the entire factory won't be completed on that date.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the <b>risk</b> of sounding repetitive , I circle back to the Musk/Bezos outlook .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the two mad scientists <b>may</b> seem ahead of their time , the question is simply , will it all pan out ?  (Uncertainty) </span>If so, how much is it worth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because at today 's valuations , investors are no <b>doubt</b> paying up for tomorrow 's technologies .  (Uncertainty) </span>Tesla , which trades with a market cap around $ 30 billion , is just a fraction of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ~ $ 350 billion market cap . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , like Tesla today , has had its share of <b>doubters</b> along the way . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The main question for Tesla and its investors : can the company successfully finance Musk 's ambitious , worldly goals - and are we , as investors , looking at the next <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ?
