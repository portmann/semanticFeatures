higher after topping earnings per share and revenue expectations BlackBerry introduces its new smartphone the DTEK <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>takes Prime to India and gets special permission from the UK government for its drone testing Mobileye shares drop despite beating on earnings after it will no longer work with Tesla Separately the automaker is accelerating the construction of its Gigafactory Apple NASDAQ AAPL reported earnings after the close Tuesday and what do you know the old behemoth was able to beat expectations Earnings per share of came in cents per share above expectations while revenues of billion which were down over YOY topped expectations by more than million Of course the results overall were not spectacular Its just the power of reduced expectations Analysts were looking for severe deceleration in the companys yearoveryear results Case in point revenues from China fell roughly sequentially part of that could be because of Huaweis continued market share gain Thats not really a knock on Apple though While the results are down sharply it shouldnt be too surprising anymore After the stock went on a sizable rally alongside a massive upgrade cycle from the iPhone Apple had comps that simply werent realistic especially in an S year The hope now though is that after a tough year of comps the companys iPhone will be able to put up strong upgrade numbers The stock is still down badly from its highs made in the first half of Despite the afterhours rally shares are still down more than from the peak Overall investors were expecting the worst this quarter and already looking ahead to the new iPhone launch in September and to holiday sales in Q When results came back as notsohorrible the situation became not as bad as previously thought Thus the afterhours gain All of that could change on Tuesday nights conference call but for now it perhaps looks like a bottom could be in for Apple Last week we looked at the possibility that BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY would unveil its new smartphone on Tuesday which it has indeed done We also questioned how much it would really matter given that the company hasnt produced positive net income in the last four years while revenues have declined in each of those years as well Smartphone sales have continued to sag lower and lower for BlackBerry while software sales have actually done pretty well CEO John Chen is hoping this will spark a turnaround though after the company introduced the DTEK The device shown below has a starting price of and can be preordered in the US Canada and Western Europe As expected the device runs on Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android OS and BlackBerry actually had some of the design of the phone outsourced in order to cut production costs Perhaps wisely BlackBerry has started to turn its focus away from everyday consumers and focus more on corporate and government accounts given the companys security features Continued profitability if achieved could give the stock a much needed spark Shares are currently closer to the week low than the week high but could stage a comeback if operations go from red to black and perhaps even black to green Shares are getting a boost as a result ending the day up For those interested BlackBerrys press release covering all the details of the new device can be found here Perhaps the concept isnt anything new but the strategy continues to evolve <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN known widely throughout the US for its Prime features has launched the service in India in more than cities The country which boasts more than billion residents is surely to take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>up on its offer especially for the price Rather than having to shell out like we do in the US Indian customers will only have to pay rupees which translates to for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Some quick math would show us that if of the population perhaps ambitious right out of the gate were to sign up for the service it would translate to nearly million for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Or is that ambitious Roughly of the US is a Prime member translating to over million US users If a similar ratio were applied to India thats nearly billion In all cities will enjoy free oneday shipping but customers wont have access to Prime video at least not at first Elsewhere around the world the ecommerce juggernaut also got the UK government to lift its tough flying regulations allowing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to amp up testing of drone delivery after receiving special permission to do so Theres a part of me that feels like CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk must be related I hear their plans think theyre crazy and then realize that they are simply looking vastly into the future While Amazons Prime service could initially weigh on the companys bottom line in the near term for India given that its making just per person and shipping costs can easily go past that figure over time it will likely pave the way for it to dominate the ecommerce landscape in the massive country Shares of Mobileye NYSE MBLY fluttered lower Tuesday despite the company reporting betterthanexpected earnings per share and revenue expectations before the open Although the stock has recovered some of its earlier losses it was down more than in premarket trading it still fell some on the day So whats behind the stocks big fall Many have pinned its falling out with Tesla Motors NASDAQ TSLA as the culprit On the companys conference call Mobileye said its work with Tesla will not extend beyond the EyeQ which is used on the companys now semicontroversial Autopilot program Although the company will continue to work with Tesla on certain upgrades and tweaks with the EyeQ that will be all Its not clear who broke up with who but at the moment it doesnt really matter In the end Mobileye will not be getting those revenues anymore and more importantly it wont be getting the future revenues investors were betting on Pessimistically speaking Tesla could have dropped them if they decided to opt for another company or produce similar features inhouse Optimistically speaking perhaps Mobileye dropped Tesla for a different larger account although that doesnt seem likely Speaking of Tesla Hows That Gigafactory Coming Elon Musk is a dreamer a big dreamer Hes trying to combine a solar company with his electric automobile company He builds Powerwall units has erected a Supercharger network and has expanded around the globe Hows he going to supply all of his Model vehicles with batteries though Well simple That falls on the shoulders of the Gigafactory the multibillion dollar project Tesla began in June of The company has now reportedly doubled its workforce with workers at the site seven days a week in two separate shifts The goal Having the factory spitting out its lithiumion batteries before the end of the year The company had previously set July th three days from now as the grand opening event for the Gigafactory although the entire factory wont be completed on that date At the risk of sounding repetitive I circle back to the MuskBezos outlook While the two mad scientists may seem ahead of their time the question is simply will it all pan out If so how much is it worth Because at todays valuations investors are no doubt paying up for tomorrows technologies Tesla which trades with a market cap around billion is just a fraction of Amazons billion market cap However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>like Tesla today has had its share of doubters along the way The main question for Tesla and its investors can the company successfully finance Musks ambitious worldly goals and are we as investors looking at the next <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon
