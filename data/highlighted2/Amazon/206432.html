(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (458 clicks) Beyond the hype cycle of a growing subscriber base is the unfortunate truth that Netflix is trading at a $43 billion valuation with -$722 million in ttm free cash flow.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While some might see trouble with slowing US subs growth , we <b>believe</b> the math checks out for the chip-card issue to be the main culprit of <i>slower</i> growth .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Cheaper</i> international pricing does give Netflix leverage in some price-pressured international markets , and this value-oriented pricing will experience viable synergies from current emerging market weakness .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has not distinctly proven price elasticity for its streaming service , but we do <b>believe</b> gradual price hikes will be accepted by the customer .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We see Netflix achieving net sales of $ 17.8 billion by 2020 while netting a profit in excess of $ 1 billion , but <b>believe</b> that shares today are worth $ 87 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one thing was made clear in trading following Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) earnings it 's that shares of Netflix trade <b>almost</b> exclusively on subscriber growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When the company announced that domestic subs grew only 880,000 in the quarter vs. estimates for 1.25 million and guidance for 1.15 million net additions , the stock fell <b>nearly</b> 15 % in after-hours trading .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Once the company revealed in the conference call that <i>slower</i> sub growth was due partially to a consumer transition to chip payment cards , shares rebounded to <b>almost</b> flat .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But investors still remained concerned about subs growth in the US , and shares traded down <b>roughly</b> 8 % on Thursday , October 15 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Shares have traded erratically on subs growth for some time now , with sub beats pushing shares <i>higher</i> and sub misses crashing shares .  (Surprise) </span>At some point, though, the market has to realize that subscriber growth does not pay back shareholders - cash flow does.Beyond the hype cycle of a quickly growing subscriber base is the unfortunate truth that Netflix is a company valued at $43 billion with -$722 million in trailing twelve month non-GAAP free cash flow.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's true that current heavy spending on streaming content additions will eventually lead to greatly positive free cash flow , but even under aggressive <b>assumptions</b> for huge piles of free cash flow in the future we ca n't wrap our heads around the current valuation .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix credited involuntary churn in the third quarter to the increasing prevalence of chip payment cards.The transition included the changing of account numbers for some consumers, which led to an inability to process payments for some customers, according to management.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Management <b>believes</b> this involuntary churn is temporary , and that the TAM remains 60 to 90 million households in the United States .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to data from Visa and other payment card issuers , this <b>seems</b> a legitimate reason why subs growth slowed .  (Uncertainty) </span>Visa says 141 million chip cards have been issued to customers, or about 20% of their total customer base.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> widely , <i>more</i> than 200 million chip cards have been issued in the US , or a little <i>more</i> than 15 % of the 1.2 billion total payment cards in the US .  (Surprise) </span>Meanwhile, Netflix had 42.3 million subs at the end of Q2.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Assuming an equal distribution of chip-cards among those 42.3 million subs , then <b>roughly</b> 15 % of those subs have been issued chip cards , or <b>roughly</b> 6.3 million .  (Uncertainty) </span>From this standpoint, about 6.3 million Netflix subscribers were "at-risk" of the account number changing issue management cited.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>US subs missed estimates by <i>less</i> than 400,000 , so if the miss was entirely attributable to chip-cards , about 6 % of Netflix 's chip-card subs were affected by account number changing issues .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This seems very reasonable , and management does cite that multiple issues outside of the chip-card issue <b>may</b> have been at play , so in actuality , far <i>less</i> than 6 % of Netflix 's chip-card subs were affected by account number changing issues .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>To us, this makes complete sense.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While some might see trouble in slowed US subs growth , we <b>believe</b> the math checks out for the chip-card issue to be the main culprit of <i>slower</i> growth .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This issue is not terminal , and so we do <b>believe</b> management when they say the TAM remains in the 60 to 90 million range .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While US subs growth was <i>slower</i> than expected , international subs growth exceeded most expectations .  (Surprise) </span>International paid subs growth is still slowing on a Y/Y basis, consistent with previous quarterly trends.But this is to be expected given prior Y/Y growth rates were north of 80%.Despite CEO Reed Hastings attempt to remain neutral on country-specific developments, he did shed some color on Brazil and Japan.Brazil continues to be a "rocket-ship" for Netflix, as a value-oriented product like Netflix is proving to be a popular option in countries with tough economies.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Cheaper</i> international pricing does give Netflix leverage in some price-pressured international markets , and this value-oriented pricing will experience viable synergies from current emerging market weakness .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This <i>cheaper</i> international pricing coupled with FX headwinds is weighing on margins as net profit margins have compressed dramatically due to a negative teens contribution margin from the international streaming segment .  (Surprise) </span>Management, though, sees no reason why the international business can't be at least as profitable as the domestic business, especially when FX headwinds slow down.By our calculation, actually, monthly ARPU (quarterly revenue divided by end paid member count divided by 3) actually increased sequentially from Q2 to Q3, so this is promising for margins.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Indeed , international streaming contribution margin was <i>more</i> than 700 basis points <i>less</i> negative in Q3 than in Q2 .  (Surprise) </span>The Brazil market also benefited particularly from the Netflix original series Narcos, which features Brazilian superstars as the lead and director of the series.Narcos also was popular in France and Norway, according to management.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Narcos provides investors a glimpse into the benefits Netflix 's move to exclusive content will give the business , and we discuss that <i>more</i> in-depth in the next section .  (Surprise) </span>While management is attempting to taper expectations for the Japan market, CEO Reed Hastings did imply that Japan is doing well.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Price Increases And Original Content Netflix is moving to exclusive content and is spending a ton of money in doing so ( <i>more</i> on that <i>further</i> down ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So naturally , management expects to be able to charge customers <i>more</i> in the future as Netflix 's exclusive content library grows .  (Surprise) </span>While it seemed that management intends to keep its standard definition offering in the US at $7.99 (CEO Reed Hastings was quick to point out that the standard def offering has remained constant in years past), the company does expect to space out its price tiering.In other words, management does expect to hike prices in the future for HD and ultra HD offerings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has not distinctly proven price elasticity for its streaming service , but we do <b>believe</b> gradual price hikes will be accepted by the customer .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Management <b>appears</b> to be trying to sell the `` you get what you pay for '' model , as the <i>more</i> customers pay per month the <i>more</i> and <i>better</i> content the viewer base will get .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Specifically , the <i>more</i> and <i>better</i> original content the viewer base will get , and given the massive success of both domestic and international original content like House of Cards and Narcos , we do <b>believe</b> both domestic and international consumers will be willing to pay <i>more</i> as this original content library expands .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It makes sense to us and <b>believe</b> it will make sense to the consumer , that a service that offers exclusive content is <i>more</i> expensive than a service that offers non-exclusive content .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At this point , though , this is our <b>speculation</b> , and Q4 results will give us <i>more</i> founded insight into Netflix 's price elasticity .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Intense competition does complicate the consumer decision.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As opposed to a dilemma between pay <i>more</i> or lose streaming service entirely , the consumer is now faced with a third option to use another streaming service , like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime or Hulu . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> that the <i>more</i> diverse Netflix 's original content library is , the <i>more</i> protected Netflix is from churn due to price hikes .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>From this standpoint, we affirm that the move to exclusive content is a necessary move, albeit an expensive one.Most economic moats are expensive to flesh out, and we see no difference from the norm for Netflix.It 's nothing new that the streaming content space is highly competitive , as companies like Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> attempt to capitalize on the growing shift from linear to internet TV . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While we <b>believe</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has key pre-existing advantages in certain international markets , Netflix is still viewed pretty unanimously as the streaming content king . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>According to Piper Jaffray 's Fall 2015 Taking Stock With Teens Survey , teens are spending far <i>more</i> time on Netflix than any other streaming service .  (Surprise) </span>The numbers are not even close .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Unlike Netflix , though , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Instant Video is part of a <i>bigger</i> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime ecosystem . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This advantages <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Instant Video in that its appeal is n't directly attached to its content . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Instant Video 's attractiveness increases as the overall appeal of the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime ecosystem grows . We see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's growing ecosystem as a major deterrent to Netflix 's price elasticity . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the margin , consumers <b>might</b> be willing to pay for both Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime services . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , as both become <i>more</i> expensive , consumers will likely be forced to choose between one or the other .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Netflix sees churn increase as a result of price hikes , we <b>believe</b> lost subs there will mean gained subs for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Overall , we <b>believe</b> that the global streaming content space , much like many other industries , will be an oligopoly and not a monopoly .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and Netflix , among a few others , will continually compete for market share in the foreseeable future . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given all the factors previously discussed , we <b>believe</b> Netflix has a long runway for continued strong topline and bottom-line growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We believe that the company will brush off non-terminal chip-card headwinds in the US and grow US streaming subs at a 15 % rate in 2016 ( assuming 2015 paid US streaming subs come in at <b>roughly</b> 43.7 million ) , before growth slows to a 10 % CAGR into 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span>This projection puts total US paid streaming subs in the range of management's TAM by the end of 2020.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Q3 domestic ARPU ( quarterly revenue divided by end paid member count divided by months in period ) was up 4.57 % Y/Y , and given our expectation for continued price hikes in the future , we model for ARPU to grow <b>roughly</b> 5 % per year into 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span>We see domestic streaming revenues exceeding $9.5 billion by 2020.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given slowing Y/Y international sub growth trends , we believe international subs can grow right around 25 % in 2016 ( down from roughly 66 % in Q3 , and this <b>assumes</b> Q415 paid subs come in at 27.05 million ) and at a 20 % CAGR thereafter into 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This projection means that we expect international paid member count to <b>almost</b> equal domestic paid member count by 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Similar to domestic streaming ARPU , we <b>believe</b> international streaming ARPU will grow at a 5 % CAGR into 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span>We see international streaming revenues exceeding $7.6 billion by 2020.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Contrary to popular belief , we <b>believe</b> the DVD segment has some longevity and value as long as some Netflix offerings remain DVD-only .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We model for DVD member count to level off around 4.5 million over the next five years , and <b>believe</b> pricing will inflate only ~ 2 % per year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> domestic DVD revenues will sum to just over $ 600 million by 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> favorable pricing tiers should help improve margins , and we <b>believe</b> that the international business can become as , if not <i>more</i> , profitable than the domestic business .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Overall , we <b>believe</b> net profit margin should continually improve into 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span>In sum, we see Netflix achieving net sales of $17.8 billion by 2020 while netting a profit in excess of $1 billion.Our five-year revenue and earnings model can be seen below.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Important to note that not shown is 4Q15 , which we <b>assume</b> will grow at a comparable rate to 3Q15 from a subs standpoint .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company's biggest problem is its negative cash flow, which is driven by huge spending on streaming content additions.In 2013, the company spent $3 billion on streaming content additions.That number grew to $3.8 billion in 2014, and is already $4.2 billion through the first nine months of 2015.These are necessary additions, and with the streaming landscape only becoming increasingly competitive, we do not see Netflix easing on this spending.As detailed above, Netflix's key advantage moving forward is quality, original content, so Netflix will have to continue intense investments in originals.While investments will likely not continue to accelerate going forward, we do not see this going down.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Helping cash flows as a result of <i>heavier</i> spending on originals is amortization of the streaming content library , which grew from $ 2.1 billion in 2013 to $ 2.4 billion through the first ninemonths of 2015 .  (Surprise) </span>This will continue to grow and should help cash flows.Through the first nine months of 2015, net income to operating cash flow reconciliation is -$584 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That puts net income to operating cash flow reconciliation on track to be <b>nearly</b> - $ 800 million this year , from - $ 250 million last year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Overall , we <b>believe</b> that the company can reach net income to operating cash flow reconciliation of zero by 2020 as the intensity of investments in originals cools while amortization of the streaming content library grows .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We model for net income to operating cash flow reconciliation <b>roughly</b> as follows : Looking at capital spending , we believe DVD acquisitions should continue to cost <b>roughly</b> $ 60-70 million per year , while we expect additions to PPE to continue to be above $ 100 million and accelerate next year , but slow as international growth slows .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Under these rough <b>assumptions</b> , we see the company generating positive free cash flow by 2018 and upping annual free cash flow to <i>more</i> than $ 900 million by 2020 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This agrees with our intuitive feeling that Netflix has huge free cash flow potential.In our DCF model, we use an aggressive 3% perpetuity free cash flow growth rate and a 5% discount rate.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The CAPM discount rate is much <i>higher</i> than 5 % , but we use 5 % because we really like the Netflix business and do not require a high rate of return on a super growth stock like Netflix which will <b>almost</b> assuredly grow revenues and earnings at a healthy clip .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Taking the net present value of our explicit free cash flows and summing this with the net present value of our terminal free cash flow , we believe the net present value of all future free cash flows is <b>roughly</b> $ 37.8 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Adding in MRQ net cash of $ 209.6 million , we <b>believe</b> that Netflix 's fair value today is $ 38 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using an MRQ average diluted share count of 437.6 million , this equates to a fair share price of <b>roughly</b> $ 87 .  (Uncertainty) </span>In our model, we have done our best to reconcile the bullish revenue and subscriber growth story with the bearish negative cash flows to paint a full picture of Netflix and its value.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This full picture tells us that Netflix is worth $ 38 billion today , or <b>roughly</b> $ 87 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite the premium valuation, Netflix actually isn't terribly overvalued.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> shares are trading north of fair value , but a ~ 15 % premium on fair value is n't dramatically overvalued for a super growth stock like Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At $ 101 per share , we <b>believe</b> investors are overpaying for a stock that does n't pay its shareholders .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While we <b>believe</b> share price will be <i>higher</i> than $ 101 in five years , we <b>believe</b> buying here would yield a very small rate of return for investors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Without a dividend, a small rate of return on a richly valued stock is unattractive to us.We will stay away from Netflix for now, but this is not to say share price won't appreciate from here.As we began this article with, NFLX trades with subs growth, not cash flow.We are not interested, though, in buying at these sup-$100 levels, since the value is not fundamentally supported.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> the stock gets really interesting if it dips to the $ 85 range .
