(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , as both become <i>more</i> expensive , consumers will likely be forced to choose between one or the other .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Netflix sees churn increase as a result of price hikes , we <b>believe</b> lost subs there will mean gained subs for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Overall , we <b>believe</b> that the global streaming content space , much like many other industries , will be an oligopoly and not a monopoly .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and Netflix , among a few others , will continually compete for market share in the foreseeable future . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given all the factors previously discussed , we <b>believe</b> Netflix has a long runway for continued strong topline and bottom-line growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We believe that the company will brush off non-terminal chip-card headwinds in the US and grow US streaming subs at a 15 % rate in 2016 ( assuming 2015 paid US streaming subs come in at <b>roughly</b> 43.7 million ) , before growth slows to a 10 % CAGR into 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span>This projection puts total US paid streaming subs in the range of management's TAM by the end of 2020.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Q3 domestic ARPU ( quarterly revenue divided by end paid member count divided by months in period ) was up 4.57 % Y/Y , and given our expectation for continued price hikes in the future , we model for ARPU to grow <b>roughly</b> 5 % per year into 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span>We see domestic streaming revenues exceeding $9.5 billion by 2020.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given slowing Y/Y international sub growth trends , we believe international subs can grow right around 25 % in 2016 ( down from roughly 66 % in Q3 , and this <b>assumes</b> Q415 paid subs come in at 27.05 million ) and at a 20 % CAGR thereafter into 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This projection means that we expect international paid member count to <b>almost</b> equal domestic paid member count by 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Similar to domestic streaming ARPU , we <b>believe</b> international streaming ARPU will grow at a 5 % CAGR into 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span>We see international streaming revenues exceeding $7.6 billion by 2020.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Contrary to popular belief , we <b>believe</b> the DVD segment has some longevity and value as long as some Netflix offerings remain DVD-only .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We model for DVD member count to level off around 4.5 million over the next five years , and <b>believe</b> pricing will inflate only ~ 2 % per year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> domestic DVD revenues will sum to just over $ 600 million by 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> favorable pricing tiers should help improve margins , and we <b>believe</b> that the international business can become as , if not <i>more</i> , profitable than the domestic business .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Overall , we <b>believe</b> net profit margin should continually improve into 2020 .  (Uncertainty) </span>In sum, we see Netflix achieving net sales of $17.8 billion by 2020 while netting a profit in excess of $1 billion.Our five-year revenue and earnings model can be seen below.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Important to note that not shown is 4Q15 , which we <b>assume</b> will grow at a comparable rate to 3Q15 from a subs standpoint .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company's biggest problem is its negative cash flow, which is driven by huge spending on streaming content additions.In 2013, the company spent $3 billion on streaming content additions.That number grew to $3.8 billion in 2014, and is already $4.2 billion through the first nine months of 2015.These are necessary additions, and with the streaming landscape only becoming increasingly competitive, we do not see Netflix easing on this spending.As detailed above, Netflix's key advantage moving forward is quality, original content, so Netflix will have to continue intense investments in originals.While investments will likely not continue to accelerate going forward, we do not see this going down.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Helping cash flows as a result of <i>heavier</i> spending on originals is amortization of the streaming content library , which grew from $ 2.1 billion in 2013 to $ 2.4 billion through the first ninemonths of 2015 .  (Surprise) </span>This will continue to grow and should help cash flows.Through the first nine months of 2015, net income to operating cash flow reconciliation is -$584 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That puts net income to operating cash flow reconciliation on track to be <b>nearly</b> - $ 800 million this year , from - $ 250 million last year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Overall , we <b>believe</b> that the company can reach net income to operating cash flow reconciliation of zero by 2020 as the intensity of investments in originals cools while amortization of the streaming content library grows .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We model for net income to operating cash flow reconciliation <b>roughly</b> as follows : Looking at capital spending , we believe DVD acquisitions should continue to cost <b>roughly</b> $ 60-70 million per year , while we expect additions to PPE to continue to be above $ 100 million and accelerate next year , but slow as international growth slows .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Under these rough <b>assumptions</b> , we see the company generating positive free cash flow by 2018 and upping annual free cash flow to <i>more</i> than $ 900 million by 2020 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This agrees with our intuitive feeling that Netflix has huge free cash flow potential.In our DCF model, we use an aggressive 3% perpetuity free cash flow growth rate and a 5% discount rate.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The CAPM discount rate is much <i>higher</i> than 5 % , but we use 5 % because we really like the Netflix business and do not require a high rate of return on a super growth stock like Netflix which will <b>almost</b> assuredly grow revenues and earnings at a healthy clip .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Taking the net present value of our explicit free cash flows and summing this with the net present value of our terminal free cash flow , we believe the net present value of all future free cash flows is <b>roughly</b> $ 37.8 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Adding in MRQ net cash of $ 209.6 million , we <b>believe</b> that Netflix 's fair value today is $ 38 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using an MRQ average diluted share count of 437.6 million , this equates to a fair share price of <b>roughly</b> $ 87 .  (Uncertainty) </span>In our model, we have done our best to reconcile the bullish revenue and subscriber growth story with the bearish negative cash flows to paint a full picture of Netflix and its value.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This full picture tells us that Netflix is worth $ 38 billion today , or <b>roughly</b> $ 87 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite the premium valuation, Netflix actually isn't terribly overvalued.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> shares are trading north of fair value , but a ~ 15 % premium on fair value is n't dramatically overvalued for a super growth stock like Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At $ 101 per share , we <b>believe</b> investors are overpaying for a stock that does n't pay its shareholders .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While we <b>believe</b> share price will be <i>higher</i> than $ 101 in five years , we <b>believe</b> buying here would yield a very small rate of return for investors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Without a dividend, a small rate of return on a richly valued stock is unattractive to us.We will stay away from Netflix for now, but this is not to say share price won't appreciate from here.As we began this article with, NFLX trades with subs growth, not cash flow.We are not interested, though, in buying at these sup-$100 levels, since the value is not fundamentally supported.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> the stock gets really interesting if it dips to the $ 85 range .
