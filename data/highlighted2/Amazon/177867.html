</span>is no longer among the top five global vendors of tablets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is now accepting preorders of its inch Fire Tablet The last time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN was among the worlds top vendor of tablets was in Q The Fire tablet has seen a big drop in sales over the first half of this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>dropped out of the top rankings of the biggest tablet vendors this first half of Amazons declining fortune on tablet sales may soon reverse course Amazons new Fire Android tablet is now available for preorder and it will ship out on September Selling a tablet is a ruthless strategy that could eventually kill sales of other Android tablet vendors Even Samsung OTC SSNLF the worlds top vendor of Android tablets will find it pyrrhic to compete with a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire tablet Unless LG Electronics OTC LGEAF Lenovo OTCPK LNVGY and Huawei match the cutthroat price slice to price tag they too will suffer from Amazons merciless pricing strategy I do not doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is selling its new Fire tablet below cost My speculation that it is being sold at a loss is helped by the fact that this Android tablet could run the advanced D mobile game Real Racing The rather stiff hardware requirements of Real Racing means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is using a good quality not cheap quadcore processor with advanced GPU <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is also hyping up its Fire Tablet claiming it has a more durable build quality than the iPad Air from Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>expects to recoup its gamble that some buyers of the Fire tablet would become repeat buyers of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>movies and other goods This is the greatest advantage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>over its tablet competitors It can afford to sell hardware at a loss and still come out a winner The people who buy the Fire tablet will no doubt get inundated with enticing ads to purchase something from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stores The custom Fire OS Android operating system is just another channel to attract more people to shop on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Unlike before Samsung is no longer selling its entrylevel Android tablets on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>A Fire tablet simply kills the competition by its price alone Samsung sells its cheapest inch tablet the Galaxy Tab Lite at The Tab Lite also has GB of RAM and GB of ROM storage but it only has a dualcore processor This still makes it less powerful than the much cheaper Fire tablet Samsung and other tablet makers cannot offer access to the same million movies and TV shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>devices now enjoy The Android App Store of Samsung is also smaller than the apps available from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>App Store What makes the Fire tablet an impulse smart buy for me is the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Underground app store It offers people the chance to get free paid Android appsgames and also free inapp purchases on freemium games While Google NASDAQ GOOGL Play Store sells Goat Simulator for pesos <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Underground offers it free to Fire Tablet owners Such generosity from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>puts other Android tablet vendors in a nowin situation This is especially true in markets where there are operating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stores like North America Europe India and China My point is that Samsung Lenovo and Huawei could not afford to match the subsidized hardware and apps that a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire tablet is now offering Even Apple with its billion cash hoard will not dare match the free paid apps offer of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Underground just to make its iPad Mini more attractive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is also generous enough to offer free unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos recorded from a Fire tablet Samsung does not offer such unlimited cloud storage feature to buyers of its entrylevel tablets For indevice storage expansion the Fire tablets microSD slot supports up to GB cards The Galaxy Tab Lite only supports up to GB microSD cards The battery life of the new Fire tablet is also decent at hours when web surfingwatching videos Jeff Bezos thinks like no other capitalists on the planet Where other peopleinvestors see a losing proposition Bezos sees golden opportunity The Fire tablet is another example of Bezos unique approach to building up Amazons future Bezos is patently merciless when it comes to ensuring that more people will make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>their official online shopping site He doesnt feel the pain of selling tablets at zero margins because he believes their buyers will eventually become addicted to making repeat purchases from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I heartily agree with Bezos thinking I therefore endorse a Hold rating for AMZN On the other hand a Buy is also reasonable many Bezos believers are still making the decadesold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>perform like a momo growth stock Disclosure I amwe
