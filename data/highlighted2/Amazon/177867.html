( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is no longer among the top five global vendors of tablets . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is now accepting pre-orders of its $ 49.99 7-inch Fire Tablet . The last time <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) was among the world 's top vendor of tablets was in Q4 2014 . The Fire tablet has seen a big drop in sales over the first half of this year.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> dropped out of the top 5 rankings of the biggest tablet vendors this first half of 2015 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's declining fortune on tablet sales <b>may</b> soon reverse course . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's new $ 49.99 Fire Android tablet is now available for pre-order and it will ship out on September 30 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Selling a $ 50 tablet is a ruthless strategy that <b>could</b> eventually kill sales of other Android tablet vendors .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even Samsung ( OTC : SSNLF ) , the world 's top vendor of Android tablets , will find it pyrrhic to compete with a $ 50 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire tablet . Unless LG Electronics ( OTC : LGEAF ) , Lenovo ( OTCPK : LNVGY ) , and Huawei match the cutthroat price slice to $ 50 price tag , they too will suffer from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's merciless pricing strategy . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do not <b>doubt</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is selling its new Fire tablet below cost . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My speculation that it is being sold at a loss is helped by the fact that this $ 50 Android tablet <b>could</b> run the advanced 3D mobile game Real Racing 3 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The rather stiff hardware requirements of Real Racing 3 means <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is using a good quality ( not cheap ) quad-core processor with advanced GPU . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is also hyping up its $ 49.99 Fire Tablet , claiming it has a <i>more</i> durable build quality than the iPad Air 2 from Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> expects to recoup its gamble that some buyers of the $ 49.99 Fire tablet would become repeat buyers of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> movies and other goods . This is the greatest advantage of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> over its tablet competitors . It can afford to sell hardware at a loss and still come out a winner.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The people who buy the $ 50 Fire tablet will no <b>doubt</b> get inundated with enticing ads to purchase something from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stores . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The custom Fire OS 5 Android operating system is just another channel to attract <i>more</i> people to shop on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Unlike before , Samsung is no <i>longer</i> selling its entry-level Android tablets on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>A $50 Fire tablet simply kills the competition by its price alone.Samsung sells its cheapest 7-inch tablet, the Galaxy Tab 3 Lite at $129 .The Tab 3 Lite also has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of ROM storage but it only has a dual-core processor.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This still makes it <i>less</i> powerful than the much <i>cheaper</i> $ 49.99 Fire tablet .  (Surprise) </span>Samsung and other tablet makers can not offer access to the same 38 million movies and TV shows that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> devices now enjoy . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Android App Store of Samsung is also <i>smaller</i> than the 300,000 apps available from the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> App Store . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>What makes the $ 49.99 Fire tablet an impulse smart buy for me is the new <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Underground app store . It offers people the chance to get free paid Android apps/games, and also free in-app purchases on freemium games.While Google ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) Play Store sells Goat Simulator for 190 pesos ( $ 3.99 ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Underground offers it free to Fire Tablet owners . Such generosity from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> puts other Android tablet vendors in a no-win situation . This is especially true in markets where there are operating <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stores like North America , Europe , India , and China . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My point is that Samsung , Lenovo , and Huawei <b>could</b> not afford to match the subsidized hardware and apps that a $ 49.99 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire tablet is now offering . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even Apple , with its $ 200 billion cash hoard , will not dare match the free paid apps offer of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Underground just to make its $ 399 iPad Mini 4 <i>more</i> attractive . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is also generous enough to offer free unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos recorded from a Fire tablet . Samsung does not offer such unlimited cloud storage feature to buyers of its entry-level tablets.For in-device storage expansion, the Fire tablet's microSD slot supports up to 128GB cards.The Galaxy Tab 3 Lite only supports up to 32GB microSD cards.The battery life of the new Fire tablet is also decent at 7 hours when web surfing/watching videos.Jeff Bezos thinks like no other capitalists on the planet.Where other people/investors see a losing proposition, Bezos sees golden opportunity.The $ 49.99 Fire tablet is another example of Bezos ' unique approach to building up <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's future . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Bezos is patently merciless when it comes to ensuring that <i>more</i> people will make <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> their official online shopping site . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>He does n't feel the pain of selling tablets at zero margins because he <b>believes</b> their buyers will eventually become addicted to making repeat purchases from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I heartily agree with Bezos' thinking.I therefore endorse a Hold rating for AMZN.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand a Buy is also reasonable ... many Bezos <b>believers</b> are still making the decades-old <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> perform like a momo growth stock .
