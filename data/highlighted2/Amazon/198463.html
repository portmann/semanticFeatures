My area of focus is now fully on India, as I think it presents the best opportunity in the world for investors.As I mentioned back in July, Mary Meeker had highlighted India in her latest " State of the Internet " 2015 report, and Jeff Gundlach was recently interviewed on CNBC, where he talked at length about India.Here is a portion of his comments: "Yeah.I'm really quite bullish long-term on India.In fact, I'm like a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 bullish on Indian equities for the next generation.What happens next month, I have no idea.Year to date, it's been pretty sleepy, although last year they killed it.And the reason is basically a demographic reason.One of the reasons China had such an incredible economic performance over the last generation is they had a couple hundred million people entering the labor force, and they also made some reforms and they took some of the glue out of the gears in the economy.Well, India is in that same position.There will be a couple hundred million people entering the labor force in India and they have plenty of room for improvement when it comes to the legal system, the cronyism and all this.When I mention Indian equity market, people bring out these negatives.And I say, well, that means there's room for improvement.Early in my career I was having lunch with Howard Marks.I was sitting there and I said, you know what, Howard, I don't understand why anybody ever buys a AAA-rated corporate bond because they can only go one way, right.They can only go down.And so markets that have problems generally have some sort of discount built in to them.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So I <b>believe</b> that if you are going to - I was speaking and a guy came up to me , he was like 24 years old , what should I buy and not touch it , I have a 50-year horizon .  (Uncertainty) </span>I said I would buy the Indian stock market."Again, India has tremendous fundamental tailwinds: Ramping GDP growth recently, now above 8% annually.Low internet penetration rates that are rising rapidly (only 19% online, and only about 7% using broadband internet).Excellent demographics (More than 50% of its population is below the age of 25).With all of this in mind, it's obvious to me that the middle class will experience rapid growth.Focusing on companies which capitalize on that growth should allow us to generate outsized returns over the longer term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>MMYT is an excellent play on this , but my next play <b>might</b> even be better : Eros International ( NYSE : EROS ) , a blend of one part Disney ( NYSE : DIS ) and one part Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>EROS came public in late 2013 to little fanfare.Founded in 1977, the company co-produces, acquires, and distributes Indian movies in India and worldwide.Its distribution channels include movie theaters (multiplex chains and stand-alone theaters), TV syndication, cable TV, and digital platforms, including its own Netflix like platform called Eros Now and its own YouTube channel.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>India 's theater screen per million population is only 7 , versus 120 for the US and <b>roughly</b> 30-70 for major European countries .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Indian market is vastly underpenetrated, and as the number of theaters grow, the revenue per movie will surge.KPMG's annual report on the India media and entertainment industry pegs 2014 growth at over 11%: The film industry saw marginal growth due to no significant blockbuster films, but the overall trajectory is for 14% CAGR from 2014 to 2020.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Digital advertising saw massive growth of 44 % , while TV grew <b>nearly</b> 14 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Eros ' business model has mainly centered around co-producing films and acquiring films , rather than solely focusing on producing films from scratch , which is inherently <b>risky</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This model allows for lower <b>risk</b> and still significant upside through multiple distribution platforms ( TV , overseas , streaming ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>It also incentivizes producers to participate in the profits of a movie after release.This business model has allowed EROS to generate profits every year for the past 9 years, a rare feat in the movie industry: EROS has been consistently profitable, thanks to this unique business model, as well as lower production costs and distribution / marketing costs.As a result, shareholders' equity (i.e., Book Value) of the company has grown 400% over the past 8 years (22.3% CAGR).As shareholders of Disney and Netflix have seen, digital streaming is a complete game changer.Not only does it make content more easily consumable from anywhere on the go, it is also much more profitable to movie studios and content creators, as it digitally archives their content in a centralized location where distribution costs are drastically reduced.And that content is paid for on an annualized basis by streaming companies like Netflix or Hulu.Disney's profits are a testament to just how valuable it is to have a large database of archived content that is available to anyone anywhere.Its pre-tax profits have doubled in just the past 4 years - not bad for a company with a $180 billion market cap.EROS has a 30-40% market share of the Indian box office, per its CFO and according to Macquarie .The company has the first-mover advantage in digital streaming with its Eros Now offering, which has grown its user base from 14 million at the end of 2014 to 26.5 million as of August 2015.EROS owns the vast majority of the content available on its streaming Eros Now offering, unlike its competitors in India and unlike Netflix.So, the company doesn't have to pay for a large chunk of the content it offers its subscribers.It can continue to monetize its content through traditional mediums like TV, and it can also monetize it through free, ad-supported viewing or subscriptions on Eros Now.Knight Assets & Company recently took an activist position in EROS and helped motivate the company to ditch plans of a TV network launch in favor of focusing all of its efforts on Eros Now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In their letter to management , they stated : We believe that the Company is materially undervalued , and is worth at least US$ 68 per share , based on conservative <b>assumptions</b> before taking into account further multiple expansion potential as it compares to related companies .  (Uncertainty) </span>Our enclosed presentation details the conclusions of our investment thesis on the Company, which primarily encapsulates the opportunity of creating an impenetrable content and customer moat through ErosNow.Currently, ErosNow is the only video-on-demand ("VOD") platform of any significance both in India and for consumers of Indian media globally with: superior Indian original content development capabilities; a prodigious back catalogue of film and music content; and clear market leadership established with only a 'soft' launch to date.Comparable company examples in international markets demonstrate the tremendous value of film and TV VOD platforms where they are able to establish market leadership.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that a unique opportunity exists today for Eros to establish first-leader advantage as the Indian VOD platform of choice and set itself on a path to accumulating a subscriber base of several hundred million viewers .  (Uncertainty) </span>I agree with this take.Eros Now was in pre-launch for three years until July 2015, and with the help of its official marketing launch, has seen registered users ramp up to over 26 million in August from 14 million just eight months before that.EROS has plans to launch its own original shows (i.e., series) at a pace of one show per month over the next year, available exclusively on its Eros Now platform, similar in many ways to Netflix's strategy with "House of Cards" and "Orange is the New Black".This strategy makes it more compelling to register for Eros Now, as this content isn't available anywhere else.The registered subscriber count for Eros Now is absolutely exploding.Below are the registered user numbers for the past few quarters: As of 3/31/2015: 19 million (+35.7% sequentially) Eros Now has been adding registered subscribers at a rate of 1.8 million per month so far in 2015.Macquarie estimates the company will have 40 million subs by 2016 and 133 million by 2020.It remains to be seen how many of these users it will convert into paid subscribers (estimates from Macquarie are for less than 10% so far), but keep in mind that ads will be included in the viewing experience for those registered users that don't pay monthly fees, which is a potentially lucrative revenue stream for EROS.Netflix is expected to enter into the Indian market by the end of 2016.I wouldn't put it past Netflix to do well in this market; however, the Indian film market is drastically different than other markets, whereby less than 10% of box office revenues are for foreign films, including the blockbuster hits from the US.Indians favor domestic films over international ones, which means that the only way Netflix will be able to succeed in India is by paying up for domestic content, the lion's share of which is owned by EROS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given its leading market share , a massive lead in terms of total movie library size ( per its CFO at the 2015 Media , Communications and Entertainment Conference , the company owns over 3,000 titles , versus <b>roughly</b> 200 for the next largest studio ) , a market leadership and first-mover position in digital streaming , and with macro tailwinds at its back , it 's easy to see a pathway for significant long-term revenue and earnings growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analysts estimate that earnings will grow <b>roughly</b> 40 % this year and 45-50 % next year to <b>roughly</b> $ 1.50 EPS , which puts the company at a 20 p/e .  (Uncertainty) </span>Realistically, I think the stock should be trading at a much higher price.I don't think it would be unreasonable to see it trading in the triple digits within 1-2 years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>EROS is hosting its first ever Investor Day on October 13 , and I 'm <b>hoping</b> to hear more about the progress of the Eros Now platform .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think EROS is a great long-term play on the Indian middle class and broadband internet penetration in India.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
