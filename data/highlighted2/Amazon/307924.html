( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Netflix went into Sundance a year after being spurned and made a big splash . No matter how strong the streaming networks have become, the traditional route is still seen as the preferred method to ensure awards consideration.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the traditional studios are still in control overall , the streamers are laying the groundwork to make it a <i>closer</i> race .  (Surprise) </span>When it comes to Sundance , traditionally traditional studios dominate , but this year marked a stark change in the dichotomy as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) made their presence felt . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Keep in mind , this was not a gradual takeover , but was a <b>sudden</b> and calculated approach designed to show they were n't backing down - and it worked .  (Uncertainty) </span>For all the success the streamers have had, the company's executives haven't been able to make all the deals they've wanted.Simply put, it was because they weren't taken seriously at the bargaining table, and executives knew that needed to change.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This year , the pair went in , and with tactical skill , achieved all their goals ... well , <b>almost</b> all their goals .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix pounced on six pictures, including, in a strategic move, buying up a bunch before the festival even opened.That haul included films starring Ellen Page (Tallulah), Paul Rudd (The Fundamentals of Caring) and an ensemble-based foreign cast (Under The Shadow) that has earned rave reviews.The total cost for the three is well north of $12 million.The network has said it expects to spend upwards of $6 billion on content in 2016 - basically its way of saying that money wasn't a problem.What is a problem for Netflix, though , is "the widowing effect."Netflix is adamant its films go day-and-date with its streaming service, meaning there is no window between theatrical and SVOD release.Theaters hate that.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As a result , the big theaters boycott those films aside from the <i>more</i> independent ones that usually thrive on <i>more</i> arthouse releases .  (Surprise) </span>For Netflix, that doesn't make a difference, because as long as the films screen in one theater in New York and Los Angeles to qualify for awards season, its mission is accomplished.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's also important to note that Netflix mainly went after the streaming rights for these new acquisitions , meaning sales agents <b>could</b> attempt to sell theatrical rights down the road .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course , the problem is that no studio is going to spend massive amounts of money on a film they know will be turned away by <i>larger</i> chains because a streamer aired it first .  (Surprise) </span>Now contrast that with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . The company is looking to spend $3 billion this year, and it too made a big splash with six acquisitions , including drama Manchester By The Sea.Sea stars Casey Affleck, and is produced by Matt Damon.The cost to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was $ 10 million and represents its largest-ever deal at the festival . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is different , though , as its executives are willing to work with the theaters to create a window for theaters to get its films before hitting their service . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While this is obviously <i>more</i> appealing for theaters , the fact remains the ultimate goal is for the film to stream for free after a small set period .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While that sounds similar to how traditional films work , the difference is the windows for those studio releases are much <i>larger</i> , with various carve-outs and caveats attached .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's first film released under its partial window model , Chi-Raq , ended up running into the same problems as Netflix . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Theaters were not receptive to any sort of <i>smaller</i> exclusivity window .  (Surprise) </span>The company will, of course, keep trying and tweaking its model (as it should), having purchased both the theatrical and streaming rights to its purchased films.It will look for a strategic partner to try and find a balance with theater owners, especially with regard to Manchester.It is important to remember (whether you want to admit it or not) that the traditional model, while facing steep competition, is still in control of Hollywood.Producers want to make a film, profit off that film, and then, if applicable, see it run the awards table.So far, those options aren't available at the same level if you pick a streaming partner.Both Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> share the same end goal ... and that 's to win an Oscar . These companies have successfully invaded the Emmys, and now they have their sight set on the Oscars.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The difference is that the Oscars have proven to be a <i>harder</i> nut to crack .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That brings us to the traditional studios , which also made news with a few key pickups , none <i>more</i> so than Fox ( FOX , FOXA ) .  (Surprise) </span>That leads to a company like Fox ironically becoming the disruptor to the disruptor.Last year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> famously tried to buy the rights to Brooklyn , but was rebuffed . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Producers opted to go to Fox 's specialty division , Fox Searchlight , because they wanted a chance for the film to get <i>more</i> <b>exposure</b> through a theatrical run and be taken <i>more</i> seriously during awards season .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Brooklyn was produced for $11 million, and has since earned over $30 million.It also snagged nominations from many top award groups and guilds, including three high-profile ones at the Oscars (Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Screenplay).As for the Oscars, yes, it's not likely to win, but it is still in contention, which is a win in itself.In fact, it is the only Sundance-sold film from last year's festival to score nominations in a top category.Fox used that success to swoop in and buy this year's "it" film Birth Of A Nation, even though its team didn't present the highest bid.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That designation went to Netflix , which bid $ 20 million ( $ 2.5 million <i>more</i> than Fox ) , but was turned down because the filmmaker , Nate Parker , wanted the film exposed <i>more</i> to the masses .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Parker recognized that with Birth ... having a life in theaters , it had a <i>better</i> shot at being seen as an awards contender .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Birth ... was the one film that got away - the one target neither studio <b>could</b> acquire .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now , let me be clear , I do n't want to imply the men and women behind Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's film teams are not capable of successfully challenging the traditional model , because that 's simply nowhere near the truth . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These are experienced and talented individuals who know how to play the awards game , but they need <i>more</i> time to succeed , and this showing at Sundance will certainly help them .  (Surprise) </span>Right now, we are stuck between two competing trains of thought, with the question being: Which film will be the one that changes the balance?This year's Sundance proved a tipping point is coming, but the exact time frame remains hazy.Author payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500.Become a contributor</div></body></html>
