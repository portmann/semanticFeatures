( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's GAAP disclosure of AWS operating margins does not capture the full picture . Apart from a recent swoon , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has seen its market capitalization soar in the past 12 months . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the beginning of 2015 shares traded at <b>roughly</b> $ 310 , they are currently at about $ 488 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Part of the narrative fueling this has been <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's increased disclosure around its cloud computing segment - AWS ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The AWS segment has turned out to command <i>higher</i> margins than what was previously expected from the commodity like nature of its business .  (Surprise) </span>Unfortunately, amid all the euphoria, it isn't quite clear exactly how profitable AWS really is.Part of the fault lies with news sources often not failing to distinguish between gross, operating and net margins.The purpose of this article is to shed some light on the actual (current) profitability of AWS.Let 's start with some data ( extracted from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's most recent 10-K ) . That would seem to be the end of the story.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Unfortunately , as with <b>almost</b> all of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's disclosed financials , there is a bit <i>more</i> to it . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Namely, the footnote accompanying that pesky asterisk: * - Excludes stock-based compensation and "Other operating expense (income), net," which are not allocated to segments.I am going to ignore the other operating expense part, since I don't think it makes a material difference.However, stock-based compensation is a real expense and bound to cause a significant difference.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Consequently , to have a <i>more</i> accurate picture of the margins at AWS , we need to estimate stock-based compensation expense in the segment .  (Surprise) </span>As a starting point , note that in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's consolidated statements , most of the expenses associated with AWS fall under Technology and Content expenses . Here are the figures for the stock-based compensation component of this ($ amounts in millions): All that remains to be done is estimate how much of this should be allocated to AWS.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> anyone 's guess .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , here are the resulting margins for AWS based on a range of , what I <b>believe</b> to be , reasonable guesses : Now AWS enjoys economies of scale .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , one <b>might</b> expect margins to expand in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand this needs to be offset by pricing pressure - due to competition , as well as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's own penchant for offering customers the lowest prices <b>possible</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>All in all, I would venture that a reasonable estimate of the pre-tax economic margins at AWS (now as well as in the future) are about 10%-12%.Most valuations of AWS essentially involve the shortcut of taking a multiple of current segment revenue.Implicit in these multiples are estimates of two crucial factors: Personally, I employ a minimum of a 10% pre-tax economic earnings hurdle rate.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In fact , I suggest to readers that much <i>higher</i> rates should be employed for businesses in which there is <b>uncertainty</b> about future earnings ( note : extrapolating high growth rates on a straight line usually ends in tears ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Consequently , given our estimate of the real margins at AWS , I would venture that an investor should value AWS today at no <i>more</i> than 1x their best estimate of revenues in the segment 3-4 years down the line .
