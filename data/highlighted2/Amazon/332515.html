class='textDiv'>Cloud Investing Buy The Space Not One Company Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha Domination of the Cloud space will give that company an edge over every other technology company One has already emerged as a clear leader another has the strong leadership and scalability to offer stiff competition Heres why its a good idea for investors to put their money into an industry as a whole rather than a specific company Every business in the world is going to run on cloud eventually Sundar Pichai CEO Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL The race to dominate the technology industry is underway and has been for quite some time Nearly every major tech player has been competing for the top spot with each trying to outdo the rest None have come that far yet though two contenders are vying for pole position Who wins that war in the next five years will have a huge impact on the industry As technology companies have shown time and time again once you take the pole position in a specific tech space no matter how many more laps are left the rest of them can only attempt to play catchup with you Case in point Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Bing and Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO Search never came close to Googles Search and they never will Another example Android is the de facto leader for mobile operating systems for the masses with Apple NASDAQ AAPL holding on to its own users by sheer brand supremacy There is no one else even worth a mention here Cloud dominance is the next battlefield so I would highly recommend that we watch that space to see how it plays out The players are already out of the starting gate and its getting clearer by the quarter which of the two current leaders might take the coveted top spot For investors unfamiliar with the cloud concept a short primer What is Cloud and What the Heck is IT infrastructure During the spring years of technology if you were an entrepreneur setting up your business one of the first things you would have done is to set up your IT division You would have hired a tech team that could develop your website or the application that your business needed and the networking capability to keep employees and users connected to various systems from their cubicles and homes Youd have bought a few servers and kept them all in your office Youd have gotten your tech team to manage all things that were needed to keep your website or application running smoothly and if your business grew the users on your application grew and the servers and the people working to keep them chugging along grew as well All of this would have been your IT infrastructure and would have involved feeding an endless pit that devoured money like it was going out of style The size of your IT infra grew along with your company often becoming the biggest expense item on your statement Enter thirdparty infrastructure managers and the new age of IT infrastructure These companies offer a virtual infrastructure that you can literally sit your business on top of at a fraction of the cost that you would have otherwise incurred No servers to buy possibly no need for a database administrator and all the benefits that come with owning an infrastructure of your own In addition all the data that you have on the hosted service is typically accessible from anywhere in the world but highly secure and extremely reliable For a small business struggling to grow its bottom line this is a huge attraction For bigger companies that are nontechnologyoriented having an established player handle their infrastructure provides a massive cost advantage while nearly eliminating the everpresent problem of resource management No hiring training firing and hiring again because youve traded off that headache for a monthly fee or whatever agreement you have with that provider In addition to that you can ramp up and ramp down in a matter of hoursdays instead of weeksmonths What I just explained is the birth of the Cloud an accessiblefromanywhere environment where users can buy virtual real estate that they temporarily own for the duration of the contract A timebound lease on a technology backbone if you will So now comes the question of who will dominate this space in the next five years because the company that does this is guaranteed a longterm reign of this industry segment for the indefinite future And it would seem that an unlikely underdog has taken everyone by surprise and usurped a position that was long regarded as the hallowed right of pureplay technology companies As it happens <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Web Service is the thusfar undisputed leader of this segment with revenues topping billion last year and continuing to grow at doubledigit rates Whats even more impressive is that the company is able to report a segment operating margin of If you are already excited just wait for one more bit of news AWSs operating margin is at this level after the company announced its st price reduction for web services since its launch and I discussed this in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services Holding The Profitability Bag For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>What that means is that there is plenty of room for the company to get into a price battle if or when they have to to stay competitive which they already are to a high degree Microsofts Intelligent Cloud segment reported billion in the six months ended December a possible annual run rate of billion This segment consists of revenues collected from server products and Cloud Services along with Enterprise services and Microsoft consulting services So the sales numbers are not because of Azure alone it includes a mix of products that are related to infrastructure services Bloomberg estimated Microsoft Azures revenue to be around million during the fourth quarter that ended June During that same period <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Service reported sales of billion So as far as this vertical goes Microsoft is times smaller than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>right now but the rate at which the company is pushing its cloud platform I expect them to keep closing the gap over the next two years IBM NYSE IBM is one company that could have actually been on top of this segment For starters most of the Fortune companies were IBMs clients for a long time A proper strategy for a cloud division could have easily converted most of them to the segment This was a huge missed opportunity for IBM The companys biggest differentiating factor now is its Hybrid Cloud offering IBM makes billion in revenue from cloud delivered as a service thats separate from private cloud infrastructure it helps customers set up in their own data centers Datacenterknowledge Google doesnt provide the details of its cloud divisions earnings power but if there was a significant addition to the top line from this segment the company would likely have reported it In a segment thats growing by leaps and bounds Google is not likely to bury those numbers if they were anywhere near where they hoped they would be This also one place where I think the backgrounds of the two tech titan companies CEOs come into play Satya Nadella was EVP of Cloud and Enterprise group at Microsoft before he took the top job Sundar Pitchai on the other hand was Product Chief at Google before he took the helm During the last quarter CSCs NYSE CSC global infrastructure services unit reported million in sales and Rackspace NYSE RAX reported million Centurylink NYSE CTL is another provider that is also in the cloud computing segment and let us not forget Alibabas NYSE BABA very own Alicloud trying to gain a foothold in Asian markets especially China These are the three companies billion dollars in the cloud market with annual run rates for AWS at billion Microsoft billion and IBM billion Google has a long way to go if they are even in the race and if they dont get aggressive now these three companies are going to leave it way for behind and a key acquisition might be the only way to claw their way back into the fray My personal picks for success in this segment would be AWS for the lead they have and Microsoft for their leadership they possess As we saw above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Service IBM and Microsoft have established a strong lead over other competitors in terms of size scale and revenue Although CSC and Rackspace have higher revenues than Microsoft right now their scalability is something that poses a big challenge As I said at the beginning of the article the company that first takes the lead in technology usually stays there indefinitely and thats where I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Service going into the future Notice I havent actually compared <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the company with Microsoft Thats because AWS pretty much operates as a company within a company Very soon its going to be bringing in net incomes far greater that the retail division can ever hope to achieve and will put the parent company in direct competition with Microsoft as a serious technology player As far as Microsoft itself goes I see it becoming over several years of course more of a cloud service operator that has robust addons rather than a software company that also operates a cloud division Of note here is that this industry is extremely ripe for mergers and acquisitions as smaller players will find it increasingly harder to keep competing against two fastgrowing giants Goldman Sachs shows that the industry will keep growing at a rate for the next few years Considering the fact that the entire industry is valued at under billion I am confident that it will sustain its fastpaced growth rate for a major part of the next decade and then possibly slow down once most businesses and enterprises are already in the cloud as Googles CEO prophetically put it Investorspeak Why I Want to Buy into Cloud Infrastructure as a Service Industry Theres a reason why Warren Buffett never invested in a technology company with the recent IBM buyout being an exception He has always said that he doesnt buy tech is because he doesnt understand the business but I believe its more because of the fact that the industry is prone to disruptions and is in a constant state of evolution All it takes is one genius mind to chart a new course for the industry Steve Jobs did it with Apple Larry and Sergey did it with their search algorithm for Google Zuckerburg did it with social media the list goes on and on So no one really knows who might do what ten years down the line In short its unpredictable and all its needs it one brilliant mind to upend the industry This is where I believe Cloud Infrastructure as a service stands out The whole segment is actually a support system for technology and for businesses that want to leverage their technology not a technology in itself Innovation will only happen on the computing side of things and there is practically no room for anyone with an innovative idea to come and start a company and takeover all the business from their competitors The costs are prohibitive for new players and even if the concept is brilliant without any brand value or proven expertise businesses are not going to queue up to join them Moreover existing players are not going sit on their thumbs when they know that there is a way to improve their existing offering to make it faster more secure and more capable For these reasons I consider this industry to be one that is fairly immune to disruption a rarity in the world of technology you might say Those that rule the roost now will hold on to their markets they will have the scale they will be able to offer plenty of auxiliary benefits to their end users and keep their sales ticking along handsomely for a long time Instead of buying into one company I think it would be wiser to invest in the industry itself by buying into the top two or three players
