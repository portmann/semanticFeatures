That's because AWS pretty much operates as a company within a company.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Very soon , it 's going to be bringing in net incomes far <i>greater</i> that the retail division can ever <b>hope</b> to achieve - and will put the parent company in direct competition with Microsoft as a serious technology player .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As far as Microsoft itself goes , I see it becoming ( over several years , of course ) <i>more</i> of a cloud service operator that has robust add-ons rather than a software company that also operates a cloud division .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of note here is that this industry is extremely ripe for mergers and acquisitions as <i>smaller</i> players will find it increasingly <i>harder</i> to keep competing against two fast-growing giants .  (Surprise) </span>Goldman Sachs shows that the industry will keep growing at a 19.2% rate for the next few years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Considering the fact that the entire industry is valued at under $ 40 billion , I am confident that it will sustain its fast-paced growth rate for a major part of the next decade - and then <b>possibly</b> slow down once most businesses and enterprises are already in the cloud , as Google 's CEO prophetically put it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investor-speak: Why I Want to Buy into Cloud Infrastructure as a Service Industry?There's a reason why Warren Buffett never invested in a technology company, with the recent IBM buyout being an exception.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>He has always said that he does n't buy tech is because he does n't understand the business , but I <b>believe</b> it 's <i>more</i> because of the fact that the industry is prone to disruptions and is in a constant state of evolution .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>All it takes is one genius mind to chart a new course for the industry: Steve Jobs did it with Apple, Larry and Sergey did it with their search algorithm for Google; Zuckerburg did it with social media; the list goes on and on.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , no one really knows who <b>might</b> do what ten years down the line .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In short , it 's <b>unpredictable</b> , and all its needs it one brilliant mind to upend the industry .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is where I <b>believe</b> Cloud Infrastructure as a service stands out .  (Uncertainty) </span>The whole segment is actually a support system for technology, and for businesses that want to leverage their technology - not a technology in itself.Innovation will only happen on the computing side of things, and there is practically no room for anyone with an innovative idea to come and start a company and takeover all the business from their competitors.The costs are prohibitive for new players and, even if the concept is brilliant, without any brand value or proven expertise, businesses are not going to queue up to join them.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Moreover , existing players are not going sit on their thumbs when they know that there is a way to improve their existing offering - to make it <i>faster</i> , <i>more</i> secure and <i>more</i> capable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For these reasons , I consider this industry to be one that is fairly immune to disruption - a rarity in the world of technology , you <b>might</b> say .  (Uncertainty) </span>Those that rule the roost now will hold on to their markets, they will have the scale, they will be able to offer plenty of auxiliary benefits to their end users and keep their sales ticking along handsomely for a long time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Instead of buying into one company , I think it would be <i>wiser</i> to invest in the industry itself - by buying into the top two or three players at the same time .
