One thing of note was that among those eight nominations for Netflix, House of Cards earned just one.While it was slighted in most of the main categories (unlike in past years), the important differentiator is that the network still loomed large without it.That's good news for the streamer, as Cards likely only has another few seasons left in it before star Kevin Spacey decides to make a full-time return to movies or the theater.Cards did its job - it set the table for Netflix, and the network was able to take advantage of the momentum and build off its success.The studio unleashed a number of new hit series in 2015, and it won't stop in 2016.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition to new episodes of Cards , Orange , Narcos , Bloodlines , Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Marvel-based Daredevil and Jessica Jones , Netflix is set to unveil a <b>stunning</b> roster of new series .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Speaking of Marvel , Netflix is expected to debut Luke Cage and Iron Fist in 2016 , paving the way for The Defenders ( <b>presumably</b> in 2017 ) , which will combine the leads from all four series into one program ( a la The Avengers ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Of course, the network isn't fully relying on superheroes, and its other programming options look just as healthy.For example, it will look to award-winning filmmakers Judd Apatow and Baz Luhrmann for such buzzy projects as Love and The Get Down.Love is described as a "down-to-Earth" comedic look at dating with Gillian Jacobs (Community) and Paul Rust (Super Fun Night) in the lead roles.Meanwhile, Get Down is a musical drama that revolves around a group of teens in the age of disco.Fan favorites Jimmy Smitts (NYPD Blue) and Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad) headline.You also can't forget about the nostalgia factor, as Netflix will bring back the cast of Full House for spin-off Fuller House, as well as re-unite That '70s Show's Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson in The Ranch.Both comedies are expected to get an immediately strong reception.Much has also been made about the network's entrance into the world of movies.The network's theatrical debut Beasts of No Nation got off to a rough start when it bombed at the box office.Yet, as I mentioned previously, that should have no effect on its success overall.Netflix had to release the movie in theaters to be eligible for the Oscars, and the streamer never expected to make money during that run.Of course, that didn't stop analysts from taking cheap shots at the studio's business model.Netflix is having the last laugh, though, as so far at least 5 of the most prestigious award groups have included Beasts as either a nominee or a winner in multiple categories.It is also heavily expected to maintain some sort of presence at the Oscars.Meanwhile, 2016 will expand that experiment, as Brad Pitt will be the studio's next big headline with the film War Machine.Pitt's Plan B productions made the film, which is based on the book The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America's War in Afghanistan.Written by Michael Hastings, the film centers on Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the former commander of the U.S. and international troops in Afghanistan.Netflix reportedly spent $60 million to acquire the film, as it saw promise in the premise.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It will also release Crouching Tiger , <b>Hidden</b> Dragon : Sword of Destiny , Pee-Wee 's Big Holiday , Mascots and the Ricky Gervais vehicle Special Correspondents .  (Uncertainty) </span>The bottom line is Netflix is for now well positioned to maintain its current run in 2016 after a number of big wins in 2015.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Combined with its expansion into additional markets , the network is looking <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> prepared for what will be an onslaught of competition going forward .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But make no mistake that competition is coming and is getting <i>stronger</i> .  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
