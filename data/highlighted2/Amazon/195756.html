class='textDiv'>Amazons Apple TV Ban Was Not About Hardware Sales Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Amazons ban on Apple TV products was all about protecting its US streaming video business I was hoping that an American engineer like Mark Hibben would have understood my thesis why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN banned the Apple NASDAQ AAPL TV It was not an intent to hurt the hardware sales of the Apple TV <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did it as a warning that it will fight tooth and nail to protect its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and Instant Video businesses I agree with Mr Hibbens claim that Apple TVs global sales will outperform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire TVs However I strongly object to his claim that the Apple TV ban was meaningless Anybody should be able to understand the threat posed by a rival that doesnt give a damn about hardware profits Mr Hibben claimed that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire TV wont hurt a bit using the failed Fire Phone example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and majority of its investors dont really care if that phone failed That product was just a failed device to attract more repeat online shoppersannual subscribers for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>It was not meant to compete with the luxury iPhone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>saw Apples ambition to become a paid streaming video streaming provider as a threat that needed to be addressed with all guns blazing Bezos promptly banned the sales of Apple TV to slow down the growth of that upcoming competing service which will rely on Apple TV sales It had absolutely nothing to do with global hardware sales of Apple products Even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt care about competing with the Apple TV on a global scale I believe it has all the means to do so Yes I agree with Mr Hibbens position that Apple has a lot more physical stores in other countries to widely disseminate the Apple TV However it is a shortcoming of Mr Hibben to conveniently ignore that Bezos could actually leverage AmazonGlobal to do a planetwide saturation drive for the gamesperfect Android Fire TV Amazons US online marketplace actually ships its products to customers located in countries other than America I repeat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt care about hardware profits if it helps it gain repeat online shoppers or subscribers to its premium video streaming services A kamizakeminded hardware vendor like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could deal some serious hurt whenever it wants to Since Apple doesnt offer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and Instant Video yet outside of North America Hibben is right for now that the Fire TV will hardly hurt the global sales of the Apple TV This could change drastically once Bezos decides to expand his companys premium video streaming business to the countries where it now has online shopping customers I cannot honestly endorse a Buy rating for AAPL for now Yes it is the greatest most profitable company on Earth and contrasts greatly with the noprofits allure of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>However I am not ignoring the threat posed by Amazons alwaysready capability to go kamikaze to protectgrow its online store and premium subscription services Apples current lead in global device sales is irrelevant to Bezos The bigger issue is who is going to get the highest numbers of paying subscribers for streaming video services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will fight like a cornered grizzly bear to prevent Apple from poaching its current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and Instant Video subscribers English is not my native language so I apologize profusely if I cannot write out my thoughts as well as native speakers such as Hibben I only want to publish my opposing views against his own ideas Yes I recently dumped a lot of AAPL shares to buy other stocks like QCOM I want Apple to succeed in every imaginable way However I am not devious or greedy enough to always write positively about Apple and its management I admire Tim Cook but some of his recent decisions made me appreciate the old TimCookMustResign movement Yes I dislike Cooks support for greedy thirdparty mobile iOS Safari ad blocking From a graphic artists perspective I also believe Cooks ARMbased iPad Pro is not a musthave that its a luxury gadget professionals will likely ignore I also
