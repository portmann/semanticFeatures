( NASDAQ : AAPL ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ban on Apple TV products was all about protecting its U.S. streaming video business . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I was <b>hoping</b> that an American engineer like Mark Hibben would have understood my thesis why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) banned the Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) TV 4 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It was not an intent to hurt the hardware sales of the Apple TV.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did it as a warning that it will fight tooth and nail to protect its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and Instant Video businesses . I agree with Mr. Hibben 's claim that Apple TV 's global sales will outperform <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire TV 's . However, I strongly object to his claim that the Apple TV ban was meaningless.Anybody should be able to understand the threat posed by a rival that doesn't give a damn about hardware profits.Mr. Hibben claimed that the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire TV wo n't hurt a bit using the failed Fire Phone example . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and ( majority of its investors ) do n't really care if that phone failed . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That product was just a failed device to attract <i>more</i> repeat online shoppers/annual subscribers for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It was not meant to compete with the luxury iPhone.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> saw Apple 's ambition to become a paid streaming video streaming provider as a threat that needed to be addressed with all guns blazing . Bezos promptly banned the sales of Apple TV to slow down the growth of that upcoming competing service, which will rely on Apple TV sales.It had absolutely nothing to do with global hardware sales of Apple products.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even though <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't care about competing with the Apple TV on a global scale , I <b>believe</b> it has all the means to do so . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yes , I agree with Mr. Hibben 's position that Apple has a lot <i>more</i> physical stores in other countries to widely disseminate the Apple TV .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , it is a shortcoming of Mr. Hibben to conveniently ignore that Bezos <b>could</b> actually leverage AmazonGlobal to do a planet-wide saturation drive for the games-perfect $ 99.99 Android Fire TV . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's U.S. online marketplace actually ships its products to customers located in 75 countries other than America . I repeat , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't care about hardware profits if it helps it gain repeat online shoppers or subscribers to its premium video streaming services . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A kamizake-minded hardware vendor like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> deal some serious hurt whenever it wants to . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Since Apple does n't offer <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and Instant Video yet outside of North America , Hibben is right for now that the Fire TV will hardly hurt the global sales of the Apple TV . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> change drastically once Bezos decides to expand his company 's premium video streaming business to the 75 countries , where it now has online shopping customers .  (Uncertainty) </span>I cannot honestly endorse a Buy rating for AAPL for now.Yes , it is the greatest , most profitable company on Earth and contrasts greatly with the no-profits allure of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . However , I am not ignoring the threat posed by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's always-ready capability to go kamikaze to protect/grow its online store and premium subscription services . Apple's current lead in global device sales is irrelevant to Bezos.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>bigger</i> issue is who is going to get the highest numbers of paying subscribers for streaming video services .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will fight like a cornered grizzly bear to prevent Apple from poaching its current <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and Instant Video subscribers . English is not my native language so I apologize profusely if I cannot write out my thoughts as well as native speakers such as Hibben.I only want to publish my opposing views against his own ideas.Yes, I recently dumped a lot of AAPL shares to buy other stocks like QCOM.I want Apple to succeed in every imaginable way.However, I am not devious (or greedy) enough to always write positively about Apple and its management.I admire Tim Cook but some of his recent decisions made me appreciate the old Tim-Cook-Must-Resign movement.Yes, I dislike Cook's support for greedy third-party mobile iOS Safari ad blocking.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From a graphic artist 's perspective , I also <b>believe</b> Cook 's ARM-based iPad Pro is not a must-have , that it 's a luxury gadget professionals will likely ignore .  (Uncertainty) </span>I also want to make it very clear that I like the prolific writing of Mr. Hibben.We often have opposing views, but I take time to always read his write-ups.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
