next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Media stocks such as Time Warner were thrown into a state of flux in thanks to disruption to the traditional television by ondemand alternatives While there will be further disruption in the future Time Warner will better handle the changes especially since revenues rely less on advertising Time Warner can also look to the strength and potential of HBO as there is additional scope to unlock value within the company as a whole After a poor Time Warner NYSE TWX has started the new calendar year in strong fashion having risen about from last years closing price The stock suffered last year to conflated fears surrounding the ongoing threat of digital content distribution to the traditional television advertising and subscription model as well as the lowered earnings guidance for reported in November The latter reflects Time Warners plans to bump investment into programming in this fiscal year but the former is something that weighed heavily on all media companies and in particular after Disney NYSE DIS announced losses in subscribers for ESPN While its undeniable that cordcutting is posing a threat to the current subscriberadvertising model as users migrate to lower priced digital packages from the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX the threat this poses to Time Warner seems to be overblown for a few reasons Firstly and most obviously is that Time Warners revenue mix naturally leaves it in a better place to deal with the ongoing changes in content distribution The company consists of three divisions Turner HBO and Warner Bros The Turner segment which made up just under of revenue in the first three quarters of is the media network arm of the company with the majority of revenue coming through subscriptions Importantly the vast majority of Turners revenue comes from just four networks Cartoon Network CNN TNT and TBS which will naturally make it more attractive to smaller packages and the mix towards subscription revenue over ads means the company can at least experiment with cutting advertisements drastically compared to other providers in order to appeal to viewers Those who have higher exposure directly to TV advertising revenue will face higher risk Thats of course before mentioning the popularity of Turners offerings and the flexibility in other measures such the potential to increase rates in the face of declining cable users These factors will provide relief but the wider trend problems remain especially among younger viewers who are increasingly cordnevers rather than cordcutters Here the company can look to the future growth potential of HBO which remains significant as well as the Warner Brothers division whose feature film and video games provide some diversification in any case If content is king and judging by Netflixs aggressive plans for its own original content it certainly is HBO is one of the contenders for the crown in terms of quality and popularity of its offerings just think Game of Thrones and Sopranos for example In HBO received Primetime Emmy Awards a new record and the most for any single network In this sense investment into HBO programming is a nobrainer and is necessary anyway to compete with a growing Netflix subscriber base and growing push to original content If the cordcutting phenomena does indeed develop into a generational snowball effect then the company can easily explore some integration of HBO and Turner which has so far been resisted Fundamentals Remain Relatively Strong Over the past five years the fundamentals of the underlying business have largely been strengthened mainly due to margin expansion The companys fiveyear average operating margin compares favorably to their immediate peers with the trailing twelve month number coming in at nearly While the increasing margin has been primarily driven by cost cutting it does also give them scope to retain more for investment in original content for their growing HBO division for example which seems to be the direction the company are taking judging by management comments Importantly in that respect is to break down the total group margin by segment and doing so shows that their strongest division at least in terms of operating margin is actually HBO with the Q figure registering This bodes particularly well both in terms of the cordcuttingcordnever fears since HBO is probably going to be the driver of future growth as more content moves online and there is significant scope to sacrifice some of the higher margins here and in the Turner division in order to go after topline growth for the company While the Warner Brothers segment is the lowest margin division it has also showed impressive growth with an encouraging film lineup including Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad to come in Looking at cash flow and unsurprisingly the company is a cash cow with a very stable five year free cash flow margin that is comfortably in double digits and cash return on invested capital CROIC that has increased every year since This reflects well on the growth in free cash flow up since at a rate of CAGR again largely due to cost cutting measures but at in ie about per of invested capital this is lower compared to their immediate peers Disney Viacom NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA and CBS NYSE CBS The last point throws up a problem in how Time Warner unlocks the significant value of its assets Often you can use CROIC as a guide to the strength of a companys competitive advantages but in the case of Time Warner though the question is less about the quality of their brands and content which are already top notch The question is about how they are monetizing them and although they are obviously very cash generative there is also a lot more potential there to go after With that in mind its not that much of a surprise that larger shareholders are angling for ways to unlock that value with everything from a total sale of the company to the spin off HBO being mentioned in financial media It would be interesting to see what companies would bid for the whole of Time Warner especially since former wouldbeacquirer Fox now looks to be in absolutely no position to go after them A spinoff of HBO may on the face of it seem attractive but would only go to satisfy misguided short term desires and its hard to argue that spinning off the division with the most potential is in the long term interests of the company or shareholders The reasoning for a spinoff has so often been on comparisons to Netflix and its market value and growth On the face of it there is logic there when you compare Netflixs enterprise value of around bn to the value of the whole of the Time Warner group of bn including net debt The issue with that is twofold Firstly if anything Netflix needs to be more like HBO rather than the other way around and secondly Netflix is absurdly overvalued anyway even if it is growing faster Shareholders would be better served in the longrun by the company investing in content in HBO and Warner Brothers and to let the distribution battle play itself out top quality content will make money whichever way it goes The company itself could also get aggressive and go on do acquisitions to strengthen these divisions but there are also adequate opportunities to crosslink their existing divisions more closely In a media segment that has seen plenty of turbulence over the last year Time Warner has been unfairly rocked by cordcutting fears Whichever way the longterm trend ultimately ends up its effect on Time Warners business is very much overblown The shares currently trade at times forward earnings and times trailing twelve month free cash flow offering an attractive entry point even without the potential nearterm catalysts moving forward </div></body></html>
