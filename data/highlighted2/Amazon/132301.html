(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Last week, Google announced the acquisition of Homejoy, a home cleaning services provider.Homejoy set up shop in 2012 by allowing residents to get their homes cleaned for as little as $20 an hour.But the company had not been doing too well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Homejoy , again , <b>may</b> not be identical to what Angie 's List offers , but analysts estimate that this is Google 's way of entering into the home services market .  (Uncertainty) </span>They expect Google to expand into other services including plumbing, cleaning and home repairs.Google also should be able to leverage their search leadership so as to offer users the capability to directly access these local services by clicking on the results of a search query .Angie's List is trying to combat this growing competition by improving their offerings.During the current quarter, they began testing their latest product on mobile called SnapFix.SnapFix enables customers to submit the details of a job by taking a photo and adding a brief description of the task needed.The service has seen positive reviews from customers who are finding it useful in speeding the completion of their home service projects.Service providers also like the product because it is leading to a high conversion of leads .The market is not pleased with their improvement though.Their stock is trading at $4.16 with a market capitalization of $243.43 million.It touched a year high of $8.90 in October last year and had fallen to a low of $3.78 last week.It's not only bigger players that are competing with Angie's List.San Francisco-based Thumbtack also is posing a growing threat.Thumbtack was founded in 2008 as a local service booking engine.It allows its 2 million subscribers to issue a service request and have service providers bid on their request.Their portfolio includes a wide range of a services ranging from accounting, statistical analysis, craft work, 3D modeling, CAD services, legal and tax related services, photography, pet care, repair and technical support, writing, translation and transcription services.Thumbtack earns revenues by charging vendors a fee for their bids.Vendors need to purchase Thumbtack credits to be able to bid on projects.Each bid costs them between 5%-10% of the estimated cost of the project.Analysts estimate that as of last year, Thumbtack had recorded $2 billion in annual gross sales .That puts their revenues anywhere from $100-$200 million annually.They have been venture funded so far with $148.2 million in funding from investors including Google Capital, Javelin Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management and Draper Associates.Their last round of funding was held in August last year when they raised $100 million in a round led by Google Capital at an undisclosed valuation.Source: Angie's List Faces Tougher Competition We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
