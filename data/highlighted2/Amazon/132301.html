( NASDAQ : ANGI ) | Seeking Alpha Jul. 29 , 2015 12:43 PM ET | About : Angie 's List , Inc. ( ANGI ) , Includes : AMZN , YELP by : Sramana Mitra Competition in the home services market is heating up .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Not only tech giants like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) <b>appear</b> interested in the market , but <i>smaller</i> vendors like Thumbtack also are growing rapidly . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>All this competition is making it difficult for established players like Angie's List to stand their ground.Angie's List's (NASDAQ: ANGI ) second quarter revenues grew 10.7% year-over-year to $87.3 million compared with the market's projections of $89.4 million.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Loss per share improved 55 % over the year to $ 0.14 per share and was <i>better</i> than the Street 's forecast of $ 0.17 per share .  (Surprise) </span>Angie's List's has been having significant trouble in growing the paid member base .During the recent quarter, while paid members did grow 12% over the year to 3.17 million, growth has decelerated significantly from the 31% number reported a year ago.Also, average revenue from each of those members has fallen 21.7% to $28.38 as the company continues to offer deals to get new customers to join.Consumers were staying away from Angie's because players like Yelp (NYSE: YELP ) offer similar services for free.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And now , things are about to get <i>tougher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Last year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> entered the local services market through their offering <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Local . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Local offers savings of as much as 75 % on local services . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> not be a site focused on reviews , but it also provides detailed information and reviews on local vendors .  (Uncertainty) </span>Recently , Angie 's List sued <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Local claiming that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Local 's employees obtained access to vendor information on Angie 's List by signing up as members and downloading provider profiles . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Local has not commented on the accusation . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Besides <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , it <b>appears</b> Google also is entering the Home Services market . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Last week, Google announced the acquisition of Homejoy, a home cleaning services provider.Homejoy set up shop in 2012 by allowing residents to get their homes cleaned for as little as $20 an hour.But the company had not been doing too well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Homejoy , again , <b>may</b> not be identical to what Angie 's List offers , but analysts estimate that this is Google 's way of entering into the home services market .  (Uncertainty) </span>They expect Google to expand into other services including plumbing, cleaning and home repairs.Google also should be able to leverage their search leadership so as to offer users the capability to directly access these local services by clicking on the results of a search query .Angie's List is trying to combat this growing competition by improving their offerings.During the current quarter, they began testing their latest product on mobile called SnapFix.SnapFix enables customers to submit the details of a job by taking a photo and adding a brief description of the task needed.The service has seen positive reviews from customers who are finding it useful in speeding the completion of their home service projects.Service providers also like the product because it is leading to a high conversion of leads .The market is not pleased with their improvement though.Their stock is trading at $4.16 with a market capitalization of $243.43 million.It touched a year high of $8.90 in October last year and had fallen to a low of $3.78 last week.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's not only <i>bigger</i> players that are competing with Angie 's List .  (Surprise) </span>San Francisco-based Thumbtack also is posing a growing threat.Thumbtack was founded in 2008 as a local service booking engine.It allows its 2 million subscribers to issue a service request and have service providers bid on their request.Their portfolio includes a wide range of a services ranging from accounting, statistical analysis, craft work, 3D modeling, CAD services, legal and tax related services, photography, pet care, repair and technical support, writing, translation and transcription services.Thumbtack earns revenues by charging vendors a fee for their bids.Vendors need to purchase Thumbtack credits to be able to bid on projects.Each bid costs them between 5%-10% of the estimated cost of the project.Analysts estimate that as of last year, Thumbtack had recorded $2 billion in annual gross sales .That puts their revenues anywhere from $100-$200 million annually.They have been venture funded so far with $148.2 million in funding from investors including Google Capital, Javelin Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management and Draper Associates.Their last round of funding was held in August last year when they raised $100 million in a round led by Google Capital at an undisclosed valuation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Source : Angie 's List Faces <i>Tougher</i> Competition We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
