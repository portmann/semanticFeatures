Wednesday Thanksgiving For People Who Were Out Of Town Or In The Hospital Last Week Thursday and Black Friday All Over Again Because Why Not there are oodles of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>packages landing on shoppers doorsteps In some rare cases those packages might end up on the wrong doorstep so why does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>not seem terribly concerned about getting those items back This was the question posed by Consumerist reader Bobby who didnt realize until after the box was opened that one of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>packages they received this week was actually intended for someone who had previously lived at their address And so Bobby contacted Amazons chat customer support and gave the rep the order number of the items involved The customer service rep then tried to generate a UPS return label for the package but because the ordered items werent associated with Bobbys account the links to print out the return labels did not work Instead Bobby got a message reading Error Occurred This <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account is not associated with the return label or authorization you are trying to access At this point the rep told Bobby to just keep the items Im sorry but since its from different account we are not able to access it reads the transcript shown to Consumerist You can just keep the items or donate Since you are not been charge Thank you for trying to return the item So is this just a case of a rep not wanting to figure out how to send a shipping label that Bobby could actually use Probably not as federal guidelines say pretty clearly that Bobby has every right to keep unordered items and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could get into trouble for pushing a customer to return something they didnt order The Federal Trade Commission rules regarding mail and online orders state that customers who receive unordered merchandise are legally entitled to treat the merchandise as a gift Moreover if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tries to obtain payment for or the return of the unordered merchandise it could be seen as being in violation of the FTC rules and make the company subject to a civil penalty of up to In general these rules are in place to protect consumers against shady mailorder and online businesses that send things to customers without their permission and then demand payment However this expanded FAQ from the FTC on this very subject deals with the issue of honest shipping errors which appears to be the case in Bobbys situation If like Bobby you do receive unordered merchandise youre not legally obligated to tell the seller But if you believe its just an error and want to see if it can be fixed the FTC suggests that you notify the seller and offer to return the merchandise so long as the seller is the one who will pay for all of the return shipping Give the seller a specific and reasonable amount of time say days to pick up the merchandise or arrange to have it returned at no expense to you reads the FAQ Tell the seller that you reserve the right to keep the merchandise or dispose of it after the specified time has passed It never even got to that point in Bobbys dealings with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as the company simply said to keep the unordered merch Weve been down this road before with other readers who received a lot more than the kids toys that Bobby ended up with Back in we told you about two separate readers who each somehow ended up with five iPads from Best Buy even though they had only ordered one Then last year there was
