Competition is heating up and analysts are expecting Netflix to maintain a strong growth rate.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While small price increases <b>may</b> seem harmless to the customer and profitable to the company , it is a daring time to begin making changes to their pricing strategy that will cost all their customers <i>more</i> money for the same services .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Netflix needs to make sure they have the right pricing strategy that balances and suits their business development and profitability goals.At $0.09 per share, Netflix beat Wall Street's earnings estimates by $0.07.Their revenue of $2.105 billion missed estimates of $2.11 billion - which is a miss of about 0.2%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Looking at those numbers head on most investors would n't complain and certainly would not <b>panic</b> like they did .  (Uncertainty) </span>So then, why did they?It was because Netflix forecasted global membership increase at 2.5 million and only came in at 1.7 million.That was the blow that really shook investors and caused a selloff.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And to make matters slightly <i>worse</i> , Netflix actually hit their gross additions target but lost members when the media reported their plans to un-grandfather their tenured members .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As we know , losing existing customers is always the <i>bigger</i> and <i>costlier</i> threat .  (Surprise) </span>So was the selloff an overreaction?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Depends</b> on how you look at it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the one hand the dollars were good , but the underwhelming number of members was highly <b>disappointing</b> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The fact that some of their customers dropped off makes their future bleaker as it can <b>suggest</b> a significant slowdown along their top line .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , Netflix 's plan to un-grandfather customers <b>may</b> ultimately be worth it if the increased revenue from it exceeds the sales lost .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's simply too early to tell how bad Q2 was for Netflix , but Wall Street does n't respond well to <b>uncertainty</b> , which makes it bad for their stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>Below you can see the slowdown in membership growth for Q2.Is It Time To Focus On The Bottom Line?Netflix has consistently shown profitability, however their margins are thin.Their operating margin for the trailing twelve months is an underwhelming 3.3%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix typically has n't had to <b>worry</b> about their earnings too much as Wall Street 's main focus has been on top line growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Nevertheless , they are not turning positive free cash flow , and while they have room to add <i>more</i> debt onto their balance sheet they <b>probably</b> wo n't want to .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Stockholders' equity is only $2.4 billion, which is small given the company's $38 billion market cap.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Their liquidity is fair , but not very strong , which <b>could</b> signal a sign of <i>more</i> debt to come unless they start producing <i>more</i> cash flow .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>While I think Netflix has a few questions to ask themselves, investors should also take note and ask themselves whether their stock is under or overvalued.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Trading at 268 times earnings and 5 times sales <b>seems</b> pricey , given the competition and slowdown in customer growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, a 23.4% 3-year growth rate is enough to keep growth investors motivated.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe the decline we 've seen in Netflix 's price this year is <b>probably</b> warranted .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The stock was previously trading at <i>more</i> than 8 times sales at the end of 2015 , which is a heavy premium to pay given the increasingly competitive landscape of the industry .
