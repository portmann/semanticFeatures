( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Netflix 's simple un-grandfathering plan <b>may</b> have had the biggest impact on their Q2 results causing a huge drop in value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While Netflix maintains strong growth the industry is becoming <i>more</i> competitive with an <b>ambiguous</b> future .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) got hit hard after reporting Q2 results and is still down double-digits.The slowdown in membership growth was the leading cause for the selloff.However, now that the storm has passed, Netflix and their investors need to take a look at the industry and what Netflix's future in it looks like.Here are four questions Netflix and their investors should ask: Netflix revolutionized Pay TV, dominating the space and wiping out the old school Blockbuster model.But people tend to see opportunity in other's success, which is what happened with Netflix.We all know that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has created their own streaming service , but that is far from the only threat Netflix faces . Devices created by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Roku, etc., have opened up viewers to many different streaming apps which aren't just cheap but free - and isn't that the way of the millennial generation?I think the biggest threat that faces all Pay TV services aren't each other, but the same threat music faced - free.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The hardware technology already exists for consumers to steal copyright content and stream <b>almost</b> any movie , show or even live event for free .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's difficult to predict how much of an effect illegal streaming will have on the future of the industry due to a <b>variety</b> of factors .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But in a worst case scenario , Netflix and other Pay TV services <b>could</b> face an ugly fate .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Now there is the <b>possibility</b> that I am completely wrong and <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> people wo n't start stealing content or it will become highly restricted .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If that is the case, Netflix is still going to face increased competition from some heavy hitters.Hulu , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , HBO , Showtime , etc. , are all direct competitors now . This is not something Netflix has had to face until recently.It is not just about buying old content anymore, but about creating new content.This is not necessarily a bad thing as Netflix has gained original movie and TV show content, however it does signal the evolution of Pay TV service, which shows it is becoming very competitive with strong established players.No matter how you look at it, the Pay TV space is becoming increasingly competitive and the once disrupter is becoming disrupted.How Successful Will Their Pricing Strategy Be?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As an industry becomes <i>more</i> competitive , pricing strategy usually becomes <i>more</i> competitive .  (Surprise) </span>Pay TV should be no exception to this rule.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix <b>may</b> only be raising their costs a buck or two but it was n't received so well by their customers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Their rollout plan to un-grandfather their customers so they can raise their prices might seem like it will simply grow their top line in the short term , but <b>could</b> cost them valuable customers over the long term .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Netflix is facing <i>stronger</i> competition now than they ever had before , and raising prices has motivated their existing customers to exit and a <b>possible</b> move to their competitors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>One of Netflix 's competitors , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , is known for suppressing prices to maintain strong growth and squeeze out their competition . Competition is heating up and analysts are expecting Netflix to maintain a strong growth rate.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While small price increases <b>may</b> seem harmless to the customer and profitable to the company , it is a daring time to begin making changes to their pricing strategy that will cost all their customers <i>more</i> money for the same services .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Netflix needs to make sure they have the right pricing strategy that balances and suits their business development and profitability goals.At $0.09 per share, Netflix beat Wall Street's earnings estimates by $0.07.Their revenue of $2.105 billion missed estimates of $2.11 billion - which is a miss of about 0.2%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Looking at those numbers head on most investors would n't complain and certainly would not <b>panic</b> like they did .  (Uncertainty) </span>So then, why did they?It was because Netflix forecasted global membership increase at 2.5 million and only came in at 1.7 million.That was the blow that really shook investors and caused a selloff.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And to make matters slightly <i>worse</i> , Netflix actually hit their gross additions target but lost members when the media reported their plans to un-grandfather their tenured members .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As we know , losing existing customers is always the <i>bigger</i> and <i>costlier</i> threat .  (Surprise) </span>So was the selloff an overreaction?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Depends</b> on how you look at it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the one hand the dollars were good , but the underwhelming number of members was highly <b>disappointing</b> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The fact that some of their customers dropped off makes their future bleaker as it can <b>suggest</b> a significant slowdown along their top line .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , Netflix 's plan to un-grandfather customers <b>may</b> ultimately be worth it if the increased revenue from it exceeds the sales lost .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's simply too early to tell how bad Q2 was for Netflix , but Wall Street does n't respond well to <b>uncertainty</b> , which makes it bad for their stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>Below you can see the slowdown in membership growth for Q2.Is It Time To Focus On The Bottom Line?Netflix has consistently shown profitability, however their margins are thin.Their operating margin for the trailing twelve months is an underwhelming 3.3%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix typically has n't had to <b>worry</b> about their earnings too much as Wall Street 's main focus has been on top line growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Nevertheless , they are not turning positive free cash flow , and while they have room to add <i>more</i> debt onto their balance sheet they <b>probably</b> wo n't want to .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Stockholders' equity is only $2.4 billion, which is small given the company's $38 billion market cap.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Their liquidity is fair , but not very strong , which <b>could</b> signal a sign of <i>more</i> debt to come unless they start producing <i>more</i> cash flow .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>While I think Netflix has a few questions to ask themselves, investors should also take note and ask themselves whether their stock is under or overvalued.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Trading at 268 times earnings and 5 times sales <b>seems</b> pricey , given the competition and slowdown in customer growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, a 23.4% 3-year growth rate is enough to keep growth investors motivated.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe the decline we 've seen in Netflix 's price this year is <b>probably</b> warranted .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The stock was previously trading at <i>more</i> than 8 times sales at the end of 2015 , which is a heavy premium to pay given the increasingly competitive landscape of the industry .
