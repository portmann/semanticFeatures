Recall that puts (short for put options) are contracts that give you the right to sell a security for a specified price (the strike price) before a specified date (the expiration date).And calls (short for call options) are contracts that give you the right to sell security for a specified price before a specified date.A collar is a type of hedge in which you buy a put option for protection, and, at the same time, sell a call option, which gives another investor the right to buy the security from you at a higher strike price, by the same expiration date.The proceeds from selling the call option can offset at least part of the cost of buying the put option.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An optimal collar is a collar that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest price , while not capping your <b>possible</b> upside by more than you specify .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In a nutshell , with a collar you may be able to reduce the cost of hedging , in return for giving up some <b>possible</b> upside .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 're going to use Portfolio Armor 's iOS app to find an <b>optimal</b> collar to hedge Netflix below , but you do n't need the app to do this ; you can find <b>optimal</b> collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined, or use the app, two pieces of information you'll need to supply (in addition to the number of shares you're looking to hedge) are your "cap" and your "threshold"."Cap" refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly.A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , if you 're hedging over a 6-month period , and you think a security wo n't appreciate more than 8 % over that time frame , then it <b>might</b> make sense to use 8 % as a cap : you do n't think the security is going to do better than that , so you 're willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the example below , we started off using a cap of 3.5 % , the potential return our site calculated for Netflix , but we raised it to 5 % , because that was as high as we <b>could</b> raise it without raising the hedging cost .  (Uncertainty) </span>All else equal though, the lower the cap, the less expensive it will be to hedge.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other term , `` threshold '' , refers to the maximum decline you are willing to <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This will vary depending on your <b>risk</b> tolerance .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the purposes of the example below, we've used a threshold of 7%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you are more risk averse , you <b>could</b> use a smaller threshold , and you are less risk averse , you <b>could</b> use a larger one .  (Uncertainty) </span>All else equal though, the higher the threshold, the cheaper it will be to hedge.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As of Friday 's close , this was the <b>optimal</b> collar to hedge 1,000 shares of NFLX against a > 7 % drop over the next several months , while not capping an investor 's upside by less than 5 % : As you can see in the first part of the <b>optimal</b> collar above , the cost of the put leg was $ 10,550 , or 10.14 % as a percentage of position value .  (Uncertainty) </span>But if you look at the second part of the collar below, you'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was $12,500, or 12.01% of position value.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So the net cost of this <b>optimal</b> collar was negative , meaning an investor would have collected $ 1,950 more from selling the call leg than he paid for the puts .  (Uncertainty) </span>Note that, too be conservative, the cost of the hedge above was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls; in practice, an investor can often buy puts for less (at some price between the bid and the ask), and sell calls for more (again, at some price between the bid and the ask), so, in reality, an investor would likely have collected more than $1,950 when opening this collar.Although the threshold on this collar is 7%, and thresholds are calculated to take into account positive hedging costs, they don't take into account negative hedging costs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , the worst case scenario in this case , when taking into account the hedging cost , would be a decline of less than 7 % : <b>assuming</b> , conservatively , a negative cost of 1.87 % , the maximum drawdown here would be 5.13 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>Similarly, the best case scenario wouldn't be 5%, the level at which this collar is capped, but 5% + 1.87% = 6.87%.Tagged: ETFs & Portfolio Strategy , Services</div></body></html>
