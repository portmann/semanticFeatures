( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Oct. . 2 , 2015 12:55 PM ET | About : Amazon.com , Inc. ( AMZN ) , Includes : AAPL , GOOG , GOOGL by : Dan Rayburn <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has announced they will stop selling streaming boxes and devices from Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) including Chromecast , Nexus Player and Apple TV . Marketplace sellers are no longer allowed to list new streaming boxes/sticks from Apple and Google and current products will be removed for sale on October 29th.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> says they have made the decision to stop listing these items for sale since they do n't currently run <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Prime streaming service and that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants to `` avoid customer <b>confusion</b> . '' (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While that sounds like a weak excuse on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's part , we do n't know all of the details and it <b>could</b> be that Apple and Google wo n't allow <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on their devices . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If that 's the case , it makes sense that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would fight back by pulling Apple and Google devices from their store . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> makes very little money on devices that cost $ 35 and $ 99 , so the decision is n't based on revenue . It 's a strategic decision on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's part . But it does hurt <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's customer experience as one of the main reasons I shop at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is due to their selection . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Having <i>less</i> inventory is a bad thing for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> overall . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While some have <b>suggested</b> that this will impact sales for Apple and Google , it really wo n't .  (Uncertainty) </span>With Apple having their own stores, and Chromecast being sold in every store imaginable, consumers won't have a hard time getting them.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Makes it a bit of an annoyance for someone like me that shops at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , but if I really want an Apple TV or Chromecast , my local Staples will have them , as well as many other stores . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But this is an interesting development to watch because if this is really about avoiding `` customer <b>confusion</b> , '' does <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> plan to stop selling smart TVs that do n't support Prime streaming ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>What about Blu-ray players?How far is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> going to take this ? My guess is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> only cares about devices made by Apple and Google and those will be the only devices that are impacted . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If that 's true , it means this is n't about avoiding <b>confusion</b> at all , it 's simply <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> flexing their power against their competitors . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But the real question we all want to know the answer to is if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> made this decision on their own , or if Apple and Google forced their hand . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'm sure something will leak out at some point and we will hear <i>more</i> details behind this decision .  (Surprise) </span>Updated 10:17 pm ET - One of the two companies mentioned reached out to me to after I published to tell me that they are not blocking <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> from being on their box . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They wo n't allow me to quote them or say which of the two companies it is , but it <b>appears</b> this is purely a decision driven by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> alone .
