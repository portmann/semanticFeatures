So they've definitely arrived as being not just library licensing entities, but those entities looking for more kind of great content that you produce out of a Nelvana studio.Rob, its Tom.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't have a specific number on that , but what we <b>could</b> say is that it 's up from low double digit from a percentage point of view .  (Uncertainty) </span>Perfect, thank you very much and I think you've given us some great color in terms of how you see the Disney launch playing out over the course of the year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the revenue side , I was <b>wondering</b> is there any kind of changing cadence on the cost side or should be expect it to kind of track similar to the revenues ?  (Surprise) </span>Well, I guess -- it's Tom.I guess from a cost point of view is that I think initially the cost will be hired going back to Doug’s initial comment is that we’ll take us a little longer to roll out the other two Disney channel.So as a result the revenue pacing will be behind, but what we had said I think back in July and certainly in previous conversations on this subject is that we will show year-over-year growth for the year.Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions.Doug so just to follow-up on that last point that Tom made, you're still calling for EBITDA accretion on the Disney Channel.Am I correct and if that's the case, is it fair to say based on for the comments you made that the higher programming cost relatively speaking would mean that in the first half of the year it would be a bit of a drag on the overall results, but potentially offsetting in the back half?Is that the cadence in terms of the EBITDA drag and tailwind that we should be looking at?Okay.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And just maybe for Tom , Tom just with respect to the strength in the free cash flow , one thing I 've noticed is the ratio between the program amortization and the actual cash payment , that ratio <b>seems</b> to have shifted a little bit in 2015 in your favor obviously helping the 2015 free cash flow numbers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Should we think of that sort of new let 's call it new ratio as a way that we should look at when we forecast beyond '15 because historically I know that the cash payments have been a bit higher than the amortization in this case it was <b>nearly</b> one for one , in fact it was little bit less than one ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Okay.Couple of good questions there and a couple of comments is that I think one of the things that would have impacted us this year compared to last year from a free cash flow point of view is that some of our license were changing from a cash spend to on accrual spend.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So in prior years we <b>might</b> have been putting more cash out of the door .  (Uncertainty) </span>This year we would have put a little less out of to door.As I look at it from a working capital point of view, if you look at our long term payables and our short term payables, the numbers are pretty comparable and that clearly we will have incremental program expenditures in the coming year because of the Disney and Nick transactions.But as we said in our previous answer, our goal is to offset that with increased revenue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It will drag a bit in the first part of the year , but as we said <b>hopefully</b> it will catch up .  (Uncertainty) </span>The challenge for us is to make sure that our cash outflows match the revenue inflows and therefore the real challenge for us is to manage our working capital for 2016.And I guess the other comment that I would make is that we talked about the fact that we had our record free cash flow of $200 million, but I should say when we pulled out the benefit of our gain on go pro, the number drops down to closer to $180 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And as we look at 2016 , the other piece of information that we would provide you with is that our capital expenditures in 2016 will <b>probably</b> be in the $ 25 million to $ 30 million range compared to $ 16 million this year .  (Uncertainty) </span>And then I guess the other part of the formula would be that we are looking for -- our goal is to grow our revenue, grow our EBITDA.So those would be some of the factors that you would be looking at in our free cash flow.We said that we're not providing specific guidance on EBITDA or free cash flow, but what you can be assured of is that a company will continue to generate strong free cash flow as we deliver against the strategic priorities that Doug outlined in his comments.Yes.Hi, thanks guys.Couple of questions, one radio, is it unrealistic to expect just to get back to flatter part of the revenue growth in the first quarter given you had a couple of consecutive books of better ratings?I think I wouldn’t expect revenue growth in the first quarter.I would expect revenue growth in the fiscal year.That is our objective.Thank you for noting our nice books we have had.We're very pleased with the results thus far, but we’re still hitting bit of a soft patch.And then in Toronto despite lift in ratings, we've got our fantastic blue days just in driving a lot of media consumption and starting to add dollars right now.So I wouldn’t want to wish that to change it for the moment to be perfectly honest with you.So I think it's more like a Q2, Q3, Q4 story for RADIO.Okay.And a separate question, you just had to go through these negotiations with the BDUs over the Disney channel.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'm <b>wondering</b> if that 's given any insight into other worlds going to unfold with pick and pay .  (Surprise) </span>Did you factor into those discussions what the current rate is as Disney sold this part of a bundle in most cases versus what it will change to if a year and year now people think Disney as their only channel.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We -- that 's a good question and I might take the liberty of <b>may</b> be answering a different question , but I guess at the same answer .  (Uncertainty) </span>What became really evident when we sat down to negotiate the Disney channel with our BDU partners was the level of analytical radio that they're bringing to the assessment of any channel in this new world.And what is true is that the BDU system our partners recognized two things when it comes to subscriber negotiations for channel.First they recognized audience delivery.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So the extent to which your top ranked channel like a W for example , we 've enormous <b>confident</b> that when it comes time to negotiate W in the future with any BDU the bias will be to reward those services that drive the most audiences and that 's pretty logical .  (Uncertainty) </span>But its begin seen now on a -- in a new level of fact based analytics.If that something I would add, in a Disney Channel case, all the BDUs were thrilled to be able to bring a brand that heretofore had not lived as its own channel in Canada through the audiences.They acknowledged the investment that we had made to bring that brand into our portfolio.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They recognize that the another outcome <b>might</b> have been that that brand <b>might</b> have ended up within over the top strategy for a call question we had earlier and so there was a mutual understanding that there was a commensurate rate that we should receive for that investment .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sorry if I missed it a little bit Doug but just to be clear , do you have any increased <b>confidence</b> now that this analytical rigger at the BDUs will allow for some volume lost in a pick and pay world to be offset by higher rates per signal or is that , I know you ca n't give specifics , but directionally you have some increased <b>confidence</b> now .  (Uncertainty) </span>Directionally I do, yes and directionally I would say the other thing is when remember now the -- we have a March date where the BDUs have to offer bundles of 10 services and then they have to offer A La Carte in December of '16.And what we've done in our Kids portfolio I think is completely emblematic of one of our key priorities is executional excellence and since that we've repositioned TELETOON Retro to cartoon network.We moved around content to make that content our brand B analogous to the U.S. service, which is extremely strong.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We also strengthened the TELETOON brand and so we believe that as a result of those decision that portfolio both as a bundle and as an A La Carte will have great value and is in the best position <b>possible</b> in this regulatory environment .  (Uncertainty) </span>Well thank you, operator and thank you everyone for your interest and your questions and your support for Corus Entertainment.I want to take this movement to thank the team here at Corus ever as completely focused on execution and will continue to deliver against these priorities that we talked about today.We look forward to talking to you again in future until then go Jays.Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So our reproduction policy is as follows : You <b>may</b> quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com .
