During the last quarter, IDC reported that "non-x86 servers experienced a revenue decline of -14.0% year-over-year to $3.0 billion.This was the fourteenth consecutive quarter of revenue decline in the non-x86 server segment."According to Kuba Stolarski , Research Manager, Enterprise Servers at IDC: "As we look forward over the next few years, server demand will continue to see aggressive hyperscale growth, as well as interrelated greenfield opportunities attached to Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.As IoT grows, generating increasing amounts of data, network traffic and demand for real-time analytics, new server designs and new methods of deploying compute capability will continue the transformation of the server market."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Increasing Data Center Group Revenues Okay ... I 've been rambling ( <b>believe</b> me , there are many other facts to be quoted in support of Intel 's dominance in Data Center growth ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Let's focus on increasing DCG revenues.I'll divide this discussion into two parts: 1.)Increases due to industry growth; and 2.)Increases due to better products.First, some basics.Intel's DCG sales in 2014 were worth $14.4 billion.We don't know much more than that from Intel data that's publicly available.There's no financial breakdown among parts of the data center (e.g., processor, SSD, communications).We also don't know how much is sold to OEMs and how much is sold direct to companies that make their own data center servers.We know squat because Intel's ability to compete would be damaged if the competition knew how much Intel sold of what to whom for how much.We do know some information on pricing and global industry-wide sales.Intel provides details of the prices for the various products that it sells, but we don't know how many of each it sells.IDC and Gartner provide information on how many servers are sold, and a split between non-x86 and x86 units.If I guess at an average price of $1,500 (likely higher) per processor, and using IDC/Gartner data indicating 5.6 million Intel servers are sold each year, I arrive at $8.4 billion of $14.4 billion overall DCG sales are from processor sales.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Seems</b> low .  (Uncertainty) </span>How about $2,000 per server and $11.2 billion is from processor sales?The rest, between $3 billion and $6 billion, is then from other products sold into data centers.Given the gross level of real data, it looks like we are stuck with overall adjustments to DCG earnings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If connected devices are growing from 6 billion to 50 billion in six years , the annual growth rate for data centers is <b>approximately</b> 50 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's huge.This 50% per year growth is being reduced by data center infrastructure efficiency/utilization improvements.If the company's programs increase the efficiency/utilization of data centers by 30% per year, then the net growth in data center expansion is 20% per year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> that Intel 's market share stays the same , then its DCG sales should grow 20 % per year .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is pretty close to the company's guidance of 15% per year.If Intel, by increasing data center efficiency/utilization by 30% per year, is able to increase average selling prices by 10% per year, then the company's DCG profits increase 30% per year.This is pretty close to what happened over the past year, with sales increasing 18% and profits increasing 31%.In addition to data center growth (18%/year) and increased profits (30%/year), we need to add Intel's increasing share of sales to data centers... this is not an increase in processor sales, but an increase in sales of other components of the data center.With a larger share of data center sales, the company's profits get even larger.Intel has been quietly buying companies that increase Intel's ability to provide all the products needed to build a complete data center.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With this approach , Intel 's $ 14.4 billion in DCG market share <b>could</b> increase to be a larger portion of the $ 50 billion IDC identifies as being spent annually on servers , and a larger percentage of the $ 120 billion to be spent on data center infrastructure over the next several years .  (Uncertainty) </span>My estimate is that Intel's DCG sales will grow 20-25% annually (not the 15% annual growth rate guided by the company), and that DCG profits will increase 30-40% annually.This creates a range of profits for 2015 of $9.5 to $10 billion.The 30% increase in YOY net revenues increase is shown in these graphs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> that PC sales remain flat at the 2013 rate ( $ 33.3 b in sales ) , mobile reduces its losses by $ 800m , IoT continues its growth and the remaining groups do n't change , I see DCG profits resulting in total Intel net revenue of $ 17.9-18 .6 for 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span>With earnings remaining at 76% of net revenue and no change in shares, this results in a range of earnings from $2.70-2.80 per share.Using the end-of-2014 P/E of 15.6, I arrive at a share price of between $42 and $44 for the end of 2015.Remember, this is without any improvement in PC or mobile sales (compared to 2013).Improvements in these areas would increase Intel's earnings and share price further.Source: Data Center Group Drives Intel's Profits Disclosure: The author is long INTC.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
