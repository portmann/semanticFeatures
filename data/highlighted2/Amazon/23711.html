(Surprise) </span>The remainder of Intel's business supports DCG profits.One of the themes of Brian Krzanich since becoming CEO in 2013 has been to grow Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) sales through non-PC areas, with Data Center sales as the biggest initial driver of growth.At the Intel Investor Day in November 2014 , the company announced that for the next four years, the Data Center Group (DCG) sales would grow 15% each year.This follows an 18% increase in DCG sales revenue between 2013 and 2014.Compounded, this amounts to a doubling of Data Center sales between 2013 and 2018.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As impressive as the growth in DCG sales is , the growth in profits is even <i>bigger</i> .  (Surprise) </span>From 2013 to 2014, while DCG sales grew 18%, DCG profits grew 31%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In 2011 , DCG operating income represented <i>less</i> than 30 % of Intel 's overall operating revenue .  (Surprise) </span>In 2014, the group's operating income of $7.3b represented 47% of the total Intel operating income of $15.3b. With a reduction in business desktop sales in the first quarter of 2015, DCG operating income is likely over 50% of total Intel operating income.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Some would say , `` But the PC Group profits are <i>bigger</i> than the DCG profits . ''  (Surprise) </span>That's true, and the PC Group will no longer exist as a reporting unit starting this quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If one combines the old PC Group , the Mobile and Communications Group and Other , then one can understand why the Data Center Group produces <i>more</i> than half of Intel 's net profit .  (Surprise) </span>That's where Intel DCG is now.Where is the DCG going, how will it get there and what will the DCG impact on Intel stock price be?The reader is reminded that Intel is one big beast of a company, with its hands in everything that computes and communicates.Add to this that in order to remain competitive, the company must limit the information that it makes publicly available.This makes complete understanding of Intel impossible, but we work at it.The following discussion is pretty complicated and long.If you just want the bottom line, you can skip ahead to the Increasing Data Center Group Revenues section or all the way to the Impact of DCG on Intel Share Price section.Diane Bryant, senior vice president and general manager of the Intel Data Center Group, provided a great outline of Intel DCG at the Intel Investor Day 2014 (video and pdf links) ."Big industry trends fuel data center growth" "Investing to win across workloads and segments" Big industry trends focus on a move to a digital service economy and Jevon's paradox .Let's focus on how these areas will likely impact Intel's DCG sales.Between now and 2020, devices connected to the internet are expected to increase from about 9 billion today (6-12 billion) to about 60 billion in 2020 ( 50 per Cisco and 75 per Morgan Stanley) .That's getting close to 10 devices for every person on earth.Intel's General Manager of Cloud Services , at the Structure conference in June 2014, pointed out that 2.5 billion people are currently connected to the internet - with another 2 billion coming soon.In the future, everything that's connected to electricity will compute and be connected to the internet.Every 400 smartphones drive the need for a server in a data center.For every 100 wearable devices, another server is needed in the data center.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Over the next several years , <i>more</i> than $ 120 billion will be spent on data center infrastructure .  (Surprise) </span>The graph below is from a 2011 report indicating the growth in cloud services, which is just one part of the market served by data centers.The numbers on the left are billions of USD.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Then , in 2014 , Forrester indicated that growth was 20 % <i>faster</i> than estimated in 2011 .  (Surprise) </span>In 2014, Intel's DCG sales were about $15 billion.Is there room for the company's growth within the $120 billion to be spent on data center infrastructure over the next several years?I am investing on it.Intel is focusing on what it calls the Rise of the Digital Services Economy.One of Intel 's strategies is to accelerate disruption of the way we do business by enabling digital services that allow companies like Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , Airbnb , Uber , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) to exist and thrive . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These companies are only <b>possible</b> because of innovations led by Intel 's low-cost computing technology .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The cloud allowed these services to exist , and in turn , the services these companies provide are increasing the demand for a <i>larger</i> cloud infrastructure .  (Surprise) </span>This is the essence of Javon's paradox.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Today 's IT challenges : 2-3 weeks to provision new servers ( networking , storage , processors ) , 66 % annual growth in mobile data traffic , 40 % annual growth in storage , 90 % of data is unstructured , server utilization <i>less</i> than 50 % .  (Surprise) </span>The current data centers are insufficient - not just size, but structure needs to change dramatically.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Intel provides a top-to-bottom solution stack : Workload optimized silicon , breaking out of the box with new ways to manage data center throughput and storage , <b>optimize</b> delivery of data center services , unlock the data vault .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company innovates functions and then integrates them into the silicon processor.It provides a full range of processors for the data center: ATOM, XEON, XEON PHI.All of these have a place in the data center to meet specific customer needs.Another focus of Intel is on Rack Scale Architecture (RSA).The key to RSA is an orchestration layer that allows the application (the app) to define the virtual network, virtual processor and virtual memory that are needed for that application.Intel is working with partners to allow the data center to automatically, in seconds, spin up or down or sideways to meet the demands of millions of applications, save power and increase data center utilization.Resources are pooled, and each application gets the resources it needs at that instant from all resources in the data center.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whether a data center builds or buys servers , the keys include performance , security and workload <b>optimization</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>New data center infrastructure powered by Intel cloud technology can increase performance and <b>optimization</b> by about 30 % from systems from just a few years ago .  (Uncertainty) </span>The cloud is now a whole new platform for computing.First, the platform was mainframes, then desktop computers, then networks with desktops, and then the networks were expanded with laptops, smartphones and tablets.Now, the cloud is the latest platform for computing across all devices.In 2014, Intel invested over $800 million in companies that accelerate Big Data analytics.Intel sees that it not only needs to develop silicon, but enable an architecture that's robust, modular, scalable and efficient to handle cloud growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then , the company <b>optimizes</b> those services to ensure data centers can easily build a cloud , deploy the cloud and monetize Big Data services .  (Uncertainty) </span>Intel sees that its work to accelerate development of improved cloud services is best for its server OEMs, direct data center clients, the clients served by data centers... everyone.Remember that over $120 billion will be spent on cloud infrastructure over the next several years.Diane Bryant, general manager of Intel's Data Center Group, makes it clear that software-defined infrastructure is a key element of Intel's strategy in the data center world.In essence, software-defined infrastructure allows one application to run across thousands of servers.This approach makes custom processor solutions a very effective way to have one application run efficiently on numerous processors.A big step in this direction is Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) married to a Xeon processor package.This package can double the performance of a processor related to a specific application.An FPGA is flexible and reprogrammable on the fly as application requirements change.An FPGA is an on-ramp to custom processor solutions.Once shown to be effective, an FPGA/Xeon can be duplicated in hundreds or thousands of custom processors.An FPGA also can be deployed broadly in a data center to allow reprogramming of an FPGA to accelerate high-demand functions as the demand for functions change.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> on FPGAs can be found here .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Utilization of compute resources in a data center today is often 50 % or <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span>This utilization can be increased to 80% by rack scale solutions and software-defined infrastructure.Both public cloud and telco service providers can avail themselves of this increase in utilization by using the latest Intel data center products.Some say that software-defined architecture works against Intel profits, since it reduces the number of processors needed to process the same throughput.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Intel 's perspective is the same as with Moore 's Law : process <i>more</i> data for <i>lower</i> cost , and thereby increase sales and margins .  (Surprise) </span>Intel's approach to competition includes the idea that, "Only the paranoid survive."This, then, is carried out in the following approach: Whatever it is, it needs to run best on Intel.Yes, data center people are looking for a second source of data center processors - customers will evaluate new sources.The competitive advantage of Intel is its constant development of improved, lower-cost technology, and the fact that in a data center, a homogeneous environment (everything running on Intel architecture) always results in the best overall performance and reliability.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Data Center is as an example is sticking with Intel , because competitors `` are just not moving fast enough , '' the cost savings are `` not quite there , '' and `` Intel is <i>more</i> receptive '' to meeting <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's custom needs . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>During the last quarter, IDC reported that "non-x86 servers experienced a revenue decline of -14.0% year-over-year to $3.0 billion.This was the fourteenth consecutive quarter of revenue decline in the non-x86 server segment."According to Kuba Stolarski , Research Manager, Enterprise Servers at IDC: "As we look forward over the next few years, server demand will continue to see aggressive hyperscale growth, as well as interrelated greenfield opportunities attached to Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.As IoT grows, generating increasing amounts of data, network traffic and demand for real-time analytics, new server designs and new methods of deploying compute capability will continue the transformation of the server market."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Increasing Data Center Group Revenues Okay ... I 've been rambling ( <b>believe</b> me , there are many other facts to be quoted in support of Intel 's dominance in Data Center growth ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Let's focus on increasing DCG revenues.I'll divide this discussion into two parts: 1.)Increases due to industry growth; and 2.)<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Increases due to <i>better</i> products .  (Surprise) </span>First, some basics.Intel's DCG sales in 2014 were worth $14.4 billion.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We do n't know much <i>more</i> than that from Intel data that 's publicly available .  (Surprise) </span>There's no financial breakdown among parts of the data center (e.g., processor, SSD, communications).We also don't know how much is sold to OEMs and how much is sold direct to companies that make their own data center servers.We know squat because Intel's ability to compete would be damaged if the competition knew how much Intel sold of what to whom for how much.We do know some information on pricing and global industry-wide sales.Intel provides details of the prices for the various products that it sells, but we don't know how many of each it sells.IDC and Gartner provide information on how many servers are sold, and a split between non-x86 and x86 units.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If I guess at an average price of $ 1,500 ( likely <i>higher</i> ) per processor , and using IDC/Gartner data indicating 5.6 million Intel servers are sold each year , I arrive at $ 8.4 billion of $ 14.4 billion overall DCG sales are from processor sales .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Seems</b> low .  (Uncertainty) </span>How about $2,000 per server and $11.2 billion is from processor sales?The rest, between $3 billion and $6 billion, is then from other products sold into data centers.Given the gross level of real data, it looks like we are stuck with overall adjustments to DCG earnings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If connected devices are growing from 6 billion to 50 billion in six years , the annual growth rate for data centers is <b>approximately</b> 50 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's huge.This 50% per year growth is being reduced by data center infrastructure efficiency/utilization improvements.If the company's programs increase the efficiency/utilization of data centers by 30% per year, then the net growth in data center expansion is 20% per year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> that Intel 's market share stays the same , then its DCG sales should grow 20 % per year .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is pretty close to the company's guidance of 15% per year.If Intel, by increasing data center efficiency/utilization by 30% per year, is able to increase average selling prices by 10% per year, then the company's DCG profits increase 30% per year.This is pretty close to what happened over the past year, with sales increasing 18% and profits increasing 31%.In addition to data center growth (18%/year) and increased profits (30%/year), we need to add Intel's increasing share of sales to data centers... this is not an increase in processor sales, but an increase in sales of other components of the data center.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With a <i>larger</i> share of data center sales , the company 's profits get even <i>larger</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Intel has been quietly buying companies that increase Intel's ability to provide all the products needed to build a complete data center.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With this approach , Intel 's $ 14.4 billion in DCG market share <b>could</b> increase to be a <i>larger</i> portion of the $ 50 billion IDC identifies as being spent annually on servers , and a <i>larger</i> percentage of the $ 120 billion to be spent on data center infrastructure over the next several years .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>My estimate is that Intel's DCG sales will grow 20-25% annually (not the 15% annual growth rate guided by the company), and that DCG profits will increase 30-40% annually.This creates a range of profits for 2015 of $9.5 to $10 billion.The 30% increase in YOY net revenues increase is shown in these graphs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> that PC sales remain flat at the 2013 rate ( $ 33.3 b in sales ) , mobile reduces its losses by $ 800m , IoT continues its growth and the remaining groups do n't change , I see DCG profits resulting in total Intel net revenue of $ 17.9-18 .6 for 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span>With earnings remaining at 76% of net revenue and no change in shares, this results in a range of earnings from $2.70-2.80 per share.Using the end-of-2014 P/E of 15.6, I arrive at a share price of between $42 and $44 for the end of 2015.Remember, this is without any improvement in PC or mobile sales (compared to 2013).Improvements in these areas would increase Intel's earnings and share price further.Source: Data Center Group Drives Intel's Profits Disclosure: The author is long INTC.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) The author wrote this article themselves , and it expresses their own opinions .
