style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Dash Button is another in a long line of services offered by the internet giant meant to offer convenience to us as consumers In essence it is taking one click ordering and putting it on steroids through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime If youve not heard much about the Dash Button news started coming out about it last week its a pilot service currently being offered by invitation only toAmazon Prime members with plans to roll it out more widely later in the year Like many others we have fairly busy lives and use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to buy a number of different products and services AsPrime members we were intriguedthought it would be good to see if the convenience promised by the new service lives up to the hype If you take a look at the picture from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>below the Dash Button is relatively small maybe about the size of a pack of gum The button can beattached to any product and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>currently lists a little over items available for the dash button Once you see youre running low on a Dashcompatible item you simply press the button and it orders said item for you Its very simple and easy which is exactly the point As a parent of three little ones I must admit that this concerns me a bit as the last thing I want is to wake up one day to cases of toilet paper or poundsof cat food on my doorstep <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was mindful of this and made the Dash Button capable of processing only one order at a time It is also important to point out that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Dash Button is connected via WiFi to Amazonsphone app and allows up to minutes to cancel an order So that does relieve some of the stress of getting cases of macaroni and cheese tomorrow because our kids thought it was a good idea to take over meal planning for the house You might also be thinking that the Dash Button is very similar to the Subscribe and Save service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>providesand youd be correct We use Subscribe and Save for several items in our home that we know we go throughon a regular basis and use it as a way to save time and not have to step foot into WalMart However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has no intent of killing off the Subscribe and Save service with the introduction of the Dash Button It is simply meant to be yet another feature to further entrench them into your purchase decision Concerns overthe risk of getting mass quantities of one item ordered by accident aside I think the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Dash Button is a novel idea In essence if you know what brands you spend on then it simplifies the act of purchasing it Good or bad it takes something routine that we all do every day purchase products and makes it easier Weve discussed shopping by brand name before on the site and believe we all have brands we will spend more for I know that I do and that my wife does and many others do as well Personally speaking I like to spend for value In many instances that means getting a lower priced item but in a number of instances I will spend more to get the name brand item because I either prefer it or because it is a quality item Arguably if there is a specific brand you purchase itll make it that much easier for you to buy the product <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is all about convenience Not only that they want to entrench themselves as the go to source for most anything you will buy or consume You can watch movies and TV shows through the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire TV Stick get your groceries delivered and everything in between For many like us that is a great convenience to have But can that convenience cause you to overspend I would argue that it could We joined <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime at the end of as a means to get the free shipping and had been something we were debating for several months to get away from shopping at WalMart I will be honest I know having the Prime membership has made it easy to overspend The overspending hasnt been anything crazy and well within what we can afford but its overspending none the less Now with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Dash Button you get a visual reminder of something being low For some this could make them feel like they have to buy another item In other instances like an office manager needing to buy more replacement KCups for the office Keuring machine or something like that the convenience could be worth it Only you can saywhether the convenience of one click ordering would cause you to overspend or not Ive read a number of articles over the past few days addressing the concern that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Dash Button could be bad for brands The argument goes that we as consumers would get mindlessly locked into buying a specific brand and avoid other possibilities Being an advertiser myself I believe this is a somewhat valid concern One click ordering could make it more difficult for new brands to stand out effectively limiting consumer choice As a mindful consumer though I see how it could make it more difficult to find deals that would result in us spending less money Admittedly we dont spend as much time as we used to scouring for deals but thats not to say that weve given up on it altogether We still try to find ways to cut expenses as time allows and on one level having the added convenience of the Dash Button could cause some to give up on that What are your thoughts on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Dash Button Is the

April Its a cool idea if you really really like a certain brand of something and plan on buying it no matter what But Im afraid that the majority of people will probably overuse this and way overspend when there is probably a cheaper alternative out there I wish the dash button was for good for groceries thats where I always find myself forgetting to pick things up from the store Then again I could always just use a list I had the same concern as you what is stopping my wife and I from accidentally ordering the same thing Good to see there is a catch all in place there While I think this is good in theory it concerns me that it is just one more step towards being more lazy Next thing you know food products will have this ability and we wont even need to go to the store For some people this is
