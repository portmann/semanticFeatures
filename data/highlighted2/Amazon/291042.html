(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) growth is hugely influenced by its loyalty program . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Prime subscribers account for <b>almost</b> half of purchases made on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's marketplace since early last year . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It is therefore great news that the company is doing its best to retain and attract new Prime subscribers by giving a 20% discount on new games.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is a great way for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to <i>better</i> monetize the huge population of gamers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Giving discounts on new games is an easy way to attract <i>more</i> people to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It already does a healthy business of selling games.Therefore, it makes sense for the company to go after the gaming community.Building good relationships with gamers can be a long-term winning strategy for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There are <i>more</i> than 1.4 billion PC/console gamers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They represent a huge pool of purchasing power that the company <b>could</b> monetize through Prime subscriptions and online shopping .  (Uncertainty) </span>The average age of video gamers is now 35 years .The gaming community is full of people that are likely employed with disposable income.People with disposable income are ideal customers for online shopping sites like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . A person who does n't mind buying 2-3 $ 50 PC games per month can certainly afford the $ 99 annual fee of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime already offers a lot of privileges . The generosity of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is likely why it is estimated that 38 % of U.S. household are now Prime account holders . Cowen Group estimates that there are now around 41 million members in the U.S. alone.The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Day event added another 3 million subscribers last December . This estimated 44-million strong <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime army is a strong tailwind for the company . However, keeping a huge number of subscribers consistently happy takes constant pampering.The latest offer of 20 % discount on new game titles is another effective way for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to retain the loyalty of its Prime subscribers . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The potential economic benefit of the company going after gamers is two-fold : It can increase the number of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime subscribers , which <b>could</b> lead to <i>more</i> people doing repeat online purchases . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Yes , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's offer of 20 % discount only applies to boxed versions of games . However, this is just fine, because physical sales still accounts for 2/3rd of new video game sales.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The gamer who used to buy most of his boxed PC/Console game from retail stores like GameStop ( NYSE : GME ) will find it <i>more</i> cost-effective and convenient to just sign up for an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime account . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The free Same-Day/2-day shipping means a person no longer needs to go to a GameStop branch to get the newest games.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and its publisher partners <b>might</b> also include downloadable versions of games inside the 20 % discount program of Prime . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I speculate that the 20 % discount <b>could</b> eventually expand to include <i>older</i> game titles .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Game publishers can monetize their <i>older</i> games by offering them inside <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's game discounting program . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>If GameStop can offer 2-year old game titles with deep discounts , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's online marketplace can also be used by game publishers to sell their unsold inventories of DVD games . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>GameStop is just one of the firms that <b>could</b> suffer from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's pursuit of gamers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Its latest move can also hurt Best Buy's (NYSE: BBY ) Game Club service.The $30/2-year membership plan of My Best Buy Game Club Unlocked also offers 20% discounts on purchases of new game title releases.Going forward, Best Buy is unlikely to see serious growth in Game Club subscriptions.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is now targeting the same core audience of gaming enthusiasts . It makes financial sense for a gamer to abandon Game Club and get the other benefits of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . The free unlimited streaming from Prime Instant Video and Prime Music are already great bonuses even for gamers.Unlike Best Buy's game club, Prime membership also offers discounts on other products.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I also <b>assume</b> that some <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime members previously signed up for Game Club because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's loyalty program did not yet have the 20 % discount . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the implementation of 20 % discount on games inside Prime , there will be no <i>more</i> reason for people to renew their Game Club accounts .  (Surprise) </span>The gaming community definitely represents millions of potential subscribers for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . Seducing gamers with a discount is one way to nurture a long-lasting relationship.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The <i>bigger</i> picture is that one successful sign-up ( because of the new 20 % discount on new games ) can lead to a gamer <b>probably</b> spending thousands of dollars on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's marketplace . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The recent substantial price pullback on AMZN presents an opportunity for brave investors to buy it on the cheap.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is the dynamo behind the company 's rapid growth . Consequently , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can sustain its double-digit growth rate ( in revenue ) as long as Prime keeps getting new loyal subscribers .
