online purchases Amazons NASDAQ AMZN growth is hugely influenced by its loyalty program Prime subscribers account for almost half of purchases made on Amazons marketplace since early last year It is therefore great news that the company is doing its best to retain and attract new Prime subscribers by giving a discount on new games This is a great way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to better monetize the huge population of gamers Giving discounts on new games is an easy way to attract more people to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime It already does a healthy business of selling games Therefore it makes sense for the company to go after the gaming community Building good relationships with gamers can be a longterm winning strategy for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>There are more than billion PCconsole gamers They represent a huge pool of purchasing power that the company could monetize through Prime subscriptions and online shopping The average age of video gamers is now years The gaming community is full of people that are likely employed with disposable income People with disposable income are ideal customers for online shopping sites like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>A person who doesnt mind buying PC games per month can certainly afford the annual fee of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime already offers a lot of privileges The generosity of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is likely why it is estimated that of US household are now Prime account holders Cowen Group estimates that there are now around million members in the US alone The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Day event added another million subscribers last December This estimated million strong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime army is a strong tailwind for the company However keeping a huge number of subscribers consistently happy takes constant pampering The latest offer of discount on new game titles is another effective way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to retain the loyalty of its Prime subscribers The potential economic benefit of the company going after gamers is twofold It can increase the number of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime subscribers which could lead to more people doing repeat online purchases Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Primes offer of discount only applies to boxed versions of games However this is just fine because physical sales still accounts for rd of new video game sales The gamer who used to buy most of his boxed PCConsole game from retail stores like GameStop NYSE GME will find it more costeffective and convenient to just sign up for an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime account The free SameDayday shipping means a person no longer needs to go to a GameStop branch to get the newest games <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its publisher partners might also include downloadable versions of games inside the discount program of Prime I speculate that the discount could eventually expand to include older game titles Game publishers can monetize their older games by offering them inside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Primes game discounting program If GameStop can offer year old game titles with deep discounts Amazons online marketplace can also be used by game publishers to sell their unsold inventories of DVD games GameStop is just one of the firms that could suffer from Amazons pursuit of gamers Its latest move can also hurt Best Buys NYSE BBY Game Club service The year membership plan of My Best Buy Game Club Unlocked also offers discounts on purchases of new game title releases Going forward Best Buy is unlikely to see serious growth in Game Club subscriptions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is now targeting the same core audience of gaming enthusiasts It makes financial sense for a gamer to abandon Game Club and get the other benefits of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime The free unlimited streaming from Prime Instant Video and Prime Music are already great bonuses even for gamers Unlike Best Buys game club Prime membership also offers discounts on other products I also assume that some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime members previously signed up for Game Club because Amazons loyalty program did not yet have the discount With the implementation of discount on games inside Prime there will be no more reason for people to renew their Game Club accounts The gaming community definitely represents millions of potential subscribers for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Seducing gamers with a discount is one way to nurture a longlasting relationship The bigger picture is that one successful signup because of the new discount on new games can lead to a gamer probably spending thousands of dollars on Amazons marketplace The recent substantial price pullback on AMZN presents an opportunity for brave investors to buy it on the cheap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is the dynamo behind the companys rapid growth Consequently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can sustain its doubledigit growth rate in revenue as long as Prime keeps getting new loyal subscribers Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
