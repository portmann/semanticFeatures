(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix will face additional challenges in a saturated U.S.A. market.A small change in Netflix's churn rate will result in a large change in its net subscription additions.Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) reported earnings after the market closed on 7/18/2016, causing the shares to drop by as much as 17% to 82.02 immediately following the earnings release at about 4:25 PM.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Such large swing was consistent with our expectations , as per article we published <i>earlier</i> in the day prior to the earnings release : `` Netflix stock poised for a major move '' .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix was primarily affected by churn, an inevitable consequence of Netflix's own success as its market share has reached saturated levels in the U.S.A. Netflix stock 5-day intraday chart - Source: Yahoo Finance Netflix reported Q2 2016 net earnings of 9 cents per share, beating estimates of 2 cents per share.However, revenues came in at $1.966 billion, missing market expectations of $2.11 billion.In addition, Netflix now expects to earn 5 cents per share in Q3 2016, below market expectations of about 8 cents per share.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> importantly , Netflix subscriptions grew by 1.68 million new customers , missing forecasts of 2.5 million .  (Surprise) </span>Of such number, U.S. subscribers only increased by 160,000 vs. expectations of 500,000 while international subscribers grew by 1.52 million vs. expectations of 2 million.Meanwhile, Netflix is now forecasting 300,000 net new U.S. subscribers for Q3 2016 and 2 million net new international subscribers.Netflix now has a total of 83.18 million subscribers in total, of which 47.13 million are U.S. subscribers and 36.05 million are international.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix CEO Hastings noted that gross subscriber additions were on target for last quarter , but churn was <i>higher</i> than expected .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Netflix blamed media coverage of the pending price increase as a cause for <i>higher</i> churn , as Hastings noted : We think some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the completion of two years of grandfathering ... We believe Netflix is starting to experience the pitfalls of market saturation in the U.S. , although the company still <b>believes</b> that it can reach 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the U.S.A. .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As of the end of 2015, 52% of all U.S. broadband households already subscribed to Netflix.Meanwhile , Netflix 's churn rate , whereby 5 % of U.S. broadband households had cancelled their subscription in 2015 ( equal to 9 % of Netflix 's subscriber base ) , was the lowest for the industry vs. 7 % for Hulu ( equal to about half of Hulu 's subscriber 's base ) and 5 % for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video ( equal to 19 % of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video subscriber base ) . Given Netflix's large U.S. subscriber base of 47.13 million subscribers, a small change in its churn rate can result in a large change in net subscriptions.Currently, every 1% change in churn will result in a change of 471,000 in subscriptions.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> successful that Netflix has become in growing its subscriber base , the <i>more</i> sensitive it has become to an increase in its churn rate .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given that Netflix 's churn rate is already the lowest in the industry , the <b>risk</b> will always rest in an increase of such churn rate .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Such <b>risk</b> is also highlighted by the fact that Netflix 's share of North American fixed network traffic had peaked in the fall of 2015 at about 37.1 % of all traffic , dropping to 35.2 % as of June 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix 's challenges for Q2 2016 were not restricted to a <i>higher</i> than expected churn rate for the U.S.A. .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As provided <i>earlier</i> , international subscription growth also came in <i>weaker</i> than expected .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As per other articles we have recently published , the current macro environment is quite challenging for companies depending on international markets due to a strong dollar , Brexit jitters , and economic <b>uncertainty</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hence , although Netflix is counting on growing its international subscription base in order to overcome challenges of a saturated market in the U.S.A. , we <b>believe</b> Netflix will continue to face challenges on such front ; both from a cost perspective , as well as macroeconomic perspective .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix will continue to face challenges in the U.S.A. as the market is mostly saturated, while Netflix's large subscription base makes it vulnerable to even minute increases in its churn rate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Risks</b> for an increased churn rate are not limited to subscription price increases , but also to added competition .  (Uncertainty) </span>Such competition was also noted by Netflix CEO Hastings as he pointed out <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video , CBS All Access , Hulu , Seeso , and Alphabet 's YouTube Red . Meanwhile, Netflix will also face challenges internationally due to a challenging macro environment, as well as reduced viewership as a result of the upcoming Olympics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In our prior article on Netflix , we had recommended an option strategy to take advantage of a <b>pending</b> sizable move in Netflix shares , by purchasing two September 16 , 2016 puts with 90 strike for every one call with 100 strike .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In such regard , with the puts deep in the money following the earnings release , we would favor maintaining such position as Netflix shares <b>could</b> see additional downside in the next several weeks .
