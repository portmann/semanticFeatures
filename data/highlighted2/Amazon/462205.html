result in a large change in its net subscription additions Netflix NASDAQ NFLX reported earnings after the market closed on causing the shares to drop by as much as to immediately following the earnings release at about PM Such large swing was consistent with our expectations as per article we published earlier in the day prior to the earnings release Netflix stock poised for a major move Netflix was primarily affected by churn an inevitable consequence of Netflixs own success as its market share has reached saturated levels in the USA Netflix stock day intraday chart Source Yahoo Finance Netflix reported Q net earnings of cents per share beating estimates of cents per share However revenues came in at billion missing market expectations of billion In addition Netflix now expects to earn cents per share in Q below market expectations of about cents per share More importantly Netflix subscriptions grew by million new customers missing forecasts of million Of such number US subscribers only increased by vs expectations of while international subscribers grew by million vs expectations of million Meanwhile Netflix is now forecasting net new US subscribers for Q and million net new international subscribers Netflix now has a total of million subscribers in total of which million are US subscribers and million are international Netflix CEO Hastings noted that gross subscriber additions were on target for last quarter but churn was higher than expected Netflix blamed media coverage of the pending price increase as a cause for higher churn as Hastings noted We think some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the completion of two years of grandfathering We believe Netflix is starting to experience the pitfalls of market saturation in the US although the company still believes that it can reach million to million subscribers in the USA As of the end of of all US broadband households already subscribed to Netflix Meanwhile Netflixs churn rate whereby of US broadband households had cancelled their subscription in equal to of Netflixs subscriber base was the lowest for the industry vs for Hulu equal to about half of Hulus subscribers base and for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video equal to of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video subscriber base Given Netflixs large US subscriber base of million subscribers a small change in its churn rate can result in a large change in net subscriptions Currently every change in churn will result in a change of in subscriptions The more successful that Netflix has become in growing its subscriber base the more sensitive it has become to an increase in its churn rate Given that Netflixs churn rate is already the lowest in the industry the risk will always rest in an increase of such churn rate Such risk is also highlighted by the fact that Netflixs share of North American fixed network traffic had peaked in the fall of at about of all traffic dropping to as of June Netflixs challenges for Q were not restricted to a higher than expected churn rate for the USA As provided earlier international subscription growth also came in weaker than expected As per other articles we have recently published the current macro environment is quite challenging for companies depending on international markets due to a strong dollar Brexit jitters and economic uncertainty Hence although Netflix is counting on growing its international subscription base in order to overcome challenges of a saturated market in the USA we believe Netflix will continue to face challenges on such front both from a cost perspective as well as macroeconomic perspective Netflix will continue to face challenges in the USA as the market is mostly saturated while Netflixs large subscription base makes it vulnerable to even minute increases in its churn rate Risks for an increased churn rate are not limited to subscription price increases but also to added competition Such competition was also noted by Netflix CEO Hastings as he pointed out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon

as a result of the upcoming Olympics In our prior article on Netflix we had recommended an option strategy to take advantage of a pending sizable move in Netflix shares by purchasing two September puts with strike for every one call with strike In such regard with the puts deep in the money following the earnings release we would favor maintaining such position as Netflix shares could see additional downside in the next several weeks Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it
