(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Only 2 % of Target 's sales originate from its website , with Best Buy seeing a bit <i>larger</i> percentage ( 10 % ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Accordingly , it is <b>conceivable</b> that these Apple product sales will drive traffic to stores .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given the competitive trends , being able to get a consumer to a store is becoming <i>more</i> difficult and expensive .  (Surprise) </span>Once in a store, Target can then do its job and sell additional product.It is a version of the milk and bread strategy where grocers place the milk and bread in the back corner of the store in order to get you to walk through all of the other aisles and items.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Retailers have long relied on this strategy to boost revenues , but it has taken on <i>greater</i> importance in recent years as competition intensifies .  (Surprise) </span>Electronics retailing in the hundreds of dollars represent the keystone of this strategy, especially in the November and December timeframe as people are willing to spend hundreds of dollars buying gifts for loved ones in addition to splurging on gifts for themselves.Similar to any consumer goods company, Apple has working relationships with its third-party retail partners.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately , when it comes to analysis , these relationships are cast in mystery as the details surrounding contracts are <b>confidential</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>In addition, the information found in these contracts is often not known by many people and is rather bland, limiting the odds of leaks reaching the press since there is little interest in such details.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Traditionally , companies compensate third-party retailers for selling their product by offering <i>lower</i> wholesale prices with a <b>varying</b> degree of built-in margin available to the retailer .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This margin is <b>dependent</b> on a number of factors , including the amount of power each party holds in the relationship .  (Uncertainty) </span>Wal-Mart, for example, is well known for its ruthlessness when it comes to its suppliers, demanding low prices in return for significant purchase orders.There are also stipulations where companies can dictate how low a retailer can sell a product for with various incentives in place to have retailers follow such clauses.When it comes to Apple's direct involvement with these Apple Watch and iPad sales at Best Buy and Target, the most likely scenario is that Apple is aware of and has signed off on such sales although much of the financial impact is carried by the third-party retailer.Why does Apple allow massive discounts on its products?Temporary discounts during peak shopping seasons of the year have little to no long-term negative consequences on branding.In fact, by embracing third-party sales while maintaining its own "no discount" policy at Apple Retail, Apple is further able to maintain its brand image.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Apple was providing significant kickbacks or compensation to these third-party retailers , such trends would <b>appear</b> in financial trends through the average selling price ( ASP ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>This explains why Fitbit's ASP is well below the actual retail sales prices of its products.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Fitbit provides retailers much <i>better</i> margins than compared to Apple .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From Apple 's perspective , what <b>may</b> end up being the most valuable long-term financial takeaway from these Apple product sales is increased brand relevance for Apple Watch .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple has sold seven million Apple Watches to date, and I currently estimate Apple will sell another five million Apple Watches during the current quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This would <b>suggest</b> that Target and Best Buy have the potential to move upwards of one million Apple Watches this quarter , or $ 400 - $ 500 million of Apple Watch revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is not a trivial amount for Target and Best Buy and would certainly help offset weakness in other areas such as winter apparel.A very successful holiday quarter will help cap off a successful launch calendar year for Apple Watch with unit sales nearing 11 million.The product category would be well positioned for Apple Watch 2 in the first half of 2016.For iPad, the iPad mini experiences strong sales each fourth quarter followed by a steady and dramatic drop-off in sales in subsequent quarters.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I estimate Apple selling 17 million iPads during the current quarter which means Target and Best Buy <b>could</b> sell up to three or four million iPads , or another $ 1.3 to $ 1.7 billion dollars .  (Uncertainty) </span>Combining Apple Watch and iPad sales, these Best Buy and Target sales are likely worth at least $1.5 billion of revenue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When considering the additional product sales resulting from customers visiting stores in search of these Apple products , Best Buy and Target will likely bring in <i>more</i> than $ 2 billion of revenue this quarter related to Apple promotions .  (Surprise) </span>In the competitive retail landscape, discounting Apple products ends up being a worthwhile bet.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
