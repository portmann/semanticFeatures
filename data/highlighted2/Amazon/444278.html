its week lows NFLX has proven resiliency in the US during the Financial Crisis of and we are confident in NFLXs ability to sell in foreign markets even during tough economic times NFLX stock rose from February to February while the SP dropped The stock may not have found a nearterm bottom but we are confident the share price will be significantly higher in one year than where they are today Since the shocking Brexit last week investors and analysts alike have arrived at the conclusion that the Brexit will significantly hurt international growth for Netflix NASDAQ NFLX The company has shed almost billion of its market cap with the share price dropping nearly in two trading days to just above a mere above week lows The selloff to us feels overdone NFLX has proven resiliency in the US during the Financial Crisis of and we are confident in NFLXs ability to sell its valueoriented product in foreign markets even during uncertain and tough economic times We think the selloff offers investors a good opportunity to buy into this highgrowth story at a considerable discount At the heart of our argument is the thesis that NFLX has proven resiliency in tough economic times If we use the Financial Crisis as a case study we can see that NFLX more than weathered the economic storm and actually dramatically accelerated growth to new highs following the stock markets plunge in late In Q of the company noted that a challenging economic environment contributed to slower than expected sub growth That sub growth was only basis points lower than Qs growth rate and actually basis points higher than Qs growth rate We can see then that growth actually didnt decelerate that much during the heart of the Crisis Nonetheless the company cut sub and rev guidance for Q given broader economic uncertainty In Q though the company posted higherthan expected sub growth and revenue growth both of which topped the lowered guide and Street estimates Sub growth stayed at the next quarter before racing to by Q By the middle of subs were growing at a YY rate higher than even Q The point here is this the Financial Crisis of was the worst economic disaster the United States has seen since the Great Depression Despite the stock market crashing the housing market bursting incomes getting chopped and consumer confidence sinking to an alltime low NFLX still grew subs at a comparable rate to previous quarters during the worst of the Crisis and accelerated growth to new highs within a few quarters following the heart of the Crisis For some reason Americans saw the value of Netflix and adopted it even during tough economic times US Real Disposable Personal Income per Capita data by YCharts More pertinent to investors following Q which topped estimates the stock soared According to this article NFLX stock rose from February to February while the SP dropped It was viewed as a defensive stock then and we do not see any reason why it shouldnt be viewed as such now Some will say the stock is more richly valued now than it ever has been and there is some merit to the argument The company earned more per share in than it did last year but investors should remember that the trailing PE is nonnormalized because the stock is trading on depressed earnings hurt by massive investment into international expansion and original content Since revenues are up almost x Once these investments pay off earnings will likewise boom to more than x EPS the PE will compress and we will have a similar stable story that investors saw in For reference we still believe the company has in annual EPS power within the next years Nonetheless there are some real challenges Netflix faces now in international markets that it didnt face in the US back in One such challenge is content requirements The European Commission is proposing a requirement that all ondemand video streaming services NFLX included comprise their video library in such a way that of the catalogues offered to EU subs are made locally NFLX is largely developing original content to meet this requirement especially in crucial markets like France and Germany and the Commission has said that Netflixs current video library satisfies the quota At this point in time it is unclear how the Brexit affects this requirement so NFLX might have to do some movie portfolio reconstructing to keep their service alive in certain European markets If this does happen NFLX will likely have to spend some money on acquiring some local content or a more meaningful amount of money on developing original local content but this shouldnt be of significant amount considering preBrexit NFLX already met the quota A more serious challenge is on the FX side where significant appreciation of the dollar and weakening of the pound and euro will undoubtedly weigh on NFLXs top line results International contribution margins will likely become more negative as a result but the company was benefiting from a weaker dollar this year up until the Brexit Despite the pounds collapse the euro is still stronger than where it was at the beginning of the year The real risk here from an FX standpoint would be further destabilization of the EU but we think this risk is still too detached to price meaningfully into the stock at this point in time Investors should also remember that the Disney NYSE DIS deal becomes effective in September and this should provide a huge boost to NFLX content especially with an onslaught of DISowned superhero and Star Wars movies set to launch over the next several years It is also looking increasingly likely that Netflix will allow subs to download Netflix content online and watch it later offline This will help people watch onthego and it eliminates the competitive advantage <span

should say something about how the company will survive in todays teetering global economy The markets currently think otherwise as the stock has done nothing but selloff since the Brexit news NFLX stock tanked with the markets back in late but a strong Q in January that topped estimates and guided higher had people some people saying What Recession only months after the Dow posted its worstday
