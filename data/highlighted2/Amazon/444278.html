(Uncertainty) </span>NFLX stock rose 30% from February 2008 to February 2009 while the S&P 500 dropped 43%.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The stock may not have found a near-term bottom , but we are <b>confident</b> the share price will be significantly <i>higher</i> in one year than where they are today .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Since the shocking Brexit last week, investors and analysts alike have arrived at the conclusion that the Brexit will significantly hurt international growth for Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company has shed almost $ 3 billion of its market cap , with the share price dropping <b>nearly</b> 7 % in two trading days to just above $ 85 , a mere $ 5 above 52-week lows .  (Uncertainty) </span>The sell-off to us feels overdone.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>NFLX has proven resiliency in the US during the Financial Crisis of 2008 , and we are confident in NFLX 's ability to sell its value-oriented product in foreign markets even during <b>uncertain</b> and tough economic times .  (Uncertainty) </span>We think the selloff offers investors a good opportunity to buy into this high-growth story at a considerable discount.At the heart of our argument is the thesis that NFLX has proven resiliency in tough economic times.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If we use the 2008 Financial Crisis as a case study , we can see that NFLX <i>more</i> than weathered the economic storm and actually dramatically accelerated growth to new highs following the stock market 's plunge in late 2008 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In Q3 of 2008 , the company noted that a challenging economic environment contributed to <i>slower</i> than expected sub growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That sub growth was 23 % , only ~ 200 basis points <i>lower</i> than Q2 's 25 % growth rate and actually ~ 200 basis points <i>higher</i> than Q1 's 21 % growth rate .  (Surprise) </span>We can see, then, that growth actually didn't decelerate that much during the heart of the Crisis.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Nonetheless , the company cut sub and rev guidance for Q4 given <i>broader</i> economic <b>uncertainty</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In Q4, though, the company posted higher-than expected 26% sub growth and 19% revenue growth, both of which topped the lowered guide and Street estimates.Sub growth stayed at 25% the next quarter before racing to 31% by 4Q09.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By the middle of 2010 , subs were growing at a 42 % Y/Y rate , <i>higher</i> than even 1Q07 .  (Surprise) </span>The point here is this: the Financial Crisis of 2008 was the worst economic disaster the United States has seen since the Great Depression.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite the stock market crashing , the housing market bursting , incomes getting chopped , and consumer <b>confidence</b> sinking to an all-time low , NFLX still grew subs at a comparable rate to previous quarters during the worst of the Crisis and accelerated growth to new highs within a few quarters following the heart of the Crisis .  (Uncertainty) </span>For some reason, Americans saw the value of Netflix and adopted it even during tough economic times.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>US Real Disposable Personal Income per Capita data by YCharts <i>More</i> pertinent to investors , following 4Q08 which topped estimates , the stock soared .  (Surprise) </span>According to this article , NFLX stock rose 30% from February 2008 to February 2009 while the S&P 500 dropped 43%.It was viewed as a defensive stock then, and we do not see any reason why it shouldn't be viewed as such now.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Some will say the stock is <i>more</i> richly valued now than it ever has been , and there is some merit to the argument .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company earned <i>more</i> per share in 2008 than it did last year , but investors should remember that the trailing P/E is non-normalized because the stock is trading on depressed earnings hurt by massive investment into international expansion and original content .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since 2008 , revenues are up <b>almost</b> 5x .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Once these investments pay off , earnings will likewise boom to <i>more</i> than 5x 2008 EPS , the P/E will compress , and we will have a similar stable story that investors saw in 2008 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For reference , we still <b>believe</b> the company has $ 10 in annual EPS power within the next 10 years .  (Uncertainty) </span>Nonetheless, there are some real challenges Netflix faces now in international markets that it didn't face in the US back in 2008.One such challenge is content requirements.The European Commission is proposing a requirement that all on-demand video streaming services, NFLX included, comprise their video library in such a way that 20% of the catalogues offered to EU subs are made locally.NFLX is largely developing original content to meet this requirement, especially in crucial markets like France and Germany, and the Commission has said that Netflix's current video library satisfies the quota .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At this point in time , it is unclear how the Brexit affects this requirement , so NFLX <b>might</b> have to do some movie portfolio reconstructing to keep their service alive in certain European markets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If this does happen , NFLX will likely have to spend some money on acquiring some local content or a <i>more</i> meaningful amount of money on developing original local content , but this should n't be of significant amount considering pre-Brexit NFLX already met the quota .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>more</i> serious challenge is on the FX side , where significant appreciation of the dollar and weakening of the pound and euro will undoubtedly weigh on NFLX 's top line results .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>International contribution margins will likely become <i>more</i> negative as a result , but the company was benefiting from a <i>weaker</i> dollar this year up until the Brexit .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite the pound 's collapse , the euro is still <i>stronger</i> than where it was at the beginning of the year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The real <b>risk</b> here from an FX standpoint would be further de-stabilization of the EU , but we think this <b>risk</b> is still too detached to price meaningfully into the stock at this point in time .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investors should also remember that the Disney (NYSE: DIS ) deal becomes effective in September , and this should provide a huge boost to NFLX content, especially with an onslaught of DIS-owned superhero and Star Wars movies set to launch over the next several years.It is also looking increasingly likely that Netflix will allow subs to download Netflix content online and watch it later offline .This will help people watch on-the-go and it eliminates the competitive advantage <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Instant Video currently has from that feature . Netflix proved resiliency through tough economic times in the United States in 2008.We think that should say something about how the company will survive in today's teetering global economy.The markets currently think otherwise, as the stock has done nothing but sell-off since the Brexit news.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>NFLX stock tanked with the markets back in late 2008 , but a strong Q4 in January that topped estimates and guided <i>higher</i> had people some people saying '' What Recession ? ''  (Surprise) </span>only 4 months after the Dow posted its worst-day on record.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The stock may not have found a near-term bottom , but we are <b>confident</b> the share price will be significantly <i>higher</i> in one year than where they are today .
