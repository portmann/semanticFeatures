( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares have underperformed the averages during the past several days as the markets were making new highs . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's delivery efficiency <b>perhaps</b> is not as efficient as we have been programmed to think it is . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Since February 9 , 2016 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) shares are up 53.75 % from $ 482.07 per share to $ 741.20 as of July 14 , 2016 . Despite such impressive performance , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares are actually up only about 9.67 % year-to-date from 675.89 on December 31 , 2015 , as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> suffered a setback in the first five weeks of the year , dropping by as much as 40.2 % . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Stock 2016 - Source : Yahoo Finance Meanwhile , during the past several days , since July 11 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares as of July 14 have dropped by 1.67 % from 753.78 , while the Dow Jones industrial average appreciated by 1.53 % , the S&P 500 index is up about 1.24 % and the Nasdaq is up about 0.91 % . Despite <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's underperformance of about 3.3 % vs. the Dow Jones average for the past several days , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is still outperforming the index year-to-date , as the Dow Jones is only up about 6.25 % vs. <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> being up 9.67 % as of July 14 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock vs. DJIA July 11 to July 14 - Source : Yahoo Finance It is <b>possible</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock is simply consolidating given its most recent gains since February . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>On the other hand , as per the article we published on July 1 , 2016 , `` Will <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> buckle under the weight of its price to book ratio ? '' <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>- we do <b>believe</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock price is simply unjustified at current levels and is poised for a major drop . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As we had already stated : Given <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's elevated valuation both from the perspective of price to book ratio , as well as price to earnings ratio , in addition to macro economic headwinds related to Brexit , U.S. elections , a <i>stronger</i> dollar , in addition to the negative effect on consumers ' disposable income by the recent increase in gas prices , we <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares can drop noticeably from current levels during the next several months . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Hence , given <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's inability to trade <i>higher</i> as the indices were making new all-time highs during the past several days , in addition to its most recent divergence , whereby it has actually traded <i>lower</i> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> be showing early signs of suffering under the weight of its P/B and P/E ratios . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In our prior article we had discussed various quantitative measures supporting our thesis of why we felt <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares <b>could</b> be poised for a major pullback . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As many of our readers commented , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> had often defied the odds in the past as it traded <i>higher</i> as many feel that such indicators do not apply to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's a blind <b>faith</b> in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> that no matter what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does , or what business it enters , it will ultimately dominate such business due to its ability to simply innovate and provide unmatched pricing and service . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is often praised for its efficiency in delivery and pricing , we believe such two metrics are <b>somewhat</b> overblown . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I do not typically like to do so, but I will provide a personal example.Fifty years ago, my grandmother, who lived in a third world country, would wake up at about 07:00 AM every morning, and upon determining her needs for fresh groceries and other needs for the day, she would call her grocer at the corner of her street.On such call, she would tell him what groceries she wanted, including other needs such as stationery, cooking gas cylinder, meat, etc...<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In <i>less</i> than one hour , the delivery boy from the grocery store would show up at her doorstep with all her needs .  (Surprise) </span>He also will install the cooking gas cylinder for her, and in case she needed to pay any bills, such as phone bills, electric bills, etc..., he would even handle all her bill payment requirements.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Similarly , in case she wanted to buy a book or a magazine , she would call her local bookstore , and they would also gladly deliver to her doorstep within a few hours at most , and often within <i>less</i> than one hour .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Every neighborhood had its local grocery store , stationer , book store , butcher , baker , hardware store , etc. , with <b>almost</b> instantaneous delivery , and let me repeat , that was 50 years ago in a third world country .  (Uncertainty) </span>Such a distribution network enabled immediate delivery of needed goods and services.Today , in the advent of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's praised model , we have moved to a central fulfillment and warehousing model . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Next , everyone <b>seems</b> to be <b>amazed</b> at how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is capable to deliver products within two days , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is currently testing drone technology in order to shorten delivery time to within hours ( a service my grandmother enjoyed 50 years ago ) . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Meanwhile , many neighborhood stores seem to be simply out of business due to their inability to compete on price with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> itself , which has been in business for 22 years , has yet to show consistent profitability ( as illustrated by the excessive price to book ratio of its shares ) . Ironically , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has come full circle , as now it has announced that it aims to open actual physical retail stores , after it had driven many retailers out of business . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares are an exuberant phenomenon . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As in any exuberance , as long as people indulge in such exuberance , it can be maintained and become even <i>more</i> exuberant .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is <b>possible</b> that the recent underperformance in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's shares during the past few days are a very early indication that such exuberance is reaching its end . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Meanwhile , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's launching of physical retail stores also is an indication that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can not simply rely on its e-commerce strategy . However , in order to raise its profitability significantly , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's pricing edge will likely erode , hence once again , making itself prone to competitive factors . As a result , we continue to favor shorting <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares at current levels .
