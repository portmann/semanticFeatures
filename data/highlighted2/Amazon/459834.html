underperformed the averages during the past several days as the markets were making new highs Amazons delivery efficiency perhaps is not as efficient as we have been programmed to think it is Since February <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN shares are up from per share to as of July Despite such impressive performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shares are actually up only about yeartodate from on December as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>suffered a setback in the first five weeks of the year dropping by as much as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Stock Source Yahoo Finance Meanwhile during the past several days since July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shares as of July have dropped by from while the Dow Jones industrial average appreciated by the SP index is up about and the Nasdaq is up about Despite Amazons underperformance of about vs the Dow Jones average for the past several days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is still outperforming the index yeartodate as the Dow Jones is only up about vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>being up as of July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock vs DJIA July to July Source Yahoo Finance It is possible that Amazons stock is simply consolidating given its most recent gains since February On the other hand as per the article we published on July Will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>buckle under the weight of its price to book ratio we do believe that Amazons stock price is simply unjustified at current levels and is poised for a major drop As we had already stated Given Amazons elevated valuation both from the perspective of price to book ratio as well as price to earnings ratio in addition to macro economic headwinds related to Brexit US elections a stronger dollar in addition to the negative effect on consumers disposable income by the recent increase in gas prices we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shares can drop noticeably from current levels during the next several months Hence given Amazons inability to trade higher as the indices were making new alltime highs during the past several days in addition to its most recent divergence whereby it has actually traded lower <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could be showing early signs of suffering under the weight of its PB and PE ratios In our prior article we had discussed various quantitative measures supporting our thesis of why we felt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shares could be poised for a major pullback As many of our readers commented <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had often defied the odds in the past as it traded higher as many feel that such indicators do not apply to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Theres a blind faith in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that no matter what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does or what business it enters it will ultimately dominate such business due to its ability to simply innovate and provide unmatched pricing and service Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is often praised for its efficiency in delivery and pricing we believe such two metrics are somewhat overblown I do not typically like to do so but I will provide a personal example Fifty years ago my grandmother who lived in a third world country would wake up at about AM every morning and upon determining her needs for fresh groceries and other needs for the day she would call her grocer at the corner of her street On such call she would tell him what groceries she wanted including other needs such as stationery cooking gas cylinder meat etc In less than one hour the delivery boy from the grocery store would show up at her doorstep with all her needs He also will install the cooking gas cylinder for her and in case she needed to pay any bills such as phone bills electric bills etc he would even handle all her bill payment requirements Similarly in case she wanted to buy a book or a magazine she would call her local bookstore and they would also gladly deliver to her doorstep within a few hours at most and often within less than one hour Every neighborhood had its local grocery store stationer book store butcher baker hardware store etc with almost instantaneous delivery and let me repeat that was years ago in a third world country Such a distribution network enabled immediate delivery of needed goods and services Today in the advent of Amazons praised model we have moved to a central fulfillment and warehousing model Next everyone seems to be amazed at how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is capable to deliver products within two days while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is currently testing drone technology in order to shorten delivery time to within hours a service my grandmother enjoyed years ago Meanwhile many neighborhood stores seem to be simply out of business due to their inability to compete on price with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>itself which has been in business for years has yet to show consistent profitability as illustrated by the excessive price to book ratio of its shares Ironically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has come full circle as now it has announced that it aims to open actual physical retail stores after it had driven many retailers out of business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shares are an exuberant phenomenon As in any exuberance as long as people indulge in such exuberance it can be maintained and become even more exuberant It is possible that the recent underperformance in Amazons shares during the past few days are a very early indication that such exuberance is reaching its end Meanwhile Amazons launching of physical retail stores also is an indication that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cannot simply rely on its ecommerce strategy However in order to raise its profitability significantly Amazons pricing edge will likely erode hence once again making itself prone to competitive factors As a result we continue to favor shorting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shares at current levels Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my
