class='textDiv'>Dont Be Fooled By Amazons Buyback Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Company announced billion share repurchase plan This is a replacement and prior plan was more than complete Last week we received an K filing from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN that contained the details of a share repurchase plan The announcement of this plan sent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shares higher helping to reverse the recent drop seen in the chart below While investors usually love these buyback announcements this plan isnt what it seems Amazons filing included some news about the board of directors but that wasnt what many focused on Here is the part about the buyback detailed in the linked filing above bold is mine On February the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to billion of the Companys common stock The program allows the Company to repurchase its shares opportunistically from time to time when it believes that doing so would enhance longterm shareholder value The repurchase authorization does not have a fixed expiration Purchases may be effected through one or more open market transactions privately negotiated transactions transactions structured through investment banking institutions or a combination of the foregoing This stock repurchase authorization replaces the previous billion stock repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors in So this billion plan is just a replacement for the prior plan not an increase What is the significance of that Well look what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported in its most recent K filing just a few weeks earlier In January our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to billion of our common stock with no fixed expiration We have million remaining under the billion repurchase program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has already repurchased more than billion worth of shares So when you look at the billion plan it is already more than a quarter complete Thus my reading of these filings means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is really only announcing a billion increase to its prior buyback which had million left Thats a significant difference from what a billion headline looks like Thats just part of the story <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>like most companies gives out a lot of shares to its executives via stockbased compensation This way of paying and rewarding through bonuses executives and key employees results in dilution meaning an increase in a companys outstanding share count Amazons original buyback was announced in early so I put together the following chart to show the rise in the share count since the end of Over this time period despite the shares that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has bought back already the outstanding share count rose by more than The situation has gotten more dramatic in recent years and thats due to a major rise in stock based compensation If we take a look at page the cash flow statement of the K filing linked above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gave these numbers for stock based compensation So in just two years stockbased compensation nearly doubled I dont think that process is going to reverse anytime soon In fact we can look at Amazons earnings reports page to get more detail For Q the company guided to million worth of stock based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets For Q that figure is up to million Even if stock based compensation only rises by the current roughly that analysts are forecasting for revenue growth this year youre still looking at almost billion That gets me to my final point and it is about timing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>didnt give a fixed date for when this program will end or detail how much it plans to repurchase in any given time It could take a number of years for the company to buyback the nearly billion thats left which means the share count could rise further That makes Amazons plan more of an offset dilution plan than a true stock buyback which aims to get the share count down This isnt like a program you currently see at Apple NASDAQ AAPL for example While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may have announced a share repurchase plan recently investors shouldnt really find it meaningful Theres only a few billion dollars involved which wont make a dent in the nearly billion market cap stock Additionally with the company pouring out plenty of shares to executive Amazons plan will likely just stop the share count from rising further not send it lower If you are interested in buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>buy it for potential revenue and earnings growth not the buyback Disclosure Iwe have no positions in
