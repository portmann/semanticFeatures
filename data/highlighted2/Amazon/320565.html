( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Company announced $ 5 billion share repurchase plan . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is a replacement , and prior plan was <i>more</i> than 60 % complete .  (Surprise) </span>Last week , we received an 8-K filing from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) that contained the details of a share repurchase plan . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The announcement of this plan sent <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares <i>higher</i> , helping to reverse the recent drop seen in the chart below . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While investors usually love these buyback announcements , this plan is n't what it <b>seems</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's filing included some news about the board of directors , but that was n't what many focused on . Here is the part about the buyback detailed in the linked filing above (bold is mine).On February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $5 billion of the Company's common stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The program allows the Company to repurchase its shares opportunistically from time to time when it <b>believes</b> that doing so would enhance long-term shareholder value .  (Uncertainty) </span>The repurchase authorization does not have a fixed expiration.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Purchases <b>may</b> be effected through one or <i>more</i> open market transactions , privately negotiated transactions , transactions structured through investment banking institutions , or a combination of the foregoing .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This stock repurchase authorization replaces the previous $2 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in 2010.So this $5 billion plan is just a replacement for the prior plan, not an increase.What is the significance of that?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Well , look what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reported in its most recent 10-K filing , just a few weeks <i>earlier</i> : In January 2010 , our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $ 2.0 billion of our common stock with no fixed expiration . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>We have $763 million remaining under the $2.0 billion repurchase program.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has already repurchased <i>more</i> than $ 1.23 billion worth of shares ! (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So when you look at the $ 5 billion plan , it is already <i>more</i> than a quarter complete .  (Surprise) </span>Thus , my reading of these filings means that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is really only announcing a $ 3 billion increase to its prior buyback , which had $ 763 million left . That's a significant difference from what a $5 billion headline looks like.That's just part of the story.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , like most companies , gives out a lot of shares to its executives via stock-based compensation . This way of paying (and rewarding through bonuses) executives and key employees results in dilution, meaning an increase in a company's outstanding share count.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's original buyback was announced in early 2010 , so I put together the following chart to show the rise in the share count since the end of 2009 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Over this time period , despite the shares that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has bought back already , the outstanding share count rose by <i>more</i> than 6 % . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The situation has gotten <i>more</i> dramatic in recent years , and that 's due to a major rise in stock based compensation .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we take a look at page 38 , the cash flow statement , of the 10-K filing linked above , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> gave these numbers for stock based compensation : So in just two years , stock-based compensation <b>nearly</b> doubled . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I don't think that process is going to reverse anytime soon.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In fact , we can look at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's earnings reports page to get <i>more</i> detail . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For Q1 2015 , the company guided to $ 450 million worth of stock based compensation and the amortization of <b>intangible</b> assets .  (Uncertainty) </span>For Q1 2016, that figure is up to $600 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if stock based compensation only rises by the current roughly 21.2 % that analysts are forecasting for revenue growth this year , you 're still looking at <b>almost</b> $ 2.6 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>That gets me to my final point, and it is about timing.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did n't give a fixed date for when this program will end , or detail how much it plans to repurchase in any given time . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> take a number of years for the company to buyback the nearly $ 4 billion that 's left , which means the share count <b>could</b> rise further .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That makes <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's plan <i>more</i> of an `` offset dilution '' plan than a true stock buyback , which aims to get the share count down . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This isn't like a program you currently see at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), for example.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> have announced a share repurchase plan recently , investors should n't really find it meaningful . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's only a few billion dollars involved , which wo n't make a dent in the <b>nearly</b> $ 250 billion market cap stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Additionally , with the company pouring out plenty of shares to executive , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's plan will likely just stop the share count from rising further , not send it <i>lower</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>If you are interested in buying <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , buy it for potential revenue and earnings growth , not the buyback .
