for new product categories The newness of smartwatches makes it difficult to forecast future sales Fitbit Blaze usurps Apple Watch on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Seeking Alpha contributor Robert Lehars recent article Fitbit Does It Stand A Chance Against Apple asks readersinvestors a basic question The authors premise and sentiment seemingly dismiss Fitbit NYSE FIT as a onetrick single purpose pony that will have difficulty measuring up to Apples NASDAQ AAPL usual and early success with new products and categories I happen to agree with the author of the article Fitibt will have difficulty competing with Apple in the smartwatch subcategory of wearables just not the way some may think Fitbits portfolio is mostly made up of singlepurpose devices which focus on casual health and fitness and does not include a smartwatch product with a rich variety of apps and use cases At the same time Park is aware of attrition problems and slowing growth in its business I wrote about this in Fitbit Things Bulls Are Missing The more sustainable and growing smartwatch category would offer Fitbit a solution to both problems The aforementioned statements need clarifying as they are largely subjective and use subjective terminology to describe products and business operations The fact is that Fitbit does offer consumers a smartwatch with its Surge and now the newly launched Blaze While it may be that these smartwatch products by Fitbit dont offer GPS and social media apps to name a few the consumers engagement with smartwatches has remained limited to their health fitness related applications and usage features In other words one way to view the Fitbit smartwatches may be to understand that they were developed with the consumer in mind and more aptly to this degree than the Apple Watch or other smartwatches The smartwatch has only been around for roughly months in the massmarket and to date every smartwatch manufacturer has found sales disintegrate past the launch period of the product Reasons for the failed predecessor smartwatches are varied but most suffer from similar issues related to connectivity pricing and the ability to offer applications that are differentiated from that of the accepted smartphone Furthermore lets now focus on the statement offered regarding the sustainable and growing smartwatch category in the graphic below What I would ask readersinvestors to consider with regard to this graphic is that there is no pricing recognition offered to the smartwatch or any product in the wearables category the company is using for this forecast and market share graphic The only variable I would agree with regarding the IDC graphic is that clothing will never represent a meaningful percentage of the wearables category You try washing sensors and electronics and tell me how that works out for you Sorry Under Armour NYSE UA I realize your company has spent well over mm aimed at the transformation of the wearables market over the last years and to date all the company has to show for it is yet another wearable for the wrist Maybe the Under Armour fitness tracker currently being positioned in Under Armour shoes will find something greater than development and actual deployment into the marketplace While such technology wont achieve mass adoption at least the company can finally say we went from AZ with a wearable product beyond the wrist as the company has spent considerable investor monies The other thing the IDC graphic above doesnt inform readersinvestors about is timing and product existence With basic wrist band wearables coming to the market in ish they have been around for well over years now and are ever closer to market saturation Smartwatches have only come to be known by consumers in the last years and with extremely limited brands and product choices If a readerinvestor doesnt recognize or interject this variable into the IDC graphic they may not be able to understand that the sustainable growth for smartwatches is highly subjective and determined mainly by the newness of the product and the more recent Apple Watch deployment If we extrapolate the Apple Watch launch from last year the numbers for smartwatches erode mightily The following graphic from IDC also validates that perspective and deeper consideration regarding smartwatches as a product segment Shipments of smartwatches according to the IDC graphic are just awful when compared to the single reported wristband wearables sales by Fitbit alone and without consideration of sales from that of other wearables companies Its one thing to look at a graphic or chart and take it at face value but I would encourage readersinvestors to practice the Why rule that I apply to my research and analytics When posed with opinions andor facts ask the question Why times in an attempt to cover all considerations regarding those opinions andor facts An example of this exercise would be to ask why has Apple been able to ship such a disproportionate number of smartwatches during when compared to its peers I would offer that with the name brand Apple supporting the Apple Watch and the healthy distribution network carried by Apple globally the ability to sellin Apple Watches is a pretty easy task for the company What may not be so easy is sellingthrough those smartwatches Meanwhile Canalys is estimating Samsungs Galaxy Gear made up the majority of smartwatch shipments or what it calls smart bands with market share in the second half of followed by Sony Pebble and others About million smartwatches shipped during the period Samsung launched the Galaxy Gear with a major marketing push that gained significant consumer interest said Chris Jones VP and principal analyst at Canalys in a statement from the company Shipments of the device took Samsung to the top of the smart band category though disappointing sellthrough will necessitate more promotional activity in coming months Basic band vendors have greater wearable expertise and have shipped greater numbers to date but smart bands are already growing faster Increasingly smart bands will adopt basic band features as the two categories converge See what I mean It is pretty easy to grab the top spot in the smartwatch subcategory of wearables through basic sellindistribution but the sellthrough is where these smartwatches are finding themselves troubled Ive offered this very valid and concerning factor regarding smartwatches in past Apple Watch articles In no uncertain terms have I offered that the Apple Watch has underachieved its expected sellthrough rate The proprietary sales data below is collected by Capital Ladder Advisory Group subscription needed for total sales and taken directly from retail pointofsale systems A quick look at Apples largest retailer by sales volume for Apple products on a retail sq footage basis shows just how poorly the product performs While Im not permitted to disclose the retailer by name and utilize a singular region to express the poor sellthrough results investors should understand the results are mirrored largely throughout the total chain and demanded upon them new pricing to increase sellthrough Unfortunately the JDA software utilized by this retailer does not have a truncate function to elicit totals at the bottom like other retailers ie Target Corp NYSE TGT WalMart NYSE WMT or Bed Bath Beyond NASDAQ BBBY Just one of the many reasons this electronics retailer has struggled since the turn of the century and watched its cheif competition in Circuit City go out of business many years ago Enough clues To be clear the data was taken just before the recent price reduction and the most recent data post the price reduction will be offered in future publications The territory exampled in the following screen shot is one of the largest sales producing regions for the retailer in the country just shy of the sales generated in the south eastern portion of the United States When your most important retailer in North America is selling less than one Watch a week there is something severely amiss with the product Apple is recognizing the shortcomings of the Watch in different ways but none more telling than the sharp repricing of its entry level and largest sales volume producer for the product segment Watch Sport Apple has taken this price reduction without any articulation offered for a Watch or secondgeneration product even though many speculate as to when Watch will launch By the time Watch does surface the original Watch will have had an average selling price NYSE ASP of and not which was the original selling price The reduced price of the product exhibiting the ASP is something that has never occurred for an Apple product since launching iproducts that breed next generation products of the same application Where Apple has been able to dominate categories based on technology and designfashion wearables dont really offer such necessities tied to fashion Remember wearables in general are heavily used for health fitness related activities One of the reasons the Apple Watch has exhibited such poor sellthrough is that it does little more than a smartphone and you have to own an iPhone in order to use the Apple Watch For all the bells and whistles associated with the Apple Watch those bells and whistles utilize a great deal of battery power The small screen is less user friendly than an iPhone to boot Combining the obstacles that rest within the Apple Watch one can deduce just some of the reasons the concept of the smartwatch as designed by Apple is found wanting And the consumer could achieve these obstacles for the former price of at retail locations Suggesting that fashion or design would be a critical advantage of Apple Watch to the likes of Fitbit seems farreaching given the proven sales results of the two products How long did it take Fitbit Blaze to usurp the Apple Watch on Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN I think it was about a week give or take a day Apple has missed the mark with the Apple Watch and allowed for Fitbit Blaze to enter the smartwatch category with a more consumeroriented product some might say Apple has seemingly focused a great deal of the Apple Watch definitions on fashion as offered in Fitbit Does It Stand A Chance Against Apple It is then not surprising that much of Apples focus with the Watch has been on the products fashion aspect the easytoswap bands Apple currently offers different Watch bands if including the Herms collection in various colors and materials and at a level of quality which rivals the best watchmakers in the industry For all the fashionforward and unique characteristics the Apple Watch offers consumers its clear that the Apple Watch focus should have been more consumercentric And I think that is what Apple Watch will provide The Apple Watch has a plethora of features to advantage consumers beyond that of a more simplistic Fitbit Blaze smartwatch But the Apple Watch simply doesnt do much more than a smartphone which the consumer already has by and large Although the Samsung Gear isnt tethered to the Android smartphone platform the product has found sales difficulty in the smartwatch segment of the marketplace One of the reasons for this is that data usage on the Samsung Gear requires a second monthly service plan beyond that of the cell phone plan The other issue is of course the duplication of smartphone technology that is unnecessary and solves no consumer problems If untethering the Apple Watch was proposed to be the savior of the Apple Watch Samsungs Gear is telling a different story But even I will recognize that Samsung is not Apple On that same token I will recognize that it doesnt have to be Smartwatchesso embattled with deficient technological advancements that aim at solving real consumer problems The reality of the situation facing the Apple Watch is that it is forced to move down market in price Fitbit is not moving upmarket either as offered by Mr Lehar as the Blaze is actually priced lower than the former Surge Fitbit product The consumer recognizes the duplicate technology of the smartphone offered in this Apple Watch and the sellthrough results highlight consumer purchase intent Suggesting that Fitbit will have difficulty competing against Apple in the smartwatch segment when Fitbit has already displaced the Apple Watch from its top sales position so quickly begs for readersinvestors to consider what is more pertinent At the very beginning of this article I agreed that Fitbit would have difficulty competing with Apple in the smartwatch subcategory of wearables I offered this because I believe the product segment will be challenged as a whole Given Fitbits attrition rate combined with its own sellthrough issues for the total wearables product line and as the leader in the wearables space the entire category suggests a greater fad element than is generally considered Nearly half of all wearables users stop using their wearable after months as defined in Fitbits quarterly reporting Smartwatches are an extension of the wearables category utilizing most of the same applications as more basic wearables the tracking of health fitness data While this application is useful for some it has proven less useful for an equal amount of people Where you have that many consumers attritioning from a productcategory there has never been considerable longterm sales growth Not ever In that Fitbit and Apple Inc will both have difficulty competing for sales in the wearables category regardless of their respective product offerings The investor takeaway presently is that Apple is a much more diversified company than is Fitbit As such Apple is likely a better longterm investment than Fitbit But timing is always relevant to investors and I dont believe Apple to be a strong investment presently I would rather see AAPL shares priced below before taking a position in the company But that is very simply my strategy and may not be favorable to the masses With the company reporting earnings this week shares could surge or plunge depending on their quarterly results and forecast With iPhone and iPad shipments expected to fall in a good portion of AAPLs share price appreciation may have to come from other products or business operations that may include increasing the dividend paid to shareholders Fitbit has dedicated itself to a singular product and business model to date While that could certainly change in the future such a change would likely come at the cost of investors Using the Fitbit business model to date once the company saturates its distribution channels globally sales will likely decline as is the typical occurrence for consumer goods companies For such companies with a singular product line the impact on the balance sheet is greater than those companies that offer products in multiple categories Having said that shares of FIT will not likely exhibit peak appreciation for several quarters and until this forecast becomes more clear and present to the investor community As such given the longterm negative outlook for the company FIT shares can make for a good trade with optimal timing Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions
