I think it was about a week, give or take a day.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple has missed the mark with the Apple Watch and allowed for Fitbit Blaze to enter the smartwatch category with a more consumer-oriented product , some <b>might</b> say .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple has seemingly focused a great deal of the Apple Watch definitions on fashion as offered in "Fitbit: Does It Stand A Chance Against Apple?"<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is then not <b>surprising</b> that much of Apple 's focus with the Watch has been on the product 's fashion aspect , the easy-to-swap bands .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple currently offers 55 <b>different</b> Watch bands ( 66 if including the Hermès collection ) in various colors and materials , and at a level of quality which rivals the best watchmakers in the industry .  (Uncertainty) </span>For all the fashion-forward and unique characteristics the Apple Watch offers consumers, it's clear that the Apple Watch focus should have been more consumer-centric.And I think that is what Apple Watch 2 will provide.The Apple Watch has a plethora of features to advantage consumers beyond that of a more simplistic Fitbit Blaze smartwatch.But the Apple Watch simply doesn't do much more than a smartphone, which the consumer already has by and large.Although the Samsung Gear isn't tethered to the Android smartphone platform, the product has found sales difficulty in the smartwatch segment of the marketplace.One of the reasons for this is that data usage on the Samsung Gear requires a second monthly service plan beyond that of the cell phone plan.The other issue is, of course, the duplication of smartphone technology that is unnecessary and solves no consumer problems.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If untethering the Apple Watch was proposed to be the savior of the Apple Watch , Samsung 's Gear is telling a <b>different</b> story .  (Uncertainty) </span>But even I will recognize that Samsung is not Apple.On that same token I will recognize that it doesn't have to be.Smartwatches…so embattled with deficient technological advancements that aim at solving real consumer problems!The reality of the situation facing the Apple Watch is that it is forced to move down market in price.Fitbit is not moving upmarket either as offered by Mr. Lehar as the Blaze is actually priced lower than the former "Surge" Fitbit product.The consumer recognizes the duplicate technology of the smartphone offered in this Apple Watch and the sell-through results highlight consumer purchase intent.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Suggesting</b> that Fitbit will have difficulty competing against Apple in the smartwatch segment when Fitbit has already displaced the Apple Watch from its top sales position so quickly begs for readers/investors to consider what is more pertinent .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the very beginning of this article I agreed that Fitbit would have difficulty competing with Apple in the smartwatch sub-category of wearables.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I offered this because I <b>believe</b> the product segment will be challenged as a whole .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given Fitbit 's attrition rate combined with it 's own sell-through issues for the total wearables product line , and as the leader in the wearables space , the entire category <b>suggests</b> a greater `` fad '' element than is generally considered .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Nearly</b> half of all wearables users stop using their wearable after 12 months as defined in Fitbit 's quarterly reporting .  (Uncertainty) </span>Smartwatches are an extension of the wearables category, utilizing most of the same applications as more basic wearables… the tracking of health & fitness data.While this application is useful for some, it has proven less useful for an equal amount of people.Where you have that many consumers attritioning from a product/category, there has never been considerable, long-term sales growth.Not ever!In that, Fitbit and Apple Inc. will both have difficulty competing for sales in the wearables category, regardless of their respective product offerings.The investor takeaway presently is that Apple is a much more diversified company than is Fitbit.As such, Apple is likely a better long-term investment than Fitbit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But timing is always relevant to investors and I do n't <b>believe</b> Apple to be a strong investment presently .  (Uncertainty) </span>I would rather see AAPL shares priced below $100 before taking a position in the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But that is very simply my strategy and <b>may</b> not be favorable to the masses .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the company reporting earnings this week , shares could surge or plunge <b>depending</b> on their quarterly results and forecast .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With iPhone and iPad shipments expected to fall in 2016 a good portion of AAPL 's share price appreciation <b>may</b> have to come from other products or business operations that <b>may</b> include increasing the dividend paid to shareholders .  (Uncertainty) </span>Fitbit has dedicated itself to a singular product and business model to date.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While that <b>could</b> certainly change in the future , such a change would likely come at the cost of investors .  (Uncertainty) </span>Using the Fitbit business model to date, once the company saturates its distribution channels globally, sales will likely decline as is the typical occurrence for consumer goods companies.For such companies with a singular product line, the impact on the balance sheet is greater than those companies that offer products in multiple categories.Having said that, shares of FIT will not likely exhibit peak appreciation for several quarters and until this forecast becomes more clear and present to the investor community.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such , given the long-term negative outlook for the company , FIT shares can make for a good trade with <b>optimal</b> timing .
