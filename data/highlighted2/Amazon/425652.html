style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a product category that everyone needs to buy and WalMart can deliver cheaply and conveniently to get new consumers hooked The world lost The Greatest of All Time boxer Muhammad Ali over the weekend due to complications associated with his year battle with Parkinsons disease Ali lived up to his famous selfappointed moniker in many ways for his civil rights advocacy his worldwide charitable and humanitarian efforts and of course his prowess as one of the greatest boxing champions of all time Perhaps one of the greatest and most historic of those bouts was the matchup between Ali and then world heavyweight champ George Foreman Sports enthusiasts say the Rumble In The Jungle as it was billed goes down in history as not only the most famous boxing match of all time but the greatest sporting event of the th century For those of you who werent even alive in this match was a pretty big deal for Ali for a couple of reasons Ali was stripped of his heavyweight boxing title in for nearly four years after he refused to honor the draft join the Army and fight in the Vietnam War In HE got a license to fight again to regain the title he lost and took on then titleholder Joe Frazier Ali was faced with the harsh reality of having to fight his way back up the championship ladder The Rumble In The Jungle was promoted as Alis big comeback after a pretty lackluster performance since he got his license back It had all of the ingredients of a firstrate media spectacle k in attendance a global television audience and three days of buildup with concerts and other celebritystudded festivities At the time Foreman was lauded as the greatest and most powerful puncher ever to have taken to the center ring and considered the hands on ha ha favorite given the brute force behind his powerful haymakers His float like a butterfly sting like a bee approach was a combination of deft footwork and technical maneuvers intended to catch his opponents off guard and wear them down before going in for the finishing blow One of those tactics the ropeadope delivered the finishing blow to Foreman quite literally in the eighth round After employing a number of moves earlier in the fight to disorient Foreman and force him to waste his power on punches that missed their mark Ali lured Foreman into attacking him against the ropes so as to tire him out It was then that Ali went on the offensive and punched back strong scoring the knockout punch to reclaim his title and little known fact launch Don Kings career this was his first fight promotion A powerful incumbent champion who was strong and dominant for years Success and longevity for Foreman was a function of relying on what had always worked for him strong punches that simply pummeled challengers and knocked them into oblivion Challengers who trained so that they could deliver strong powerful punches were simply no match at beating the champion at a game that he simply owned A nimble challenger with a new game plan Ali knew he had to deliver a knockout punch in the end to win but needed new techniques on the way there He knew he couldnt match Foreman punch for punch so he decided to take the fight to a new playing field the ropes instead of the center of the ring Once on turf that Ali knew better he could use new techniques to both disorient and then wear the champion down and at that point lure him to the center of the ring and deliver the finishing blow to a champ that never saw it coming Last week the biggest retailer in the world by revenue WalMart NYSE WMT made an announcement that made it clear that its really not that interested in ceding the title of worlds biggest retailer to a younger and nimble challenger named <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN This of course is WalMarts announcement of a new partnership with Uber Private UBER and Lyft Private LYFT to leverage those ridesharing platforms to deliver groceries in a twohour window to WalMart customers The company has been trialing this in a couple of markets with Deliv and is now ready to expand its efforts on a national basis with partners that have a density of drivers to serve its hundred million consumers WalMart is already one of the biggest grocery stores in the country accounting for of all grocery sales thats up from in Under this new arrangement payment is made via the Walmartcom app after customers make their selection online WalMart employees do the shopping load the UberLyft car with said bags and then make the delivery A delivery scheduled for two days post order gets delivered at a cheaper price WalMart gets the benefit of a readymade pool of drivers with critical mass in the areas it needs to serve I dont know the details of the partnership but certainly some of the costs are only incurred when service is performed This keeps WalMarts economics in check why build when you can rent the services of a complementary platform when needed For Uber and Lyft this is pure profit to the bottom line that keeps drivers happy by giving them more work Uber drivers complain in some cities that there is too much supply and not enough demand Uber just created more demand just like it has with UberEats which also leverages Uber drivers for pickup and delivery WalMarts announcement comes on the heels of a number of other digital and instore initiatives that the company has launched over the last year An instore system alerts WalMart associates when customers come into the store to pick up things ordered online Shipping Pass allows consumers to pay a year to have orders delivered in two days no minimum purchase required Walmart Pay is a mobile app that uses the Walmartcom app to enable instore payment using any phone and leverage the user behavior of the million consumers a month who comScore says visit the Walmart physical store and use their Walmartcom app while there to check prices etc Walmart Pay consolidates all relevant Walmart promotions Savings Catcher balances unused gift cards among other things and applies them at checkout This announcement also follows a very strong earnings report which even took a few analysts by surprise It reflected five quarters of upward revenue growth and increased foot traffic a big challenge for most physical retailers today These results are driven partially by buy online pickup instore initiatives that not only has consumers coming into the store but according to CEO Doug McMillon when that behavior is applied to grocery orders sees consumers spending more when they get there And dont forget that Walmartcom and now Walmart Pay allow consumers to buy online and pay in cash at the store for what they order online WalMarts stated mission is about making peoples lives better by helping them save money Sam Walton once said that theres only one boss the customer who can fire anyone in the company by simply spending her money somewhere else According to a survey done by Kantar of consumers that boss skews toward those who make k or less Saving money is therefore mission critical to WalMart shoppers and is their No priority WalMart delivers on that mission by operating a pretty sophisticated supply chain and distribution network that includes its physical store footprint stores which are within a minute ride of of all people living in the US In addition the companys distribution centers are strategically situated within miles of a Walmart store WalMart also operates a companyowned fleet of k tractortrailers and drivers who deliver daily to those locations WalMarts revenue of nearly half a trillion dollars billion in and million employees half of which are in the US makes it the largest retailer in the world in terms of revenue and number of employees One hundred million people step foot in a Walmart store every week and million are spent in a Walmart store every hour We estimate that eight cents of every dollar in the US is spent at a Walmart Theres no doubt about it this is a big and powerful incumbent thats historically delivered knockout punches to a host of challengers over the years Its controversially driven many momandpop shops in local communities out of business Its annual revenues are nearly X that of its closest rival Target NYSE TGT Its formats have evolved to serve a variety of customer needs including membership clubs like Sams Club and smaller format stores that hope to attract a new type of customer in a more urban location The first is from Mary Meekers hotoffthe presses Internet Trends report This chart shows that while WalMart may have x the revenues of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the market seems to be betting that its the younger more nimble challenger that is best prepared to capitalize on the digital waves that are transforming retail and commerce more broadly How much of a worry depends on how much of that market cap reflects the value of nonretail efforts such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services its content production and streaming business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reports a margin on the service and an annual growth rate of and is said to own roughly of the cloud infrastructure market Some analysts have ascribed a billion valuation on the service in Backing out that nonretail dimension of the business closes the market cap gap a bit But where the worry beads might need to come back out of the drawer is because of this next chart which shows that the customer base that WalMart has locked and loaded today isnt that digital Millennial native shopper who needs to be the WalMart customer tomorrow Its why when the companys eCommerce numbers dipped in the last earnings report growing at only the headlines didnt tout how well it did in the physical channel they slammed them for whiffing online And whiffing after saying that the company has sunk billion into eCommerce efforts that analysts said have not borne much fruit to date <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>over the last years of its life has taken the retail fight to a different part of the ring online and mobile It started life as a digital retailer selling things that appealed to all people books And in an environment that was unencumbered by the physical real estate that became an albatross for many of its brickandmortar challengers We all know the rest of the story Those book sales turned into a massive online store selling just about everything and now everything delivered in two days and even sooner to Prime customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a massive online marketplace with more than million products listed on its US website and is said to add new items each day Fifty percent of those items are from marketplace sellers and the rest from Amazons traditional buy wholesalesell retail business The company has cultivated three secret weapons in its quest to change the retail playing field Its Prime customer base of which there is said to be million who are not only brand loyal but big spenders outspending nonPrime customers by a factor of two to one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>uses data on what its million customers buy in order to personalize the shopping experience in a helpful and nonintrusive way And they leverage the trust of its customers so that they buy even more things and they hope help it become the trusted digital credential that consumers take everywhere they go digitally to conduct commerce <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>today accounts for of online retail One of comScores senior executives told CNBC in November that Amazons share online is higher than the next six retailers combined and that there no evidence that things are slowing down for them Like WalMart <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is pouring gobs of money into logistics and distribution Its deal with the US Post Office enables costeffective delivery using someone elses critical mass and capacity Amazons also bought a slew of tractor trailers to control its own delivery future and is investing in distribution centers like theres no tomorrow Then there are the planes the companys leasing the German airport its rumored to be buying and the drones it would like to see added to its delivery repertoire Physical bookstores are a mere shadow of themselves if you can even find one Most big box retailers are taking their lumps either directly or indirectly thanks to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>As Jeff Bezos famously said Your margin in my gain and that retail margin turned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gain comes in the form of either lost sales or lost margin as the consumers expectation of delivery from those stores has now become two days or less or someone else like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>In one corner we have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that nimble challenger to retail that is today a big fish in a small retail pond called online sales The Census says that online sales are roughly of all retail sales Mary Meeker says its after backing autos and a few other things out In either case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>owns of that or thats online sales today But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is skating to where the puck and its mobiletoting Alexapassionate and Amazonloving customers are going and is investing in even more things that will drive the commerce experience online in some way Presumably thats why analysts perceive the longterm value of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to trump WalMart Amazons vision of the retail world has digital retail capturing more and more of the retail flag than its brickandmortar incumbents have today Its investing in delivering that future plowing billions into experiments that will get the company there first and fastest delivering the convenience of buying online and getting things delivered fast at the same time it keeps prices low leveraging its assets and customer base along the way Amazons strategy is designed to keep its other online and physical retail challengers punching and punching and punching as it bobs and weaves building out its digital assets and expanding its digital ecosystem Then going in for the knockout blow when it believes its physical retail competitors are most vulnerable after years of fighting back but losing ground during each round In the other corner we have WalMart the reigning heavyweight champion of the world in the big pond called physical retail where or depending on what source you believe of physical retail still happens WalMarts knockout punch over the years has been everyday low prices and physical distribution that makes it convenient for consumers to visit a store since of consumers live within minutes of one And in key sectors like groceries the one thing that everyone needs to buy it has a commanding share allows consumers to place orders online and pay for those orders in cash if they want to and has massive business from consumers who use food stamps to buy their food Four percent of Amazons grocery business is from people using food stamps to make grocery purchases Amazons share of grocery sales is reported to be But the physical retail pond in which WalMart has been so dominant now has a powerful undercurrent called digital retail and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Consumers visit fewer stores and less frequently When they visit those stores they go to buy but the discovery part of their journey has happened well before they step foot in those stores The consumer only goes to WalMart or any physical store if they have something that a consumer cant or doesnt want to easily buy somewhere else including on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Who wins the rumble in the jungle remains to be seen and as all of these things go will be decided by the consumer wholl ultimately deliver the knockout punch For physical retail that fight will be fought and won well before she ever gets to your physical front door That means every single physical retailer better think about their business in the very same way that Jeff Bezos does We dont make money when we sell things We make money when we help customers make purchase decisions Where those purchase decisions actually get bought and from whom will be the rumble in the big retail jungle that every retailer should now be training for It made me wonder whether the WalMartUberLyft partnership announcement is part of WalMarts training to ropeadope its digital challenger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Maybe the company is using its low prices and massive delivery and distribution network to both juice its Walmartcom numbers and Walmart Pay user base and hook more consumers into going to a Walmart more often Doesnt sound implausible to me Consumers dont buy all of their groceries online but having them locked into WalMart for that one ubiquitous product category that every single person needs to buy sound familiar could be a big first step into getting existing consumers to buy more and for new consumers to give it a try WalMart is also leveraging a platform strategy that delivers reasonable economics for the company and uses brands like Uber and Lyft that the digital natives it wants to court also use and associate with hip and happening digital commerce innovation Could groceries be to WalMart what books were to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a product category that everyone needs to buy and WalMart can deliver cheaply and conveniently to get new consumers hooked Getting new consumers into the mix is missioncritical for WalMart So is plowing even more of its investments into product innovation and taking a good look at how its physical footprint needs to evolve to deliver the omnicommerce promise that these digitalsavvy consumers demand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on the other hand must be prepared to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee across the categories of physical retail that consumers want to buy online and in which the experience of doing so is better than what consumers can get from its physical retail counterparts If price and convenience are now table stakes the experience must win the day Twenty years after the Rumble in the Jungle matchup a year old George Foreman regained his heavyweight championship title by knocking out a yearold challenger Foremans lifetime record of wins and losses includes knockouts and the distinction of being the oldest heavyweight champion in history Alis overall record was wins and losses and knockouts One knockout punch it seems doesnt always mean the fight has been lost forever regardless of who threw it and when Tagged Investing Ideas
