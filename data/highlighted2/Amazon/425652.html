(Surprise) </span>When they visit those stores, they go to buy, but the discovery part of their journey has happened well before they step foot in those stores.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The consumer only goes to Wal-Mart or any physical store if they have something that a consumer ca n't or does n't want to easily buy <b>somewhere</b> else , including on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Who wins the rumble in the jungle remains to be seen and, as all of these things go, will be decided by the consumer, who'll ultimately deliver the knockout punch.For physical retail, that fight will be fought - and won - well before she ever gets to your physical front door.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That means every single physical retailer <i>better</i> think about their business in the very same way that Jeff Bezos does : `` We do n't make money when we sell things .

(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Doesn't sound implausible to me.Consumers don't buy all of their groceries online, but having them locked into Wal-Mart for that one ubiquitous product category that every single person needs to buy (sound familiar?)<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>could</b> be a big first step into getting existing consumers to buy <i>more</i> - and for new consumers to give it a try .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Wal-Mart is also leveraging a platform strategy that delivers reasonable economics for the company and uses brands like Uber and Lyft that the digital natives it wants to court also use and associate with hip and happening digital commerce innovation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Could</b> groceries be to Wal-Mart what books were to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - a product category that everyone needs to buy and Wal-Mart can deliver cheaply and conveniently to get new consumers hooked ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Getting new consumers into the mix is mission-critical for Wal-Mart.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So is plowing even <i>more</i> of its investments into product innovation and taking a good look at how its physical footprint needs to evolve to deliver the `` omnicommerce '' promise that these digital-savvy consumers demand .
