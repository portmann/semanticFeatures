( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha I still do n't think <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a real business worthy of one 's investment . My opinion has not changed on that.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nevertheless , I am throwing in the towel , and will now <b>assume</b> that it will start generating real earnings over the next few years .  (Uncertainty) </span>That does not mean one should buy <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Quite the contrary.Stay away from this stock.It's not worth it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In October , I outlined my thesis that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) was no <i>better</i> than Sun Microsystems was as a buy and hold company . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The main premise was that a company eventually has to prove that it can develop a consistent earnings stream to become a viable investment opportunity.Since 2011 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has yet to prove that it can string together positive earnings for two consecutive fiscal years . For one who relies on earnings trends to develop a future target price so they can then calculate a net present value, this is critical data.Because of this , my normal analytics do not work on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . When my post on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was posted on October 23 , 2015 , it was on the same day the company came out with an earnings beat . Because of the delay one experiences from writing a piece to the time it posts, I saw the stock's price jump from $560 to $608 during the interim.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is an 8.5 % pop , and if one reads the comments , I did take my lumps .  (Uncertainty) </span>Poster Gary J said, " Embaaaarisiiiiing!!SA should rethink this whole First Look 24 hour delay thing."One comment was so foul that Seeking Alpha took the post down.It's part of the deal when one publishes, but I don't let keyboard warriors deter me in my efforts to help my readership.Fortunately , time has been my best friend , and so far <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> handed back those early gains , and is actually down since that earnings pop . First , it is worth pointing out that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a low margin business . Here is a chart showing the net profit margin for the last ten fiscal years and the next two years.Is all this fuss worth it over such a low margin business?I've never seen it, and this company wouldn't even pass my initial screens for analysis.My main premise about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , though , has been that it is not worth my investment dollars because it simply can not establish an earnings history that is reliable . Too often, I feel like one is investing in Jeff Bezos' hobbies rather than any real business.That's my opinion though.With that in mind , I decided to accept the consensus opinion of Wall Street experts , and used their estimates to determine whether <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is undervalued enough to warrant my investment dollars . The general opinion is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will grow its business by increasing market share , and global growth in e-commerce . Here are a few charts that I developed using data from Morningstar and NASDAQ.After each chart, I will attempt to quantify the future worth of the company, and determine whether it is undervalued based on present value.The Street 's opinion is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenues will grow 20.4 % annually the next two fiscal years . That's impressive, and is part of a consistent narrative of ever increasing sales for the company.Over the last ten years, revenues have grown each year, and the analysts do not see that changing.Is this growth worth my investment dollars, though?Let's see.Currently , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Price/Sales ratio is 2.6 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That is 53 % <i>higher</i> than the industry average of 1.7 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Assuming some regression to the mean , I will <b>assume</b> that the future average should be <i>more</i> in line with its five year average of 2.1 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If these numbers hold true , then <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's fair market value at the end of 2017 will be $ 682.50 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That will net one a tidy 17.2% profit.Not bad.Here is the challenge, though.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is it worth the <b>risk</b> ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on Robert Shiller 's data , the historical <b>risk</b> free rate ( 10-year note ) is 4.69 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the S&P 500 averaging 8.97 % historically , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sitting at a beta of 1.65 , one would need to experience a Required Rate of Return of 11.75 % to warrant the <b>risk</b> of investing in this business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Knowing that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will announce its 2017 earnings in January 2018 , its current present value is $ 556.75 . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is overpriced by 4.5 % based on its future revenue growth . Now it is time to look at earnings, because isn't business about the bottom line?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it is not , then <b>maybe</b> I missed something when I was studying finance .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is here where the story about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's worth gets weird . Somehow, this low margin business is going to grow its earnings 146% per year over the next three years.I don't see it since it has only grown earnings at 12% annually over the last 10 years, and lately, earnings have been so unreliable that a recent S&P Capital IQ report did not even use a P/E ratio to evaluate the company.Nevertheless, I will grant this point to the Wall Street crowd, and attempt to see if we can find a fair market value for the company.First, which P/E ratio do I use?<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current P/E ratio is 466.6 , and its five-year average is 610.7 . Its P/E in 2010, which was the last time the company was on a trend of growing earnings, was 71.4.Regardless, all of these metrics are outrageous levels if one compares them to the industry average of 31.7.Even the Forward P/E ratio of 56.2 is too high compared to the industry average.This discussion alone should warn people how overpriced this company is.Still, I will try to make some hay out of these weeds.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Assuming that I need an 11.75 % annual price appreciation to justify my <b>risk</b> in this company , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> needs to be priced at $ 799 when it announces 2018 earnings in January 2019 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That will net me a nice 37 % profit , which justified the extra <b>risk</b> I took .  (Uncertainty) </span>For this to happen , though , that means <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is still selling at a P/E ratio of 42.75 . How and why will this happen?What logic lends it to conclude that these high valuations are justified, and will continue?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one <b>assumes</b> that the P/E will regress to a normal level , then <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is worth $ 432.50 right now . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One would be paying a 34 % premium immediately , then <b>hope</b> that it will continue to appreciate from there .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are those who have done quite well investing in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Good for them.No strategy finds all the winners, and those same strategies will ignore some winners outright.However, at no point do I ever see myself recommending this company.I simply don't see it.At some point, the bough must break, and I don't want to be on that branch when it does.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.</div></body></html>
