#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a real business worthy of ones investment My opinion has not changed on that Nevertheless I am throwing in the towel and will now assume that it will start generating real earnings over the next few years That does not mean one should buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Quite the contrary Stay away from this stock Its not worth it In October I outlined my thesis that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN was no better than Sun Microsystems was as a buy and hold company The main premise was that a company eventually has to prove that it can develop a consistent earnings stream to become a viable investment opportunity Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has yet to prove that it can string together positive earnings for two consecutive fiscal years For one who relies on earnings trends to develop a future target price so they can then calculate a net present value this is critical data Because of this my normal analytics do not work on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>When my post on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was posted on October it was on the same day the company came out with an earnings beat Because of the delay one experiences from writing a piece to the time it posts I saw the stocks price jump from to during the interim That is an pop and if one reads the comments I did take my lumps Poster Gary J said Embaaaarisiiiiing SA should rethink this whole First Look hour delay thing One comment was so foul that Seeking Alpha took the post down Its part of the deal when one publishes but I dont let keyboard warriors deter me in my efforts to help my readership Fortunately time has been my best friend and so far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>handed back those early gains and is actually down since that earnings pop First it is worth pointing out that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a low margin business Here is a chart showing the net profit margin for the last ten fiscal years and the next two years Is all this fuss worth it over such a low margin business Ive never seen it and this company wouldnt even pass my initial screens for analysis My main premise about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>though has been that it is not worth my investment dollars because it simply cannot establish an earnings history that is reliable Too often I feel like one is investing in Jeff Bezos hobbies rather than any real business Thats my opinion though With that in mind I decided to accept the consensus opinion of Wall Street experts and used their estimates to determine whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is undervalued enough to warrant my investment dollars The general opinion is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will grow its business by increasing market share and global growth in ecommerce Here are a few charts that I developed using data from Morningstar and NASDAQ After each chart I will attempt to quantify the future worth of the company and determine whether it is undervalued based on present value The Streets opinion is that Amazons revenues will grow annually the next two fiscal years Thats impressive and is part of a consistent narrative of ever increasing sales for the company Over the last ten years revenues have grown each year and the analysts do not see that changing Is this growth worth my investment dollars though Lets see Currently Amazons PriceSales ratio is That is higher than the industry average of Assuming some regression to the mean I will assume that the future average should be more in line with its five year average of If these numbers hold true then Amazons fair market value at the end of will be That will net one a tidy profit Not bad Here is the challenge though Is it worth the risk Based on Robert Shillers data the historical risk free rate year note is With the SP averaging historically and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sitting at a beta of one would need to experience a Required Rate of Return of to warrant the risk of investing in this business Knowing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will announce its earnings in January its current present value is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is overpriced by based on its future revenue growth Now it is time to look at earnings because isnt business about the bottom line If it is not then maybe I missed something when I was studying finance It is here where the story about Amazons worth gets weird Somehow this low margin business is going to grow its earnings per year over the next three years I dont see it since it has only grown earnings at annually over the last years and lately earnings have been so unreliable that a recent SP Capital IQ report did not even use a PE ratio to evaluate the company Nevertheless I will grant this point to the Wall Street crowd and attempt to see if we can find a fair market value for the company First which PE ratio do I use Amazons current PE ratio is and its fiveyear average is Its PE in which was the last time the company was on a trend of growing earnings was Regardless all of these metrics are outrageous levels if one compares them to the industry average of Even the Forward PE ratio of is too high compared to the industry average This discussion alone should warn people how overpriced this company is Still I will try to make some hay out of these weeds Assuming that I need an annual price appreciation to justify my risk in this company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>needs to be priced at when it announces earnings in January That will net me a nice profit which justified the extra risk I took For this to happen though that means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is still selling at a PE ratio of How and why will this happen What logic lends it to conclude that these high valuations are justified and will continue If one assumes that the PE will regress to a normal level then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is worth right now One would be paying a premium immediately then hope that it will continue to appreciate from there There are those who have done quite well investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Good for them No strategy finds all the winners and those same strategies will ignore some winners outright However at no point do I ever see myself recommending this company I simply dont see it At some point the bough must break and I dont want to be on that branch when it does Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
