(Uncertainty) </span>Some investors have been asking lately, why should we when profitability is going down?Those impressive margins have been cut in half this year, with Facebook earning "only" $512 million in net income for the March quarter, on $3.54 billion in revenue.That top line was up "only" about 40% from the previous March quarter.To justify its stock price, then, Facebook has to knock it out of the park every quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There seem to be <b>possibilities</b> for doing that , in Whatsupp and the growing interest in mobile games .  (Uncertainty) </span>However as model Kate Upton says in one of her Game of War ads, "but you must not delay."Facebook is increasingly being bound by political forces beyond its control.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whether we 're talking about national governments seeking control of their local Internets , dumb apps having to be pulled down , legal cases that <b>could</b> dissuade people from using social networks or pushback against its Internet.org efforts , Facebook is now facing opposition that wo n't yield easily to technical tweaks .
