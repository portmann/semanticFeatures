( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha This has been a pretty solid year for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investors : <i>better</i> profitability , FCF improvement , <i>more</i> cash sitting in the bank . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The improvement in cash management, ramping profitability in AWS, and resurgence in media resulted in a rally in the stock price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The most <b>surprising</b> aspect was the media component as it has been stubbornly stagnant over the years .  (Surprise) </span>However , various efforts by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to improve its positioning has resulted in growth . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , e-commerce data also supports a high possibility of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reporting at the high-end of sales this year , <b>perhaps</b> beating on earnings too . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While valuation has been a contentious issue , I <b>believe</b> that on a P/FCF basis it trades at a reasonable value when compared to other high-quality growth businesses in its space .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the most part , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) addressed a lot of issues in the past year . The cash issue has been resolved, and free cash flow metrics have improved.While there 's a degree of subjectivity to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's own reported FCF , I 'm going to save that for another time . After reconciling the data, I have found that the cash balance increased, so the improvement in cash flow isn't imaginary accounting manipulation, but actual efforts to improve upon balance sheet fundamentals.In terms of growth, we're starting to hear from industry analysts such as comScore that the retail season was strong.Obviously, a lot of discount purchasing has occurred, and various viral video uploads on YouTube confirmed how difficult it was to shop for bargains at brick-and-mortar.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I , on the other hand , would prefer avoiding black Friday closeouts due to the convenience of shopping online , and the patience needed to wait in front of a PC is a lot <i>less</i> strenuous than camping out in front of Target ( NYSE : TGT ) or Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) for that matter .  (Surprise) </span>While I can acknowledge that Target and Wal-Mart put on some phenomenal door buster sales in the consumer electronics category, I am woefully hesitant to rely on black Friday sales for both margin and sales uplift for well-established retailers.Not only do retailers report very narrow margins, it's difficult to beat prior year comps on well-established retail brands.Strong E-Commerce Growth Trends Heading Into Holiday 2015.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>U.S. ecommerce sales posted 15 % Y-o-Y growth in 3Q15 , flat from 2Q15 on a 1-point <i>harder</i> comp .  (Surprise) </span>Desktop e-commerce slowed to 8% for the quarter, but mobile commerce accelerated to make up the difference.Looking ahead, comScore, expects Y-o-Y growth of 13-15% for the Nov-Dec holiday period, aided by low gas prices and an extra shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.The Mizuho figures are based on comScore data.Furthermore, Adobe recently released data indicating that Black Friday and Thanksgiving sales, when combined, grew by 18.5% from prior year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> offered guidance of <b>roughly</b> 14 % to 25 % y-o-y growth in their Q3 '15 earnings release , so they 're on solid track to deliver top line figures . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Thankfully, no data point sticks out that indicates cyclical weakness or faltering consumption patterns among U.S. consumers.While weather played an important role in assessing the lead-up to black Friday, it doesn't seem to affect e-commerce companies as much.Nonetheless , it 's fair to mention that worsening weather conditions can impact the pricing of shipments due to delays , but much of that abnormality tends to be balanced out with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ability to secure large-scale shipping contracts from the various carriers . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's also worth mentioning that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's actual revenue is usually several points <i>higher</i> than the comScore figures for retail . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This is mostly driven by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ability to gain market share due to its ecosystem tie-in of Prime , which lowers shipping rates for average consumers . The company also competes aggressively on price during the holiday quarter, which is enabled by their large-scale warehouse infrastructure and pricing discounts due to their well-established wholesale network.In a sense, I view this competitive advantage as a key reason for holding onto this e-commerce retailer when compared to alternatives like eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD ).Nonetheless, some view these companies under the spotlight of deep value, but given the way tech companies have been discounted aggressively for poor market positioning or weak growth prospects, I would be hesitant to buy deeply discounted e-commerce companies.There are significant advantages to scale.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was also able to accelerate both domestic retail and media in the past couple of quarters . In the case of media , I think this was due to the increasing penetration of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire/Kindle e-Readers and tablets paired with its relative strength in the book publishing industry . Much of the industry has moved over to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's publisher ecosystem due to ease of deployment and high royalty rates . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the past , digital media consumption was dominated by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , but over time the game industry opted to sell games via their own channels via Steam , Origin , PSN , Xbox Live , and movie publishers got steamrolled by VOD and to a <i>smaller</i> extent piracy . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>However , these headwinds have been mitigated by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's strengthening presence through its Kindle Platform , integration into TV-sets and boxes , along with its Prime Streaming service . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The degree to which these factors impact media is hard to read into , but basically , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's efforts to bolster its media segment by competing in key categories while experiencing some encroachment from competition <b>seems</b> to have stabilized . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Hence the <i>healthier</i> pattern of growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The stock continues to rally and much of this was driven by profitability , which I had alluded to in the <i>earlier</i> parts of this article .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think there 's <i>more</i> room to expand the margin thus normalizing valuation making it <i>easier</i> for analysts to make valuation comps .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I go over this in <i>more</i> detail later on in this article .  (Surprise) </span>Also , it 's worth noting that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's AWS segment increased operating profitability ( 432 % y/y ) and has been able to ramp revenue ( 78 % y/y ) at a pretty steady pace . This segment is important due to its growth potential, but margin potential as well.The retail segment has a pretty low ceiling to profitability.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , leasing out data center architecture becomes <i>more</i> profitable due to vendor lock-in and platform specific advantages .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The various companies competing in the cloud segment have moved towards profitability , so while competition does become an interesting dynamic to watch , it <b>seems</b> microeconomic themes will continue to play out in the segment .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given the limited number of competitors , I feel like the industry will stabilize to a much <i>higher</i> profit rate of which , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will likely generate the bulk of the profits in the IaaS category . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When dealing with valuation comparison , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is actually a lot <i>easier</i> to work with this year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company 's reported FCF has improved pretty significantly , so it becomes <i>easier</i> to compare with some of its industry peers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When compared to old tech rivals like Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) who also happens to be a direct competitor , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still <b>seems</b> quite expensive . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does seem to overcompensate for this due to their improving margins in cloud and e-commerce . They've also expanded their online catalog in various international markets to increase international e-tail sales growth.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I believe the opportunity in mobile commerce is also under stated , which implies that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> could increase sales <b>assuming</b> they 're able to convert <i>more</i> of their mobile shoppers over time . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>While valuation remains a contentious issue among <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's investors . I think it's worth mentioning that the company isn't expensive when compared to other quality growth stocks like Facebook and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been able to execute on generating cash to reduce on solvency <b>risk</b> and has also improved its positioning in media .
