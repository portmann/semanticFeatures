year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>investors better profitability FCF improvement more cash sitting in the bank The improvement in cash management ramping profitability in AWS and resurgence in media resulted in a rally in the stock price The most surprising aspect was the media component as it has been stubbornly stagnant over the years However various efforts by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to improve its positioning has resulted in growth Furthermore ecommerce data also supports a high possibility of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reporting at the highend of sales this year perhaps beating on earnings too While valuation has been a contentious issue I believe that on a PFCF basis it trades at a reasonable value when compared to other highquality growth businesses in its space For the most part <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN addressed a lot of issues in the past year The cash issue has been resolved and free cash flow metrics have improved While theres a degree of subjectivity to Amazons own reported FCF Im going to save that for another time After reconciling the data I have found that the cash balance increased so the improvement in cash flow isnt imaginary accounting manipulation but actual efforts to improve upon balance sheet fundamentals In terms of growth were starting to hear from industry analysts such as comScore that the retail season was strong Obviously a lot of discount purchasing has occurred and various viral video uploads on YouTube confirmed how difficult it was to shop for bargains at brickandmortar I on the other hand would prefer avoiding black Friday closeouts due to the convenience of shopping online and the patience needed to wait in front of a PC is a lot less strenuous than camping out in front of Target NYSE TGT or WalMart NYSE WMT for that matter While I can acknowledge that Target and WalMart put on some phenomenal door buster sales in the consumer electronics category I am woefully hesitant to rely on black Friday sales for both margin and sales uplift for wellestablished retailers Not only do retailers report very narrow margins its difficult to beat prior year comps on wellestablished retail brands Strong ECommerce Growth Trends Heading Into Holiday US ecommerce sales posted YoY growth in Q flat from Q on a point harder comp Desktop ecommerce slowed to for the quarter but mobile commerce accelerated to make up the difference Looking ahead comScore expects YoY growth of for the NovDec holiday period aided by low gas prices and an extra shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year The Mizuho figures are based on comScore data Furthermore Adobe recently released data indicating that Black Friday and Thanksgiving sales when combined grew by from prior year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offered guidance of roughly to yoy growth in their Q earnings release so theyre on solid track to deliver top line figures Thankfully no data point sticks out that indicates cyclical weakness or faltering consumption patterns among US consumers While weather played an important role in assessing the leadup to black Friday it doesnt seem to affect ecommerce companies as much Nonetheless its fair to mention that worsening weather conditions can impact the pricing of shipments due to delays but much of that abnormality tends to be balanced out with Amazons ability to secure largescale shipping contracts from the various carriers Its also worth mentioning that Amazons actual revenue is usually several points higher than the comScore figures for retail This is mostly driven by Amazons ability to gain market share due to its ecosystem tiein of Prime which lowers shipping rates for average consumers The company also competes aggressively on price during the holiday quarter which is enabled by their largescale warehouse infrastructure and pricing discounts due to their wellestablished wholesale network In a sense I view this competitive advantage as a key reason for holding onto this ecommerce retailer when compared to alternatives like eBay NASDAQ EBAY and JDcom NASDAQ JD Nonetheless some view these companies under the spotlight of deep value but given the way tech companies have been discounted aggressively for poor market positioning or weak growth prospects I would be hesitant to buy deeply discounted ecommerce companies There are significant advantages to scale <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was also able to accelerate both domestic retail and media in the past couple of quarters In the case of media I think this was due to the increasing penetration of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>FireKindle eReaders and tablets paired with its relative strength in the book publishing industry Much of the industry has moved over to Amazons publisher ecosystem due to ease of deployment and high royalty rates In the past digital media consumption was dominated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but over time the game industry opted to sell games via their own channels via Steam Origin PSN Xbox Live and movie publishers got steamrolled by VOD and to a smaller extent piracy However these headwinds have been mitigated by Amazons strengthening presence through its Kindle Platform integration into TVsets and boxes along with its Prime Streaming service The degree to which these factors impact media is hard to read into but basically Amazons efforts to bolster its media segment by competing in key categories while experiencing some encroachment from competition seems to have stabilized Hence the healthier pattern of growth The stock continues to rally and much of this was driven by profitability which I had alluded to in the earlier parts of this article I think theres more room to expand the margin thus normalizing valuation making it easier for analysts to make valuation comps I go over this in more detail later on in this article Also its worth noting that Amazons AWS segment increased operating profitability yy and has been able to ramp revenue yy at a pretty steady pace This segment is important due to its growth potential but margin potential as well The retail segment has a pretty low ceiling to profitability However leasing out data center architecture becomes more profitable due to vendor lockin and platform specific advantages The various companies competing in the cloud segment have moved towards profitability so while competition does become an interesting dynamic to watch it seems microeconomic themes will continue to play out in the segment Given the limited number of competitors I feel like the industry will stabilize to a much higher profit rate of which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will likely generate the bulk of the profits in the IaaS category When dealing with valuation comparison <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is actually a lot easier to work with this year The companys reported FCF has improved pretty significantly so it becomes easier to compare with some of its industry peers When compared to old tech rivals like Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT who also happens to be a direct competitor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still seems quite expensive However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does seem to overcompensate for this due to their improving margins in cloud and ecommerce Theyve also expanded their online catalog in various international markets to increase international etail sales growth I believe the opportunity in mobile commerce is also under stated which implies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could increase sales assuming theyre able to convert more of their mobile shoppers over time While valuation remains a contentious issue among Amazons investors I think its worth mentioning that the company isnt expensive when compared to other quality growth stocks like Facebook and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX Also <span style='background-color:
