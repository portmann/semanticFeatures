( NASDAQ : AAPL ) | Seeking Alpha Mar 16 2016 , 17:24 ET | About : Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) | By : Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Sources tell enterprise tech site CRN Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) has begun using Google 's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) cloud infrastructure ( IaaS ) platform , and has `` significantly reduced its reliance '' on market leader <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , which it has used to help run iCloud and other services . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Google execs have reportedly told partners Apple is spending $400M-$600M on the Google Cloud Platform - CRN says it isn't clear if this reflects an annual spending rate or capacity purchases.Morgan Stanley estimated last month Apple, which has been investing heavily in its own data center infrastructure, spends ~$1B/year on AWS.The report comes three weeks after Spotify, which has relied on both AWS and its own servers, announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform.It also shortly follows a Wired column about cloud storage giant Dropbox's (Private: DROPB ) efforts to migrate stored files from AWS to a home-grown infrastructure relying on "a software system built by its own programmers with a brand new programming language" (not something many companies have the resources to pull off).Aside from Spotify, known Google clients include Snapchat, Coca-Cola, Best Buy, and Sony.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still towers over the IaaS market , while Google is viewed as # 3 or # 4 ( behind <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Microsoft , and <b>perhaps</b> IBM ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Synergy Research estimates Google 's IaaS and cloud app platform ( PaaS ) revenue totaled <i>less</i> than ~ $ 300M in Q4 ; <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reported Q4 AWS revenue of $ 2.4 B ( +69 % Y/Y ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Michael Fraser , head of cloud management software firm InfiniteOps , argues Google 's huge fiber network provides bandwidth cost savings - <b>possibly</b> an incentive for Apple , given the amount of download activity it handles - and that its platform ( per InfiniteOps ' tests ) delivers <i>better</i> performance than that of any major rival .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>"Google is actually the cheapest play in the market when you take into consideration everything they're doing and when you take into account their various incentives."<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> closed down 0.5 % after slipping in the wake of CRN 's column ( the Nasdaq rose 0.8 % ) , and is down 1 % in after-hours trading . It is not bad to buy your initial business to gain a reputation.But Google is obviously not some startup.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` Since the beginning of the year , <i>more</i> than 1,000 databases from `` many hundreds '' of companies have used an early version of its migration service , said AWS vice president Adam Selipsky .  (Surprise) </span>"You can clearly see that we're now getting into the meat of enterprise adoption of the cloud."Yes Glen.The issue is margins.All of these companies - GOOG, AMZN, and IBM - have "economies of scale".<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The challenge is that is getting <i>easier</i> and <i>easier</i> for customers to spread their business out among different Cloud SPs and <i>easier</i> to migrate applications from one to another with the click of a mouse .  (Surprise) </span>On one side of the coin, it's a massive business opportunity.On the other side, margins will get capped which is why investors need to consider valuations.IMO, it is about market share and NOT margins today.It is a land grab right now.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was well ahead of the game . Gary,   Come on do you not remember the case tool days when we just pushed a button and all our code was written for us?If Google is using this as a ploy to data mine my activities when using Apple's cloud services, I will be migrating to another manufacturer.I do not want any of my data stored on Google servers and will be shutting down my iCloud backups.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>may</b> also be compelled to migrate off of Apple 's email also .  (Uncertainty) </span>I have to agree not interest in any of my limited data being stored on Google servers.I tend to store all my information my computer.My company switch from Outlook to Gmail for corporate email and services.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We were told Google did not data mine corporate email , but no one <b>could</b> explains how ads were showing up on my personal home computer which I never use gmail or any other google services was showing me ads based on emails in my work gmail account .  (Uncertainty) </span>What I do at work is completely different than what I do at home and the ads that should up were for companies I worked with at work, and the only way for Google to know I had some relationship with those company was to read my work emails.I know Google at some people made a connection between my work computer internet searches and my home computer, however, in the case of these companies I never did any searching about them on the internet at work or at home.I tell people about this all the time, you can not trust what Google is doing with your data on their servers.what an uneducated comment.Blind fanboyism wont get you far away.Obviously google is not data mining.But yes your data will be stored on google servers.What are you going to do?Stop buying apple devices now?We switched Google mail at work also, and have noticed the same thing happening.I get ads showing up in my email for services related to my work also.Everyone in my office has noticed this.It is creepy, and never used to happen on our old mail system.I once worked  for a major outfit that insisted that we use gmail accounts.I refused, on account of a NDA that I signed with another company disclosing to a third party (in that case Google) sensitive information.People need to realize that google is not a 'common carrier'.They have access to every morsel of data that you store on their computers, and they *will* use that data to their advantage.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In some cases , that <b>could</b> even mean to their own proprietary advantage .  (Uncertainty) </span>Most corporations (and people generally) would like to know, at the very least, if the FBI/NSA/CIA/etc. is snooping around in their data.But when one outsources to, say, Google, those three-letter agencies can use secret warrants to examine data without even tipping you off to the existence of such.Mark,   You just laid out the #1 reason why you should use Google.Since Google makes their money leveraging information there is  ZERO chance they would ever sell it.Agreed Garrrrlic.Azure is no slouch either.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I would have guessed the relationship with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> have been <i>more</i> synergistic than with Google . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has always offered the best deal Google recently closed a deal for Qualcomm chipped ARM operated Servers with fast memory and bandwidth for HPC Cluster Servers and Networking . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They save a whole lot of money over Intel , are <i>cheaper</i> to maintain and run far <i>more</i> efficiently !  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>... so yeah Google is getting ready to blow the competition out the door with <i>lower</i> priced cloud services and storage !  (Surprise) </span>"Sources tell CRN."LOL  This is at least 2 levels of hearsay which makes it inherently unreliable.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Why spread what you know are only unconfirmed <b>rumors</b> ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Let's see.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> basically is financed for ` free ' by the markets equity-wise . Apple has a P/E of what, 14 or so.Apple is just using <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( and now , Google ) as a form of cheap off-balance-sheet financing for functions of their business that they 'd otherwise have to commit equity . Smart for Apple.Kind of dumb for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Google . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And if Google is winning business from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , they had <i>better</i> a major technological/cost advantage in providing service . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Otherwise, they're subsidizing their customer (Apple).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ETF Screener : Search and filter by asset class , strategy , theme , performance , yield , and much <i>more</i> ETF Performance : View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
