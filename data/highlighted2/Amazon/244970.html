(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple needs to grow sales 20%/year to sustain its growth model.The iPhone and Mac are doing great, the iPad not so much.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has remained a quiet, and modest profit maker to investors so far this year.The shares are up just 8.09% since January.Add in the 1.74% yield and you get a return of about 10%.Nice in a year where the Dow (of which it's a part) is flat, but right in line with gains in its Nasdaq market, which are just .3% behind it.Apple has become what General Motors (NYSE: GM ) was in the 1960s, a stock to own, a classic "widows and orphans" stock.Is there anything that can get it out of first gear?Since its introduction in 2010, the iPad has mainly remained what it was then, a tablet computer, as well as an extra screen for the kids on the road, or a WiFi TV.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you bought one then you <b>may</b> still be using it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It may still work great , and it 's <b>probably</b> still providing value .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's the problem.Chances are great you don't still have your iPhone 3 or the laptop you used then.Chances are that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is n't sending your files through the same server , either . You , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , have upgraded . But you don't need to upgrade an iPad.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple tried <i>earlier</i> this year to create an upgrade path for the iPad the way it did for the iPhone , with a <i>bigger</i> model .  (Surprise) </span>It even added a stylus for close work.It hasn't worked.What Apple wanted from the iPad Pro was that it would "stick a knife into PCs."It hasn't.Now Apple is a facing a developer revolt .Ostensibly it's over the policies of the App Store, which don't seem to let mobile app makers earn as much as they do from making, say, Macintosh software.But it's really over high-end software, creative software that takes big money to produce but which only sells to creatives and, thus, doesn't sell as many units as consumer software.Apple needs this kind of software to hit in order to force an upgrade path, in order to make current iPad owners give theirs to the kids and run to get another one.Developers are saying they can't make the numbers work and that they have alternatives.I'm not saying that this problem is insoluble.It's not.I'm saying that Apple has yet to solve it, that the lack of an "induced" upgrade path is hampering iPad sales, and that slow iPad sales are slowing the growth of the company as a whole.Solve this problem and Apple stock will get out of first gear.Get people to replace their iPads en masse and Apple sales will soar.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Failure to solve this problem makes it difficult to see the company exceeding the <b>nearly</b> $ 75 billion in sales it achieved last Christmas , not by the 20 % it needs to sustain its growth model .  (Uncertainty) </span>I'm not selling Apple on this call.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But I 'm not buying <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>I will when I see a viable upgrade path, both for my investment and the iPad.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
