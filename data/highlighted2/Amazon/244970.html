But you don't need to upgrade an iPad.Apple tried earlier this year to create an upgrade path for the iPad the way it did for the iPhone, with a bigger model.It even added a stylus for close work.It hasn't worked.What Apple wanted from the iPad Pro was that it would "stick a knife into PCs."It hasn't.Now Apple is a facing a developer revolt .Ostensibly it's over the policies of the App Store, which don't seem to let mobile app makers earn as much as they do from making, say, Macintosh software.But it's really over high-end software, creative software that takes big money to produce but which only sells to creatives and, thus, doesn't sell as many units as consumer software.Apple needs this kind of software to hit in order to force an upgrade path, in order to make current iPad owners give theirs to the kids and run to get another one.Developers are saying they can't make the numbers work and that they have alternatives.I'm not saying that this problem is insoluble.It's not.I'm saying that Apple has yet to solve it, that the lack of an "induced" upgrade path is hampering iPad sales, and that slow iPad sales are slowing the growth of the company as a whole.Solve this problem and Apple stock will get out of first gear.Get people to replace their iPads en masse and Apple sales will soar.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Failure to solve this problem makes it difficult to see the company exceeding the <b>nearly</b> $ 75 billion in sales it achieved last Christmas , not by the 20 % it needs to sustain its growth model .  (Uncertainty) </span>I'm not selling Apple on this call.But I'm not buying more.I will when I see a viable upgrade path, both for my investment and the iPad.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
