Facebook Now Payments Biggest Threat Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Editors note This article first appeared here on Pymntscom in March Innovation Project was all about Innovation at the Intersections a nod to the influence of the many powerful ecosystems that are now shaping the future of payments and commerce Our two days of discussion focused on the extent to which the individual and collective actions of those ecosystems either create big crashes and traffic jams at those intersections or an orderly crossing to a new digital payments and commerce future A lot of what happens of course depends on who does what and how and when Thats why Facebooks NASDAQ FB launch of its PP payments capability via its Messenger app has made a lot of people a little nervous about Facebook positioning itself to become the next big thing in payments Facebook was brushed aside by lots of folks including me as a social platform that had failed pretty miserably at igniting payments and commerce on its social network At one time and not all that long ago Facebook just seemed like the perfect walled garden in which to launch commerce a captive audience of hundreds of millions of consumers who checked Facebook multiple times a day and spent minutes there stalking their friends uploading photos and liking pages Except that commerce on Facebook outside of that driven by advertising on Facebook has had a very rocky history As a social network Facebook is all about broadcasting aka boasting updates to friends Want to brag to your network about hopping on a plane and heading to St Barts in February when the rest of us slobs are under feet of snow in Boston Facebook has just the status update for you But that same rule applied to broadcasting shopping updates can get pretty complicated People are funny about how much info about their spending habits they want to share with their network Maybe theyd like to keep their husband from knowing that they just bought another pair of Jimmy Choos Then again maybe they dont want their friends to know they did either since theyd prefer not to see them wearing the same pair at the next cocktail party they attend together Or maybe they just dont think that its any of anyones business what they buy how often and how much they spend when they do go shopping And since most people dont really understand how to manage their privacy settings to limit who sees what updates theres always this nagging fear that any action taken on Facebook including buying stuff would be open to the whole world to see and therefore to know So between Facebooks early attempt at commerce via Beacon which spoiled an engagement surprise by broadcasting that a guy bought a ring for his girl and planned to propose the Facebook Credits closure the shuttering of Gifts and the change in the news feed algorithms that made it impossibly expensive for merchants to use Facebook to message their fans with an offer to buy something the notion of commerce on Facebook pretty much came to a grinding halt a couple of years ago As did anyones expectations of payments and commerce igniting on the social network Which is why Messenger and its payments ambitions is now such an interesting topic of conversation Messenger has million consumers who message each other every day and a lot The number of messages sent each day via Messenger isnt reported but we do know that Whats App which Facebook also owns is said to generate billion messages a day among its million user base Even if Messenger generates percent of that volume thats a lotta messages flying back and forth between people in private In Pew reported that percent of people young and old who own smartphones text Three years later that number is probably even higher Boomers learned to text since it was among the only way to communicate with their offspring and smartphones with keyboards made keeping tabs on junior simple and fast And messaging others is an easy habit to develop Messenger also has David Marcus former PayPal President at the helm David is a mobile guy who started and sold a few mobilefocused ventures including Zong which PayPal acquired in While at PayPal Marcus no doubt got schooled on payments and the fact that payments is above all a risk business Its therefore not a big surprise that Messengers PP capability leverages the existing credit and debit card rails to enable people who are already connected with each other in some way to send money to each other for free for now I cant wait for all of the friend requests to come streaming in from Nigerian royalty Sending money to friends via existing credit and debit cards is a very clever way to authenticate the identity of the sender and receiver of the funds By leveraging a network of people who are already known to each other and who have been vetted by their issuer to have a credit or debit account gives Messenger a good way to authenticate the identity of sender and receiver and reduce the risk that either the sender or the receiver of the funds arent who they say they are Messenger also has one other important characteristic that the Facebook social network doesnt and thats the ability to enable onetoone interactions Of course groups can chat and do but for the most part messaging is done between two people in private When Facebook spun off Messenger it also cut the cord from its social network mother ship and jettisoned any potential baggage associated with doing activities more appropriate in a onetoone environment like paying people and businesses and merchants from those designed for a much more social and onetomany setting like posting pictures of the kids dogs and grandkids Marcus says he has always admired Chinas WeChat platform and used it as the inspiration for his vision of what Messenger could become That suggests that PP is likely Messengers first act Like Messenger WeChat started as a chat platform but over the last several years has evolved to become much more a network of billion people of whom million are active users Payments is embedded in WeChat and registered users can send each other money buy tickets pay bills hail and pay for taxis and order and pay for stuff from storefronts that operate on its platform It also can enable the payment of items in store via QR codes In a relatively short period of time WeChat has evolved to become the top influencer of luxury brand preference of Chinese consumers too And it has done this by embedding payments capabilities inside a network that has become an ecosystem central to the lifestyle of the Chinese consumer Facebook and its announcement of payments via Messenger also made a bit more tangible a few of the key themes that we discussed last week at Innovation Project For instance Sir Tim BernersLee creator of the World Wide Web and iPhone owner stunned the crowd on Wednesday morning when he suggested that innovation in payments needs to be independent of any device Innovation can only flourish he believes when people can enable any commerce opportunity via any connected device securely His frame of reference of course is the Internet and the World Wide Web which can be accessed via any device at any time including the most basic of phones That he believes is why the Web has become so central to our existence and in just years has grown to some billion pages And also why apps like WeChat and Alipay and PayPal have hundreds of millions of users their dependencies are entirely a function of the value associated with creating an account and using it not on which devices they own I didnt ask and he didnt have an opportunity to explain why Apple NASDAQ AAPL which only innovates on its own hardware has been so much more successful by the vote of the people who buy plus our own Pii innovation index than Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Android which adopts the open hardware approach That software trumps hardware all day long theme surfaced later that same day when the debate over mobile vs apps in the retail setting was raised There was a pretty divided camp over apps and the ability of smartphones to accommodate zillions of them and the friction associated with having to ask consumers to download and then use them The smart moneys on responsive design and the ability for consumers to have a better Web experience on their phones or tablets by simply having the Web adapt to those smaller screens Of course that will only trigger commerce if payment can be made both easy and frictionless We all realize that the future of payments is not about payments at all but about making the act of payment invisible and a part of something else searching for and then booking a flight searching for and then buying a concert or a movie ticket searching for and then ordering something online to pick up in a store even for example being reminded to stop into the dry cleaners to pick up clothes when in the vicinity of the store and then having that service automatically charged to the account registered at that store That whole notion was debated further during the discussion of the latest Apple Pay adoption results led by Hooked author Nir Eyal and InfoScout CEO Jared Schrieber Without ubiquity it seems pretty clear that consumers have to be given a reason and a reward to remember to break an old payments habit to create a new one The act of payment alone isnt enough of a hook for most people to go to the trouble not knowing whether a new form of payment is accepted creates more friction than simply whipping out a plastic card that consumers know works just about everywhere they go Making payments invisible also implies a need to take the security game up a few dozen notches The discussion with General Keith Alexander and Kevin Mandia from FireEye NASDAQ FEYE was as terrifying as it was enlightening A shift away from efforts focused simply on authorizing transactions to those that can authenticate the identity of the consumer or business initiating those transactions is the imperative for payments moving forward And of course doing it in a way that doesnt introduce friction in the relationships that businesses want to have with their consumers Friction of course was a key theme over the course of the two days Solving for friction in payments and commerce is whats giving rise to the emergence of mobile money schemes in developing countries and better ways of moving money across border for commerce and business purposes But despite the spirited debate over the degree to which cryptocurrency and software could make both easier and cheaper few walked away convinced that innovators using software to leverage rails and networks already in place and already in compliance was a far better option than ditching them for free unregulated cryptoenabled rails And of course we learned on Thursday morning that the most innovative players in payments arent traditional payments companies at all The results of the Pii Payments Innovation Index revealed that six of the top highest ranking companies are technology companies Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Facebook PayPal Google GOOG GOOGL and Alibaba NYSE BABA companies whose core business isnt payments but are interested in payments because its complementary to their commerce capabilities Whats also stunning is how many traditional payments companies including some of the giants of the industry didnt make it into the Top or even to the top of the segments we examined as part of our work I suppose if you wanted validation of the relevance of the innovation at the intersections concept Pii sort of spells it all out for you Which brings me full circle to Facebook We got a hint of the potential impact that Facebook could have on payments when we reviewed the initial results of Pii about six weeks ago At that time we saw what most of you did a few days ago Facebook beating out three existing payments networks all of the issuers and even PayPal It was at first a puzzle But in addition to scoring highly on marketcompany indicators and the expert survey Facebook has been methodically investing in payments patents as evidenced by the massive war chest of patents it has accumulated Facebooks patent war chest is only slightly less valuable than Visas NYSE V and Amazons which combined have been in payments about times longer than Facebook has been in existence Payments innovation is like an iceberg its what you cant see thats critical In other words Facebook probably isnt the only company that should keep you up at night sweating bullets There are undoubtedly others that are making investments in payments that arent all that visible yet but will pop up when they feel the time is right Which for Facebook and Messenger was recently and well timed to coincide with its F Developer Conference and PayPals impending IPO Of course all we have at the moment is an announcement As we all know the proof is in the execution If Messenger can execute on its payments ambitions it could become an interesting new player at the intersection of payments and commerce and maybe even cause a few multicar pileups in the process In the US PP is a crowded field and the domain of a bunch of players some more established and entrenched than others PayPal Venmo Square SnapCash and bankled clearXchange not to mention WeChat which has million users including me its great outside of China and Alipay And Facebook has tried a number of prior payments experiments that have fumbled badly in the payments and commerce space But embedding payment inside of messaging also is an interesting way for merchants to explore the onetoone personalized commerce relationship that they seek with their customers Texting is being used now by businesses to confirm appointments message about statuses and send useful information that typically generates an immediate action often to percent higher response rates than via email So dont be surprised if at Facebooks F developer conference this week you hear Marcus invite developers to write commerce apps for Messenger that can leverage the registered payments card accounts that it hopes to create or even act as an incentive for consumers to register them in the first place Its a short hop from sending money to friends to enabling the purchase of things that people do socially with their friends tickets to movies or concerts taking trips pitching in for group gifts going out to eat and splitting the check etc Unlike WeChat Messenger has the headwinds of building a user base in the US which is where it is launching alongside others that have tens and even hundreds of millions of registered users and that offer PP alongside a portfolio of payments and commerce services that create additional value and utility for consumers merchants and businesses WeChats success and even Japans Line is the result of filling a void by eliminating the friction of doing basic things like payments and commerce in a connected world The environment in the US is vastly different as are the expectations of its consumers who increasingly find friction in having to use multiple different apps to do similar things For Messenger to be successful it will have to solve a problem for consumers that isnt being addressed today by any existing solution Will just offering PP payments capabilities be enough for them to build a payments business Well it wasnt for Square which found that PP did diddlysquat to build its own consumer wallet platform which it shuttered a while back Or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which shut down its PP capabilities less than a year after introducing it Or even Google which continues to struggle to ignite payments on or offline Messenger will have to quickly introduce something that solves a problem or unlocks other value to capture the consumers interest and as we learned from the Hooked discussion last week getting consumers off of one thing that works for them today and onto another isnt ever easy Even if you have million users in your sandbox But having a new player in the space with a different approach makes being at the intersection of payments and commerce and innovation a whole lot
