(Surprise) </span>I suppose if you wanted validation of the relevance of the "innovation at the intersections" concept, Pii360 sort of spells it all out for you.Which brings me full circle to Facebook.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We got a hint of the potential impact that Facebook <b>could</b> have on payments when we reviewed the initial results of Pii360 about six weeks ago .  (Uncertainty) </span>At that time, we saw what most of you did a few days ago - Facebook beating out three existing payments networks, all of the issuers and even PayPal.It was, at first, a puzzle.But in addition to scoring highly on market/company indicators and the expert survey, Facebook has been methodically investing in payments patents as evidenced by the massive war chest of patents it has accumulated.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Facebook 's patent war chest is only slightly <i>less</i> valuable than Visa 's ( NYSE : V ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's which , combined , have been in payments about 10 times <i>longer</i> than Facebook has been in existence . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Payments innovation is like an iceberg, it's what you can't see that's critical.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words , Facebook <b>probably</b> is n't the only company that should keep you up at night , sweating bullets .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are undoubtedly others that are making investments in payments that aren't all that visible yet, but will pop up when they feel the time is right.Which for Facebook and Messenger was recently - and well timed to coincide with its F8 Developer Conference and PayPal's impending IPO.Of course, all we have at the moment is an announcement.As we all know, the proof is in the execution.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Messenger can execute on its payments ambitions , it could become an interesting new player at the intersection of payments and commerce and <b>maybe</b> even cause a few multi-car pileups in the process .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the U.S. , P2P is a crowded field and the domain of a bunch of players - some <i>more</i> established and entrenched than others - PayPal , Venmo , Square , SnapCash and bank-led clearXchange , not to mention WeChat which has 100 million users ( including me - it 's great ! )  (Surprise) </span>outside of China and Alipay.And Facebook has tried a number of prior payments experiments that have fumbled badly in the payments and commerce space.But embedding payment inside of messaging also is an interesting way for merchants to explore the one-to-one, personalized, commerce relationship that they seek with their customers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Texting is being used now by businesses to confirm appointments , message about statuses and send useful information that typically generates an immediate action , often 25 to 30 percent <i>higher</i> response rates than via email .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So do n't be <b>surprised</b> if at Facebook 's F8 developer conference this week you hear Marcus invite developers to write commerce apps for Messenger that can leverage the registered payments card accounts that it <b>hopes</b> to create - or even act as an incentive for consumers to register them in the first place .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's a short <b>hop</b> from sending money to friends to enabling the purchase of things that people do socially with their friends - tickets to movies or concerts , taking trips , pitching in for group gifts , going out to eat and splitting the check , etc. .  (Uncertainty) </span>Unlike WeChat, Messenger has the headwinds of building a user base in the U.S. (which is where it is launching) alongside others that have tens and even hundreds of millions of registered users and that offer P2P alongside a portfolio of payments and commerce services that create additional value and utility for consumers, merchants and businesses.WeChat's success - and even Japan's Line - is the result of filling a void by eliminating the friction of doing basic things like payments and commerce in a connected world.The environment in the U.S. is vastly different as are the expectations of its consumers who increasingly find friction in having to use multiple, different apps to do similar things.For Messenger to be successful, it will have to solve a problem for consumers that isn't being addressed today by any existing solution.Will just offering P2P payments capabilities be enough for them to build a payments business?Well, it wasn't for Square, which found that P2P did diddly-squat to build its own consumer wallet platform which it shuttered a while back.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> which shut down its P2P capabilities <i>less</i> than a year after introducing it . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Or even Google which continues to struggle to ignite payments on or offline.Messenger will have to quickly introduce something that solves a problem or unlocks other value to capture the consumer's interest - and as we learned from the "Hooked" discussion last week, getting consumers off of one thing that works for them today and onto another isn't ever easy.Even if you have 700 million users in your sandbox.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But having a new player in the space with a different approach makes being at the intersection of payments and commerce and innovation a whole lot <i>more</i> interesting , do n't you think ?
