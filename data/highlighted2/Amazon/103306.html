(Uncertainty) </span>Ford has to modify its way of thinking about how consumers want to use and own cars to stay attractive and competitive.Ford (NYSE: F ) is keeping up with the ride sharing app trend with its latest Ford car sharing test program to run until November.Drivers looking for a car to drive on even an hourly basis will be able to use the Ford2Go app to rent Ford cars in the US and the UK.The automaker is partnering with Getaround, a peer-to-peer car sharing company that advertises car sharing for as little as $5 per hour.Getaround currently operates in four cities on the west coast and in Washington D.C.In the UK, Ford has chosen easyCar Club to run its new trial, where the company says it operates throughout the UK.easyCar Club launched in February 2014 The Ford2Go car sharing program has been running already in Germany with DB Rent in 2014 and Flinkster from this year.Ford estimates that about 14,000 Ford cars will be available in the US and 12,000 in the UK during the trial.The US trial will involve select Ford Credit customers in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Portland, Chicago and Washington D.C.The cars will be sourced from Ford Credit-financed vehicles on a voluntary basis from owners.Announcing the new US and UK car sharing trials , Ford Credit vice president of marketing David McClelland said, "Consumers tell us they are interested in sharing the costs of vehicle ownership, and this program will help us understand how much that extends to customers who are financing a Ford vehicle.As most vehicles are parked and out of use much of the time, this can help us gauge our customers' desires to pick up extra cash and keep their vehicles in use."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The love for cars <b>may</b> still be strong , but Millennials and Generation Z consumers consider money savings and the opportunity to try new products as major pluses in service sharing .  (Uncertainty) </span>Ford2Go offers the Millennial generation consumer three things they love: convenience, easy access, and a way to make some money on the side.Ford sees car sharing as a way to showcase its cars, but in my opinion it is good marketing that suits the mindset of the next generation of car owners.They can become repeat Ford car purchasers because there is an attractive and modern way to defray the cost of ownership.It is also a good way to compete with the rise of ride sharing services like Uber and Lyft, which forego the ownership of cars altogether (unless you're a driver) and allow users to hitch a ride.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a car company , Ford will want to promote car ownership directly and indirectly as much as <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Being innovative and progressive with this trial service gets consumers thinking about Ford cars.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Overall , I think car sharing <b>could</b> help Ford auto sales .  (Uncertainty) </span>People value having a car at their disposal and the love for cars and traveling won't change.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This potentially <b>could</b> make buying a Ford <i>more</i> appealing because owners would have that option to share their car safely within a Ford car care and protection program rather than just with an aftersales third-party app service .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the opposite side , a part of Ford 's and other carmakers ' future car sales <b>may</b> be in jeopardy .  (Uncertainty) </span>The market research company Gartner Inc projects that by 2025 as much as 20% of urban area cars will be available for shared use.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If that amount of cars are being shared , it <b>could</b> delay or even reduce car sales .  (Uncertainty) </span>This potential situation will shape future carmaker marketing.Ford CEO Mark Fields said his company has to think "like a mobility company" as well as a car producer.Consumer preferences for convenience are being shaped by services like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , with its quick and free deliveries , and the laid-back style of Uber . Ford is setting itself apart from competitors by taking a progressive stance on car sharing.That can help the bottom line later on.Source: Ford Is Staying Up With The Times With New Car Sharing Program Trial Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
