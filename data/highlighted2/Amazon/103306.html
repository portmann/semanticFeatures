cities and the UK Participants are selected from among Ford Credit customers for the trial Ford expects it may get as many as US cars involved the program in the UK Ford has to modify its way of thinking about how consumers want to use and own cars to stay attractive and competitive Ford NYSE F is keeping up with the ride sharing app trend with its latest Ford car sharing test program to run until November Drivers looking for a car to drive on even an hourly basis will be able to use the FordGo app to rent Ford cars in the US and the UK The automaker is partnering with Getaround a peertopeer car sharing company that advertises car sharing for as little as per hour Getaround currently operates in four cities on the west coast and in Washington DC In the UK Ford has chosen easyCar Club to run its new trial where the company says it operates throughout the UK easyCar Club launched in February The FordGo car sharing program has been running already in Germany with DB Rent in and Flinkster from this year Ford estimates that about Ford cars will be available in the US and in the UK during the trial The US trial will involve select Ford Credit customers in San Francisco Oakland Berkeley Portland Chicago and Washington DC The cars will be sourced from Ford Creditfinanced vehicles on a voluntary basis from owners Announcing the new US and UK car sharing trials Ford Credit vice president of marketing David McClelland said Consumers tell us they are interested in sharing the costs of vehicle ownership and this program will help us understand how much that extends to customers who are financing a Ford vehicle As most vehicles are parked and out of use much of the time this can help us gauge our customers desires to pick up extra cash and keep their vehicles in use The love for cars may still be strong but Millennials and Generation Z consumers consider money savings and the opportunity to try new products as major pluses in service sharing FordGo offers the Millennial generation consumer three things they love convenience easy access and a way to make some money on the side Ford sees car sharing as a way to showcase its cars but in my opinion it is good marketing that suits the mindset of the next generation of car owners They can become repeat Ford car purchasers because there is an attractive and modern way to defray the cost of ownership It is also a good way to compete with the rise of ride sharing services like Uber and Lyft which forego the ownership of cars altogether unless youre a driver and allow users to hitch a ride As a car company Ford will want to promote car ownership directly and indirectly as much as possible Being innovative and progressive with this trial service gets consumers thinking about Ford cars Overall I think car sharing could help Ford auto sales People value having a car at their disposal and the love for cars and traveling wont change This potentially could make buying a Ford more appealing because owners would have that option to share their car safely within a Ford car care and protection program rather than just with an aftersales thirdparty app service On the opposite side a part of Fords and other carmakers future car sales may be in jeopardy The market research company Gartner Inc projects that by as much as of urban area cars will be available for shared use If that amount of cars are being shared it could delay or even reduce car sales This potential situation will shape future carmaker marketing Ford CEO Mark Fields said his company has to think like a mobility company as well as a car producer Consumer preferences for convenience are being shaped by services like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime with its quick and free deliveries and the laidback style of Uber Ford is setting itself apart from competitors by taking a progressive stance on car sharing That can help the bottom line later on Source Ford Is Staying Up With The Times With
