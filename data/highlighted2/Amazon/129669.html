(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Blogger Jim Dalrymple has complained about losing his music library as a result of Apple Music.Some are likening the “failure�?of Apple Music to the Apple Maps fiasco.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The negative PR <b>may</b> depress Apple shares in the month of August , but this should turn around due to new products in the December quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>Last week, long time Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) bloggers Jim Dalrymple and John Gruber went online to complain about Apple Music.Dalrymple complained that an entire library of over 4000 songs had been wiped out by Apple Music.Gruber chimed in, "iCloud Photos gets right everything that Apple Music gets wrong."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the problems with Apple Music <b>may</b> not be as serious as claimed , they add to the upswell of negative Apple sentiment following its June quarter earnings report .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Dalrymple 's account of his Music experience <b>appears</b> in loopinsight.com , and has already been reported and elaborated on as in this Business Insider article .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Dalrymple is no Apple-hater , yet his <b>frustration</b> with Music is palpable : I had high <b>hopes</b> for Apple Music .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I really wanted it to work and become my default music streaming service, but after the problems I've experienced over the last couple of weeks, I'm disabling it altogether. . . .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While Apple Music Radio and Playlists worked well , adding music to my library is nothing short of a mind-blowing exercise in <b>frustration</b> .  (Surprise) </span>The Business Insider article is typical of the kind of gloating condemnation we can expect in the tech media.BI quoted Anil Dash, described as a blogger and entrepreneur: If someone as expert as [Dalrymple] is this flummoxed, that puts Apple Music on par with Apple Maps as a failure of user experience In fact, Maps is not the failure that has been portrayed in numerous articles in the business media.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As made clear at this year 's WWDC , Maps is now used 3.5 times <i>more</i> frequently by iOS users than Google Maps .  (Surprise) </span>But the quote shows how this is going to be spun.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A couple of days ago Forbes published <b>Frustration</b> And Anger As Apple 's Reputation Tumbles , recounting the various problems Apple has had in the past year , such as WiFi issues in OS X on up to the post by Dalrymple .  (Surprise) </span>Dalrymple subsequently reported that he had gotten most of the "lost" music back, but it took a visit to Apple headquarters to do that, and he's still missing a few hundred songs.Gruber quotes iOS developer Marco Arment's view of Apple Music: iTunes is designed by the Junk Drawer Method . . . I have plenty of plausible theories on why iTunes didn't get the iCloud Photos treatment - why Apple Music was bolted onto this ancient, crufty, legacy app instead of discontinuing iTunes, dropping its obsolete functions, and starting fresh with a new app and a CloudKit-based service.(Engineering resources, time to market, iPods, Windows, and people with slow internet connections.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A quick perusal of Apple 's support pages <b>seems</b> to confirm the diagnosis of Arment and Gruber .  (Uncertainty) </span>iOS device users got a unique standalone Apple Music app, while Mac and Windows users got Apple Music integrated into a new version of iTunes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are problems across the board with Music , but Mac and Windows users <b>seems</b> to be having the most problems .  (Uncertainty) </span>Clearly the decision to integrate with iTunes was marketing driven.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple <b>could</b> use its existing iTunes customer base to promulgate Apple Music <i>more</i> widely than just the iOS device world .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The clean sheet approach would have yielded a <i>better</i> app , but it would have been an app that many iTunes users would have ignored .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As undesirable as integration with iTunes <b>might</b> have been , that is n't where the real failure lies .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple's software deployments, such as its major OS upgrades, increasingly betray a lack of testing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Software testing is increasingly important as operating systems become embedded in <i>larger</i> service ecosystems .  (Surprise) </span>Developers don't like to do testing.We'd rather develop cool new features.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The kind of thorough ringing out that good testing performs seems <b>almost</b> destructively sacrilegious .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's why major software companies maintain separate organizations who's sole purpose is testing (otherwise known as software quality assurance).Testing is necessary because the developers are such lousy testers.Everything a developer produces has bugs.Always.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Software QA <b>seems</b> to be getting short shrift these days at Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> it 's a growth thing .  (Uncertainty) </span>But if Apple can't perform adequate testing, then they need to do what competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are doing.Microsoft has been holding a protracted beta for Windows 10, letting volunteer "Windows Insiders" do the testing for them.Apple has been doing something similar for the upcoming iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan releases.Beta testing works.Why didn't Apple release Music as a beta?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Apparently</b> whoever was in charge thought Music was good to go .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>hope</b> that was n't Iovine .  (Uncertainty) </span>It shouldn't have been his call.He's not a software guy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Increasingly , Apple <b>seems</b> to be in a hurry when there 's no discernible reason .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps it 's to counteract the <b>appearance</b> of a lack of agility that goes with being so big .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whatever the reason, Apple's premature release of products, whether Maps or Music is only premature, not failure.Software can always be fixed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> not be pretty under the hood .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> not be the clean sheet that Gruber would want .  (Uncertainty) </span>But iTunes + Music can be made to work, and I'm sure it will eventually.The real problem here is not the impact to Apple's customers.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Probably</b> all the problems and <b>frustrations</b> reported by bloggers and visible on the support forums is just a small fraction of the overall experience people are having .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The real problem is that the media run with this as confirmation of the "Apple Is In Decline" view.It's hard to quantify the impact of such missteps, but I'm sure there is one.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>How <i>better</i> to explain the market 's reaction to the recent earnings reports of Apple and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As Philip Elmer-DeWitt has pointed out , Apple grew <i>faster</i> and had much <i>more</i> profit than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in the June quarter , yet Apple tanked after its earnings release while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> soared . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple is viewed as much <i>more</i> vulnerable to its own judgment .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple 's success is viewed as <b>dependent</b> on its judgment about the products and services it provides .  (Uncertainty) </span>If Apple makes a mistake, if Apple doesn't design the next hit product, it's viewed as potentially catastrophic.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple is n't really as vulnerable as that , but there is a heavy dependence on iPhone , which makes people <b>nervous</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple's attempts at diversification have been a mixed bag.Apple Pay has been impressively free of stumbles.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple Watch <b>seems</b> very hurried in retrospect , with not enough product available from the beginning .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple Music also <b>seems</b> to have been very rushed .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple's image will suffer as a result of Music in the short term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> , this will keep the stock depressed through the month of August .  (Uncertainty) </span>Every time Apple stumbles, it's always the same story: how the mighty are fallen.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Long term Apple investors have learned to weather such storms , but those with a <i>shorter</i> investment horizon will <b>probably</b> bail out of Apple , further depressing the stock .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once again , I regard any such <b>fluctuations</b> as a buying opportunity .  (Uncertainty) </span>This Fall is shaping up to be a particularly good one for Apple.Apple Watch will be everywhere in the U.S. as Best Buy starts to offer it.The new iPhone 6S will be available.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There will <b>probably</b> be a new Apple TV as well as a new <i>larger</i> screen iPad Pro .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>iOS 9 and Mac OS X El Capitan will arrive , <b>probably</b> with resolutions for most problems with Apple Music .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The product pipeline for Apple going into the December quarter looks <i>fuller</i> than it has in years .  (Surprise) </span>Investors who weather the Apple Music PR storm will be well rewarded by the end of the year.Source: Is Apple Music The Next Maps?Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
