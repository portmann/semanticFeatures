(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That has the potential to help drive revenues and keep Facebook stock going <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>It's Marketing 101 - make it exclusive and hard to get, and everyone will want it.And for diehard fans, Facebook would become a favorite place to be for seeing their favorite artists, sports players and cult personalities.Some of the first who will be able to do live streaming are Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Martha Stewart, Serena Williams and Michael Bublï¿½.As much as Periscope and Meerkat opened up the new field, it will be some time before they can harness it to make money.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Showing videos of average people <b>might</b> spark some interest and curiosity , yet it wo n't be focused enough to drive viewing traffic in a coordinated effort on a large scale at this stage .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This new feature gives <i>more</i> marketing power to Facebook , which in turn <b>could</b> lead to capturing <i>larger</i> ad budget spends from advertisers and businesses .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Live streaming by celebrities <b>could</b> increase Facebook 's average revenue per user ( ARPU ) generation and user login time , two of the most important metrics that Facebook and its analysts use to judge the company 's performance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Viewers may stay logged into Facebook <i>longer</i> to get the latest updates in NewsFeed about their favorite celebrities , or even catch a video <b>suddenly</b> streaming from the celebrity .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>User login time is now on average 46 minutes per day, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the earnings call.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>greater</i> the time logged in , the <i>more</i> opportunities for users to see ads , engage with businesses , and shop online with new features coming out as we speak .  (Surprise) </span>Average view time means activity, so increasing that time increases Facebook's potential earnings capability.Since Facebook is forecast to grow earnings in the high double digits annually, live streaming connected with ad and event promotions can help make that growth rate a reality.Facebook is trying to convince Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) huge number of businesses and video creators on YouTube to switch over to Facebook.Those advertisers will want to split their ad budget among the best advertising platforms.Facebook wants to make sure it gets the majority of that split.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My take on this is if major brand businesses like cosmetics and haircare producers , which heavily use YouTube to showcase their products in short commercials or extended videos , were to link up with celebrities who live streamed on Facebook , they would want to advertise on Facebook to harness that star power for their brands .  (Uncertainty) </span>According to eMarketer , Facebook grew its net US digital display ad revenues 61% in 2014, taking the market leader position with 24% of the nationwide total.The market research firm also projects the company will continue to increase its market share over the coming years and widen the gap between it and Google , Twitter and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Live streaming will be one <i>more</i> weapon in its arsenal to do that .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The recent flurry of new features and services from Facebook , in particular those connected with video , have made me much <i>more</i> bullish on the company 's prospects .  (Surprise) </span>Investors can better understand how Facebook can create its high growth.Twitter also is planning to use its Periscope app for multimedia events as a marketing tool.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , Twitter is having difficulty revamping its product offering to make it <i>more</i> appealing to the mass market , while at the same time hunting for a suitably strong , new CEO to drive the messaging platform company .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>These distractions will allow Facebook to leapfrog ahead of Twitter and secure <i>more</i> ad revenue that <b>might</b> potentially go to its rival .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Facebook is carving out its new territory and extending its social media empire.For me, that's a good growth catalyst for the stock.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
