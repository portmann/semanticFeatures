(Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) management is looking to buy Ocado ( OTC : OCDDY ) . The British online grocer would expand upon <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Pantry service for their <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime subscribers . This is a great opportunity for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , in part because the threat of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> competition served to beat down Ocado shares over the past few years . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants to enter the UK online grocery market , but they have to make the decision of whether to make or buy their business . Buying Ocado speeds up their entry.Meanwhile , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has also registered with the Federal Maritime Commission to do business as an ocean freight forwarder in the US . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This will make it <i>easier</i> for Fulfillment by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> customers to move products into <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's existing logistics system . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The biggest impact will be on Chinese suppliers for the American consumer markets.In cutting out the middle man , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Jeff Bezos wants to reduce costs and protect critical supply chain information . He is acting at an advantageous time - he can move in on the ocean freight business for a low price.Part of the plan to recoup his investment is to take out costs with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's software and automation . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can offer improved efficiencies related to pricing , booking , status tracking , and customs filings . This is bad news for other maritime freight competitors as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will have massive scale and a willingness to price at its marginal cost . It is never easy to compete against someone who is willing and able to forgo a profit for decades.Once <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ships arrive in the US , they will have a number of new planes to speed up service within the US market . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is buying twenty 767 freighters to begin supplanting United Parcel Service ( NYSE : UPS ) and FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) . As with their new oceanic efforts, they will squeeze margins in the air.Who can hold their breath the longest?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> Jeff Bezos .
