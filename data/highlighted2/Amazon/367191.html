The streaming leader isn't backing down from its "day-and-date" approach, which means the theaters get no exclusivity period and films stream online at the same time.This goes against the "windowing" agreement that has keep theaters in the driver's seat all these years.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Netflix 's approach , which for the lack of a <i>better</i> word has been forceful and unyielding , has really <b>scared</b> the industry .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's created this domino effect that has led to the studios and theaters becoming even <i>more</i> intertwined .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The exhibitors are <b>worried</b> about their livelihoods , and it is understandable , but it should n't prevent them from at least entertaining the idea of embracing technology beyond what 's in the theaters .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Screening Room is the closest we are getting to that conversation started, and while its creators are attending the Con, they enter with a target on their backs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Here 's where that bond I mentioned <i>earlier</i> is vital .  (Surprise) </span>While the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) has said it will leave it to its individual members, it will not as a group advocate for the service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yet , cracks are beginning to form in this tight alliance , which is another reason why events like CinemaCon and all of its `` A-list '' guest <b>appearances</b> and tentpole screenings are important .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> defections , the <i>more</i> the traditional model is impacted .  (Surprise) </span>Right now, the theaters are very loyal to the traditional Hollywood studios and have chosen to stay with them over the streamers.Yet, AMC Theaters (NYSE: AMC ) for example is close to teaming with The Screening Room and that's going to cause a rift.Of course, this works in reverse.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>You <b>may</b> remember last year Paramount ( owned by Viacom ( NASDAQ : VIA ) ( NASDAQ : VIAB ) ) made news when it said it would give a <i>shorter</i> window to theaters for two of its October films in order to give the films a <i>earlier</i> SVOD launch ( where it 's found them to be <i>more</i> profitable ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The move created a similar rift and even with Paramount offering theaters a cut of the SVOD profits most of the <i>larger</i> chains still boycotted the movies .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Again , it is that fear of the <b>unknown</b> and the Paramount situation was one where some of the theaters even had a safety net and still would n't take the chance .  (Uncertainty) </span>Shareholders are going to have decide soon which side they want to support, because right now each side is beginning to show signs of a break.Do investors show allegiance to the studios that make the content, the theaters that show it or neither and opt for a Netflix-like company which preaches a new path?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While that was never a real debate before it 's becoming a <i>larger</i> one with every day .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the end , it 's going to come down to where investors <b>believe</b> consumers will spend their money .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While personally I <b>could</b> get over the $ 50 price point of Screening Room , it 's the $ 150 set top box that I <b>could</b> n't justify ( and I 'm willing to bet I 'm not alone ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A year of Netflix ( even with the $ 2 monthly increase ) is still $ 30 <i>less</i> and that 's without the add-ons .  (Surprise) </span>Customers recognize that appeal and it's a proven model.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Conversely , the theaters are finding new ways to win back crowds as they 've added in reserve seating , reclining options and just overall <i>plusher</i> theaters .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The chains are trying to wage a <i>bigger</i> battle , but is it too little , too late ?  (Surprise) </span>At the center of this is Netflix, which has shown there are other models that work.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And to be clear , while Netflix <b>may</b> have pushed its agenda rather forcefully , it also has had to scratch and claw its way into a power position , and now that it 's there , it has earned the right to play the game however it wants .  (Uncertainty) </span>While the bulk of this year's CinemaCon will be spent on the immediate future, the real conversation should be about further down the road.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With Silicon Valley 's many think-tanks and innovations , there has to be a solution in which both sides can profit ... if only the sides would be <i>more</i> open to listen .
