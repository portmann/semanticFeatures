affected Facebook says it complies with European law Watchdog works with German French Dutch Spanish counterparts BRUSSELS May Reuters Belgiums privacy watchdog accused Facebook on Friday of trampling on European privacy laws by tracking people online without their consent and dodging questions from national regulators The Privacy Protection Commission CPVPCBPL which is working with German Dutch French and Spanish counterparts launched the blistering attack after trying to find out more about the US social media giants practices It urged Internet users to install privacy software to shield themselves from Facebooks tracking systems whether they have an account with the social network or not The show of strength from the Belgian regulator which does not have the power to levy fines highlights a growing willingness across the member bloc to demand that big US tech companies abide by European laws Facebook tramples on European and Belgian privacy laws the Commission said after publishing a report analysing changes that the company made to its privacy policies in January It said in a statement that Facebook had refused to recognise Belgian and other EU national jurisdictions insisting it was subject only to the law in Ireland the site of its European headquarters Facebook has shown itself particularly miserly in giving precise answers the watchdog said adding that the results of the study by a group of researchers were disconcerting A Facebook spokeswoman questioned the Belgians authority but said it would review the studys recommendations with the Irish data protection commissioner We work hard to make sure people have control over what they share and with whom Facebook is already regulated in Europe and complies with European data protection law so the applicability of the CBPLs efforts is unclear she said Some EU states accuse Ireland of being soft on the multinational firms it wants to attract whether in data protection or corporate taxation The commission said it would publish a second report on Facebook this year Sanctions available to privacy watchdogs can be negligible to big firms but a new EU data protection law expected to be ready this year would allow for fines up to percent of annual sales The commission said Facebook would not explain in detail how it uses data it collects It highlighted problems with plugins such as Facebooks Like button which it said affected many who do not have a Facebook account A number of firms are under fire in Europe over the data they collect Facebook places tracking cookies when anyone visits a Facebook page meaning it can track the online activities of a huge number of noncustomers but has said this is a bug that it is working to fix The Commission asked Facebook to stop gathering user data via cookies and plugins except where users asked for it European regulators have previously forced Google to change its privacy policies And a year ago EU judges upheld a Spanish order that Google must remove links to outdated information from searches for peoples names establishing a right to be forgotten EU antitrust regulators launched a case against Google last month and are probing
