class='textDiv'>Netflix Will Likely Fail In China Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Few American companies succeed in China especially when there are Chinese companies with large amounts of resources also competing in that market In the case of Netflix all three of the biggest private Chinese companies are involved in video streaming with Alibaba recently entering the fray Netflix is too expensive right now especially given this China risk but investors should wait until after the stock split to short it Its well known that the list of American companies that have managed to succeed in China is rather short This is doubly so for companies that sell products that depend upon judging Chinese demand a situation that Netflix NASDAQ NFLX finds itself in It has to select shows that it will buy the rights to and bring to its Chinese portal Even companies that sell undifferentiated goods have struggled to gain market share in China with companies as mighty as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN unable to build a sizable presence Netflix dipped a little bit on the news that Alibaba NYSE BABA would be launching the Netflix of China Alibaba is already a very familiar brand in China and knows what Chinese consumers think I think in particular theyll have a big advantage when it comes to designing the UI for their video streaming service Chinese consumers have radically different design tastes than consumers in the West as can be seen in Weibos NASDAQ WB a major micro blogging platform in China extremely cluttered design Tencents OTCPKTCEHY messaging apps are also packed with features This would never fly in America or any other Western country really Silicon Valley companies generally produce products that do one thing really well and thats all Good design in America is completely different than good design in China Alibaba has already crushed American competitors before and this time its the one with vast resources at its disposal The conglomerate model is also fairly popular in China which is another contrast to America The most successful financially speaking American companies are famous for their incredible focus such as Apple NASDAQ AAPL However the most successful companies in China make money from a multitude of vastly different products This can be seen from how both Tencent and Alibaba engage in multiple different lines of business and the former manages to dominate social media messaging web portals and gaming in China Alibaba dominates ecommerce cloud services and payment through their stake in AliPay Additionally the Chinese government is likely to favor local companies Netflixs experience with video streaming is also not guaranteed to result in success in China The best example of this can again be seen from how Alibaba beat eBay despite eBay coming first Additionally Uber the pioneer in ride sharing services only has around a market share in China while DidiKuaidi owns the remaining Its also interesting that headlines are declaring that Alibabas service will be the Netflix of China when such a video streaming service already exists in the form of Iqiyi from Baidu NASDAQ BIDU Additionally Tencent has its own video streaming service as well though it isnt as popular as Iqiyi I doubt that Netflix would be able to beat Alibaba even if they launched their services at the same time but theres an even slimmer chance of them beating an already entrenched service They have to get the design content and pricing right which will take a lot of time and focus Given that China is just one country in Netflixs overall international push I feel that the latter is severely lacking Theres still a possibility for Alibaba to make inroads given that video streaming in China is still young and more importantly because they are very well known in China and know China well China isnt really a market that Netflix can afford to lose given that it contains around of the worlds population This is especially true since Netflix currently seem to be priced for perfection having risen nearly year to date as can be seen below Part of this was due to solid subscriber growth for the last quarter and another part is due to excitement from an upcoming stock split Investors are excited about the potential in international subscriber growth and failure in China wont be an easy pill to swallow Moreover the valuation right now is very rich It trades at a PE and has negative growth rates EPS wise Even its revenue growth rate is only around Theyre also piling on more and more debt increasing by billion dollars in the past quarter Most of this is going to fund their international growthoriginal content which makes the debt somewhat risky If their international growth or new programs dont go as well as expected Netflix may be left struggling to fulfill its obligations This risk is not really reflected in its share price especially since China will be an extraordinarily tough market to succeed in However due to the stock split I recommend waiting before shorting the stockbuying puts People buy stock in companies that they know and Netflix is well known among younger generations such as Millennials Younger people generally tend to have less money making a high share price a greater deterrent to ownership than older people with more capital This is why its likely that the stock split will result in a rise in the share price at least in the short term The longterm future for Netflix looks murky which is not reflected in the current share price let alone an even higher share price Source Netflix Will Likely Fail In China Disclosure The author is long AAPL MoreThe author wrote this article themselves and it expresses their own opinions The
