opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Amazons promising business model is based on being an ecommerce enabler rather than a retailer Amazons real value is embodied in its unique experience knowledge systems and credibility gained in ecommerce which will be monetized by rendering service like FBA and AWS Amazons own retail activities may even become irrelevant as a direct earnings contributor as profit margins on AWS and FBA will dwarf those ever achievable in retail sector <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN published a remarkable set of excellent results in Q and the whole of They demonstrate that enabling others to conduct their ecommerce results in much higher profit margins than when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would only strive for growing is own online retail business Compare <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to the guys that sold tools and victuals to the fortune seekers going to Klondike during the gold rush These were the firms that made the real money This concept of what is the essence of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is still little recognized I may be wrong nothing is certain in the field of investing New ideas develop from unintended results But I do believe that when Jeff Bezos started his venture in his mission was to be a new revolutionary factor in bringing goods to consumers via the internet Sometime in the execution phase of this idea the insight must have gradually taken shape that more had to be gained by making others retail or dig for gold and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would be better off to sell to these guys all the unique tools and things Bezos had acquired and learned in the pioneering years This initially vague notion has gradually become ever more clear with each step set on the road to serve other retailers It turned into the crystal clear vision to see these other retailers not as competitors but as customers The amazing set of quarterly earnings figures that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>released on January seemed to confirm this thesis Services grew three times as fast in Q than the sale of goods from Amazons own stock resulting in a overall growth in revenue of billion Operating earnings were up to billion taking the operating margin to A memorable fact as it was the first time for the operating margin to exceed again the level since Q Before in the early years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had earned regularly between and and even in That was the period in which Bezos must still have set his eyes firmly on becoming a big online retailer As soon as he saw the light and realized that the real value of the company was embodied in the experience knowledge and systems gained during the pioneering years and decided to exploit all this by making it available to any would be eretailer in the world things definitively changed This idea must have been born short after when Bezos realized that an operating margin of slightly more than was probably the maximum he could hope for While fulfillment for others later termed FBA Fulfillment by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>began to take off earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS was launched in That year Amazons sales had exceeded the billion mark It would take another years before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would break out services revenue In sales had tripled to billion while services were reported to have been billion Ever since while sales of goods rose in the next five years services grew on average by an annual This rapid expansion of services had to be supported by completely new software solutions developed inhouse fulfillment centers and data centers cloud computing services all marketed to millions of potential customers What in fact was going on within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must have been a complete reinvention This naturally exerted heavy pressure on the operating margin that eroded to around At the bottom line <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could just manage to break even In the three years from through all efforts resulted in a combined loss of million a loss of in positive earnings of in and a loss again of in changed all that Under difficult market conditions and extreme currency headwinds demand for services accelerated and with reached the highest growth seen in the last three years Total operational profitability exploded to billion The first significant level of profit in years While the operational income margin in Q was for the whole year it amounts to a still modest but I expect it to quickly and significantly improve in coming years I suspect that sales of goods that move over Amazons own ledger contributed hardly if at all to the encouraging earnings obtained in There is much in Amazons financial reporting that can and must be improved but as least we know the level of profitability realized last year on the AWS cloud computing services for the final quarter and for the whole of the year But AWS accounted with a turnover of billion for just of Amazons net service revenues which totaled billion The largest part of it stems from annual payments for Prime subscriptions and payments for a range of fulfillment services From the current state of Amazons reporting it can only be guessed how much the operational margin on these activities must have been but I think there is all the reason to expect that the margin is high and much higher than most investors probably assume so far My best guess for the moment as stockbased compensation must be allocated to the different activities is that fulfillment activities are currently achieving an operational margin of around much higher than will ever be achievable with retailing sec One can only imagine how profitability will develop in coming years when the two components that make up Amazons total revenue merchandise and services keep following their distinctive growth paths Merchandise will become even more irrelevant as a contributor to earnings but still highly relevant as the base for extending services Within five years services may take over merchandise as Amazons main activity in sales and the overall profitability may become a multiple of the operational margin as seen over the whole of may go into the companys annals as the year in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>really took off in becoming a highly profitable company Early earnings were visible but not in the conventional way showing up as EPS but in terms of the number of customers prime subscriptions orders fulfilled etc However before they finally showed up as EPS results had already become more and more visible at the cash flow level In the final quarter of all three different free cash flow concepts which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>uses for a more detailed discussion of them see my previous article Amazons Financial Reporting A Bit Opaque But Not Misleading showed huge improvements From the common definition of the free cash flow which is net cash from operations minus capex until the most inclusive definition that also subtracts spending on equipment purchases under financial and capital lease all three measures have become widely positive From billion yy for the conventional FCF to billion yy for the most demanding of the two alternative FCF measures There is a lot more to say about Amazons latest set of earnings figures and why I think they give rise to a final take off to a definitively higher level of profitability For that I need more than the about words which seems to be the optimal size for an article on SA I hope to elaborate in more detail on the various aspects that I have mentioned later on For now I just give my estimates for the next couple of years in the table below As can be seen Amazons earnings multiples remain still optically high but it should be born in mind that these are figures strictly on GAAP basis So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does not care to publish its earnings on a nonGAAP basis as most other internet firms do If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would calculate these nonGAAP earnings and PEs would be calculated on basis of these multiples for and would already be about half of those now shown Tagged Investing Ideas Technology
