(NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha There's blood in the aisles at Wal-Mart.Shares have cratered 35% since the beginning of the year, making the retailer a textbook example of a deep value play.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A trifecta of catalysts have the potential to boost profits at Wal-Mart : <i>smaller</i> Neighborhood Market outlets , e-commerce initiatives and a rapidly approaching holiday season .  (Surprise) </span>Wal-Mart shares offer 30% upside and a 3% dividend yield.I have a confession to make.I've never been too keen on retail sector investments.In fact, I've mostly avoided them.Something about sourcing widgets for 4 cents and selling them for a nickel has never appealed to me as an investor.The title of my least favorite retailer in my least favorite sector has long belonged to Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ).The stores have always had a scorched Earth vibe to me.Like big-box capitalism run amok.A refuge for squatters and looters fleeing the zombie apocalypse just outside the doors.But I digress... Wal-Mart is changing my mind.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I recently visited one of the new smaller-format Neighborhood Markets near my home in Florida and found myself <b>almost</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>.(gulp) ..impressed.Someone turned on the color!The floors were clean!!And it didn't smell like a truck stop!!!Whether or not my reaction was a function of low expectations remains to be seen.I know this though: win, lose or draw, this is a company clearly determined to invest in its operations and identity.By all means necessary.The new concept is not going to do anything for margins at Wal-Mart.In order to pull it off, prices must remain just as low as they are at Supercenters.This long game here is market share, and my experience is a perfect example, since the shopping center I visited also has a Publix, a Target (NYSE: TGT ), and a Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA ).Publix is a hugely popular grocer in Florida, but the prices are outrageous; the Target is too big to dip into just to pick up dinner; and Walgreens doesn't have food.Guess which store just became my go-to bounce for food and toilet paper!<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Moody 's expects Neighborhood Markets to eventually outnumber Supercenters , and with <i>more</i> than five Supercenters currently in operation to every one Neighborhood Market locations , this upscaling of the down market is clearly in its infancy .  (Surprise) </span>While it 's impossible to under-estimate the retail threat from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , until I can beam a salad down from the cloud , the online juggernaut does n't pose a threat to the new concept . The Supercenters are a different story.They are , in fact , endangered by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and this is one of the main reasons Wal-Mart 's share price has been crushed this year . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'm actually <b>surprised</b> it did n't happen sooner as the writing 's been on the wall for years .  (Surprise) </span>But <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has its proverbial irons in a lot of fires and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fresh notwithstanding , the company has no designs on being your neighborhood market . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Nor should it with so many <i>higher</i> margin opportunities in the works .  (Surprise) </span>Still, that doesn't mean Wal-Mart is prepared to cede its legacy business to Bezos and company.If it looks familiar that 's because Wal-Mart has shamelessly embraced the best that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to offer to enhance its own web presence . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has all but perfected the web user experience and if it ai n't broke , why fix it ? <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The new interface is simple , clean and <b>optimized</b> across input mechanisms ( ie .  (Uncertainty) </span>PC, phone, tablet), and developers are working to increase the relevancy and frequency of personalized item recommendations throughout the site.The real key , however , to Wal-Mart differentiating itself from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is to embrace the omnichannel ( buzzword alert ! ) consumer by leveraging its 5200 Supercenters to offer instant gratification via in-store pickup.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>After all , right now is <i>faster</i> than 2-day shipping with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , as long as you do n't mind the drive . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Early results are encouraging as Wal-Mart claims a 300 % increase in store pickups during a July 15 sale in response to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Day , and it <b>may</b> have even come out the winner overall among Prime Day shoppers who appreciated the deals available . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Still, it's early innings and success is far from guaranteed.Wal-Mart has to find a way to bring its shipping charges down to Earth, while maintaining the super low prices its known for.They also have to keep the behind-the-scenes infrastructure humming and make it all feel effortless.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even something as simple as the loading speed of pages can cut into revenues and see consumers lose <b>confidence</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>The next real test for Wal-Mart is rapidly approaching - the 2015 holiday shopping season - and the retailer is already capitalizing on a potentially huge profit driver in the release of Disney's new "Star Wars" film.It's impossible to miss the excitement felt within and among generations as December 18 beckons.My 5-year-old nephew doesn't know Jabba the Hut from Boba Fett and still went out as Darth Vader for Halloween; his mother just got him a ridiculously cute R2D2 backpack; Games Radar calls the Stars Wars videogame Battlefront "a relentless, giddy, air-punch generator;" and as for the movie itself, let's just say the hype is about to hit lightspeed.Target and Wal-Mart both participated in September 4th's Force Friday retail event.Wal-Mart went all out, rolling out new Star Wars merchandise at 2900 of its 4000 U.S. stores, while Target only hosted events at 207 of its 1799 U.S. stores.Wal-Mart understands the resurgence of toys , which are increasingly the domain of mainline retailers not specialty shops.Videogame maker Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ) just upped its sales expectations for Battlefront from 10 million to 13 million units, and 3000 Wal-Mart locations are hosting an "Epic Weekend" November 13 - 15 during which time shoppers will be able to play the game before it's released.A dozen other Star Wars items will be available exclusively at Wal-Mart, as well as the Disney Infinity 3.0 Star Wars bundle for PlayStation 4.I don't mean to paint a rosy picture of the future for bricks-and-mortar retailers.The arrival of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is akin to the asteroid that struck down the dinosaurs 65 million years ago . The herd is destined to thin in coming years.The amount of retail floor space will be a fraction of its former self.There's simply too much of it in a world where so many needs are met online.But they're not all going away.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There 's room for <i>more</i> than one and the largest retailer in the world certainly has a shot at being one of the survivors .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>OK ... if you 're like the average Wal-Mart shopper , you 're <b>anxious</b> to get down to the bottom line .  (Uncertainty) </span>What's it going to cost me?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The retail landscape is changing rapidly and there 's no way I <b>could</b> recommend Wal-Mart if the price was n't right .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's important to note, Wal-Mart does not have to execute perfectly on anything I've discussed and it would still be a fantastic deep value play.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the end of 2014 , investors were paying <b>nearly</b> 19 times trailing earnings for Wal-Mart 's shares .  (Uncertainty) </span>This compares with a 5-year average P/E multiple of 14.3 and a current P/E of 12.3, which is a 10-year low.So the shares were clearly way ahead of themselves based purely on historical measures.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While it 's true that forward earnings estimates have come down , I <b>could</b> make the same under-valuation arguments using forward multiples .  (Uncertainty) </span>For comparison, the average P/E covering the universe of discount stores is currently 18.7, according to Morningstar .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> wide-moat Wal-Mart was right where it needed to be going into 2015 ?!  (Uncertainty) </span>It certainly makes the year's plunge from $90 to under $60 look like a wild over-reaction.Surely Wal-Mart deserves Target's 15.7 multiple at a bare minimum.Using Wal-Mart's trailing 12-month EPS of $4.78, Wal-Mart is worth $75.That means the shares offer 30% upside from current levels plus a 3% dividend.Talk about a deep discount!This target doesn't even take into consideration the added tailwind of a reloaded stock buyback program worth $20 billion.While the quote is often attributed to Warren Buffett, it was actually Baron Rothschild that famously said it was "time to buy when there's blood in the streets."Well there's blood in the aisles at Wal-Mart.It's time to buy.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
