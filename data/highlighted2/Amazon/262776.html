class='textDiv'>WalMarts Crisis Creates Opportunity For Contrarians WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha Theres blood in the aisles at WalMart Shares have cratered since the beginning of the year making the retailer a textbook example of a deep value play A trifecta of catalysts have the potential to boost profits at WalMart smaller Neighborhood Market outlets ecommerce initiatives and a rapidly approaching holiday season WalMart shares offer upside and a dividend yield I have a confession to make Ive never been too keen on retail sector investments In fact Ive mostly avoided them Something about sourcing widgets for cents and selling them for a nickel has never appealed to me as an investor The title of my least favorite retailer in my least favorite sector has long belonged to WalMart NYSE WMT The stores have always had a scorched Earth vibe to me Like bigbox capitalism run amok A refuge for squatters and looters fleeing the zombie apocalypse just outside the doors But I digress WalMart is changing my mind I recently visited one of the new smallerformat Neighborhood Markets near my home in Florida and found myself almost gulp impressed Someone turned on the color The floors were clean And it didnt smell like a truck stop Whether or not my reaction was a function of low expectations remains to be seen I know this though win lose or draw this is a company clearly determined to invest in its operations and identity By all means necessary The new concept is not going to do anything for margins at WalMart In order to pull it off prices must remain just as low as they are at Supercenters This long game here is market share and my experience is a perfect example since the shopping center I visited also has a Publix a Target NYSE TGT and a Walgreens NASDAQ WBA Publix is a hugely popular grocer in Florida but the prices are outrageous the Target is too big to dip into just to pick up dinner and Walgreens doesnt have food Guess which store just became my goto bounce for food and toilet paper Moodys expects Neighborhood Markets to eventually outnumber Supercenters and with more than five Supercenters currently in operation to every one Neighborhood Market locations this upscaling of the down market is clearly in its infancy While its impossible to underestimate the retail threat from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN until I can beam a salad down from the cloud the online juggernaut doesnt pose a threat to the new concept The Supercenters are a different story They are in fact endangered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and this is one of the main reasons WalMarts share price has been crushed this year Im actually surprised it didnt happen sooner as the writings been on the wall for years But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has its proverbial irons in a lot of fires and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fresh notwithstanding the company has no designs on being your neighborhood market Nor should it with so many higher margin opportunities in the works Still that doesnt mean WalMart is prepared to cede its legacy business to Bezos and company If it looks familiar thats because WalMart has shamelessly embraced the best that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has to offer to enhance its own web presence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has all but perfected the web user experience and if it aint broke why fix it The new interface is simple clean and optimized across input mechanisms ie PC phone tablet and developers are working to increase the relevancy and frequency of personalized item recommendations throughout the site The real key however to WalMart differentiating itself from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is to embrace the omnichannel buzzword alert consumer by leveraging its Supercenters to offer instant gratification via instore pickup After all right now is faster than day shipping with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime as long as you dont mind the drive Early results are encouraging as WalMart claims a increase in store pickups during a July sale in response to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Day and it may have even come out the winner overall among Prime Day shoppers who appreciated the deals available Still its early innings and success is far from guaranteed WalMart has to find a way to bring its shipping charges down to Earth while maintaining the super low prices its known for They also have to keep the behindthescenes infrastructure humming and make it all feel effortless Even something as simple as the loading speed of pages can cut into revenues and see consumers lose confidence The next real test for WalMart is rapidly approaching the holiday shopping season and the retailer is already capitalizing on a potentially huge profit driver in the release of Disneys new Star Wars film Its impossible to miss the excitement felt within and among generations as December beckons My yearold nephew doesnt know Jabba the Hut from Boba Fett and still went out as Darth Vader for Halloween his mother just got him a ridiculously cute RD backpack Games Radar calls the Stars Wars videogame Battlefront a relentless giddy airpunch generator and as for the movie itself lets just say the hype is about to hit lightspeed Target and WalMart both participated in September ths Force Friday retail event WalMart went all out rolling out new Star Wars merchandise at of its US stores while Target only hosted events at of its US stores WalMart understands the resurgence of toys which are increasingly the domain of mainline retailers not specialty shops Videogame maker Electronic Arts NASDAQ EA just upped its sales expectations for Battlefront from million to million units and WalMart locations are hosting an Epic Weekend November during which time shoppers will be able to play the game before its released A dozen other Star Wars items will be available exclusively at WalMart as well as the Disney Infinity Star Wars bundle for PlayStation I dont mean to paint a rosy picture of the future for bricksandmortar retailers The arrival of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is akin to the asteroid that struck down the dinosaurs million years ago The herd is destined to thin in coming years The amount of retail floor space will be a fraction of its former self Theres simply too much of it in a world where so many needs are met online But theyre not all going away Theres room for more than one and the largest retailer in the world certainly has a shot at being one of the survivors OK if youre like the average WalMart shopper youre anxious to get down to the bottom line Whats it going to cost me The retail landscape is changing rapidly and theres no way I could recommend WalMart if the price wasnt right Its important to note WalMart does not have to execute perfectly on anything Ive discussed and it would still be a fantastic deep value play At the end of investors were paying nearly times trailing earnings for WalMarts shares This compares with a year average PE multiple of and a current PE of which is a year low So the shares were clearly way ahead of themselves based purely on historical measures While its true that forward earnings estimates have come down I could make the same undervaluation arguments using forward multiples For comparison the average PE covering the universe of discount stores is currently according to Morningstar Perhaps widemoat WalMart was right where it needed to be going into It certainly makes the years plunge from to under look like a wild overreaction Surely WalMart deserves Targets multiple at a bare minimum Using WalMarts trailing month EPS of WalMart is worth That means the shares offer upside from current levels plus a dividend Talk about a deep discount This target doesnt even take into consideration the added tailwind of a reloaded stock buyback program worth billion While the quote is often attributed to Warren Buffett it was actually Baron Rothschild that famously said it was time to buy when theres blood in the streets Well theres blood in the aisles at WalMart Its time to buy We only use your contact details to
