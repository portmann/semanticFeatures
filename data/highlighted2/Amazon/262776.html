The herd is destined to thin in coming years.The amount of retail floor space will be a fraction of its former self.There's simply too much of it in a world where so many needs are met online.But they're not all going away.There's room for more than one and the largest retailer in the world certainly has a shot at being one of the survivors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>OK ... if you 're like the average Wal-Mart shopper , you 're <b>anxious</b> to get down to the bottom line .  (Uncertainty) </span>What's it going to cost me?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The retail landscape is changing rapidly and there 's no way I <b>could</b> recommend Wal-Mart if the price was n't right .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's important to note, Wal-Mart does not have to execute perfectly on anything I've discussed and it would still be a fantastic deep value play.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the end of 2014 , investors were paying <b>nearly</b> 19 times trailing earnings for Wal-Mart 's shares .  (Uncertainty) </span>This compares with a 5-year average P/E multiple of 14.3 and a current P/E of 12.3, which is a 10-year low.So the shares were clearly way ahead of themselves based purely on historical measures.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While it 's true that forward earnings estimates have come down , I <b>could</b> make the same under-valuation arguments using forward multiples .  (Uncertainty) </span>For comparison, the average P/E covering the universe of discount stores is currently 18.7, according to Morningstar .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> wide-moat Wal-Mart was right where it needed to be going into 2015 ?!  (Uncertainty) </span>It certainly makes the year's plunge from $90 to under $60 look like a wild over-reaction.Surely Wal-Mart deserves Target's 15.7 multiple at a bare minimum.Using Wal-Mart's trailing 12-month EPS of $4.78, Wal-Mart is worth $75.That means the shares offer 30% upside from current levels plus a 3% dividend.Talk about a deep discount!This target doesn't even take into consideration the added tailwind of a reloaded stock buyback program worth $20 billion.While the quote is often attributed to Warren Buffett, it was actually Baron Rothschild that famously said it was "time to buy when there's blood in the streets."Well there's blood in the aisles at Wal-Mart.It's time to buy.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
