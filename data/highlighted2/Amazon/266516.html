Revenues would taper off there, but all of these expenses would both remain and require costs to maintain.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If they are constantly working to lower the price of the goods they are selling , then each future customer , by definition , becomes <i>less</i> profitable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The technology they employ , instead of becoming <i>less</i> costly , just becomes obsolete over time and has to be replaced .  (Surprise) </span>Employee wages tend to rise over time as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When a management builds this kind of reputation for being brilliant , but the economics of the business are n't in their favor , well , I think you <b>may</b> have heard this before .  (Uncertainty) </span>Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) is like that too.Their CEO, Elon Musk has a reputation now as a visionary, and he has gone and said things about the competition now that force them to deliver on certain promises.Those promises cost money to deliver .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> may be a thorn in the side of Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) lately , but perhaps if Wal-Mart were able to do something for their business other than upgrade the technology ; say , for example , improve their public image by improving the appearance of their stores , and raising the wages of their employees , they <b>might</b> just be able to gain their edge back here .

(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>might</b> think you 're ahead of the game by setting a stop-loss order in preparing for that day , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has an average trading volume of over 4 million shares a day . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Imagine what would happen if 4 million "sell" orders hit brokers simultaneously.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Retail has been a pretty tough segment to be in this year , but when you can buy ownership in other companies that are earning 5 times the amount of profits , for 1/10th the price of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , then <i>sooner</i> or <i>later</i> , the other shareholders are going to notice that .
