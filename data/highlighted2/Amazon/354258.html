( NYSE : FIT ) | Seeking Alpha Too much <b>confusion</b> and misinformation persists regarding the Apple Watch vs. Fitbit Blaze competition and the overall wearables category .  (Uncertainty) </span>Clarity will show Fitbit to be an oversold opportunity.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>House cleaning : Providing documentation of early results showing Blaze was indeed sold out of stock <b>may</b> be helpful .  (Uncertainty) </span>The market sold Fitbit based upon the view that Apple Watch would crush Fitbit Blaze.The market was wrong.Now the rebound is taking place.Fitbit experienced an unjustified sell-off from $31 to $12 during January - February of this year.The move back upwards to correct this oversold condition has just begun.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shares of Fitbit are up <b>almost</b> 20 % from their February bottom to $ 14.51 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Citibank's price target of $35 is reasonable but there is a sense of urgency to get involved.Please use this hypertext link to check this "7 Steps" ad (the play button on the still image above is not interactive).This ad is shared by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Alexa and Fitbit 's ( NYSE : FIT ) Blaze . The ad features former NBA stars Steve Smith and Grant Hill and is being run during prime-time spots on this year's NCAA tourney.While the ad is both effective and amusing , it communicates that two premier consumer brands worldwide , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Fitbit , have strengthened their relationship . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The future of wearables is upon us and this increasingly important category 's leader , Fitbit , <b>may</b> one day receive the premium valuation that is definitely deserved .  (Uncertainty) </span>We have recently presented several articles discussing some of the key aspects impacting the wearables category and a few of its key players such as Fitbit, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and the most recent entry into wearables from Under Armour (NYSE: UA ).Numerous negative consumer reviews have been posted on UA's own website for their Health Box and UA Band products.This negative consumer feedback supports our recent article Under Armour Health Box And UA Band Unable To Compete With Fitbit .With the early feedback on the UA wearables product launch looking weak, this article will focus on the developing news that Fitbit's Blaze is indeed cleaning the clock of Apple Watch in the marketplace.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the assertion that Blaze is competing well against the Apple Watch is accurate , then it <b>could</b> lead to a sharp increase in the price of FIT shares .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On <b>almost</b> a daily basis we are getting feedback from early retail channel checks , consumers , as well as from Fitbit that the sales of the recently launched Blaze smart fitness watch product are very strong .  (Uncertainty) </span>The same strong sales indications for Fitbit's other new product launch, Alta, indicates another strong year of sales growth for Fitbit is in the making.This developing success of both new products, Blaze and Alta, is definitely not yet factored into the current price of the stock.Because Fitbit has dominated the fitness tracker sub-category of wearables and Apple Watch has dominated the smartwatch sub-category, the Blaze is the first Fitbit product to step onto Apple Watch's turf in direct competition.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For some background on this head to head turf war please reference our recent article entitled Apple Watch Vs. Fitbit Blaze : The Early Winner <b>May</b> <b>Surprise</b> You .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is still a great deal of <b>confusion</b> and misinformation on the overall wearables category as well as the undervalued shares of FIT .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This article will attempt to lend clarity to several key issues in an effort to dispel the <b>confusion</b> and misinformation surrounding the Apple vs. Fitbit competition and which is winning this battle for market share in the smartwatch sub-category of wearables .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Clarity of understanding will likely drive the price of FIT shares <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Slowly but surely , the market is beginning to understand Fitbit and wearables and this will cause shares of FIT to trade <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>My goal is to help SA readers understand this opportunity ahead of the Street.Let's be crystal clear from the outset: With triple-digit growth of 171% in the category for 2015, wearables are not a zero-sum game.A high-growth category, such as wearables, will support at least several winning companies for many years into the future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fitbit is currently the clear winner in the category with first-mover advantages , but we are <b>hopeful</b> that Apple will continue to contribute to the growth and innovation in this important industry going forward .  (Uncertainty) </span>Wearables can make a significant difference in the quality of people's lives via the mHealth and preventive healthcare applications that are becoming increasingly prevalent in the category.Apple's HealthKit app for iPhones is significant, but CEO Tim Cook failed to mention in the webcast from Cupertino that this app also is available for the Apple Watch OS.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For the benefit of Apple shareholders and the mHealth/wearables category , we would like to see Apple commit far <i>greater</i> resources and focus to the advancement of the Apple Watch .  (Surprise) </span>Fitbit is highly focused on its mission in wearables and has been building an R&D army that now comprises an entire two-thirds (624 people in R&D) of all employees.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you do n't <b>believe</b> that Fitbit is going to accelerate innovation to become an even <i>greater</i> powerhouse in wearables and mHealth , then consider both the quantity and quality of talent being attracted by Fitbit across the country and even in its eastern European location of Minsk , Belarus .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Those who <b>believe</b> that entrance into the wearables category can be achieved by sticking a glorified pedometer onto a rubber band are living in the Stone Age .  (Uncertainty) </span>The age of high-tech wearables is upon us now, albeit in a nascent stage, and there is an increasing barrier to entry that exists now.Below is an important graphic that displays the only competitive companies in wearables at this time, please disregard the media hyperbole regarding hordes of competitors in wearables.It is noteworthy that the category's leader, Fitbit, took back market share from competitors during the important 4Q15 holiday period: This article also will present the case that the recent sell-off in FIT shares from $31 down to $12 was unjustified and is now beginning to correct back upwards to the pre-January 5th CES announcement by Fitbit of its Blaze smart fitness watch.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shares of FIT have appreciated <b>nearly</b> 20 % from their February low .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since the market will eventually arrive at the truth regarding Fitbit and wearables , as it almost always does , presenting this opportunity to investors early while the stock is still oversold will <b>hopefully</b> prove highly profitable for readers .  (Uncertainty) </span>A statement we made in a previous SA article that "Fitbit Blaze has been literally selling out of big box retailers..." needs documentation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So let 's clear up any <b>doubts</b> by using two screen shots , one hyperlink and a report from BofA/Merrill Lynch .  (Uncertainty) </span>Please find below a screen shot of a recent Live Chat from Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) that documents some of the retail channel check efforts.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apologies that the under-sized screen shot below will not fit into the SA Article Wizard <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Please use whatever feature that your PC offers to enlarge this screen shot.The screen shot documents that the Fitbit Blaze was indeed "out of stock for about a month" according to customer service rep Annebel R: In fact, please note that the CSR confirms, at least, four separate times that the Blaze was out of stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Importantly , she also mentions that Blaze <b>may</b> go out of stock again due to high demand ( sell-through ) and that they are trying to catch up on back orders for Blaze .  (Uncertainty) </span>When asked about the Apple Watch supply she says "we have enough."Best Buy is representative of the experiences that we have had with every channel check completed for big box retailers.For those of us doing the due diligence, numerous indications that the Blaze was sold out were obvious across several retailers as it was being launched.When you find a clue like the following Facebook post then you simply do the work to follow up and channel check.This is how we knew that Blaze was selling out prior to the reports issued by a few major analysts.We began reporting this well-earned due diligence to the SA readership in prior articles, ahead of the confirmations of Blaze sales by major investment firm analysts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Please note that the Facebook post by a consumer Ms. Jazmin Mendoza accurately matches the information from the consumer rep Annebel R who also stated that the Blaze was out of stock for `` <b>almost</b> a month . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>We followed up on this investigative due diligence regarding the Blaze being sold out of stock, which was tipped off to us by several clues including huge pre-sales of Blaze.For those who listened to CFO Zerella's webcasts at different investment conferences, it was clear that Blaze and Alta pre-sales had "exceeded expectations."Afterwards, major analysts began to confirm what we had discovered.A simple keyword search performed during daily due diligence uncovered the following major analyst report by BofA/Merrill Lynch .All of these items lead up to our 100% accurate statement that, "Fitbit Blaze has literally been selling out of big box retailers."Here is another statement in our previous article , `` Fitbit Blaze is outselling the Apple Watch by at least a 5:1 ratio on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at the time of this writing . '' <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now it should be noted that the same due diligence link as follows also <b>appeared</b> in the previous article .  (Uncertainty) </span>So there was no excuse if anybody missed this retail check.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Here is that same link once again , in case anybody missed it the first time around : Check this <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> link to Best Selling Smart Watches and decide for yourself if our statement was accurate . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Of course , the actual rankings change from day to day but as I write this Fitbit 's Blaze holds the top four ranked positions and also the number six position for best selling smart watches on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . While reviewing the list please throw out the few watches priced under $100 that are included in the rankings since these manufacturers are insignificant for our discussion.Apple Watch holds the number eight position on this <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> list . So if Fitbit Blaze holds all of the positions for the top four ranked , best selling smart watches and also the number six position as well , and Apple Watch only holds the number eight position , then is n't it safe to say that `` Fitbit Blaze is outselling the Apple Watch by at least a 5:1 ratio on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ? '' <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The 5:1 ratio that I used is actually overly conservative since holding the number one ranked spot alone <b>might</b> give the Blaze <i>more</i> than a 5:1 ratio in sales over Apple 's number eight ranking .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But when the Blaze occupies all of the top four ranked best sellers and also the number six ranked spot as well in comparison to the Apple Watch 's number eight ranked spot , the ratio of Blaze sales to every Apple Watch sale on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is easily 5:1 at the time of this writing . It is understood that Apple sells its products through its own stores - both Apple and Fitbit also sell product via company websites.Still , the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> channel is an increasingly significant retail check and can not be ignored as it is a valid reflection of the general marketplace just as Best Buy is a significant channel check on the rate of retail sales at big box stores . We look forward to the upcoming several quarters of IDC sales reports to confirm the trend of early sales indications that Fitbit's Blaze is indeed competing well and taking market share from Apple's Watch.We are always glad to confirm the credibility of our statements and document the value of our accurate and proper due diligence.The two screen shots above , combined with the BofA/Merrill Lynch report , and the link to the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> best sellers page all confirm that the statements in our previous article were accurate . It is noteworthy that our channel checks uncovered Blaze being sold out of stock prior to this event being reported by major firm's research.Good for us.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And <i>more</i> importantly , good for our readers and the SA forum .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The important takeaway here is that the market sold off shares of FIT from $ 31 down to $ 12 based upon the errant <b>assumption</b> that Apple would crush Fitbit 's Blaze .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now the market is beginning to learn the opposite is occurring.Fitbit Blaze is not only competing well but is actually outselling the Apple Watch per several key retail checks on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Best Buy and other major retailers . Again, no data exists for the rate of Apple Watch sales from Apple stores or website.Fitbit's own website has been having great success selling the Blaze product.It is clear that the reason for the plunge in FIT shares down from $31 is unjustified and that the sell-off should now correct itself back upwards.Fitbit's Blaze is not being crushed, it is competing well, and Blaze is taking market share from the Apple Watch in the smartwatch sub-category.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This <b>surprise</b> to the market which has gotten this event totally wrong is reason enough to correct the unjustified sell-off back to $ 31 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Along with the improvement of the overall market , this developing news on Blaze sales is likely a part of the reason for the <b>almost</b> 20 % increase in the price of FIT shares since February .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As it becomes clear to the rest of the market that Fitbit Blaze is competing well and <b>possibly</b> even outselling Apple Watch , we are likely to see significant short covering .  (Uncertainty) </span>FIT has one of the highest short interests in the entire stock market.It is notable that the second of the two graphics below indicates short covering has begun during the latest time period reported: Past is not prologue.The idea that because a stock is down over a period of time there must be problems at the company is not always accurate.Facebook (NYSE: FB ) is one of many examples of the market getting the story wrong after the company's IPO.But once the market figured out the truth, the stock of FB rallied strongly.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the price of FIT shares have sold off since their peak on August 2015 , the fundamentals at the company are tremendous and getting <i>stronger</i> by the quarter .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fitbit is the industry leader of a high-growth wearables category with company sales up 92 % YOY for 4Q15 , zero debt , <b>almost</b> $ 700 million in cash , two successful new products recently launched , and Fitbit demonstrated that it took back market share from the No. 2 and No. 3 companies in the category during the important 4Q15 holiday period .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors on Wall Street <b>almost</b> always figure out the truth on a stock eventually .  (Uncertainty) </span>Fitbit will be no different.An industry-leading stock with the strength of fundamentals enjoyed by FIT should receive a premium valuation in the marketplace.Instead, FIT trades at a steep discount.FIT currently has a forward PE of only 10.Let's be candid, this is insane for a stock that just grew sales at 92% and has a brilliant future with many years of high growth ahead.To give you some reference points for how cheap this valuation is , the forward PE for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is about 400 and for Facebook is about 70 . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you feel that FIT is not in the same league with either of those stocks at this time in its development , then <b>perhaps</b> FIT should only have a forward PE of a <i>more</i> modest 30 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This type of valuation is very reasonable for the worldwide leader of a high-growth industry.It means that the price of FIT shares can triple from current levels to about $45 price per share and still be considered cheap by some measures.The PEG ratio is only 0.6 when a PEG of 1 is considered fair value.By all measures FIT is way oversold.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The upcoming <b>May</b> 2 , 2016 , earnings report for 1Q16 is likely to deliver both a `` beat and a raise '' for full-year 2016 guidance according to indications by CFO Zerella who said that they would have `` <i>better</i> vision after receiving the first quarter numbers . ''  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>stronger</i> than expected Blaze and Alta sales make this beat and raise scenario very likely .  (Surprise) </span>Let's complete this article by presenting a bull case for shares of FIT to correct the unjustified sell-off that took the stock down from $31 to $12 during January-February.Here are the five key factors that all combined to be prevalent on January 5, 2016, to create a perfect storm that led to the sell-off of FIT and the reasons why each of these five factors are now unjustified: The overall market was in a sharp corrective phase during January-February.Markets have rebounded and are at about breakeven now.Shares of Fitbit have not rebounded to $31 yet.A class-action lawsuit that Fitbit vigorously contends is meritless was announced on the same day as the Blaze product announcement on day one of CES, January 5th.Only about 30% of all class action lawsuits ever receive certification by a judge to proceed.One of the qualifications for certification is that 100 persons are included in the class.This lawsuit was filed with only three persons.The class action, in part, contends that Fitbit's patented PurePulse technology for monitoring heart rate is inaccurate.However, the independent and highly credible organization Consumer Reports has conducted tests on this heart rate monitor on two separate occasions.Consumer Reports has found that Fitbit's heart rate monitor technology is "very accurate."Please view this short video by Consumer Reports on their study and findings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is <b>possible</b> that this class-action lawsuit will never even see the inside of a courtroom .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And even if the lawsuit did make it into court , it is unlikely to succeed or have any material impact upon Fitbit or the price of its stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>It would seem that what Fitbit calls a meritless claim will now achieve diminishing returns for shorts going forward.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The class-action lawsuit <b>may</b> be a moot point now .  (Uncertainty) </span>Under Armour announced their new wearables product Health Box and UA Band during CES at about the same time as Fitbit announced Blaze.The media and self-proclaimed experts have the wrong idea that any company can enter the wearables category and if it is a major company, then they are certain to be successful and Fitbit is certain to suffer significant loss of market share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nothing <b>could</b> be further from the truth .  (Uncertainty) </span>If wearables were an easy category to enter, then why did Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) fail, Nike (NYSE: NKE ) quit, Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) first band failed and now their second band is struggling with small market share, Jawbone (PRIVATE: JAW ) is also struggling with small market share, and now the Under Armour wearables product has numerous negative consumer reviews on its own website just a few weeks after the product's launch?These negative reviews support our recent article published on the Under Armour wearables product on SA and is linked at the top of this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The fact is that wearables have become a category with a defensible moat that is steadily growing into a <i>higher</i> barrier for entry .  (Surprise) </span>When we look at four of the top five wearables vendors in the category, we see that each of them have invested substantial resources into building an in-house R&D effort that is very expensive and resource intensive.The IDC report below shows that there are only five competitors with over 4% market share in the entire wearables category.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Due to being over-priced , and late to market , with extremely <b>disappointing</b> technology that has numerous fatal flaws , Under Armour 's product is unlikely to gain significant market share in this competitive category .  (Surprise) </span>The weak Under Armour product will not threaten Fitbit's dominance in the category.The release of this UA product is basically a non-event for Fitbit and the marketplace will recognize this emerging fact.Another fundamental misconception has been that there are huge numbers of competitors in wearables all battling for crumbs of market share.This is not exactly accurate.Again, please refer to the IDC report above.There is your entire wearables category that consists of only five companies with any significant market share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The IDC determined that if a company <b>could</b> not scratch out 4 % market share than they were lumped together in the `` Others '' category .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As the overall category 's growth has now begun to slow ( wearables growth was 171 % for all of 2015 , but only 126 % for 4Q15 which indicates slowing growth , albeit still high growth ) , then the inevitable shake-out will begin where the <i>weaker</i> competitors are forced out of the market .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the number of companies trapped in the Others category with low market share will likely suffer , the Top Five leader board will likely benefit as these other <i>weaker</i> competitors fail .  (Surprise) </span>The market is just beginning to understand the fact that the wearables category is limited to only a few key players, with Fitbit being the undisputed, worldwide leader.And here is the big reason that the market chose to sell-off shares of FIT from $31 down to $12: Check the price action for FIT on January 5th when Blaze was announced as well as the class-action lawsuit, and you will see the stock was down about $4 that day.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This day one sell-off was followed by four <i>more</i> consecutive down days that started the selling all the way down to below $ 12 in February .  (Surprise) </span>The overwhelming sentiment was that the Apple Watch was going to crush Fitbit's new smart fitness watch, called Blaze.In fact, social media was flush with posts that even the name Blaze was indicative that the product would crash and burn, while many media and experts acted shocked and derisive that Fitbit would even contemplate such a disastrous move to compete directly with the Apple Watch.After all, wasn't the only thing saving Fitbit the fact that Apple's smartwatch was in a different sub-category of wearables than Fitbit's fitness trackers?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So how <b>could</b> Fitbit be so crazy to step onto the Apple Watch 's turf and engage in direct competition ?  (Uncertainty) </span>This was the overwhelming consensus in January-February that the Blaze was going to get crushed by the Apple Watch and devastate Fitbit's chances for any future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sounds dramatic but if you were paying close attention at the time , this was exactly the tone of the debate .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now here we are in March and the early news on the Fitbit Blaze vs. Apple Watch turf battle is heavily in favor of the Blaze being the early winner.Even if you are unwilling to acknowledge that Blaze is beating the Watch and taking market share from Apple, then you certainly must concede that Blaze is not getting crushed as the market expected.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And if you can concede only this much , as the market will also have to concede very soon , then this is enough for the unjustified sell-off to correct back <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Summary: By all metrics shares of FIT are very oversold.And the reasons for the recent sharp sell-off are all unjustified.The sky-high short interest in FIT has a terrible risk-reward ratio, an expensive borrow rate, and recently increased margin requirements.The short ended in February and the stock is up 20% since then with a tremendous amount of upside threatening shorts in the very near future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Looking forward , we conclude that the over-crowded short side of the trade must cover or <b>risk</b> severe losses in the near term .  (Uncertainty) </span>Clearly, the Blaze is competing exceptionally well against the Apple Watch and taking market share away from the Watch.This is significant.The upcoming IDC report will quantify what the early numbers look like for 1Q15, although Blaze only started shipping in March.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So the Fitbit <b>May</b> 2 , 2016 , earnings report and conference call will also be very interesting to see how strong both Blaze and Alta have been in the marketplace .  (Uncertainty) </span>Also, it is highly likely that we will see a 1Q16 beat and a raise of full-year 2016 guidance for this first quarter earnings report in a few weeks.CFO Zerella's comments during several recent investment conferences have indicated as much.In particular, Fitbit has received re-orders on the Blaze product that was not included in the conservative 1Q16 guidance.The Fitbit Blaze-Amazon Alexa relationship is going to gain momentum as this partnership is mutually beneficial for both companies . It is genius for Fitbit to have engaged themselves with one of the world's largest e-commerce companies.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Also , the <b>possibility</b> is high for upside <b>surprises</b> as Fitbit has stated that there would be further product releases and corporate developments in 2016 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Certainly, we are due for an update of the booming corporate-government wellness business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The near-term future for Fitbit is very bright and there are multiple catalysts close at hand that <b>could</b> trigger a significant and rapid increase in the price of FIT shares as this stock continues its recent upside move as it takes back the unjustified sell-off and trades back into the $ 30s .  (Uncertainty) </span>This price target represents a reasonable valuation for this high-growth, industry leader with excellent fundamentals and successful new products.We will continue to follow wearables closely with a focus on Fitbit, Apple, and other significant companies and events.Stay tuned and good luck.Disclosure: I am/we are long FIT, AAPL.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Author payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500.Become a contributor � Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Diversified Electronics, Event/Special Situations, Unjustified Sell-Off</div></body></html>
