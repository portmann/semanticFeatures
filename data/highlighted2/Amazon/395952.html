During the month of April, two new positions were added including Boeing and Sprouts Farmers Market.The Lean Long-Term Growth Portfolio, or LLGP, was created in early February 2016.The objective of this portfolio is for long-term capital appreciation and will include companies that pay dividends.Not all companies in the portfolio will pay dividends, however, as this is not the primary objective for wealth creation at this time.The portfolio will remain lean for the foreseeable future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What this means is that the number of holdings will most likely remain <b>somewhere</b> near the 10 , or so level .  (Uncertainty) </span>The limit placed as of this update is 15, so ideally this limit will be maintained.The WhiteWave Foods Company (NYSE: WWAV ) The focus of the portfolio will always dictate that a majority of the holdings will be in the freight sector.This is a primary area of research and focus.However, other companies including Netflix and WhiteWave have been long-term investments where research has diligently been performed since these companies were public entrants to the stock market.To maintain some level of diversification, other non-freight companies have been added.Current Holdings Performance - Initial Update As of March 8, 2016, the table below provides the initial date of purchase and stock price paid, including transaction fees, for each of the current seven holdings.Since these holdings were purchased in February and March, no dividends have been paid out yet.All dividend payouts will be included in the performance to illustrate total returns.All initial holdings from the March 31, 2016 update have been maintained.The only new position added included Boeing and Sprouts Farmers Market.Buy alerts were place on April 1st and 15th respectively for Boeing and Sprouts Farmers Market.Over 50 percent of the portfolio's composition is within consumer discretionary.This is includes <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , DHL Group , JB Hunt and Matson . Since the portfolio is focused on remaining lean, it should be expected that consumer discretionary will continue to represent a substantial proportion moving forward.However, this proportion declined ten percentage points due to the additions of Boeing and Sprouts Farmers Market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The portfolio is much <i>more</i> balanced when considering its capitalization composition .  (Surprise) </span>The large cap and mid cap categories have increased due to the additions of Boeing and Sprouts Farmers Market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As stated above , due to the leanness of the portfolio , changes could occur in the future which <b>may</b> offset this balance due to management strategies .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reflected the sole mega cap holding . Benchmark Comparison and Performance As noted, the portfolio was developed in February 2016; as such, the benchmark performance below is as of February 4, 2016 to provide a comparable review.Source: Yahoo Finance and Personal Database To date, the portfolio has returned 6.6 percent.The portfolio has underperformed the majority of its primary benchmarks.The benchmark comparison is not so much as a direct comparison in that the portfolio would ever boast of outperformance, but rather the benchmark is a general comparable to gauge whether the LLGP is fitting anywhere close to major indices performance.The LLGP expense ratio stood at 1.2 percent from all transactions for the year.It should be noted that all performance includes transaction costs, so the 6.6 performance is the pure return to date of the portfolio.The LLGP yield on cost stood at 0.1% through April 2016.The stance for managing the portfolio will be biased towards holding companies over long-term periods of time for capital appreciation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , due diligence will be performed to consider trimming positions or in worst case scenarios , exiting a position entirely if the business fundamentals change and merit such a move .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As the majority of the holdings only have initial positions , it should be <b>assumed</b> that near-term actions will include additions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The benefits from this approach is that the LLGP is taking the <b>risk</b> as an example for investors to follow and consider if any of the companies are suitable for their own investment goals and objectives ; as always separate due diligence should be performed .  (Uncertainty) </span>April performance witnessed a decline of 1.9 percentage points.The biggest laggard during the month of April was Netflix, which has declined strongly since earnings were reported.Both Netflix and Sprouts Farmers Market performance was negative to date.Based upon this, these two holdings will be closely monitored for potential buying opportunities.Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, BA, CNI, DPSGY, JBHT, MATX, NFLX, SFM, WWAV.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .
