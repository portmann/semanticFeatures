style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>WhiteWave and JB Hunt During the month of April two new positions were added including Boeing and Sprouts Farmers Market The Lean LongTerm Growth Portfolio or LLGP was created in early February The objective of this portfolio is for longterm capital appreciation and will include companies that pay dividends Not all companies in the portfolio will pay dividends however as this is not the primary objective for wealth creation at this time The portfolio will remain lean for the foreseeable future What this means is that the number of holdings will most likely remain somewhere near the or so level The limit placed as of this update is so ideally this limit will be maintained The WhiteWave Foods Company NYSE WWAV The focus of the portfolio will always dictate that a majority of the holdings will be in the freight sector This is a primary area of research and focus However other companies including Netflix and WhiteWave have been longterm investments where research has diligently been performed since these companies were public entrants to the stock market To maintain some level of diversification other nonfreight companies have been added Current Holdings Performance Initial Update As of March the table below provides the initial date of purchase and stock price paid including transaction fees for each of the current seven holdings Since these holdings were purchased in February and March no dividends have been paid out yet All dividend payouts will be included in the performance to illustrate total returns All initial holdings from the March update have been maintained The only new position added included Boeing and Sprouts Farmers Market Buy alerts were place on April st and th respectively for Boeing and Sprouts Farmers Market Over percent of the portfolios composition is within consumer discretionary This is includes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>DHL Group JB Hunt and Matson Since the portfolio is focused on remaining lean it should be expected that consumer discretionary will continue to represent a substantial proportion moving forward However this proportion declined ten percentage points due to the additions of Boeing and Sprouts Farmers Market The portfolio is much more balanced when considering its capitalization composition The large cap and mid cap categories have increased due to the additions of Boeing and Sprouts Farmers Market As stated above due to the leanness of the portfolio changes could occur in the future which may offset this balance due to management strategies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reflected the sole mega cap holding Benchmark Comparison and Performance As noted the portfolio was developed in February as such the benchmark performance below is as of February to provide a comparable review Source Yahoo Finance and Personal Database To date the portfolio has returned percent The portfolio has underperformed the majority of its primary benchmarks The benchmark comparison is not so much as a direct comparison in that the portfolio would ever boast of outperformance but rather the benchmark is a general comparable to gauge whether the LLGP is fitting anywhere close to major indices performance The LLGP expense ratio stood at percent from all transactions for the year It should be noted that all performance includes transaction costs so the performance is the pure return to date of the portfolio The LLGP yield on cost stood at through April The stance for managing the portfolio will be biased towards holding companies over longterm periods of time for capital appreciation However due diligence will be performed to consider trimming positions or in worst case scenarios exiting a position entirely if the business fundamentals change and merit such a move As the majority of the holdings only have initial positions it should be assumed that nearterm actions will include additions The benefits from this approach is that the LLGP is taking the risk as an example for investors to follow and consider if any of the companies are suitable for their own investment goals and objectives as always separate due diligence should be performed April performance witnessed a decline of percentage points The biggest laggard during the month of April was Netflix which has declined strongly since earnings were reported Both Netflix and Sprouts Farmers Market performance was negative to date Based upon this these two holdings will be closely monitored
