(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Stock's fall has pushed annual yield to key level.Investors expecting another increase in a few months.For shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), the past few weeks have not been pretty.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Fears</b> over an iPhone sales slowdown have pushed the stock towards its yearly low , if you exclude the August 2015 flash crash for a minute .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With shares <b>almost</b> back to $ 100 , investors looking at the stock are now presented with a dividend yield that 's back over 2.00 % on an annual basis .  (Uncertainty) </span>For some, there is a major psychological difference for the annual yield topping this level.A dividend yield that starts with a 1 does not seem like much, but when you get to the 2 level people start to notice.According to a finviz stock screener , there are 368 stocks in the S&P 500 with a dividend yield above 1%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If we go to a <i>greater</i> than 2 % yield , that number drops by over 100 names .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A little <i>more</i> than half of this key index has dividend yields topping 2.00 % .  (Surprise) </span>I cover Apple a lot on Seeking Alpha , and one of the biggest complaints about the stock I've gotten in recent years is the dividend yield.The company is in an interesting stage right now, because it is trying to grow and be a tremendous value name at the same time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Currently , Apple management is <i>more</i> focused on buying back shares then paying dividends , which I think is a <i>more</i> prudent strategy .  (Surprise) </span>There are those out there that criticize Apple for not having a dividend yield as high as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ).However, there are plenty of large cap tech names that don't offer investors any income opportunities, let alone a multi-billion dollar per quarter buyback.While a number of investors are screaming for Apple to significantly increase the dividend, the stock's fall has done that to an extent already.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At the stock 's 52-week high of $ 134.54 , shares were yielding <i>less</i> than 1.55 % on an annual basis .  (Surprise) </span>At Monday morning's low, that amount has risen by just about 50 basis points.As seen from the table in Apple's 10-K filing below, Apple has increased its dividend by a decent amount in recent years, paying out over $33 billion in the past three fiscal years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple 's dividend itself has risen even <i>more</i> , thanks to the company 's buyback plan .  (Surprise) </span>The company has reduced the outstanding share count by 15.15% over the past three fiscal years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As seen in the chart below , Apple 's share count is coming down around 4-5 % per year , which allows the dividend to increase without the company having to dole out <i>more</i> cash .  (Surprise) </span>Apple has increased its total payments though, as I detailed above.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Source : Apple financial information page Now I know that one of my 2016 <b>predictions</b> was that Apple 's potential dividend raise this year will likely <b>disappoint</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I'm not saying that Apple won't raise its dividend, but I just don't see the company giving into those calling for some major raise.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My official raise prediction will come in the next couple of months , but I still see a raise <b>probably</b> around 10 % or so , in-line with the recent pattern .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While a 2.00 % annual yield <b>might</b> not seem like much , investors have to think about Apple in the grand scheme of things .  (Uncertainty) </span>Savings accounts and CDs are getting you basically nothing right now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the table below , you can see how what US Treasuries currently yield , with Apple 's pre-tax income <b>roughly</b> equaling a 7-Year offering .  (Uncertainty) </span>With many expecting bond yields to jump in the coming years as the Federal Reserve raises rates, bond prices will come down.Would you rather own Apple or a US bond for the next 7 years?By the way, a 10% dividend raise would put Apple's current yield above what the 10-Year Treasury currently fetches.Shares of Apple declined Monday morning with the overall market , although they are n't down as much as some of the tech sector 's high growth names such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) or Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is <b>probably</b> because AAPL has come down a lot lately , pushing the annual dividend yield over 2.00 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>In fact, Apple is currently testing its 52-week daily low close, $103.12 unadjusted for dividends.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the stock hitting this psychologically important dividend level , the stock becomes a <i>more</i> exclusive part of certain indices .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since fixed income rates are low and bond prices will decline if we get further rate hikes , Apple <b>may</b> be worth a look for investors looking to generate income .  (Uncertainty) </span>For those complaining about Apple's dividend, the yield is up about 50 basis points from its yearly low.You're also getting a tremendous buyback and paying a below average market multiple for this cash generation monster.Additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.Investors should also consider seeking advice from a broker or financial adviser before making any investment decisions.Any material in this article should be considered general information, and not relied on as a formal investment recommendation.Tagged: Dividends & Income , Technology</div></body></html>
