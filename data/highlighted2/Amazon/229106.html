#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>with a Buy rating and a target price of per share The key assumptions underlying our target price include continuous top line growth and expansion in profitability We find Amazons AWS business its Prime Now service and its expansion into emerging markets to be the core drivers of growth for the company going forward Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN has gone up about in value over the past six months as strongerthanexpected results have lifted investor sentiment Although the stock is currently trading at high valuation with a forward Enterprise Value EVtoEBITDA multiple of x we see further upside potential in the companys stock price We initiate our coverage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>with a Buy rating and target price of per share suggesting upside to the current stock price The key assumptions underlying our target price include oneyear average forward EVEBITDA multiple of x growth in the companys Media segment in and onwards following weakness in continued doubledigit growth in revenues from the Electronics and Other General Merchandise EGM business despite a slight fall in the annual growth rate to by consistently high growth in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS with annual growth of about in and a continuous expansion in Amazons EBITDA margin with a major improvement to in These assumptions are discussed in detail below along with their rationale The slowdown in Media shouldnt concern investors Amazons Media business remains to be one of the key drivers of revenues for the company as the segment contributes to roughly of its total revenues The recent slowdown in revenues from the business has been a source of concern for the investors as the Media segment posted a yearoveryear YoY fall in revenues during the first two quarters of the current fiscal year However we believe that this shouldnt concern investors as the importance of this business will continue to decline for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>going forward This is because the proportion of revenues generated from the Media business will continue to decline considering that its growth is significantly lower compared to other businesses This is also evident from the past trends Amazons revenues from the Media business increased at an annual rate of over the past three years falling far below the annual growth in other segments during the same period This led to a fall in the proportion of total revenues generated from the media from in to in The consistent fall in proportion of revenues from the Media business will also result in better annual growth in the companys overall revenues Furthermore we expect a recovery in Media revenues going forward as the foreign exchange pressures ease out going forward The fall in revenues from the segment during the first half of current fiscal year was primarily a result of fall in international Media revenues due to forex pressures while the segment revenues from North America continued to grow increasing and YoY in QFY and QFY respectively Media revenues from international markets increased on a currencyneutral basis during the first half of growing and in QFY and QFY respectively As forex pressures ease out going forward with the recovery in emerging markets growth in Media revenues will be boosted This trend can already be observed with an improvement in segment revenues from a YoY fall of in QFY to an increase of in QFY Apart from this we expect healthy revenues from the Media segment owing to Amazons investments into content including original content Investments into shows such as Man in the High Castle and Transparent reflect managements increased focus on original content which looks to be a strong driver for Media revenues in the future Based on the factors discussed above we expect an improvement in YoY Media revenue growth from about in to in The outlook for Amazons EGM business which comprise roughly of the companys total revenues remains strong with the success of Prime Now and expansion into emerging markets Ecommerce started to take share of brickandmortar retail stores due to not only increasing the ease of shopping for consumers but also saving their time in this fastmoving world where consumers are fighting a battle with time every day As more and more retailers are moving towards ecommerce the uniqueness of ecommerce retail is reducing and for retailers to now outpace others further differentiation strategies such as quickness of delivery are required Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the online retailer which is able to save a customers time most by delivering the product in the shortest time possible will be able to take up the share of other retailers in the same way as ecommerce took up the share of brickandmortar stores Not only that but such a retailer will even able to charge a higher price from the customers as time is becoming money in this age <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>looks set to capitalize on these trends by focusing on quick delivery options such as Prime Now Considering that this core driver of Amazons EGM revenues is only operating in about cities around the world so far there looks to be huge untapped potential for the company As Prime Now and other similar services expand into other cities EGM revenues will show further strength Amazons international expansion particularly its expansion into emerging markets such as India look to be a core driver of growth for the companys EGM This is evident from the fact that Amazons active customer accounts in India increased YoY during the last quarter with its sales being about three times higher compared to the same period in the previous year Not only that but the suppliers side remains strong as well The number of sellers in India increased roughly YoY during the last quarter with of sellers using Amazons logistics and warehouse services The companys continuous investments into the country with the introduction of products per day will continue to drive up its EGM revenues Based on factors such as the expansion of Prime Now into other cities around the world as well as its investments into emerging markets we expect Amazons EGM revenues to sustain doubledigit growth going forward Expected improvement in profitability Amazons EBITDA margin has continued to improve since increasing from about in to in We expect the improvement to continue and even pace up going forward owing to the increasing share of AWS in Amazons total revenues compression in shipping loss margin and economies of scale due to an increase in the size of the business High growth in Amazons AWS business YoY in QFY compared to other businesses consolidated YoY in QFY will lead to a consistent increase in proportion of revenues generated by AWS Considering AWS to be a highermargin segment with operating margins of about compared to for international segment and for North America the increase in proportion of revenues generated from AWS will lead to an expansion in Amazons overall margins Furthermore AWS operating margin is itself expected to improve with an increase in the size of business and improvement in fixed cost leverage thus adding to the companys overall profitability This is also evident from the significant increase in AWS trailingtwelve month TTM operating margins from in QFY to in QFY Furthermore we believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to focus on setting up its fulfillment centers FCS near the areas where sales are concentrated This will continue helping the company switch from costly air shipping to cheaper ground shipping thus reducing shipping costs In addition the increase in size of business with growth in revenues will improve Amazons operational leverage thus expanding its EBITDA margin Based on these reasons we expect an expansion in EBITDA margin from an estimated in to in AWS remains to be Amazons star business with significant growth and higher margins compared to other businesses Although the segment is quite small as of now with roughly billion in quarterly sales it should be noted that the business proportion in Amazons total revenues has significantly increased from in QFY to in QFY The companys strategy to scale up the AWS business by introducing newer and costeffective options such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Aurora and QuickSight will help it reach a broader customer base by suiting the needs of diverse customer groups This along with the increasing demand for cloud computing will continue driving growth for Amazons AWS business thus supporting the companys top line and bottom line We believe that AWS contribution to Amazons total revenues will increase further to by owing to high growth of the business thus having a significant impact on the companys top line and profitability in and onwards Over the past one year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has traded at an average forward EV EBITDA multiple of x while it is currently trading at significantly higher EVEBITDA multiple of x having uplifted investor sentiment with strongerthanexpected results The graph below shows the historical valuation of the company If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>trades at its oneyear average forward EV EBITDA of x its enterprise value will be billion assuming an EBITDA of billion for This enterprise value translates into a stock price of per share suggesting upside potential from the current price The valuation metrics used to arrive at this price are shown in the table below Our forecast of for Amazons EBITDA is based on the
