( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha We initiate coverage on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> with a Buy rating and a target price of $ 780 per share . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The key <b>assumptions</b> underlying our target price include continuous top line growth and expansion in profitability .  (Uncertainty) </span>We find <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's AWS business , its Prime Now service , and its expansion into emerging markets to be the core drivers of growth for the company going forward . Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has gone up about 57 % in value over the past six months , as stronger-than-expected results have lifted investor sentiment . Although the stock is currently trading at high valuation with a forward Enterprise Value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple of 28x, we see further upside potential in the company's stock price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We initiate our coverage of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> with a Buy rating and target price of $ 780 per share , <b>suggesting</b> 18 % upside to the current stock price . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The key <b>assumptions</b> underlying our target price include one-year average forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 19.5 x ; growth in the company 's Media segment in 2016 and onwards following weakness in 2015 , continued double-digit growth in revenues from the Electronics and Other General Merchandise ( EGM ) business despite a slight fall in the annual growth rate to 19 % by 2017 ; consistently high growth in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) , with annual growth of about 50 % in 2017 ; and a continuous expansion in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's EBITDA margin , with a major improvement to 11.7 % in 2017 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These <b>assumptions</b> are discussed in detail below , along with their rationale .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The slowdown in Media should n't concern investors <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Media business remains to be one of the key drivers of revenues for the company , as the segment contributes to <b>roughly</b> 21 % of its total revenues . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The recent slowdown in revenues from the business has been a source of concern for the investors, as the Media segment posted a year-over-year (YoY) fall in revenues during the first two quarters of the current fiscal year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , we <b>believe</b> that this should n't concern investors , as the importance of this business will continue to decline for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> going forward . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is because the proportion of revenues generated from the Media business will continue to decline considering that its growth is significantly <i>lower</i> compared to other businesses .  (Surprise) </span>This is also evident from the past trends.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenues from the Media business increased at an annual rate of 8.2 % over the past three years , falling far below the 29.9 % annual growth in other segments during the same period . This led to a fall in the proportion of total revenues generated from the media, from 37% in 2011 to 25% in 2014.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The consistent fall in proportion of revenues from the Media business will also result in <i>better</i> annual growth in the company 's overall revenues .  (Surprise) </span>Furthermore, we expect a recovery in Media revenues going forward as the foreign exchange pressures ease out going forward.The fall in revenues from the segment during the first half of current fiscal year was primarily a result of fall in international Media revenues due to forex pressures, while the segment revenues from North America continued to grow, increasing 5% and 7% YoY in 1QFY15 and 2QFY15 respectively.Media revenues from international markets increased on a currency-neutral basis during the first half of 2015, growing 2% and 3% in 1QFY15 and 2QFY15 respectively.As forex pressures ease out going forward with the recovery in emerging markets, growth in Media revenues will be boosted.This trend can already be observed with an improvement in segment revenues, from a YoY fall of 3.3% in 1QFY15 to an increase of 0.7% in 4QFY15.Apart from this , we expect healthy revenues from the Media segment owing to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's investments into content , including original content . Investments into shows such as Man in the High Castle and Transparent reflect management's increased focus on original content, which looks to be a strong driver for Media revenues in the future.Based on the factors discussed above, we expect an improvement in YoY Media revenue growth from about -1.2% in 2015 to 3% in 2017.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The outlook for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's EGM business , which comprise <b>roughly</b> 70 % of the company 's total revenues , remains strong with the success of Prime Now and expansion into emerging markets . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>E-commerce started to take share of brick-and-mortar retail stores, due to not only increasing the ease of shopping for consumers, but also saving their time in this fast-moving world where consumers are fighting a battle with time every day.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> retailers are moving towards e-commerce , the uniqueness of e-commerce retail is reducing , and for retailers to now outpace others , further differentiation strategies such as quickness of delivery are required .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the online retailer which is able to save a customer 's time most by delivering the product in the shortest time <b>possible</b> will be able to take up the share of other retailers , in the same way as e-commerce took up the share of brick-and-mortar stores .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not only that , but such a retailer will even able to charge a <i>higher</i> price from the customers , as time is becoming money in this age .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> looks set to capitalize on these trends by focusing on quick delivery options such as Prime Now . Considering that this core driver of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's EGM revenues is only operating in about 17 cities around the world so far , there looks to be huge untapped potential for the company . As Prime Now and other similar services expand into other cities, EGM revenues will show further strength.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's international expansion , particularly its expansion into emerging markets such as India , look to be a core driver of growth for the company 's EGM . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is evident from the fact that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's active customer accounts in India increased 230 % YoY during the last quarter , with its sales being about three times <i>higher</i> compared to the same period in the previous year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Not only that, but the suppliers side remains strong as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The number of sellers in India increased <b>roughly</b> 250 % YoY during the last quarter , with 90 % of sellers using <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's logistics and warehouse services . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The company's continuous investments into the country, with the introduction of 40,000 products per day, will continue to drive up its EGM revenues.Based on factors such as the expansion of Prime Now into other cities around the world as well as its investments into emerging markets , we expect <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's EGM revenues to sustain double-digit growth going forward . Expected improvement in profitability <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's EBITDA margin has continued to improve since 2010 , increasing from about 4.3 % in 2011 to 5.4 % in 2014 . We expect the improvement to continue and even pace up going forward owing to the increasing share of AWS in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's total revenues , compression in shipping loss margin , and economies of scale due to an increase in the size of the business . High growth in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's AWS business ( 78 % YoY in 3QFY15 ) compared to other businesses ( consolidated 23.2 % YoY in 3QFY15 ) will lead to a consistent increase in proportion of revenues generated by AWS . Considering AWS to be a higher-margin segment , with operating margins of about 20.6 % compared to -0.3 % for international segment and 4.2 % for North America , the increase in proportion of revenues generated from AWS will lead to an expansion in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's overall margins . Furthermore, AWS' operating margin is itself expected to improve with an increase in the size of business and improvement in fixed cost leverage, thus adding to the company's overall profitability.This is also evident from the significant increase in AWS' trailing-twelve month (TTM) operating margins from 14.2% in 4QFY14 to 20.6% in 3QFY15.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , we <b>believe</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to focus on setting up its fulfillment centers ( FCS ) near the areas where sales are concentrated . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This will continue helping the company switch from costly air shipping to <i>cheaper</i> ground shipping , thus reducing shipping costs .  (Surprise) </span>In addition , the increase in size of business with growth in revenues will improve <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's operational leverage , thus expanding its EBITDA margin . Based on these reasons, we expect an expansion in EBITDA margin from an estimated 7.4% in 2015 to 11.7% in 2017.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AWS remains to be <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's star business , with significant growth and <i>higher</i> margins compared to other businesses . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although the segment is quite small as of now , with <b>roughly</b> $ 2 billion in quarterly sales , it should be noted that the business ' proportion in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's total revenues has significantly increased , from 5.3 % in 1QFY14 to 8.2 % in 3QFY15 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company 's strategy to scale up the AWS business by introducing <i>newer</i> and cost-effective options , such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Aurora and QuickSight , will help it reach a <i>broader</i> customer base by suiting the needs of diverse customer groups . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This , along with the increasing demand for cloud computing , will continue driving growth for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's AWS business , thus supporting the company 's top line and bottom line . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> that AWS ' contribution to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's total revenues will increase <i>further</i> to 12.7 % by 2017 , owing to high growth of the business , thus having a significant impact on the company 's top line and profitability in 2017 and onwards . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Over the past one year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has traded at an average forward EV / EBITDA multiple of 19.5 x , while it is currently trading at significantly <i>higher</i> EV/EBITDA multiple of 28.4 x , having uplifted investor sentiment with stronger-than-expected results .
