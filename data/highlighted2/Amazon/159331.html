There are millions of ways to demonstrate just how difficult and competitive this space is.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>After earnings last week , the Bloomberg interviewer referenced above immediately questioned the future of a company that ca n't offer <i>better</i> pricing than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Citron wanted to illustrate that the vast majority of goods that are <i>less</i> expensive on other sites ( namely <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) , so if any potential customers refer to a Google search , Wayfair loses . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In order to avoid the <b>appearance</b> of having `` cherry-picked '' a few items , Citron went to `` Favorite Wayfair Purchase '' links selected by the company 's own management on their executive profile page .  (Uncertainty) </span>Let's see what we found: " Meet the Team " page: Wal-Mart and Target also have aggressive price match policies.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While they clearly do n't have the price change flexibility that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does ( changing prices on shelf tags and POS scanner systems is a <i>bigger</i> task than just changing the price displayed to an online customer ) , clearly nobody is going to be able to expand gross margins competing against Target and Wal-Mart either , much <i>less</i> having to go head-to-head against <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The power of omni-channel marketing is just as impactful in the low-to-mid end of the home furnishings sector.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As anyone who has ever bought furniture online knows , the biggest <b>risk</b> is that today 's online furniture purchase winds up in your garage tomorrow .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart and Target offer return policies that Wayfair ca n't <b>possibly</b> ever compete with .  (Uncertainty) </span>While Wayfair online buyers are stuck with paying return shipping fees, buyers at Walmart.com and Target.com can return products bought online to any Wal-Mart or Target store location.(Except, notably, in the case of Walmart.com items "fulfilled by Wayfair"!)"Wayfair items cannot be returned to Wal-Mart stores or to Walmart.com."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because furniture items are often bulky , this <b>could</b> be a $ 50 hit on a $ 200 purchase to keep the item from winding up in your garage .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is Citron 's opinion that many consumers will continue to consider it a superior value to pay a slightly <i>higher</i> price merely for the level of `` return assurance '' and convenience afforded by box stores like Target or Wal-Mart .  (Surprise) </span>Through a rarely publicized artifact of its business called "Get it Near Me," in which Wayfair sells ads to retail furniture stores, Wayfair offers up a one-line admission that proves in its own words the inherent flaw in the company's business that cannot be changed.What you are about to read is all you have to know to pinpoint why this unicorn is doomed to certain death .Although the vast majority of consumers go online to begin their research for a major home purchase, the vast majority of consumers will ultimately make their purchase at a brick & mortar store.This presents an incredible opportunity for retailers to get the attention of consumers as they conduct their research.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company states in its own '' Get it Near Me '' FAQ : Q : If Wayfair sells furniture , why would I want to advertise on your sites ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Aren't we competitors?Yes and no.As an online-only retailer of furniture, most people use our sites as a way to conduct product research before going to one of their local "brick-and-mortar" furniture stores to make a purchase.Wayfair's "Get it Near Me" program is all but an admission that the company's core business will never change consumer home goods buying behavior to the point that Wayfair will be profitable.The most obvious indication of the problems with the Wayfair business model is the extraordinary amount of customer complaints online.When selling non-branded merchandise for which you do not control the ship dates, and the product is often too large to return easily (have fun returning a sofa), you have an uphill business model.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> that is why Wayfair 's `` asset-light '' model continues to lose money , while its omni-channel competitors rack up profits quarter after quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>Everyone knows - just Google "Wayfair complaints" and your head will spin.A recent Bloomberg interview with Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah just proves how clueless he is about his own business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is the same guy who <b>could</b> n't figure out to start a furniture `` brand '' until Google changed its search mechanisms .  (Uncertainty) </span>Citron adds comments (italicized) on his statements.No!It did not drive a profit line.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It made you have a <i>smaller</i> loss - big difference !  (Surprise) </span>"Home is a 250 billion retail market and as it is shifting online - we think there will be a big winner and... we are having success at being that winner" [0:50] How are you a winner - with $200 million in accumulated losses after being at the business for 13 years - while your competition, both high- and low-end, have generated billions of dollars in profits in the same category?"For the first 9 years of this business we were profitable" [1:10] You were?As the filing of the S-1, your company had $190 million in cumulative losses before you went public, and the number has done nothing but escalate.There is a difference between generating a small profit as a private company and trying to scale a business.How many times have investors read this dishonest description of Wayfair?"To transform the way people shop for their homes" - Wayfair's "Our Mission": Q2 2015 Investor Presentation What is transformative here?Using the internet to buy goods??What is the differentiated retail experience?The only thing differentiated is the ability to lose hundreds of millions of dollars while Wall Street allows insiders to dump stock at a staggering pace - that truly is differentiated in the furniture and home furnishings space, where its competitors are held to the burden of making a profit.Conclusion: Why Wayfair Will NEVER achieve mass-scale profitability - simplified.The company's much-touted recent quarter netted it a 4% loss on revenues, which were up 66.45% over the prior-year quarter.The law of large numbers has claimed billions of dollars invested in internet companies over the years.Unless you have a viral strategy, paying for traffic flow is an extremely high-risk strategy.If it doesn't bind long-term customers, you have flushed your investors' money on nothing.Etoys and pets.com are but two examples among hundreds of forgotten URLs which used ad spend trying to carve out online turf for a vertical market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Meanwhile , the margins on online furniture , and the brutal realities of dynamic pricing strategies promise that this company is unlikely to ever see margin expansion , and in fact , margin contraction is in fact a very real <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wayfair 's gross margin , which the company has been unable to expand by even one point over several years , is so narrow that driving revenues <i>higher</i> alone wo n't get this company into the green .  (Surprise) </span>So Wayfair won't become profitable, regardless of the size of the top line, without slashing its all-in marketing costs to the low teens.At the moment, those costs are 21.08% of gross, having peaked in 2014 at 24.81%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With an intense marketing spend ( for instance , running 5x <i>more</i> TV ads than Overstock ) , the transactions generated from this ad spend are n't profitable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company `` <b>hopes</b> '' that a large percentage of these first-time buyers will become long-term customers of Wayfair .  (Uncertainty) </span>Evercore's model, for example, has this company losing an additional $80 million through the end of 2017, and even then, just breaking even.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And to merely breakeven 2Â 1/2 years from now , Wayfair is required to hit the trifecta of : ... while slashing marketing spend by <b>nearly</b> 3 points <i>less</i> than current quarter 's `` lowered '' rates ... And , despite withering competition , carve out marginally positive gross margins too .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For those reasons, Wayfair is the most mispriced publicly traded stock Citron has seen in years - with 80% downside.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
