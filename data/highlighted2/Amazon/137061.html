Home Saving Money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Completely Changed How You Can Share Your Prime Benefits and Not for the Better Well it looks like the sharing party is over my friends I was gone this past weekend on a little trip and got a comment on one of my most popular articles It shows you how to share your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime shipping benefits with four other family members Since I wrote it it has been well received Most people didnt know you could share you <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime benefits Either way apparently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has decided to change up how you are able to share your Prime account This new change was introduced on August st They have redevelopedthe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Household program In doing so they have removed the ability for people to share their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shipping benefits with four other people Before all you needed to do was follow the few steps listed in this article Now you cant do that any more My dad and sister were listed under mine and were able to get my prime shipping benefit That gave them free twoday shipping on millions of products They are no longer able to do this So what changed I can count a number of possible reasons but the main one is probably because they realized people were abusing the system Their wording told you to share with members in your household or you could share with coworkers The issue is there was no way to know who you were sharing with While I only had my sister and father Im sure others had friends There were a number of articles showing you how to save on an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prime membership and this was the top tip The other one was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Student Its no surprise that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants more paying Prime customers They are a business that thrives on having more customers When you take Prime shipping away from those who were getting it for free you might be able to convert them to paying customer For us who are already paying customers this doesnt affect me much as I wasnt getting money from my family to share my shipping benefits This might not be the case with others To get more paying customers they introduced the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Household program This is where the sharing gets dismantled Instead of sharing with other people and not having to worry about seeing their order profile information now those in the household will be able to see your orders This is what you see when you go to the regular share your Prime benefits page The new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Household program is literally designed for those in a household Its only for up to six people and four of those being children who dont need <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>accounts Basically its for two adults and four children The kicker in the program come in when they talk about how to set it up Here is a little note they put in there Note In order to share content Prime benefits and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mom benefits both adult account holders need to authorize each other to use credit and debit cards associated with their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>accounts for purchases on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This will not affect either of their current payment settings but each adult will be able to copy the credit and debit cards of the other account to his or her <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account and use them for purchases with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>So in order to actually share your benefits you need to authorize the other adult account to use your creditdebit cards already in your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account with the other adult This means both account holders can use either card in both accounts Basically this weeds out anyone trying to share their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime shipping benefits with anyone outside of their close family You wouldnt want your coworker getting access to your credit cards and vise versa That could end poorly From what Ive been told you will also be able to see purchase histories between the two accounts I cant verify this but that would be terrible You wouldnt be able to buy your significant other a gift without them knowing it I will keep my eyes and ears out to see if this is actually true Some said it was true with the regular sharing program but I never found it and asked a number of people who couldnt see the other peoples order history Prior to this new change you were only able to share your twoday shipping benefits and the Kindle library I would say the whole reason to share was for the shipping benefits Now the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Household program allows you to share a few more things inside your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime account Here they are Since the traditional sharing method is gone then you will need to set up and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>household if you want to share with someone you dont mind having access to your credit
