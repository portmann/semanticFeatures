( NASDAQ : AAPL ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Netflix have largely been dominating the streaming content field , but the feeling is Apple will soon get involved . Apple is currently working on a few original productions, but none are expected to be the launching pad for a full-fledged roster.Reports have surfaced that Apple’s delay in launching top tier scripted programming comes from a level of “disorganization�?it hasn’t seen in the past.A general feeling is growing that Hollywood has thus far been unwilling to work with Apple due to its very “hands-on�?approach and desire to move slowly into the space.Apple likely knows that to make an impact, it has to enter the market with a splash similar to what Netflix did with "House of Cards."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the attention in the streaming media battles has been on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , reports have recently surfaced that Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) <b>could</b> soon enter the marketplace . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , we 've heard these <b>rumors</b> many times before , but this latest round sheds some light on why there is a holdup .  (Uncertainty) </span>Although will it really make a difference?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The news about Apple starting an original TV division started popping up again <i>earlier</i> this year when a new Dr. Dre-produced limited series was uncovered by the media .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , it soon became clear that while scripted , this was for release on Apple Music and not part of a <i>larger</i> streaming TV empire ( for now ) .  (Surprise) </span>Just the other week though, Apple was in the news again regarding a show in development with Ben Silverman and will.i.am about the creation of apps.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This one , while not confirmed , <b>seems</b> like it will be an Apple TV/iTunes exclusive .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Neither the Dr. Dre project nor the one about apps screams to Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> `` watch out , here we come , '' but that just <b>may</b> be the point . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Apple is smart and its team doesn't want to just dip its toe into the streaming waters; it wants to dock a massive yacht.And if you think about it, it makes sense.Before House of Cards , we were n't talking about Netflix as a streaming giant and it took until last year for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to really enter the conversation when Transparent and The Man In The High Castle caught on . Then there's Hulu, which after being around for years just became an actual player in the original streaming content game this winter when 11.22.63 and The Path debuted.Netflix knew signing Kevin Spacey and David Fincher was a big deal that would get immediate attention , but it seemingly took <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Hulu a little while to grasp that concept . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Now to be fair , I 'm sure they had conversations about a <i>bigger</i> rollout and ultimately decided the `` slow and steady '' approach was smart , but it has led to a massive imbalance of power here .  (Surprise) </span>If Apple wants to compete from the jump, they have to come in with a lineup of series that look like a broadcast network's fall roster on steroids.And investors (as well as analysts) need to understand that type of roster takes time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What Apple looks to be doing is the equivalent of what Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did to start , which is prepping <i>smaller</i> projects , but here they are earmarked for other divisions . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is an important distinction because this way , the company gets the experience of developing new content but without the <b>fear</b> of it being underwhelming .  (Uncertainty) </span>In a manner of speaking, they get to have their cake and eat it to… for the moment.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The twist is that reports are beginning to surface that Apple 's planning stage <b>may</b> be <i>more</i> intense than usual , namely it 's becoming so disorganized that <b>frustration</b> is beginning to take over .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Apple reportedly spent most of the Sundance this year in secret meetings with the goal of luring top talent, but it doesn't sound like it went well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The problem is that Hollywood <b>seems</b> resistant to its approach , which has been nicknamed `` the two-lane '' method .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Basically , the perception is Apple is content to trickle out these <i>smaller</i> projects now as a prolonged semi-beta stage that gooses the numbers of its other key divisions .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While this is happening , they can take <i>more</i> time to build an army of <i>larger</i> series that would rival Netflix 's roster .  (Surprise) </span>Industry executives, however, want Apple to jump right in now and that paired with Apple's notorious reputation for perfection and owning all aspects of a project is not making for good bedfellows.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With that said , while the `` disorganized '' <b>rumors</b> are spreading , it likely wo n't impact the end result .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is known for making sure it's buttoned up before going wide with announcements and it is easy to imagine the madcap scramble that precedes a big reveal.This is part of the scramble, but it's just getting amplified because it's all so new.Even though only a handful of people know what Apple's big plan actually is (and its current pitfalls), the truth is Apple is very likely going to enter this space at some point.It is also likely they will do so in a way that will appeal to consumers, investors and analysts, but in typical Apple fashion, we aren't going to know about it until they are good and ready.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers, Expert Insight</div></body></html>
