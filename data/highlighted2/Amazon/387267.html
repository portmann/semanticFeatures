(Surprise) </span>If Apple wants to compete from the jump, they have to come in with a lineup of series that look like a broadcast network's fall roster on steroids.And investors (as well as analysts) need to understand that type of roster takes time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What Apple looks to be doing is the equivalent of what Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did to start , which is prepping <i>smaller</i> projects , but here they are earmarked for other divisions . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is an important distinction because this way , the company gets the experience of developing new content but without the <b>fear</b> of it being underwhelming .  (Uncertainty) </span>In a manner of speaking, they get to have their cake and eat it toâ€¦ for the moment.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The twist is that reports are beginning to surface that Apple 's planning stage <b>may</b> be <i>more</i> intense than usual , namely it 's becoming so disorganized that <b>frustration</b> is beginning to take over .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Apple reportedly spent most of the Sundance this year in secret meetings with the goal of luring top talent, but it doesn't sound like it went well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The problem is that Hollywood <b>seems</b> resistant to its approach , which has been nicknamed `` the two-lane '' method .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Basically , the perception is Apple is content to trickle out these <i>smaller</i> projects now as a prolonged semi-beta stage that gooses the numbers of its other key divisions .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While this is happening , they can take <i>more</i> time to build an army of <i>larger</i> series that would rival Netflix 's roster .  (Surprise) </span>Industry executives, however, want Apple to jump right in now and that paired with Apple's notorious reputation for perfection and owning all aspects of a project is not making for good bedfellows.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With that said , while the `` disorganized '' <b>rumors</b> are spreading , it likely wo n't impact the end result .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is known for making sure it's buttoned up before going wide with announcements and it is easy to imagine the madcap scramble that precedes a big reveal.This is part of the scramble, but it's just getting amplified because it's all so new.Even though only a handful of people know what Apple's big plan actually is (and its current pitfalls), the truth is Apple is very likely going to enter this space at some point.It is also likely they will do so in a way that will appeal to consumers, investors and analysts, but in typical Apple fashion, we aren't going to know about it until they are good and ready.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers, Expert Insight</div></body></html>
