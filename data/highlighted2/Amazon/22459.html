class='textDiv'>April Fools Apple to Buy Spotify The Big Picture It had to happen Apples stock rises when it has a monopoly And despite all the iPhone profits Android has greater worldwide market share This is not the iPod revolution wherein a seamless hardwaresoftware combination of iPod iTunes and FairPlay DRM ensured that no other player could gain traction Hell Apple is losing traction every day in music And if you believe that Jimmy Iovine can pull a rabbit out of his hat you believe Jay Z is gonna turn Tidal into a raging success Thats right Jimmy was left out of the negotiations Tim Cook is still pissed about the U fiasco wherein Iovine paid back the hasbeen stars and Apple ended up with egg on its face Apple is a bigger brand than U and Cook feels like the company got hijacked so therefore just like David Geffen was left out of the MCAMatsushita negotiations Jimmy had no part in this purchase its news to him Actually credit Scott Forstall You remember him right Mr Software Steve Jobss righthand man Forstall was agitating for a music streaming service so loudly that he got fired But after promoting Jony Ive and closing ranks Cook had a chance meeting with Daniel Ek at the San Jose airport while their respective jets were being gassed and Cook realized the error of his ways He couldnt bring back Forstall but he was man enough to recognize hed been wrong as Steve was too files are history streams are forever So the seed was planted YEARS ago Thats why Spotify has never gone public Projects at Apple take as long to develop as movies at Pixar and while you were looking for an Apple TV set and deriding Jony Ives Watch Cook was positioning the company to win and win big Thats right now Apples going to own streaming music no one else will be able to compete its monopoly time all over again Live like a king Get a NetJet account You cant advance your career flying coach Just like a wannabe leases a BMW in Los Angeles in Silicon Valley you fly private For the hang For the business Anyway Apple is behind the eight ball in music iTunes sales are faltering and iTunes Radio is a disaster Sure iTunes Radio may ultimately triumph in countries Pandora has not entered but it doesnt look good Dont believe the naysayers Spotifys footprint is immense its in almost every country with an economy And as Daniel Ek so famously says if they stopped expandinginvesting theyd be profitable today Sure the business was built on musicians backs but we reward superstar coders more than superstar musicians and conception is everything In a world of metoo music Spotify was never a metoo music service Which is why Beats Music could never catch it Why Rdio and Deezer cant catch it Along with the deep pockets to give the music away for free And no one has a deeper pocket than Apple Theyre the only one who could overpay for Spotify because not only do they have the cash theyre the only one who can benefit from the synergy of the acquisition That Beats Music service that Ian Rogers has been working on so hard Its the equivalent of Copland the unworkable OS that caused Gil Amelio to purchase NeXT and gain what evolved into OS X Thats why BeatsApple Music has never relaunched Its too buggy So Spotify will now be Apples default service With a reskinning and a rebranding Theyve been working on this for two years but the software is now launchready Its akin to the Macs switch from PowerPC to Intel By time they announced it they were ready to do it all the work had already been done This is Jimmy Iovines middle finger to the music industry Thats right Jimmy is incredibly pissed the label bosses wouldnt agree to lower the price of an Apple streaming service to a month And hes now getting the last laugh Because with Apple the only game in town Lucian Grainge has to bow to his will Itll be ten bucks a month for all you can eat or you can experience the ads and listen for free Apple has money to lose as it tightens its grip on streaming music Thats right its over No other enterprise has pockets this deep software this good and mindsharerep of an equivalent stature BECAUSE ITS THE START OF TAYLOR SWIFTS TOUR It was all a head fake The joke is on you Taylors been in cahoots with Apple for nearly a year She removed her music from Spotify in order to drive down the purchase price Every dollar below bil was hers to keep Alas she was unsuccessful in this effort but shes coming out fine Shes gonna get a dollar for every signup for the first twelve months So expect her to hawk Apples streaming service like she hawked her album and no ones a better marketer than Taylor no ones got a better relationship with the press Didnt you notice her absence at the Tidal press conference She of all people should have been there But isnt even streamable on Tidal doesnt that tell you something And now you know why MercedesBenz was a late addition sponsor to the Rock In Rio festival in Las Vegas Thats where Taylors headlining on the th MercedesBenz is going to give everyone who purchases an automobile a lifetime subscription to Apples streaming service as long as they continue to drive an MBZ Its a winwin Dead in the water where it already is A bunch of the artists involved were already eager to bolt from Live Nations management division after Mondays debacle now this sale will anger them even further It was all masterminded by Guy Oseary the same guy who was responsible for the U album fiasco Rumor has it theyre all going to march en masse into Irving Azoffs fold now that his noncompete has expired but that has not yet been substantiated But the reason MSG is dividing in two is to free up money for further acquisitions by Irving so all signs are pointing in this direction The other streaming services will fade away and will not radiate Because online only one entity wins you gravitate to where all your friends are All the exclusives will be on Apple The streaming service will work on Android and Windows but icons will not look as sharp and functionality will be hampered in order to force people to buy Apple hardware Its all about the hardware you know that right Its the reverse razor blade theory You give away the software to sell expensive hardware Theyre not going to buy labels Thats ridiculous Who needs the headache But they are going to release data so that acts will know that its the labels screwing artists not the streaming service So the war is over You can stop bitching about Spotify You can get back to making good music if you ever did As for consumers this is heaven And books and television are next Apple plans to corner the market on TV distribution their deal with HBO is just the beginning And despite being judged guilty of pricefixing re books the publishers are still angry at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and are willing to throw in with Cook for a subscription service They get to set the price Apple will just take its traditional Amazons reading devices suck anyway and this is just a further way to cement Apples power in tablets a way to goose sales which have suddenly stalled So its been proven that Tim Cook is quite the match for Steve Jobs Just like he greenlit the evisceration of skeuomorphism hes pivoting the company to streaming content He knows that streaming is the future Please use the comments to demonstrate

Finance working as a trader researcher and strategist before graduating to asset management The price pattern reminds you that every movement of importance is but a repetition of similar price movements that just as soon as you can familiarize yourself with the actions of the past you will be able to anticipate and act correctly and profitably upon forthcoming movements Jesse Livermore
