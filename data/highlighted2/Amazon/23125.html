( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Since its inception , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services has grown to be the world 's largest cloud infrastructure provider . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Its aggressive approach to pricing and scaling has driven huge revenue growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) was one of the <i>earlier</i> entrants in the cloud computing space , which has allowed the company to gain some considerable sway in the industry . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In fact, the company was partly responsible for popularizing the term, after introducing the Elastic Compute Cloud in 2006, and is by now the world's largest cloud infrastructure provider by a considerable margin.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although like other cloud computing competitors it is growing revenue quickly , the company <b>may</b> not be earning any money off these services , according to Citi estimates , which is problematic for a company struggling to consistently get the bottom line into positive territory .  (Uncertainty) </span>Getting into the cloud computing space was a logical move for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , whose engineers had acquired years of experience in designing flexible , easily scalable online infrastructure and software for its own sprawling e-commerce platform . As demand grew for low-cost, reliable infrastructure among businesses, offering this platform to others became an enticing proposition.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> made its entry into the cloud computing space in 2006 with the launch of EC2 , an online service that provides easily scalable access to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's computing capacity , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) , which provides flexible data storage infrastructure . Both of these were largely geared toward developers and both quickly garnered a sizable following after their introduction.The rapid growth of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services was in part due to its aggressive approach to acquiring market share , according to its originator Chris Pinkham . This involved on the one hand scaling up its offerings very quickly, and on the other hand settling for very low margins as a means of undercutting the competition.Indeed , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's guns-blazing approach to cloud computing paid off in terms of revenue growth and market share . Although judging growth over the last few years is a hazy business due to the fact that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has not yet broken out Web Services in earnings reports , estimates are fairly spectacular . By 2013, AWS is estimated to have hit $3.1 billion in revenue.This figure is expected to have hit around $4.6 billion last year.AWS is now the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure by orders of magnitude.In 2014, AWS hit a worldwide combined IaaS, PaaS, Private and Hybrid market share of 28%, dwarfing runners up like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) which posted 10% and 7%, respectively.It is in fact one of the fastest-growing software services in history.This year, it is expected to hit $6.6 billion revenue, and by 2016 this figure is expected to rise to a whopping $9.2 billion, according to Citi estimates.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , this spectacular growth comes at a price - <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services <b>may</b> not yet be profitable . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>According to Citi's estimates , AWS lost $123 million in 2014 and by 2016 will earn only $69 million.It bases these estimates on the company's prior comments as well as figures from competitors.The strategy of gaining market share at the expense of margins and profit is well-known to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . So familiar, in fact, that the company routinely posts quarterly losses, with two in fiscal 2014 alone.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This has not stopped the company 's stock from rising as optimistic investors <b>believe</b> that its massive revenue growth and market share make up for its choppy bottom line .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Indeed , many <b>believe</b> that AWS is headed on the right path .  (Uncertainty) </span>At some point, however, profits will start to matter.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will break out AWS ' results when it reports Q1 2015 toward the end of the month , and many cloud industry watchers will be extremely interested in how much money Web Services is actually making for the sprawling internet company . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , judging by Citi estimates , it is not yet likely that Web Services is the profit cash cow that investors will be <b>hoping</b> for .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services was one of the first major cloud infrastructure providers , and it is currently the biggest by a sizable margin . The company's aggressive approach in garnering market share has led to spectacular revenue growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , its slim margins aimed at undercutting the competition mean that AWS <b>may</b> not yet be profitable , at least according to Citi estimates .  (Uncertainty) </span>With the first break-out of AWS results due toward the end of the month, analysts and investors alike will be very curious to see how this cloud giant is actually performing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services <b>May</b> Not Be Profitable Disclosure : The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours .
