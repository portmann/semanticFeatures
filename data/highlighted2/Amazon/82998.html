announcing its Q numbers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Price targets have been hiked post the announcement of better than expected AWS segment results Amazons NASDAQ AMZN stock price is up nearly since its Q numbers hit the street Major investment houses have been busy hiking their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>price targets citing the newly disclosed operating profitability of AWS as a major driver of the firms value We had earlier highlighted the fundamental problems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>faces as factors which made the stock a risky bet With the new information on AWS should investors rethink their stance on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as is being widely done We update our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock analysis to put things in perspective Amazons valuation can be understood if we look at the company as one comprising of three pieces Direct sales or Product Revenue Cloud or AWS and Third party sales or Rest of total revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>valuations on most traditional valuation metrics would throw up ridiculously low valuations due to an inconsistent or near nonexistent bottomline However a sum of the parts valuation based on revenue multiples for comparable businesses would provide a better understanding of what the right market valuation for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock would be We use a sumoftheparts approach looking at the three components as mentioned earlier to understand Amazons overall valuation We compare the Direct Sales of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to that of regular retailers Most large retailers currently trade at a Pricetosales multiple of around X Providing for Amazons superior product revenues growth rate a multiple in the range of to would be appropriate to value the direct sales component of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Using a multiple of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Direct sales can be valued at billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Service Sales mostly include P sales on which it receives and records associated commission similar to eBay Marketplaces We could therefore use eBays PS ratio of X to value the service sales component of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>However a point to note is that eBay NASDAQ EBAY valuation is positively impacted by the high growth of PayPal and hence the eBay multiple already implies a premium as compared to a pure play marketplace However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>p sales have a superior growth rate as compared to eBay Marketplace and hence we apply a multiple of X sales to Amazons service sales to account for its rapid growth valuing this component at billion The total valuation of Amazons nonAWS business comes to billion as detailed above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>currently has a total market cap of billion June close implying a valuation of for the AWS segment The derived AWS valuation equates to a multiple of x LTM sales of billion AWS Competing with Google and Microsoft in a highly commoditized market Are these valuations stretched A few points to consider would be the fact that Amazons retail platform has failed to establish any kind of a significant and stable bottom line unlike most established retailers and eBay Hence valuing the company at these valuations does provide for a significant premium and an assumption that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will turn profitable someday Profitability is the company has failed to achieve with any kind of consistency in its close to years of existence Moving over to the cloud segment AWS competes in a market which has attracted companies like Microsoft and Google The cash piles these companies possess are no secret The IAAS market where AWS operates in is a highly commoditized market where cash cows are highly valued given the huge upfront investments required Googles online search and Microsofts Windows and Office suite are great examples of solid cash cows Competing with Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT in a highly commoditized market where Price is the significant differentiator can only lead to one destination lower profit margins AWS operating profits are a proof of what is in store ahead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported a segment operating profit margin of for AWS in Q a significant contraction from in Q Hence any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock analysis should closely reflect and incorporate any changes in the AWS segment operating margins over the coming quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>valuations definitely appear stretched even when evaluating the company using a sumoftheparts approach At this point in time investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would be a like walking blindfolded to the edge of a cliff While you wont be sure where the cliff ends the fall could be great if the company fails to reinvent itself into profitability While it would be highly speculative to go long at current valuations betting against the stock would amount to foolishness of the highest order for this is a stock which has traded in defiance of the greater investment rationale for well over a decade The takeaway for investors Look at better riskreward options to park your money rather than a gamble in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The market does have plenty of them Source
