( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock price is up <b>nearly</b> 9 % since its announcing its Q1 2015 numbers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Price targets have been hiked post the announcement of <i>better</i> than expected AWS segment results . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) stock price is up <b>nearly</b> 9 % since its Q1 2015 numbers hit the street . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Major investment houses have been busy hiking their <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> price targets citing the newly disclosed operating profitability of AWS as a major driver of the firm 's value . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We had <i>earlier</i> highlighted the fundamental problems <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> faces as factors which made the stock a <b>risky</b> bet . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>With the new information on AWS , should investors rethink their stance on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , as is being widely done ? We update our <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock analysis to put things in perspective . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation can be understood if we look at the company as one comprising of three pieces : Direct sales or Product Revenue , Cloud or AWS and Third party sales or Rest of total revenue . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> valuations on most traditional valuation metrics would throw up ridiculously low valuations , due to an inconsistent or near non-existent bottomline . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , a sum of the parts valuation based on revenue multiples for comparable businesses would provide a <i>better</i> understanding of what the right market valuation for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock would be . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We use a sum-of-the-parts approach , looking at the three components as mentioned <i>earlier</i> , to understand <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's overall valuation . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>We compare the Direct Sales of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to that of regular retailers . Most large retailers currently trade at a Price-to-sales multiple of around 0.5 X. Providing for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's superior product revenues growth rate , a multiple in the range of 0.5 to 1 would be appropriate to value the direct sales component of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Using a multiple of 1 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Direct sales can be valued at $ 71.5 billion . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Service Sales mostly include 3P sales on which it receives and records associated commission , similar to eBay Marketplaces . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>could</b> therefore use eBay 's PS ratio of 4.09 X to value the service sales component of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However, a point to note is that eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) valuation is positively impacted by the high growth of PayPal and hence the eBay multiple already implies a premium as compared to a pure play marketplace.However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 3p sales have a superior growth rate as compared to eBay Marketplace and hence we apply a multiple of 5X sales to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's service sales to account for its rapid growth , valuing this component at $ 76.7 billion . The total valuation of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's non-AWS business comes to $ 148.2 billion , as detailed above . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> currently has a total market cap of $ 203.31 billion ( June 4 2015 close ) , implying a valuation of $ 55.11 for the AWS segment . The derived AWS valuation equates to a multiple of 10.7x LTM sales of $5.16 billion.AWS Competing with Google and Microsoft in a highly commoditized market Are these valuations stretched?A few points to consider would be the fact that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail platform has failed to establish any kind of a significant and stable bottom line , unlike most established retailers and eBay . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hence valuing the company at these valuations does provide for a significant premium and an <b>assumption</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will turn profitable someday . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Profitability is the company has failed to achieve with any kind of consistency, in its close to 20 years of existence.Moving over to the cloud segment, AWS competes in a market which has attracted companies like Microsoft and Google.The cash piles these companies possess are no secret.The IAAS market, where AWS operates in, is a highly commoditized market where cash cows are highly valued, given the huge upfront investments required.Google's online search and Microsoft's Windows and Office suite are great examples of solid cash cows.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Competing with Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) and Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) in a highly commoditized market where Price is the significant differentiator can only lead to one destination , <i>lower</i> profit margins .  (Surprise) </span>AWS operating profits are a proof of what is in store ahead.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reported a segment operating profit margin of 17 % for AWS in Q1 2015 , a significant contraction from 23 % in Q1 2014 . Hence , any <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock analysis should closely reflect and incorporate any changes in the AWS segment operating margins over the coming quarters . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> valuations definitely <b>appear</b> stretched even when evaluating the company using a sum-of-the-parts approach . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>At this point in time , investing in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would be a like walking blindfolded to the edge of a cliff . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While you wo n't be sure where the cliff ends , the fall <b>could</b> be great if the company fails to reinvent itself into profitability .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While it would be highly <b>speculative</b> to go long at current valuations , betting against the stock would amount to foolishness of the highest order ; for this is a stock which has traded in defiance of the <i>greater</i> investment rationale for well over a decade .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The takeaway for investors : Look at <i>better</i> risk/reward options to park your money rather than a gamble in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The market does have plenty of them.Source : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Valuation Post AWS Disclosure : Justified Or Not ?
