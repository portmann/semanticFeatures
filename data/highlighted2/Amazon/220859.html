( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha The only thing debatable about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> today is its valuation in light of its 98 % year-to-date performance and 111x FY16 P/E . We have performed a bull/bear valuation analysis.With 23 % upside in a bull case and 4 % downside in a bear case , we view the risk/reward on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as compelling . The strength and profitability of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) business model has long been debated . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But following three consecutive earnings beats and strong metrics in both North American ops and AWS , we <b>believe</b> the only thing debatable today is the stock 's valuation in light of its 98 % year-to-date performance and 111x FY16 P/E .  (Uncertainty) </span>Consequently, we have decided to review our DCF (discounted cash flow) valuation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As mentioned in previous articles , valuing companies which deliver high revenue growth but limited short-term earnings is always a difficult task but we <b>believe</b> that a DCF valuation is pretty well suited to this kind of mission as it captures the long-term potential ( revenues and margins ) of any company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In our DCF , we have made the following <b>assumptions</b> : - Revenue growth stays above 20 % until 2017 , which is consistent with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current revenue momentum ( +30 % at constant FX in Q3 ) , and then gradually moderates . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>- Over 2015-2025 , revenues grow at a 14 % CAGR , with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> generating $ 418bn sales ( vs. $ 108bn expected in 2015 ) . For comparison purposes, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) is expected to deliver $488bn revenue in 2015.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>- AWS grows <i>faster</i> than core retail ops and accounts for 13 % of total revenue by 2025 ( vs. 7 % in 2015 ) .  (Surprise) </span>- AWS' non-GAAP operating margin reaches 30%, slightly above current levels thanks to the scalability of the business model.- Retail ops' non-GAAP operating margin gradually moves toward 6% in 2025, in-line with Wal-Mart's margins over the last few years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We believe this is a reasonable <b>assumption</b> considering that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's North American business is already on track to deliver a 4-5 % margin next year . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>- Overall , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's non-GAAP operating margin reaches 9.1 % , compared to a 4.5 % margin expectation for FY15 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>- <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's FY25 GAAP margin is slightly <i>lower</i> ( 7.9 % ) as we include in our model stock-based compensation . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Even if stock-based compensation is a non-cash item, we view it as a real cost that reflects the impact of continued share dilution on the P&L.- Growth rate in perpetuity is 2.5%, consistent with world GDP growth across different economic cycles.- We use a discount rate of 8.1% (with a beta of 1.0).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We have also performed a bull/bear analysis to <i>better</i> assess the risk/reward .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In our bull case , we <b>assume</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will post a <i>higher</i> retail margin than Wal-Mart ( 7 % ) thanks to the scalability of the Internet model and the contribution of new high-margin services ( such as payment features ) . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That would push the stock price toward $760.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In our bear case , we <b>assume</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail margin only reaches 5 % ( well below Wal-Mart 's ) as profitability of international operations remains <b>disappointing</b> and well below domestic operations due to the lack of critical size in several international markets . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We also retain a <i>more</i> conservative margin assumption for AWS ( 25 % , in-line with the current margin ) , considering that increased competition and price pressures in the cloud infrastructure market <b>could</b> weigh on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In conclusion , with 23 % upside in a bull case and 4 % downside in a bear case , we view the risk/reward on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as compelling . That said , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's new ventures will have to be monitored carefully . Even if the company has been investor-friendly in the last few quarters through the disclosure of AWS metrics and reduced spending ( enabling retail margins to pop ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a long history of spending heavily on new projects for an extended period of time . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> delay or even derail the margin improvement story .
