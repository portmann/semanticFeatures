<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and AWS is the prime driver read more with year over year Net Sales growth AMZN has fallen dramatically recently It appears to be rebounding nicely with the market It likely has a lot farther to go up AMZN is an industry leader and it will likely continue to be If you are a strategic long term investor you can probably ride this horse to greater heights Hopefully this article will help you grow your investment capital Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN has a largely deserved reputation for being the online marketplace It earned this reputation many years ago and since then it has been a Wall Street darling AMZN has been designated a momentum stock and its value has been run up Its FPE Forward PE is That number puts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at a roughly a fold premium to most of its retail peers Does any stock deserve this kind of valuation I would have argued that no stock does However Q and Q results from AWS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services present a justification for all of the previous years of hype The chart below shows the fantastic recent growth in AWS and the end does not appear to be in sight AWS Net Sales were B in Q with a operating margin Projecting from the above growth results Net Sales for AWS promise to be B for FY Of course there is a lot of wiggle room when Net Sales grew year over year in FY Operating Income grew an even better year over year Worldwide for the entire company revenue increased year over year to B Excluding the B negative Forex effect revenue growth was The Trailing Twelve Month Operating Cash Flow increased to B year over year The Trailing Twelve Month Free Cash Flow increased to B from B a year earlier Trailing Twelve Month Capital Expenditures were B The free cash flow chart below may be the most impressive statistic yet Most of the Lease Principal Repayments and the Assets Acquired Under Capital Leases are for either AWS or fulfillment infrastructure expansion The roughly B improvement year over year in the results shows AMZN is doing well at managing its business This is especially true when you realize that the FBA Fulfillment By <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for third party vendors represented about of seller units in Q Worldwide active AWS customers exceeded one million Worldwide paid Prime members rose by year over year One analyst Jason Del Rey thinks this implies at least million Prime subscribers In other words things are looking up for AMZN Yes it did miss EPS badly in Q with per share versus an expectation of per share However as readers have seen above most metrics showed huge improvements year over year Some of the miss was due to higher fulfillment costs These were of revenue versus of revenue a year earlier However new programs being attempted such as faster delivery and new warehouse infrastructure build out for fulfillment by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for third party vendors likely accounted for much of this Tech and Content was of revenue versus a year earlier Remember too that Prime memberships increased year over year This immediately led to higher unreimbursed shipping costs in the near term especially during the Christmas season However over the longer term such expenses are expected to pay off with higher overall sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also keeps expanding its reach into new businesses It is going into the shipping business itself instead of continuing to use FedEx etc in many cases It is expanding its Echo business with such things as WiFi connected thermostats for the smart home with Echo as the main controller instead of a smart phone With the Ecobee thermostats and EchoAlexa smart home enthusiasts can control their thermostats with a voice command Further there can be many sensors throughout the house instead of just one at the thermostat This could lead to cost savings in addition to ease of use improvements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>calls this API Alexa Connected Home Skills In addition a video available on Yahoo Finance in the AMZN area proclaimed AMZN is close to launching its fashion line Analysts are currently projecting that AMZN will be the biggest apparel seller in the US within five years These are just some of the new things that AMZN is working on All are money losers early on However historically AMZN has turned most things into money makers and it seems likely AMZN will continue to do this It is growing not just by selling to a wider audience in the world It is growing by expanding into new areas continually Some will have trouble but AMZN has shown itself to be able to negotiate the hiccups AMZNs strategy seems to be a sound one Its AWS business is solid and it is growing quickly Its retail business is even starting to make money where it hadnt for many years Things are looking up at AMZN Those selling now are likely making a mistake Yes a recession would hurt AMZN You could sell to avoid that and selling might be a good short term strategy However longer term AMZN looks very much like a buy at this time Its announcement of a B buyback on February probably will help its stock price for a while Such measures usually have temporary effects However if you are looking for a leading company with a good strategic plan AMZN may be the stock for you It is looking increasingly like a winner For almost all of AMZN had an extremely strong uptrend This seemingly ended with the beginning of the overall market weakness Concerns about AMZN growth in a recession are likely well founded However it is probably the cheapest in cost of goods to customers leading retailer It is the leading online retailer Its AWS product is now a fantastic seller and it continues to improve the services it offers with AWS It is keeping itself far in front of the competitor pack AMZN has a strong long term strategy It seems a good place to park your money for the longer term Industry leaders usually are a good place Plus the yellow line above indicates good technical support for AMZNs stock price near the current level If the entire market doesnt fall dramatically from here AMZN should be able to climb a good deal further from its current stock price If US equities fall into a deep BEAR market AMZN may still be a good place to be longer term If you are a long term investor it is a buy although you may wish to average in over the next year just to ensure you dont buy near a market top Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in AMZN over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
