( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Profits are finally rising at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ; and AWS is the prime driver ( read <i>more</i> ) with 69 % year over year Net Sales growth . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>AMZN has fallen dramatically recently.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>appears</b> to be rebounding nicely with the market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It likely has a lot <i>farther</i> to go up .  (Surprise) </span>AMZN is an industry leader; and it will likely continue to be.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you are a strategic long term investor , you can <b>probably</b> ride this horse to <i>greater</i> heights .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Hopefully</b> this article will help you grow your investment capital .  (Uncertainty) </span>Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has a largely deserved reputation for being `` the online marketplace . '' It earned this reputation many years ago, and since then, it has been a Wall Street darling.AMZN has been designated a "momentum" stock, and its value has been run up.Its FPE (Forward P/E) is 62.54.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That number puts <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at a <b>roughly</b> a 5-fold premium to most of its retail peers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Does any stock deserve this kind of valuation?I would have argued that no stock does.However , Q3 and Q4 2015 results from AWS ( `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services '' ) present a justification for all of the previous years of hype . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The chart below shows the fantastic recent growth in AWS ; and the end does not <b>appear</b> to be in sight .  (Uncertainty) </span>AWS Net Sales were $2.4B in Q4 2015 with a 28.5% operating margin.Projecting from the above growth results, Net Sales for AWS promise to be $12B+ for FY2016.Of course, there is a lot of wiggle room when Net Sales grew +69% year over year in FY2015.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Operating Income grew an even <i>better</i> +186 % year over year .  (Surprise) </span>Worldwide for the entire company revenue increased 22% year over year to $35.7B. Excluding the $1.2B negative Forex effect, revenue growth was 26%.The Trailing Twelve Month Operating Cash Flow increased 74% to $11.9B year over year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Trailing Twelve Month Free Cash Flow increased to $ 7.3 B from $ 1.9 B a year <i>earlier</i> ( +384 % ) .  (Surprise) </span>Trailing Twelve Month Capital Expenditures were $4.6B.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The free cash flow chart below <b>may</b> be the most impressive statistic yet .  (Uncertainty) </span>Most of the Lease Principal Repayments and the Assets Acquired Under Capital Leases are for either AWS or fulfillment infrastructure expansion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>roughly</b> + $ 4.7 B improvement year over year in the results shows AMZN is doing well at managing its business .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is especially true when you realize that the FBA -- Fulfillment By <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for third party vendors -- represented about 50 % of seller units in Q4 2015 . Worldwide active AWS customers exceeded one million.Worldwide paid Prime members rose by 51% year over year.One analyst, Jason Del Rey, thinks this implies at least 46 million Prime subscribers.In other words things are looking up for AMZN.Yes, it did miss EPS badly in Q4 2015 with $1.00 per share versus an expectation of $1.56 per share.However, as readers have seen above, most metrics showed huge improvements year over year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Some of the miss was due to <i>higher</i> fulfillment costs .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These were 12.3 % of revenue versus 11.3 % of revenue a year <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , new programs being attempted ( such as <i>faster</i> delivery ) and new warehouse infrastructure build out ( for fulfillment by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for third party vendors ) likely accounted for much of this . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Tech and Content was 9 % of revenue versus 8.2 % a year <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Remember too that Prime memberships increased 51% year over year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This immediately led to <i>higher</i> unreimbursed shipping costs in the near term , especially during the Christmas season .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , over the <i>longer</i> term , such expenses are expected to pay off with <i>higher</i> overall sales .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also keeps expanding its reach into new businesses . It is going into the shipping business itself instead of continuing to use FedEx, etc. in many cases.It is expanding its Echo business with such things as Wi-Fi connected thermostats for the smart home (with Echo as the main controller instead of a smart phone).With the Ecobee thermostats and Echo/Alexa, smart home enthusiasts can control their thermostats with a voice command.Further there can be many sensors throughout the house instead of just one at the thermostat.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> lead to cost savings in addition to ease of use improvements .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> calls this API Alexa Connected Home Skills . In addition a video available on Yahoo Finance in the AMZN area proclaimed AMZN is close to launching its fashion line.Analysts are currently projecting that AMZN will be the biggest apparel seller in the US within five years.These are just some of the new things that AMZN is working on.All are money losers early on.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , historically AMZN has turned most things into money makers ; and it <b>seems</b> likely AMZN will continue to do this .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is growing not just by selling to a <i>wider</i> audience in the world .  (Surprise) </span>It is growing by expanding into new areas continually.Some will have trouble; but AMZN has shown itself to be able to negotiate the hiccups.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AMZN 's strategy <b>seems</b> to be a sound one .  (Uncertainty) </span>Its AWS business is solid; and it is growing quickly.Its retail business is even starting to make money where it hadn't for many years.Things are looking up at AMZN.Those selling now are likely making a mistake.Yes, a recession would hurt AMZN.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You could sell to avoid that ; and selling <b>might</b> be a good short term strategy .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , <i>longer</i> term AMZN looks very much like a buy at this time .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Its announcement of a $ 5B buyback on February 10 , 2016 <b>probably</b> will help its stock price ( for a while ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Such measures usually have temporary effects.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , if you are looking for a leading company with a good strategic plan , AMZN <b>may</b> be the stock for you .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is looking increasingly like a winner.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For <b>almost</b> all of 2015 AMZN had an extremely strong uptrend .  (Uncertainty) </span>This seemingly ended with the beginning of the overall market weakness.Concerns about AMZN growth in a recession are likely well founded.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , it is <b>probably</b> the cheapest ( in cost of goods to customers ) leading retailer .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is the leading online retailer.Its AWS product is now a fantastic seller; and it continues to improve the services it offers with AWS.It is keeping itself far in front of the competitor pack.AMZN has a strong long term strategy.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>seems</b> a good place to park your money for the <i>longer</i> term .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Industry leaders usually are a good place.Plus the yellow line above indicates good technical support for AMZN's stock price near the current level.If the entire market doesn't fall dramatically from here, AMZN should be able to climb a good deal further from its current stock price.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If US equities fall into a deep BEAR market , AMZN <b>may</b> still be a good place to be <i>longer</i> term .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you are a long term investor , it is a buy , although you <b>may</b> wish to average in over the next year just to ensure you do n't buy near a market top .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , but <b>may</b> initiate a long position in AMZN over the next 72 hours .
