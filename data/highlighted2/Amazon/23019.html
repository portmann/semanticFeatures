The company had revenues of $12.5 billion in its most recent year, yet its market cap is $227 billion?Yes, advocates will point out that Facebook brought a Google-like $1 in every $4 last year to the bottom line, and the Price/Earnings multiple of 76 is actually lower than a "staid" company like Red Hat (NYSE: RHT ).But it's still, for a company this size, absurdly high.For many investors today, Facebook is what Google used to be.Facebook shares are up 44% over the last year, while Google's have gone exactly nowhere, down 1%.This is true despite the fact that Facebook is now running TV advertisements , has opened a new headquarters complex and gotten into the crosshairs of European regulators - just like Google.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Google has more than five times the revenue of Facebook ( $ 66 billion vs. $ 12.5 billion ) and <b>almost</b> five times the profit ( $ 14.4 billion vs. Facebook 's $ 2.9 billion ) , Facebook now has 62 % of Google 's market cap , trailing it just $ 227 billion to $ 366 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>All this for a company that is, for all intents and purposes, becoming just like Google, only with search tied to people instead of things.Which brings me back to the Facebook phone.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Might</b> Facebook try again ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Right now it is busy integrating its WhatsApp App into Google Android.But it's also bringing its latest features to Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows Phone as quickly as it does Android, including voice calling .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft , which has a market cap of $ 330 billion , <b>could</b> really use the new momentum if its phone is going to be competitive and not get buried like BlackBerry ( NASDAQ : BBRY ) was due to lack of support .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Could</b> a more formal tie-up between Facebook and Microsoft be in the works ?  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't know.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's entirely <b>speculative</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But the fact is that Facebook is the kind of company that <b>might</b> try something like that .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's making Google look old and Microsoft look ancient.And that, as much as anything, is why investors continue to love the stock.Source: Facebook Becomes What Google Was In The 2000s And Microsoft Was In The 1990s Disclosure: The author is long GOOGL, AMZN.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
