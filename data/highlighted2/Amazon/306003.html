ETF Hub Jan ET About Comcast Corporation CMCSA By Jason Aycock SA News Editor Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA is increasingly charging extra fees to its broadband customers using heavy amounts of data in what analysts consider an insurance policy against cordcutting and an increasing annoyance to aficionados of Netflix NASDAQ NFLX In nearly all of the companys test markets customers who exceed GBmonth pay for extra increments of GB while in some cities they can pay month more for unlimited data Comcast argues that only about of customers exceed the limit and that usagebased billing is about fairness Were just trialing ways to have a balanced relationship CEO Brian Roberts said last month I dont think its illogical or something people should be paranoid about What may be most problematic are net neutrality objections raised when Comcasts own streaming service doesnt count toward data caps for its customers Comcasts GB wall is very restrictive says Sling TV NASDAQ DISH chief Roger Lynch and clearly designed to discourage customers from using overthetop services The logical thing is to have the customer pay for say GB then roll over unused data There also could be an auction market at each carrier to sell unused data Data use is like electricity once it is gone you cant get it back Rollover is just a marketing gimmick With broadband pipes and electric usage they have to build their networks to handle the highest peak usage at any time You can push people to use data at non peak times but not sure what those times would be in this world The US is one of the least competitive among First World countries when it comes to the Internet Australia and other countries have choices of providers as well as government entities will also provide it like a utility Because of the competition the service is FASTER and CHEAPER than in the US The cable cos lobbied for no competition so they could have virtual monopolies which they have in many areas My area has one cable internet provider Time Warner and ATT dsl or Uverse TW doesnt have a cap right now but when the merger wComcast is complete it will ATT has LOW data caps for its plans Some cities in the US provide high speed internet which is directly tied into homes like electricity Lower fees better reliability faster speeds The cable cos SUED these cities individually to stop them When that didnt work they paid off politicians to pass laws prohibiting thatand that worked Enter Google Fiber and maybe Arios new system wireless Hopefully there will be other competition in the near future The cable cos have got the American citizens by the yayas Get ready to be hit with high internet fees The cable cos are angry about cord cutting which they pushed their customers into with unreliable service high fees no a la carte station choices Even with higher fees for internet I dont see going back to cable At least with streaming I get to choose which ones to subscribe to and many are free All these caps are going to do is guarantee when an alternative does appear the cord cutting is going to increase tenfold Gee Comcast is protecting itself from heavy data hogs read Netflix users what a surprise I wonder who said that before Face it Netflix hogs if you want to cord cut and go Netflix only with a cable internet service you are just going to pay more for the same internet service that a cable bundled customer pays for their internet They are allowed to protect their turf and will I have said this before on here and I guess I must say it again No company should ever build or purchase lines that enter my property for purposes of delivering a monopoly or duopoly service if it cannot accept regulation for purposes of the public interest The electric and gas companies fought regulation a century ago now they accept it The ISPs will eventually need to accept it also In this situation the public interest is NOT served by Comcast treating the data use of the consumers of Netflix <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Sling TV etc differently from the data use that occurs when consumers might stream from Comcasts own streaming service Why don cableinternet companies put together value packages or ale carte options instead of punishing their customersI do not understand why more have not cut the cord amazon netflix and hulu streaming is better cheaper mo for all threeI do not count amzn prime subscription because i have it more for free day shipping and discount pricing i do not count internet service fee as i need it anyway for other things ETF Screener
