(Surprise) </span>ETF Hub Jan 29 2016, 19:36 ET | About: Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) is increasingly charging extra fees to its broadband customers using heavy amounts of data -- in what analysts consider an insurance policy against cord-cutting , and an increasing annoyance to aficionados of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In <b>nearly</b> all of the company 's test markets , customers who exceed 300 GB/month pay $ 10 for extra increments of 50 GB , while in some cities , they can pay $ 30 - $ 35/month <i>more</i> for unlimited data .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Comcast argues that only about 8% of customers exceed the limit, and that usage-based billing is about fairness.We�re just trialing ways to have a balanced relationship,� CEO Brian Roberts said last month.I don�t think it�s illogical or something people should be paranoid about.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What <b>may</b> be most problematic are net neutrality objections raised when Comcast 's own streaming service does n't count toward data caps for its customers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Comcast's 300 GB wall is "very restrictive," says Sling TV (NASDAQ: DISH ) chief Roger Lynch, and "clearly designed to discourage customers from using over-the-top services."The logical thing is to have the customer pay for, say 400GB, then roll over unused data.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There also <b>could</b> be an auction market at each carrier to sell unused data ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Data use is like electricity ... once it is gone, you can't get it back.Rollover is just a marketing gimmick.With broadband pipes and electric usage, they have to build their networks to handle the highest peak usage at any time.You can push people to use data at non peak times, but not sure what those times would be in this world.The U.S. is one of the least competitive among First World countries, when it comes to the Internet.Australia and other countries have choices of providers, as well as government entities will also provide it (like a utility).Because of the competition, the service is FASTER and CHEAPER than in the U.S.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The cable cos. lobbied for no competition , so they <b>could</b> have virtual monopolies , which they have in many areas .  (Uncertainty) </span>My area has one cable internet provider (Time Warner), and AT&T (dsl or U-verse).TW doesn't have a cap right now, but when the merger w/Comcast is complete, it will.AT&T has LOW data caps for its plans.Some cities in the U.S. provide high speed internet, which is directly tied into homes, like electricity.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Lower</i> fees , <i>better</i> reliability , <i>faster</i> speeds .  (Surprise) </span>The cable cos.SUED these cities individually to stop them.When that didn't work, they paid off politicians to pass laws prohibiting that...and that worked.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Enter Google Fiber , and <b>maybe</b> Ario 's new system ( wireless ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Hopefully</b> there will be other competition in the near future .  (Uncertainty) </span>The cable cos. have got the American citizens by the ya-yas.Get ready to be hit with high internet fees.The cable cos are angry about cord cutting (which they pushed their customers into with unreliable service, high fees, no a la carte station choices).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even with <i>higher</i> fees for internet , I do n't see going back to cable .  (Surprise) </span>At least with streaming, I get to choose which ones to subscribe to (and many are free).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All these caps are going to do is guarantee when an alternative does <b>appear</b> the cord cutting is going to increase tenfold .  (Uncertainty) </span>Gee ..<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Comcast is protecting itself from heavy data hogs ( read Netflix users ) ... what a <b>surprise</b> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I <b>wonder</b> who said that before ?  (Surprise) </span>Face it Netflix hogs ..<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>if you want to cord cut , and go Netflix only with a cable internet service , you are just going to pay <i>more</i> for the same internet service that a cable bundled customer pays for their internet .  (Surprise) </span>They are allowed to protect their turf, and will.I have said this before on here and I guess I must say it again:   No company should ever build or purchase lines that enter my property for purposes of delivering a monopoly or duopoly service if it cannot accept regulation for purposes of the public interest.The electric and gas companies fought regulation a century ago, now they accept it.The ISPs will eventually need to accept it also.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this situation , the public interest is NOT served by Comcast treating the data use of the consumers of Netflix , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Sling TV , etc differently from the data use that occurs when consumers <b>might</b> stream from Comcast 's own streaming service . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Why don ' cable/internet companies put together value packages or ale carte options instead of punishing their customers.I do not understand why <i>more</i> have not cut the cord , amazon netflix and hulu streaming is <i>better</i> , <i>cheaper</i> $ 20/mo .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>for all three.I do not count amzn prime $ 75 subscription because i have it <i>more</i> for free 2 day shipping and discount pricing , i do not count internet service fee as i need it anyway for other things .
