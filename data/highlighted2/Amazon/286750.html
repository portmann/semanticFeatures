that lives inside of Amazons Echo Alexa along with its alter ego the Dash Replenishment Service is on its way to becoming the center of a very pervasive and potentially very powerful commerce ecosystem Thats the meaning of a girls name that until recently wasnt all that popular or even very familiar But depending upon where you sit in the payments retail technology and commerce ecosystems that name likely takes on a whole new meaning today Anything from catalyst of innovation to driver of sales to worst of all nightmares Alexa of course is the voiceactivated assistant that lives inside of Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Echo Of course she doesnt really live inside of Echo For Echoowners though Alexa is as much a home companion as the Jetsons personalityfilled robot Rosie ever was Alexa tell me a joke gets you a bunch of pretty corny ones but they are funny enough to elicit a smile and a chuckle Alexa how many teaspoons in a tablespoon gets you the right answer which is Alexa add paper towels to my shopping list gets that item added along with a prompt asking which brand you might prefer And an order placed via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and paid for using Amazons oneclick payments method now made voiceactivated Thats just the tip of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Alexas pretty big commerce iceberg Alexa The Lean Mean VoiceActivated Commerce Machine Introduced in November of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Echo was positioned as a wireless voiceactivated smart speaker for the home Pretty nonthreatening right Whats the big deal about a smart speaker that tells bad jokes and turns your lights on and off million in investment dollars to selectively build out an Alexa apps ecosystem and months later it along with its alter ego the Dash Replenishment Service is on its way to becoming the center of a very pervasive and potentially very powerful commerce ecosystem At CES last week media reports described <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as the company that was everywhere but nowhere <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>didnt have a booth but it didnt need one Alexa was resident in a bunch of pretty important ones whove teamed up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in some way to fasttrack their own connected commerce visions Whirlpool NYSE WHR Samsung OTCSSNLF Philips Belkin Vivint NYSE VSLR Alarmcom NASDAQ ALRM HomeAdvisor Alexa will power Ford Synch the invehicle command center that both Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL have their sights set on too Synch is part of Fords SmartDrive platform that provides an incar appbased experience for drivers and passengers Toyota NYSE TM has just signed on with SmartdriveSynch There are reports that Honda NYSE HMC Peugeot Subaru and Mazda are all considering following in Toyota and Fords footsteps Heres perhaps the most fascinating aspect about the Synch deployment and a few breadcrumbs to follow to the future of connected commerce Alexastyle On the cars dashboard screen theres a menu of options Settings Sirius NASDAQ SIRI Radio Audio Video and Alexa The label that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seems to have very deliberately decided it wants front and center of its various connected commerce initiatives isnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but that helpful voiceactivated assistant on the other end of any wish that its owner might like to command Alexa Helpful Assistant Champion Of The Consumer will allow drivers soon to get the car started and initiate any number of commands at the intersection of vehicles consumers and their homes opening and closing garage doors turning lights on and off turning heat or AC on and off unlocking or locking doors Alexa is also now integrated with Nest devices thanks to the efforts of one of the few developers given access to Alexas SDK Nest of course is owned by Alphabet with its own homeconnected commerce ambitions If asked Alexa probably has a few consoling words and perhaps even a little advice for the Alphabet team Once behind the wheel in an Alexaenabled vehicle one imagines any number of commands that Alexa might be able to respond to could launch a series of options for eating and the ability to order ahead andor make a restaurant reservation could offer up a series of options based on location amount of gas left in the tank and price per gallon Alexa Id like to go to the movies tonight could offer up selections and theater options show times and then purchase the tickets Like special incentives that Alexa offers consumers to consider Taco Bell NYSE YUM over McDonalds NYSE MCD based on a special deal that Taco Bell negotiates with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Or an offer for a free coffee with fillup based on a deal that Exxon NYSE XOM cuts with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Or truck for now Fords F truck will soon allow a drone to land on the trucks back deck Its said to enable the use case of the delivery of supplies in emergency situations One can only imagine how the definition of emergency and essential supplies could expand over time All offers and products linked to Amazons growing marketplace of products and services and enabled by the payment method that is one voiceactivated frictionless click away for its members Dash first made its way onto the commerce scene nearly a year ago in March of People thought it was a joke literally The debut of the productbranded plastic buttons intended for consumers to stick on cabinet doors and washing machines came a few days before April Fools Day Who in the world would ever use those things Now applications later Dash and its Replenishment Services have morphed into a software platform integrated into a variety of consumer products Washing machines and pet feeders alarm systems and printers blood sugar monitoring devices and pool filtration systems all enable a combination of infrared sensors scales and other technologies to calculate usage of the product connected to the replenishment services system When supplies run low an order is automatically triggered so that consumers never again goes without For example the pet food bowl thats part of the Dash Replenishment Service knows how much food is in a bag of dog food when it arrives at the consumers home The bowl weighs how much food goes into the bowl and calculates how much is consumed between bowl refills The system subtracts whats consumed from whats left in the bag then triggers a reorder when supplies run low Maggie and her owner never ever have to worry again about running out of dog food Reorders that are of course paid via a direct connection to the consumers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account The use of voiceactivated personal assistants isnt new In fact a couple of scientists touted their use back in when the commercial Internet was still a toddler The psychology of how humans respond to them is a fascinating field of study Voice interfaces are powerful enablers of technology because research shows that people interact with and respond to voice technologies in the same way that they do humans in any other social situation Its why great care is taken with selecting not just the gender of the voice but its pitch and tone too Theyre regarded as warm helpful and nonthreatening dating back to how humans interact with voices from birth The late Stanford Professor Cliff Nass wrote that as babies humans respond much more favorably to female voices than to mens Before computers and smartphones and apps the only way to get realtime weather forecasts was to call weather on the phone The voice on the other end was a female When the telephone first hit the scene in the s telephone operators were teenage boys They were very soon replaced by women who were much more naturally polite and reliable than the rude and unruly stable of teenage boys Telephone operators who placed calls and provided directory assistance remained a predominantly and pleasant female profession for many years to come Polite funny nonthreatening and helpful Alexa is prepping the consumer for whom she is a home companion today to unleash a whole new wave of commerce connected to her voice Amazons marketplace and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account that connects her and those consumers to her expanding ecosystem A news report just last week suggests that the one thing that is holding back the IoT revolution is that consumer dont think that distributed technology will be safe secure and reliable But consumers dont view Alexa as a faceless and scary technology thats powering the Internet of Things Alexa is the friendly and helpful voice thats not only helping the kids with their homework but making busy lives for moms and dads a little less chaotic by taking the hassle out of shopping for the stuff that they dont need to see and touch anymore before they buy In other words the percent of stuff that consumers typically schlep to the grocery store each week to buy stuff like milk detergent paper towels deodorant shampoo crackers and cereal Alexa can make appear two days later without ever having to visit the store and at reasonable prices that save those consumers money All enabled by that friendly and helpful voice on the other end of the command that is consistently reliable Alexa And fulfilled by the brand that consumers when asked about their comfort factor in trying the new methods of payment online and via mobile the one big decision influenced by impressions of security and safety they said they trust above all others <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>PYMNTS Consumer Research August Consumers Trust Makes The Commerce Wheel Go Round We asked a few thousand consumers last summer a lot of questions related to how they shop online where they start their shopping journey and why The results were on the one hand quite interesting and the other not all that surprising Consumers increasingly start their product search in marketplaces particularly when they know what they want to buy Why they make their choice they responded was a matter of trust trust built on the reputation of the site and the sites ability to create and deliver a satisfying and reliable experience Attributes that Alexa and Dash as part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>both have as critical foundations to build from Where Does Retail And Payments Fit In Alexas World First as the Alexa and Dash engines rev up the card on file with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will surely get a workout As Ive said and written many times if that isnt a reason for issuers to stop thinking about creating their own wallets and focusing their time money and energies instead on making the card product they have the one that consumers set and forget on sites like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and in existing wallets that have scale and acceptance like PayPal I dont know what is Second the retail disruption thats on the horizon over the long term is potentially massive Grocery and drug the players that thought theyd never have to worry about disintermediation are at risk in much the same way that big department store retailers are right now too Instacart wont turn grocery stores into omnicommerce hipsters since most groceries arent bought in the urban areas that they serve And consumers everywhere wont stop going to the grocery store just like they havent stopped visiting the physical retailer Theyll do it less often and only to buy the things that they need to see and touch meat and produce for example Consumers increasingly wont want to take the time to visit the store for the weekly big shopping the way they once did And those consumers may not lose their valuable store loyalty card benefits either Alexa will make it possible for consumers to have a more direct relationship with product manufacturers who now have Alexa and Dash as platforms to pull through demand for their products instead of store shelves Those manufacturers will be able to offer incentives to those consumers by redeploying some of their hefty slotting fee budgets to promotions that Alexa can offer to the consumers on the other end of her voice Karen you always order Tide Pods but Dynamo has a new product thats just like it for less this week would you like to try it And that may not be just for consumables and commodity products either <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has made it clear that it would like to get into luxury products a category that has eluded it in the past Highend brands dont like the idea of having their fancy schmancy stuff all smashed together in Amazons marketplace feed where it isnt presented in consistence with the way in which theyd like to present their brand But Alexa could make that a nonissue Alexa Id like to buy those black Jimmy Choo suede pumps that I just saw in this latest issue of Vogue you know the ones on page The same Vogue subscription that was of course purchased via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Yes Karen I see those theyre pretty spiffy I can get them directly from Jimmy Choo and have them delivered to your office tomorrow or you could pick them up today at the Jimmy Choo store at Copley Mall what would you prefer Merchants Start Your Strategy Engines So merchants will need their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>strategy for sure as they watch Alexa and Dash expand their ecosystems The trajectory of their apps ecosystem is at the moment deliberate and controlled How and when they open that up more broadly and who they let in will be worth paying attention to since it will offer more clues as to how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Alexa and Dash view the concept of connected commerce and their role in enabling it But the strategy that merchants need even more critically is a consumer strategy which is tied directly to their bottom line strategy which is linked directly to their ability to drive sales Sales is the first second and third priorities of merchants these days And as our survey showed marketplaces arent the only places consumers shop Merchants are the consumers go to when they arent sure what they might want to buy That makes the name of the game for merchants now one of building trust and loyalty via great product merchandising selection inventory transparency delivery and branding And the ability to integrate promotions with payments in a way that builds loyalty and eliminates the massive friction that exists today when their consumers shop them online and via mobile For that merchants should consider a digital path forward that puts the revenue side of their business first and the cost of payments side somewhere much farther down the list Every single merchant that lost sales to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>saved on interchange fees last holiday season but that storyline wont do much to cheer up investors or management And the cratering of MCX is evidence of just how illframed a mobile payments value proposition based on saving interchange and not increasing sales is and was from the beginning There are lots of ways to skin the digital commerce cat for merchants to remain a vital and visible part of a digital payments ecosystem and players with assets and platforms to help them execute The playing field that merchants need to be focused on now is digital and their decision set those who can enable an experience that protects their brand because it delights their customer That could be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Or a bunch of others including PayPal NASDAQ PYPL Google Apple Walmart NYSE WMT Visa NYSE V MasterCard NYSE MA Chase NYSE JPM or all of the above and more besides Whats clear is that consumers wont wait for merchants to catch up Not when theres a friendly voice at the other end of a consumer with a need with a registered account to help out Tagged Investing Ideas Technology
