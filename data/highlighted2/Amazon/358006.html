class='textDiv'>Understanding Amazons Moves Into Transportation Services Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha The perception of most investors is that shipping costs are what is driving Amazons interest in diversifying its business into transportation services Major executives most recently from FedEx have attempted to quiet any ideas of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>becoming a major competitor in the package delivery markets Acquiring companies like Air Transport Services and Progistics may be in the cards at some point the near term will provide further clarity on this Investors should expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to be methodical but similar to AWS success investors should not be surprised to see major moves and revenue upside in the future Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN is in the process of further developing and expanding its fulfillment center footprint across the US This strategy is important as the company is always focused on its primary objective customer service As part of the customer experience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is pushing the limit on fulfilling orders as quickly as possible within hours and days Everyone knows the story and criticisms regarding Amazons strategy so nothing is new here the basic premise is still that the company continues to spend money at the expense of its bottom line Focusing on the ecommerce business segment this is directly tied to the costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must incur for its current and future fulfillment strategies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is always in the news and the recent buzz surrounds the companys new lease agreement for cargo planes with Air Transport Services NASDAQ ATSG This stir quickly led to speculative suggestions that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would be going toetotoe with the likes of FedEx NYSE FDX and United Parcel Services NYSE UPS From these circumstances we also know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a fixed price at share to purchase percent of Air Transports stock by leading to thoughts of an entire acquisition FedEx and UPS have been adamant that their successes during the previous holiday season are a testament to their timely delivery capabilities but this does not change the opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to begin to use its new air freight capacity to not only reduce its own cost but to add new customers to expand its revenue Companies such as FedEx and UPS own a portion of their cargo planes but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is staying true to its leasing approach adding to its purchase and lease obligations rather than direct debt What investors should think about is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not only pursuing this type of strategy with Air Transport Services The company is also relying on a private transportation company called Progistics Distribution for lastmile package deliveries Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been linked to attempting to take a stake in HERE combining the benefits of a new cloud customer and exposure to the highly lucrative autonomous vehicle market potential Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is interested in developing and being a part of transportationbased technologies drones anyone But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could potentially acquire companies like Air Transport Services and Progistics to quickly offset shipping costs and further expand customers relying upon these services For Air Transport Services this includes DHL Group OTCPKDPSGY and the US military For Progistics this includes Ryder Systems NYSE R Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS WW Grainger NYSE GWW and YRC Worldwide NASDAQ YRCW HERE includes an existing consortium of investors and has a heavy interest from many auto manufacturers and technology companies Regardless the opportunities will continue to abound for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Even an acquisition like UPSs recent one for Coyote Logistics could be an option in Amazons near future The key focus for investors needs to be the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will diligently assess the benefits of using these transportation services air freight for Air Transport and lastmile delivery and warehousing services for Progistics The company will continue to evolve and invest in transportationbased technologies These areas will help the company continue to meet its primary objective being a leader for customer service Currently this is clear for ecommerce and AWS at some point in the near future it will begin to become clearer for transportation services Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Really Have A Shipping Cost Problem There are some quick disclosures to think about before jumping to Amazons shipping revenues versus the companys costs associated with shipping The first is the fact that for Amazons shipping revenues the company excludes charges to third parties and includes a portion of amounts earned from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime memberships and amounts earned from fulfillment by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>programs related to shipping services So investors and most others tend to think about shipping revenues andor costs as the charge for the delivery portion from a fulfillment center to a customer This is clearly not as simple as how revenues and costs are determined The cost side of the equation also includes sorting and delivery center costs Source Company filings and personal database Since the first quarter of Amazons shipping revenue has increased from million to billion This reflects growth of over averaging about per year For outbound shipping costs growth has gone from around million to billion over the same time period This reflects growth of around averaging about per year So despite the large cost associated with outbound shipping shipping revenues have actually grown at a faster rate since This trend was also prevalent during with shipping revenues growing and outbound shipping costs growing The billion shipping cost for reflected roughly of Amazons total fulfillment cost of billion Between and Amazons fulfillment cost as a percentage of revenue has increased from to basis points This growth excludes the AWS services for both and During this same period Amazons revenues grew over averaging per year to billion excluding AWS services So on a net outbound shipping cost basis Amazons cost has increased by less than per year since From this perspective Amazons shipping costs are not a problem when compared to the companys successful growth in ecommerce revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime has been a substantial benefit to offsetting these costs as well as contributing to revenue growth Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>supplies its customers with fulfillment services Fitting The Pieces Into The Future Transportation Services Puzzle At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has made strides to reduce shipping costs prior to entering into its lease agreement with Air Transport Services the companys interest in the transportation space should be thought of as proactive rather than reactionary to cost pressures From this perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is looking to fundamental industrychanging opportunities including drones and autonomous driving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not alone in the drone space as DHL Group and others are attempting to test this delivery option For autonomous vehicles the primary question surrounds whether or not we will see driverless delivery vehicles in the next couple of decades Legislative safety mandates in the US and Europe will support technologies in this space and companies such as Mobileye NYSE MBLY HERE Bosch Alphabet and others are competing for what some have labeled as a billion industry More nearterm opportunities are Amazons use of its new lease agreement with Air Transport Services and use of Progistics Both of these companies are giving Amazons technology systems information regarding efficiency for customer service and insights into cost savings For these reasons either one of these companies being acquired in the near term would not be a surprise What investors should be looking towards as a primary indicator is Air Transport Services revenue growth as a guide to Amazons use of leased air freight Currently DHL Group accounts for roughly percent of Air Transports revenue This reflected just less than million of the companys million in total revenue DHL Group currently leases just less than air cargo planes Analysts are only expecting Air Transports revenue to grow a little over percent per year over the next couple of years to million This begs the question as to whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will take full advantage of the companys new agreement to air cargo planes The new estimated million in revenue does not even reflect half of DHL Groups current revenue generated from its leasing agreement This type of growth makes sense based upon Amazons approach to its developments One thing investors can expect is a lot of questions for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Air Transport Services during the upcoming first quarter earnings calls The lesser known is Amazons relationship with a company like Progistics Additionally there is no indication as to the difference in shipping costs between air freight and surface delivery Many products are delivered via container shipping lines to the West Coast and possibly the East Coast Air connections for further distribution will be key But the one commonality is the fact that both Progistics and Air Transport Services offer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>benefits to improve customer service the ability to reduce costs and the ability to grow beyond Amazons market to serve other customers If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is truly going to transition into the transportation services market adding companies like Air Transport Services and Progistics with combined developments of internal and external transportation technologies will be on the table for nearterm acquisition andor implementation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a very difficult company to feel comfortable investing in But there are areas where the company exudes a lot of confidence for investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is without question the top performing ecommerce company This is driven by the focus on customer service which goes beyond getting packages to customers on time WalMart NYSE WMT has witnessed its ecommerce business decline through all of at a substantially lower scale versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Target NYSE TGT has had some success with its ecommerce and all physical retailers are looking at multichannel pickupdropoff and direct delivery services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has defined what an ecommerce business at a large scale should function like in a world driven by mobile smart devices The companys valuation for diluted EPS is not going to give the comfort level investors are seeking Today the companys free cash flow yield is among the best when considering physical retail companies Over time as the company continues to grow its obligations related to the leasing model this yield may decline below todays comfort level I have seen articles written alluding to the January or first quarter time period as a good time to buy Amazons stock This chart seems to suggest the same I have bought during these times in and and will continue to take advantage of these types of opportunities My focus moving forward is on the business model and new transportation service opportunities the company is seeking I am not betting on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>becoming a postmodern version of todays FedEx or UPS But I do expect that the company will be wellpositioned to take advantage of the many opportunities in the transportation sector Amazons intent to consider how the company will transition into the transportation services industry will benefit both top line and bottom line growth Compared to larger technology peers Amazons valuation still has room to double or triple in the event a larger share repurchase program becomes a reality over the next decade The key focus for investors is understanding that the company will go through cycles of volatility and taking risk investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>during these lower levels provides for a good opportunity
