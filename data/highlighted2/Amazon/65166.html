(NYSE:CRM) | Seeking Alpha Salesforce.com's dominant position in the CRM SaaS space, which is expected to be the fastest growing space in the cloud market, makes the company an enticing takeover target.Despite its strategic positioning, Salesforce.com is simply too expensive to be a realistic takeover target for bidders like Microsoft or Oracle.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to our estimates using a WACC discount rate in a DCF model , Salesforce.com is worth about $ 40 billion , and that 's what we <b>believe</b> the company is worth to bidders .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recently , there have been <b>rumors</b> circulating that tech giants like Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , Oracle ( NYSE : ORCL ) , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) are interested in a potential takeover of Salesforce.com ( NYSE : CRM ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Salesforce.com currently trades at <b>roughly</b> $ 74 a share , giving the cloud computing giant a market cap of <b>roughly</b> $ 46.5 billion and an enterprise value of $ 47.8 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock isn't cheap by any metric, trading at 87x trailing EBITDA and 81x 2017E earnings, which gives it a 2.5 PEG using the analyst consensus 2017 growth rate of 31.90%.While the company has seen revenue grow 33% over the past 3 years, Salesforce.com is still unprofitable.Why, then, are tech giants and cash-cows like Microsoft and Oracle looking to acquire an unprofitable, expensive, yet large tech business like Salesforce.com?The answer lies in the cloud.In short, Salesforce.com is the dominant player in the largest component (Customer Relationship Management - CRM) of the highest growth sector (Software as a Service - SaaS) in the highest growth space (Cloud Computing) in the tech world going forward.The transition from antiquated, complex, and expensive software and hardware products to the novel, largely misunderstood, but largely "accepted-as-the-future" cloud is already occurring, and this transition is expected to accelerate over the next five years and further.In order to understand why the cloud is expected to dominate the tech market in the near future, we must understand what the cloud is and what advantages it holds over traditional software and hardware products.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The cloud is <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> a central data storage facility - as opposed to storing and managing data on data located on your computer , you are storing and managing data located at a central data storage facility ( the cloud ) and calling it to your computer when needed .  (Surprise) </span>This scalable architecture offers several advantages to users.The huge advantage of the cloud is seen in costs.The cloud is a shared infrastructure, much similar to a utility.You only pay for what you need or use, usually via monthly or annual subscriptions, and upgrades to cloud services are automatic and applied to all users using the cloud service.This is very different to traditional software & hardware products, where you pay for the whole software or hardware package and have to manually install the updates.Moreover, the cloud eliminates the need for physical storage or the hiring of an IT team, further cutting costs.The convenience advantage and space advantage can be explained by one simple sentence - the cloud is easy to start, use, and manage, and an entire business can be run from a single computer, since the data is stored on the cloud.The security advantage is exemplified by the cloud's multi-tenancy architecture.The cloud is very similar to a huge commercial building with several tenants (users).In this sense, the cloud's multi-tenancy architecture offers unprecedented scalability and security for stored data.Analysts and research groups alike expect computing cloud technology to experience exponential growth over the next five years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Goldman Sachs not only expects the cloud computing infrastructure market to be <b>roughly</b> three-fold its current size by 2018 , but also expects cloud computing costs to account for nearly 11 % of total enterprise IT spending by 2018 ( up from <b>roughly</b> 5 % in 2014 ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Computerworld , a business technology publication , <b>believes</b> 42 % of IT decision makers are planning to increase spending on cloud computing services in 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Further , 52 % of IT decision makers at companies with <i>more</i> than 1,000 employees are planning to increase spending on cloud computing services in 2015 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This speaks to the scalability and cost advantages of the cloud - the <i>larger</i> a company gets , the <i>greater</i> the necessity for having consolidated , cost-effective network of data storage .  (Surprise) </span>The growth isn't just domestic, as evidence by the following forecasts from Ovum.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By 2016 , Ovum <b>predicts</b> that over 80 % of enterprises globally will be using IaaS ( Infrastructure as a Service ) cloud technology .  (Uncertainty) </span>Cloud computing infrastructure can be segmented into three services: SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).According to Cisco Global Cloud Index, SaaS, with a 33% CAGR, is expected to be the fastest growing service of the cloud (24% CAGR) into 2018.SaaS can be further segmented into two equal parts.The important part here is that CRM (Customer Relationship Management) services account for 50% of SaaS services.CRM comprises all interactions a company has with its consumers, including B2B (business to business) and B2C (business to customer) relationships.And here is where we see Salesforce.com's ostensible value to bidders like Microsoft and Oracle.Salesforce.com, with a 16% market share, is the clear front-runner in the CRM cloud space.Using Cisco Global Index's growth estimates for the SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, and overall cloud sector into 2018, we can quantify what Salesforce.com's position as the favored CRM SaaS software company means for the top line of the company (compared to Microsoft, who offers PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS services with its cloud enterprise suite).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If we assume Salesforce can grow revenues in line with SaaS market expectations ( 33 % CAGR ) and Microsoft can grow its commercial cloud revenues in line with cloud market expectations ( 24 % CAGR ) , we can see that the difference in each company 's cloud top line diverge over time with Salesforce.com notching <b>nearly</b> $ 3 billion <i>more</i> in revenue from cloud services than Microsoft , on a trailing twelve month basis .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>These figures force us to recall a recent statement from Microsoft targeting a $20 billion run-rate for its commercial cloud by fiscal 2018.Looking at the numbers above, it just doesn't make sense that Microsoft can get to that run-rate without acquiring Salesforce.com.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To <i>better</i> understand this , refer to the following chart , which is our analysis of what Microsoft 's commercial cloud segment top-line CAGR would have to be in order to reach the targeted $ 20 billion run-rate by fiscal 2018 , both by itself and with a potential acquisition of Salesforce.com .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We can see that Microsoft , without a Salesforce.com acquisition , would have to grow its commercial cloud segment at roughly 44 % , a little <i>less</i> than double the market 's expected CAGR , to reach a $ 20 billion run-rate by FY18 ( we <b>assume</b> baseline $ 17 billion in FY18 rev , from $ 4B + $ 4B + $ 4B + $ 5B , in sequential quarter revenue ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>With a Salesforce.com acquisition, however, that CAGR drops to 15.22%, below the market's CAGR.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This highly <b>suggests</b> that the only way Microsoft reaches its $ 20 billion run-rate target by FY18 is through an acquisition of Salesforce.com .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All these qualitative and quantitative reasons are why Microsoft and others would make a bid for Salesforce.com , and the type of value a Salesforce.com acquisition <b>could</b> add to the top line of these companies over the next few years .  (Uncertainty) </span>But is the price-tag on Salesforce.com worth it?In M&As, the bidder pays premium for shares of the company being bought out.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Merrill Lynch thinks Salesforce.com shares <b>could</b> sell for as much as $ 92 , while Credit Suisse values Salesforce.com 's takeover value between $ 81 and $ 88 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Our analysis leads us to believe that Salesforce.com 's fair takeover value could be roughly $ 87 per share , but we believe the <b>assumptions</b> that lead us to this takeover value are unreasonable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> reasonable assumptions lead us to believe Salesforce.com shares are worth only about $ 64 to bidders , valuing the company at <b>roughly</b> $ 40 billion .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We get to our takeover value based on a 4-year DCF analysis using a WACC discount rate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We find Salesforce.com 's WACC to be 9.05 % using the following math : To get to an $ 87 takeover value , we <b>assumed</b> that Salesforce.com grows revenues at a 33 % CAGR into 2018 ( in line with the SaaS market ) and benefits from some operating cost-saving synergies from a merger with Microsoft which should be effective immediately .  (Uncertainty) </span>Our work can be shown in the following figure.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do not <b>believe</b> , however , that a Microsoft merger will ensure a top-line CAGR of 33 % for Salesforce.com , and thus do not <b>believe</b> Microsoft should pay $ 55 billion for Salesforce.com ( a 17 % premium on current market value ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>A merger will imply some cost-saving synergies, but that is exactly where the synergies end and become de-synergies.Companies like Microsoft and Oracle don't mesh with companies like Salesforce.com.Big and old companies don't mesh well with small and new companies in the tech industry - cultures clash, business values are devalued, and the core of what made Salesforce.com successful is quickly lost in the M&A shuffle.And there aren't enough cost-saving synergies for Microsoft or Oracle to break even on the EPS dilution from paying $55 billion for an unprofitable business.We do, however, recognize that there is some substantial value in adding the industry leading CRM SaaS provider for companies like Oracle and Microsoft who are looking to expand and grow their cloud businesses to stay relevant as their hardware and software businesses slowly bleed out.So how much is Salesforce.com worth to these bidders?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> that Salesforce.com can grow revenues in line with cloud-market CAGR ( 24 % ) , but not at a rate <i>higher</i> than that .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Salesforce.com already has deep penetration into the cloud space, specifically the CRM SaaS space.Salesforce.com should also see slowed top-line growth due to increase competition from deeper-pocketed competitors like Microsoft and Oracle.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As detailer <i>earlier</i> , a merger , while providing cost-saving synergies , risks personnel , cohesion , and culture problems , which <b>could</b> adversely impact top-line growth .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These <b>assumptions</b> can be represented in the following figure , where we show our steps leading to a $ 64 per share takeover value for Salesforce.com .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Our <b>suggestion</b> to Microsoft , Oracle , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and others interested in a bid for Salesforce.com : it 's not worth anything north of $ 50 billion . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>None of these companies <b>could</b> get an earnings yield that justifies for paying a premium on $ 50 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>Our DCF analysis indicates Salesforce.com is worth about $40 billion, and that is about what the company is worth to bidders like Microsoft and Oracle.Source: Why Salesforce.com Is Only Worth About $40 Billion To Bidders Disclosure: The author is long MSFT.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) The author wrote this article themselves , and it expresses their own opinions .
