(Uncertainty) </span>While Microsoft is de-emphasizing phone hardware, much attention is being given to creating cross-platform mobile apps, developer tools and cloud services.Intel overhauls its reporting structure - Notably, Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) flash memory sales will now be separately broken out, rather than grouped into an "All other" segment that also covers things like one-time charges and divested businesses.The move comes with Intel continuing to ramp its SSD business and making big Chinese NAND flash manufacturing investments .Security software/services revenue will also be broken out - it was previously grouped with other software/services revenue - as will recently-acquired FPGA developer Altera's sales.Also getting broken out is a newly-formed New Technology Group, which consists of "Intel's perceptual computing efforts and products designed for wearables, drones and other market segments."All in all, the new structure represents a major improvement in financial transparency.One remaining shortcoming: PC and mobile chip sales are still grouped together through the Client Computing Group - Intel's PC CPU business is quite profitable, while its mobile chip ops have been in the red in recent years.Also: Intel is buying Yogitech , an Italian firm that provides semiconductor functional safety products.Intel plans to use Yogitech's products within solutions for self-driving cars and IoT devices, both to protect its chips and make sure users are aware of when they fail.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>WSJ : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is releasing a Kindle with a rechargeable protective case - The inclusion of a separate case is said to allow the new Kindle to be <i>thinner</i> than prior models .

Facebook and Google are also fans of using A.I./machine learning to analyze and tag photos.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Ericsson buys data center management software firm NodePrime - The acquisition furthers Ericsson 's ( NASDAQ : ERIC ) efforts to grow its data center and software/services exposure , and in doing so <i>lower</i> its <b>dependence</b> on a slow-growing mobile infrastructure market .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>NodePrime provides tools for deploying, managing and collecting/analyzing data from data center hardware - Ericsson declares the software allows data center owners to easily migrate to hyperscale architectures (beloved by Internet giants and increasingly others).The software is already integrated with Ericsson's HDS 8000 servers for hyperscale data centers.The HDS 8000 is aimed partly at carriers looking to deploy network functions virtualization (NFV - allows many networking functions to be handled by standard servers), and is among the first systems to use Intel's Rack Scale Architecture , which lets many server components be upgraded/swapped out independently.Etsy launches a website-building service for sellers - The service, called Pattern, lets Etsy's (NASDAQ: ETSY ) 1.6 million active sellers quickly set up websites to market their wares.The company is touting integration with Etsy's marketplace - a seller's content/inventory gets automatically imported and synced - as a differentiator relative to site-building tools from the likes of Wix.com (NASDAQ: WIX ) and GoDaddy (NYSE: GDDY ).Etsy's sales mix has been increasingly shifting to value-added services.Seller services revenue rose 53.9% Y/Y in Q4 to $47.2 million, while marketplace revenue (transaction-based) rose 19.5% to $97.9 million.Sony lets PS4 users stream games to PCs and Macs - For gamers, the PC is far from dead, as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) can vouch .Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) move comes after Microsoft allowed Xbox One users to stream games to Windows 10 PCs ( reviews have been good ).It also follows reports Sony is prepping a " PlayStation 4.5 " supporting 4K gaming and PlayStation VR enhancements.For now, PS4 games streamed to PCs support a max resolution of 720p.WhatsApp adds end-to-end content encryption - WhatsApp's move drives home the company and parent Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) pro-privacy stance amid the Apple-FBI dispute : WhatsApp now won't be able to grant law enforcement access to private communication on its platform even if a warrant exists.It comes with a few weeks after rival Telegram, which has emphasized its encryption features, said it has topped 100 million active users (WhatsApp topped 1 billion a couple months ago).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>HP launches an ultra-thin high-end notebook - HP Inc.

(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Needless to say , the percentage of people who actually stop using a product/service following a price hike is inevitably much <i>lower</i> than the percentage who say they will .  (Surprise) </span>A recent BuzzFeed column voiced a similar opinion.Also: Netflix app download activity in many of the 130+ countries the company recently entered is solid.Netflix's content library for many of the new markets is relatively limited.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The HTC Vive VR headset gets decent reviews - It looks like the Oculus Rift has credible competition - Sony should provide <i>more</i> <i>later</i> this year via the PlayStation VR .
