(NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Customers use Wal-Mart's e-commerce platforms to buy goods they can't find in stores, thereby adding incremental revenue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Management made a concerted effort to capitalize on e-commerce in 2012 and the company grew digital sales <i>faster</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in 2013 and 2014 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The company's plan to invest $2B in e-commerce will address the recent deceleration of digital sales growth.The company expects e-commerce growth to return to mid-to-high double digits, but I've shown how management has a history of under-promising and over-delivering.On November 4, I published an article detailing Wal-Mart's (NYSE: WMT ) guidance history.I sifted through seven years of earnings calls to show that management typically beats the median of their quarterly earnings guidance by about 2.7%.I also showed how management's full-year guidance has been historically conservative and how actual results typically exceed their expectations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I used this information to construct a case that investors engaged in panic selling when management <b>revised</b> their three-year earnings outlook to reflect increased capital expenditures aimed at improving their employee relations and e-commerce .  (Uncertainty) </span>On Tuesday, Wal-Mart reported quarterly results.The company earned $1.03 per share, beating the median of earnings guidance by 4% and validating my research.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Overall , investors were impressed with the report and shares gained 3.6 % as the <i>broader</i> market retreated .  (Surprise) </span>For me however, the most satisfying tidbit of the earnings call was how their recent capital expenditures announcement addresses their decelerating e-commerce operations.This article discusses how Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales growth has been decelerating and why management is wise to invest heavily in the segment.Before discussing Wal-Mart's performance in e-commerce, it's important to understand why e-commerce is so important to the business.Unlike some online retailers that aren't generating meaningful profits, Wal-Mart focuses on profitable growth in all their ventures.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Wal-Mart does n't specifically report profits for online operations , management gives us clues to <b>suggest</b> their e-commerce operations are lucrative .  (Uncertainty) </span>There has always been a concern the company's e-commerce sales cannibalize the company's brick-and-mortar business.This simply isn't true.In the 2015 Annual Report , Wal-Mart reported 75% of sales from Walmart.com come from non-store inventory, thus providing incremental sales growth beyond the stores.To capitalize on this fact, Wal-Mart increased their online offerings by 60% throughout the year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the past , when customers <b>could</b> n't find an item at a store , they 'd look to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) to fulfill their order . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Now, they're likely to find their item in Wal-Mart's cache of 8 million different SKUs available.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company can further exploit this trend by reducing the <b>variety</b> of similar products within stores and shifting them to online-only items to reduce inventory costs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Reducing the number of different items allows the company to keep competing items <i>better</i> stocked , creating a <i>better</i> shopping experience .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Some investors <b>fear</b> e-commerce shoppers are fickle and spend <i>less</i> than their in-store counterparts .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , during the Q3 call , the company stated customers using online grocery shopping spend 50 % <i>more</i> on their sites than similar customer shopping only in stores .  (Surprise) </span>To take advantage of this emerging trend, the company accelerated their grocery pickup offering to 85 additional locations this quarter, bringing the total to 140 locations across 25 different markets.As the program picks up steam, company-wide revenue growth will benefit from the additional 50% sales from online grocery shoppers.Clearly, there is tremendous opportunity for Wal-Mart to grow via e-commerce.However, management was sluggish to react to the emerging craze at the turn of the millennium.By the time Walmart.com was launched in 2000 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was already selling $ 2.8 B of product online . It wasn't until 2011 that management created an e-commerce division .By that time , the company had fallen way behind <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , who had grown annual revenues to $ 48B . In 2012 , Wal-Mart planned to create online channels for all their markets.The company now operates 10 dedicated websites for 26 different countries.Most notably, the company acquired Yihaodian, a Chinese online retailer, to kick-start Chinese e-commerce.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Management worked out the kinks in Yihaodian by creating a <i>more</i> intuitive mobile app that resulted in transactions growing 800 % in 2014 .  (Surprise) </span>The company continued executing its vision by increasing traffic to Yihaodin by 60% last year.By 2014 , Wal-Mart 's digital sales growth outpaced <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( see above ) . At this time, the launch of the e-commerce division seemed like a success.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , a <b>worrisome</b> trend began developing .  (Uncertainty) </span>Sources: Quarterly calls and reports Wal-Mart has experienced a long-term trend of decelerating digital sales.In Q2 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> retook the lead for online growth . In Q3, Wal-Mart's e-commerce slowed to 10%.I credit management for stepping up and taking initiatives to reverse this trend.The company now plans on investing $900M in FY16 and $1.1B in FY17 for e-commerce development alone.The takeaway here is management acknowledges the valuable opportunity e-commerce presents.Data shows customers are using their sites to buy product they can't find in stores.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Other data shows customers spend <i>more</i> money once they start shopping on Wal-Mart 's sites .  (Surprise) </span>For these reasons alone, management is wise to invest in e-commerce.This is n't 2010 when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was growing revenue at 34 % and Wal-Mart refused to address the problem . Instead, Wal-Mart is tackling these issues head on to the tune of $2B invested over two years.Management expects e-commerce to resume mid to high double digit e-commerce growth going forward.As I've wrote before, management has a history of under-promising and over delivering.Therefore , I expect Wal-Mart 's digital sales growth to accelerate and rival <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth , as it did in 2014 . I am happy to see management investing heavily in the company's future and I remain bullish on the stock.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
