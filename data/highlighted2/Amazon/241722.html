class='textDiv'>Data Indicates WalMarts Plan To Invest In ECommerce Makes Perfect Sense WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha Customers use WalMarts ecommerce platforms to buy goods they cant find in stores thereby adding incremental revenue Management made a concerted effort to capitalize on ecommerce in and the company grew digital sales faster than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in and The companys plan to invest B in ecommerce will address the recent deceleration of digital sales growth The company expects ecommerce growth to return to midtohigh double digits but Ive shown how management has a history of underpromising and overdelivering On November I published an article detailing WalMarts NYSE WMT guidance history I sifted through seven years of earnings calls to show that management typically beats the median of their quarterly earnings guidance by about I also showed how managements fullyear guidance has been historically conservative and how actual results typically exceed their expectations I used this information to construct a case that investors engaged in panic selling when management revised their threeyear earnings outlook to reflect increased capital expenditures aimed at improving their employee relations and ecommerce On Tuesday WalMart reported quarterly results The company earned per share beating the median of earnings guidance by and validating my research Overall investors were impressed with the report and shares gained as the broader market retreated For me however the most satisfying tidbit of the earnings call was how their recent capital expenditures announcement addresses their decelerating ecommerce operations This article discusses how WalMarts ecommerce sales growth has been decelerating and why management is wise to invest heavily in the segment Before discussing WalMarts performance in ecommerce its important to understand why ecommerce is so important to the business Unlike some online retailers that arent generating meaningful profits WalMart focuses on profitable growth in all their ventures Although WalMart doesnt specifically report profits for online operations management gives us clues to suggest their ecommerce operations are lucrative There has always been a concern the companys ecommerce sales cannibalize the companys brickandmortar business This simply isnt true In the Annual Report WalMart reported of sales from Walmartcom come from nonstore inventory thus providing incremental sales growth beyond the stores To capitalize on this fact WalMart increased their online offerings by throughout the year In the past when customers couldnt find an item at a store theyd look to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN to fulfill their order Now theyre likely to find their item in WalMarts cache of million different SKUs available The company can further exploit this trend by reducing the variety of similar products within stores and shifting them to onlineonly items to reduce inventory costs Reducing the number of different items allows the company to keep competing items better stocked creating a better shopping experience Some investors fear ecommerce shoppers are fickle and spend less than their instore counterparts However during the Q call the company stated customers using online grocery shopping spend more on their sites than similar customer shopping only in stores To take advantage of this emerging trend the company accelerated their grocery pickup offering to additional locations this quarter bringing the total to locations across different markets As the program picks up steam companywide revenue growth will benefit from the additional sales from online grocery shoppers Clearly there is tremendous opportunity for WalMart to grow via ecommerce However management was sluggish to react to the emerging craze at the turn of the millennium By the time Walmartcom was launched in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was already selling B of product online It wasnt until that management created an ecommerce division By that time the company had fallen way behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>who had grown annual revenues to B In WalMart planned to create online channels for all their markets The company now operates dedicated websites for different countries Most notably the company acquired Yihaodian a Chinese online retailer to kickstart Chinese ecommerce Management worked out the kinks in Yihaodian by creating a more intuitive mobile app that resulted in transactions growing in The company continued executing its vision by increasing traffic to Yihaodin by last year By WalMarts digital sales growth outpaced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>see above At this time the launch of the ecommerce division seemed like a success However a worrisome trend began developing Sources Quarterly calls and reports WalMart has experienced a longterm trend of decelerating digital sales In Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>retook the lead for online growth In Q WalMarts ecommerce slowed to I credit management for stepping up and taking initiatives to reverse this trend The company now plans on investing M in FY and B in FY for ecommerce development alone The takeaway here is management acknowledges the valuable opportunity ecommerce presents Data shows customers are using their sites to buy product they cant find in stores Other data shows customers spend more money once they start shopping on WalMarts sites For these reasons alone management is wise to invest in ecommerce This isnt when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was growing revenue at and WalMart refused to address the problem Instead WalMart is tackling these issues head on to the tune of B invested over two years Management expects ecommerce to resume mid to high double digit ecommerce growth going forward As Ive wrote before management has a history of underpromising and over delivering Therefore I expect WalMarts digital sales growth to accelerate and rival Amazons growth as it did in I am happy to see management investing heavily in the companys future and I remain bullish on the stock We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
