Bezos himself calls his company "inventive".They like to experiment.They like to make a lot of bets.And they swing for the fences.But the cost of striking out on any of these bets is tiny.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And you <b>could</b> argue that any human capital wasted on a bad idea was n't actually wasted .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - like many people - <b>probably</b> learns a ton from failed bets . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You could argue that these failures actually have a negative cost on balance - they do cost some capital , but this loss that shows up on the income statement ( which , again , is very small ) ends up creating value <b>somewhere</b> else down the line due to increased knowledge and productive redeployment of human capital .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , I think there are advantages to this type of `` moonshot bet '' approach that works well within the confines of a business like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> or Google , but <b>might</b> not work as well within the confines of an investment portfolio . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This isn't always the case - I recently watched The Big Short (great movie, but not as good as the book ), and the Cornwall Capital guys used these types of long-shot bets to great success.They used options (which inherently have this type of capped downside, unlimited upside risk/reward) and turned $30,000 into $80 million.But I think this would be considered an exception, not the rule.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think most investors have a tendency to <b>arbitrarily</b> tilt the odds of success ( or the amount of the payoff ) too much in their favor with these types of long-shot bets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They <b>might</b> think a situation has 6-to-1 upside potential , when it only has 2-to-1 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or they <b>might</b> think there is a 30 % chance of success , when there is only a 5 % chance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's a subjective exercise - this is n't poker or blackjack , where you can pinpoint <b>probabilities</b> based on a finite set of outcomes .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , I think many investors would be better off not trying to go for the long-shots - which , in investing , unlike business , almost always carry real <b>risk</b> of capital destruction .  (Uncertainty) </span>Berkshire Hathaway manages a business using a completely opposite style of capital allocation.Instead of moonshots, it goes for the sure money, the easy bets.It's not going to create a business from scratch that can go from $0 to $10 billion in 10 years.But nor does it make many mistakes.There is no right or wrong approach.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As Bezos says , it just <b>depends</b> on the culture of the business and the personalities involved .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think certain businesses that possess large amounts of human capital, combined with the right culture, the right leadership, and a collective mindset for the long term can benefit from this type of moonshot approach.They can, and should, use this style of capital allocation.Ironically, I think investments in such well-managed, high-quality companies with great leadership and culture are often the sure bets that stock investors should be looking for.Tagged: ETFs & Portfolio Strategy , Portfolio Strategy & Asset Allocation</div></body></html>
