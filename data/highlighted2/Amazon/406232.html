That's $6.7 billion spread across 21 companies, so each one only has a small piece of the pie.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Intel 's slice is <i>less</i> than a tenth of that pie - at $ 651 billion for Q1 2016 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As for their growth in this segment , we already know that it took them three years to go from $ 370 million per quarter to $ 651 million per quarter - or 78 % , as I mentioned <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span>That's a CAGR of 20% in an industry that has been growing at 14.8%.Keep that in mind as I now show you how fast their PC-based business is declining.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So that $ 7 to $ 10 trillion figure I spoke of <i>earlier</i> is not the revenues that will be generated but the total volume of business that will be impacted because of the Internet of Things .  (Surprise) </span>Now, on to the PC side of Intel's business.How Bad Is The Downward Slope For The Client Computing Group?On the surface, it doesn't look too bad.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Like most retail products , PC sales are cyclical and typically <i>heavier</i> during the second two quarters of the year .  (Surprise) </span>But if you look at their TTM revenues at the end of 2015 versus 2014 (table below), you'll see a loss of about $2.65 billion.That's about a 7.6% loss YoY - another figure to keep in mind.Investor-speak: Where Does Intel Stand, and Should You Buy or Sell?In summary, the gap between increasing IoT (and data center) revenues will need time to offset the decline in their core segment.Here's a summary of what we calculated above: IoT revenue is growing at a rate of 20%-plus year-over-year against an industry growth of 14.8% - a sign that they're at the leading edge of the IoT phenomenon.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Client Computing ( sales ) is declining at <b>nearly</b> 8 % year-over-year against an average industry decline ( PC shipments ) of about 11.5 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you extrapolate that in a linear fashion , it will take them until the year 2034 for IoT revenues to fully compensate for the chip-related income decline .  (Uncertainty) </span>From that perspective, it looks like a lost cause.But there are other factors that come into play, and these are what we should pay special attention to because they make all the difference between a company on its way out and a company that will claw its way back up.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , personal computers are n't going to <b>suddenly</b> drop dead and make way for an exclusively mobile world .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are still things you can't do easily enough on a mobile device that's a breeze for PCs - like writing this article and submitting it to Seeking Alpha, for example.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I ca n't do this effectively on even the most expensive mobile or tablet in the world , but I can do it on the cheapest PC in the world - which <b>probably</b> runs on an Intel chipset .  (Uncertainty) </span>The 11.5% decline in shipments is not sustainable and it will eventually stabilize.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Second , IoT growth will accelerate even <i>faster</i> as we approach critical mass that everyone agrees will happen around the year 2020 , when estimates put public cloud revenues at around $ 167 billion , up from $ 80 billion in 2015 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Intel already is at the front end of that growth , so they 'll continue to grow <i>faster</i> each year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That current rate of 20 % CAGR is only going to get <i>bigger</i> by the year as the industry itself accelerates .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With <i>more</i> than 20 big companies in the fray and hundreds <i>more</i> providing various components for IoT systems , that 's inevitable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Third , their data center group also is growing at a healthy rate and will accelerate as <i>more</i> companies move to the cloud and the top three cloud players - IBM , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Microsoft and Google - keep expanding their data center footprints around the world . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another point is that the company has made a $ 16.7 billion investment to acquire Altera , a specialist in field programming gate array ( FPGA ) technology , which allows quick reconfiguration of servers for <b>varied</b> workloads - something that is critical in a cloud data center environment .  (Uncertainty) </span>And yes, this segment will grow with or without Google .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Combine these three scenarios and this is what we have : The offset between IoT growth and PC decline will happen <i>faster</i> over time , and the aggressive growth of cloud data centers will provide additional floor support for declining revenues .  (Surprise) </span>In my opinion, it will take at least five years for us to see the net positive effect of these on Intel's top line, but most of the downside has already been priced in at a forward P/E of 11.4 .My recommendation is simple: you can buy now on a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) over the next two to three years, but you'll need to wait another two to three years to see your investment start to pay off.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After that five - to six-year period , I expect cloud and IoT to be significant top line contributors while their core PC business gradually takes a back seat to give them a <b>dependable</b> , albeit slow-growing , foundation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The senior management team has been shaken up lately by the exits of the IoT and Client Computing heads , but it <b>seems</b> that the board needs to shake the tree even <i>more</i> so the real fruit-bearing branches can grow in a healthy way moving forward .
