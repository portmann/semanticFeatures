( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has operated payments services for years , but the company is absent from the current boom in the e-payments market . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is currently one of the smallest players in the payments market and <b>could</b> n't monetize its extensive payments portfolio . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By rebranding its payment service and distancing itself from the marketplace business , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> grow revenues from an existing business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>One of the latest trends among technology companies is trying to expand revenues by adding e-commerce or online payment capabilities.With these new capabilities, companies like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and Pinterest can increase traffic monetization, keep users on the site, and benefit from a portion of the sale.Each of these social networking sites implemented the idea in a very similar way through a call-to-action button that drives users to "Buy" or "Shop Now."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook is one of the companies leading the effort to penetrate the e-commerce and online payment markets and tries to implement on top of the e-commerce features mentioned above , as well as the P2P money transfer through Messenger that <b>could</b> operate as an online/mobile payment service .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) and Apple ( OTC : APPL ) followed Facebook into the online payment market and recently launched their payment services to challenge existing players like PayPal ( <b>Pending</b> : PYPL ) and Square .  (Uncertainty) </span>With all the buzz and hype on every new development in this area , I find it odd that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is not making any move in the same direction . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has thrown to the air many ideas that were supposed to improve their business , including shipment drones , uber-like grocery delivery , Kindle improvements , AWS-related issues and many <i>more</i> concepts , good and bad . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>However , one low-hanging fruit that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has not fully utilized is its payments portfolio , which includes <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Payments and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Local Register . Years ago , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> launched an electronic payment service to replace eBay 's ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) PayPal and to gain additional revenues from transactions . However , while PayPal is widely used across the web and is a synonym for secure online payment , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Payments remain primarily within the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> turf and is hardly used in other sites as a secure payment processor . Unlike eBay that leveraged PayPal to become an industry leader , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Payment lags behind PayPal , Stripe , and Braintree as shown in Chart 1 below . Last year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> expanded its payments portfolio and launched <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Local Register , an in-person , point-of-sale service that allows merchants to accept credit cards in their brick-and-mortar stores . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Local Register competes with Square and PayPal Here and completes <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's comprehensive offering for merchants that includes an e-commerce marketplace , payment processing service , and in-store credit cards transactions . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> suffers from the inherent problem that merchants consider <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as their rival and do n't rush to do business with the company . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unlike Square , Stripe , or PayPal , which are perceived as standalone , independent players that do n't compete with the local merchants , many retailers consider <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's e-commerce platform as a <b>risk</b> to their business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't reveal how many transactions are paid using <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Payments but , based on the fact that it 's not raising any questions and no serious investor considers it as competition to PayPal , I infer that its revenues are not significant . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> consolidated its payment services under a wholly-owned subsidiary named <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Payments Inc. . This subsidiary owns <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Payment service , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Checkout , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Local Register - quite an impressive portfolio that can be easily compared to PayPal . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Theoretically , PayPal , which is owned by eBay ( for now ) , <b>could</b> have faced the same problems as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Payments ; however , unlike <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Payments , merchants are not intimidated by PayPal as they do n't consider it a threat to their business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>PayPal is branded and perceived as a standalone payments company and not as an eBay subsidiary.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should copy that model and rebrand <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Payments without the `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> '' to something else ; let 's call it `` ZonPay . '' <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>By minimizing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's presence in ZonPay , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> could help the payment service gain <i>more</i> customers both in e-commerce sites and in-stores locations , and could move with these three actions : Reach out to eBay once the PayPal spin-off is done and offer its services or some strategic alliance that would benefit both sides as <b>probably</b> other payment services will do . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Reach out to Etsy and Shopify to add ZonPay to their list of payment methods.Aggressive transaction fees at the start to compete with PayPal, Square, Stripe, Apple Pay and Android Pay.Acquire Square or Stripe to increase its market penetration.Such an acquisition will move ZonPay to become the number 2 player in the market and start challenging PayPal's dominance.As companies like Apple , Google and Facebook struggle to penetrate the e-commerce and online transactions markets , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a vast payment portfolio that includes services for in-store transactions , online transactions , and checkout solutions . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can do much <i>more</i> than it does to generate additional revenues from the payment business that is relatively easy for a company with such an impressive payment portfolio , alongside with its endeavors in the shipment drones and hardware area .
