class='textDiv'>Payments Business Is A LowHanging Fruit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Could Use To Drive Growth Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has operated payments services for years but the company is absent from the current boom in the epayments market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is currently one of the smallest players in the payments market and couldnt monetize its extensive payments portfolio By rebranding its payment service and distancing itself from the marketplace business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could grow revenues from an existing business One of the latest trends among technology companies is trying to expand revenues by adding ecommerce or online payment capabilities With these new capabilities companies like Facebook NASDAQ FB Twitter NYSE TWTR and Pinterest can increase traffic monetization keep users on the site and benefit from a portion of the sale Each of these social networking sites implemented the idea in a very similar way through a calltoaction button that drives users to Buy or Shop Now Facebook is one of the companies leading the effort to penetrate the ecommerce and online payment markets and tries to implement on top of the ecommerce features mentioned above as well as the PP money transfer through Messenger that could operate as an onlinemobile payment service Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple OTCAPPL followed Facebook into the online payment market and recently launched their payment services to challenge existing players like PayPal Pending PYPL and Square With all the buzz and hype on every new development in this area I find it odd that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is not making any move in the same direction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has thrown to the air many ideas that were supposed to improve their business including shipment drones uberlike grocery delivery Kindle improvements AWSrelated issues and many more concepts good and bad However one lowhanging fruit that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has not fully utilized is its payments portfolio which includes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Local Register Years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>launched an electronic payment service to replace eBays NASDAQ EBAY PayPal and to gain additional revenues from transactions However while PayPal is widely used across the web and is a synonym for secure online payment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments remain primarily within the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>turf and is hardly used in other sites as a secure payment processor Unlike eBay that leveraged PayPal to become an industry leader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payment lags behind PayPal Stripe and Braintree as shown in Chart below Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>expanded its payments portfolio and launched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Local Register an inperson pointofsale service that allows merchants to accept credit cards in their brickandmortar stores <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Local Register competes with Square and PayPal Here and completes Amazons comprehensive offering for merchants that includes an ecommerce marketplace payment processing service and instore credit cards transactions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>suffers from the inherent problem that merchants consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as their rival and dont rush to do business with the company Unlike Square Stripe or PayPal which are perceived as standalone independent players that dont compete with the local merchants many retailers consider Amazons ecommerce platform as a risk to their business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt reveal how many transactions are paid using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments but based on the fact that its not raising any questions and no serious investor considers it as competition to PayPal I infer that its revenues are not significant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>consolidated its payment services under a whollyowned subsidiary named <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments Inc This subsidiary owns Amazons Payment service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Checkout and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Local Register quite an impressive portfolio that can be easily compared to PayPal Theoretically PayPal which is owned by eBay for now could have faced the same problems as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments however unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments merchants are not intimidated by PayPal as they dont consider it a threat to their business PayPal is branded and perceived as a standalone payments company and not as an eBay subsidiary <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should copy that model and rebrand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Payments without the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to something else lets call it ZonPay By minimizing Amazons presence in ZonPay <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could help the payment service gain more customers both in ecommerce sites and instores locations and could move with these three actions Reach out to eBay once the PayPal spinoff is done and offer its services or some strategic alliance that would benefit both sides as probably other payment services will do Reach out to Etsy and Shopify to add ZonPay to their list of payment methods Aggressive transaction fees at the start to compete with PayPal Square Stripe Apple Pay and Android Pay Acquire Square or Stripe to increase its market penetration Such an acquisition will move ZonPay to become the number player in the market and start challenging PayPals dominance As companies like Apple Google and Facebook struggle to penetrate the ecommerce and online transactions markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a vast payment portfolio that includes services for instore transactions online transactions and checkout solutions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can do much more than it does to generate additional revenues from the payment business that is relatively easy for a company with such an impressive payment portfolio alongside with its endeavors in the shipment drones and hardware area Source Payments
