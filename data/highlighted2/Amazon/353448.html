Yet another data point showing the impact of the market shift on other hardware providers.Open-Source & Emergence of Universal Routers: Home Wi-Fi and "Internet of Things" (IoT) eliminated all the technology entry barriers that previously made install systems like Control4's viable.IoT refers to the ability to virtually connect to home and office devices that have embedded sensors.Now most appliances are internet-enabled (smart TVs, wireless speakers, LED lights, etc.) and have their own smart device applications.These are free, can be accessed from your phone or tablet and do not require clunky hardware installation or maintenance.Additionally, the latest CTRL platform is open-source on Android, which eliminates the need for customers to buy a clunky CTRL touchscreen for $1k (a product that accounted for ~15% of revenue per last disclosure).Numerous hardware vendors now sell sub-$200 home routers.Last year, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) released an Android-driven home automation/ IoT platform "Brillo" and "Weave" (I/O agnostic communication system).Part of this will include a home automation hub that will run through the home router.Going a step further, this technology eliminates the need for any controller and shows the direction of automation technology.Control4 sells hardware that automates home appliances, essentially a remote control for video, music and lights.The Company was founded in 2003 and initially positioned itself as one of the first producers of mainstream home automation hardware.The <$100k income households CTRL targeted were not addressed by the luxury-priced providers at the time.For the next three to four years, home automation remained a nascent market and Control4 was one of few selling hardware at the lower-end of the price spectrum (below $5k per unit).CTRL's hardware is sold through third-party distributors who also provide installation and ongoing service.This is a major structural flaw in its business model.Control4's product costs $600-2k for the basic hardware but when you factor in programming and installations, the cost increases massively to $5k-8k for one room, >$20k for a small to mid-sized house.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a bit of a <b>hidden</b> cost that typically does not get included in product price comparisons and industry reviews .  (Uncertainty) </span>These upfront costs severely limit its potential customer base.The Company does not generate any recurring revenue from subscriptions or licensing.All revenue is from one-time hardware sales.Control4's product is sold through independent, third-party distributors.These distributors have historically been compelled to sell CTRL's hardware not based on the merits of the technology but because of the installation and ongoing maintenance revenue those distributors can generate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As noted , installation costs range from $ 5k to $ 20k <b>depending</b> upon the scope of the project .  (Uncertainty) </span>Ongoing maintenance is also required any time the user wants to add an appliance or modify the configuration.It is important to note, CTRL does not receive any of this revenue.A basic service visit from a technician costs ~$200.This type of tail revenue is obviously exactly what a distributor loves and a customer hates (as indicated by CTRL's poor customer reviews).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While this <b>may</b> not have been an impediment to sales a couple of years ago , it debilitates CTRL 's competitive position given the ever-growing number of alternatives , including <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Echo , which do not require expensive installation and ongoing service . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>At $8.11 per share, CTRL has a $218M market capitalization (27 F/D shares) and an EV of $170M ($48M net cash adjusting for the Pakedge deal).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Company reported $ 163M in revenue and $ 8.1 M in adjusted net income in 2015 and Pakedge generated $ 18.5 M in revenue and <b>approximately</b> $ 1M in net income .  (Uncertainty) </span>CTRL has guided to 2016 revenue of $198M-$202M with adjusted net income of $16M-18M.This implies 10-12% organic revenue growth yet CTRL only grew organic revenue 4% in 2015 (ex-Leaf acquisition) and Pakedge was flat.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This also <b>assumes</b> a 100 % increase in adjusted net income off the $ 9.1 M base .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is insane given the aforementioned growth and margin headwinds.Yet the current 24.7x proforma EV/LTM net income multiple indicates the market is buying it.At the end of the day, Control4 has a severely impaired business model and the growth story that supports its multiple is imploding.The increasingly bleak competitive picture is leading to negative revenue growth and declining margins.The Company has negligible IP it can monetize.One need only look at the failed sale of peer Wink to get a perspective on how little strategic interest there is for hub hardware manufacturers.At a 15x EPS market multiple (arguably generous given the business profile and prospects), CTRL would trade 40% lower.Ultimately, Control4 lacks any discernible strategic value, thus the stock is not worth anything more than its net cash position of $1.78 per share for a potential 75% return.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The primary near-term catalysts include : 1 ) revenue and margin erosion from recent price cuts and volume declines leading to performance falling well short of current lofty expectations/guidance , 2 ) increased competitive pressures from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and others , 3 ) stock re-rating as its fate becomes painfully <b>apparent</b> , and 4 ) potential share sales from Foundation Capital and Frazier Ventures . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Accounting Red Flags& Other Considerations Low earnings quality: In 2015, levered FCF was -$4.3M vs. adjusted net income of $8.1M. Inventory has been consistently growing well ahead of revenue.In Q4'15, inventory grew a staggering 40% Y/Y while revenue only grew 4%.Timing of the new product releases can only explain part of this inventory build.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The more likely scenario is orders have not been meeting <b>anticipated</b> demand and the Company will likely need to take some write-downs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For six consecutive quarters , A/R has grown well ahead of revenue , <b>suggesting</b> aggressive recognition/pulling forward of sales and/or that CTRL is being forced to extend credit terms to its dealers .  (Uncertainty) </span>The CEO, CFO, VP of Marketing, VP of Business Development and VP of Product Development collectively own 0 common shares.It is also rather telling that Pakedge totally cashed out and did not take any stock in the deal.Not favorable signals or incentives.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Author payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500.Become a contributor ï¿½ Tagged: Investing Ideas , Short Ideas, Technology , Diversified Electronics, Buyside Insight, Short, PRO</div></body></html>
