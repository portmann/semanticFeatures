</span>NASDAQ AMZN are now trading at per share At this level it is very easy to knock Amazons rich valuation Look no further than the stocks x forward PE multiple to realize that immense growth expectations are baked into the stocks current stock price But the companys current investments to support technological infrastructure and buildout its already expansive ecosystem skew the current valuation While shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>certainly look expensive we believe investors buying at these levels are actually buying a great growth company trading at a discount to its fair value After considering its immense cash flow growth potential of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in future years we believe shares are currently worth around per share We have written before on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>commenting on why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime had an advantage in Japan over Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is a true juggernaut of a business In our opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime will be the fuel for sustained revenue growth for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is currently taking what we expect to be successful steps to grow its Prime user base including the recent launch of its Fire tablet At the Fire tablet is priced in what we believe is an impulse buy range at a level so low relative to other tablet prices namely the iPad that consumers will be coerced to buy the device on price attractiveness alone and discover its specs later While the pricepoint surely offers slim if any margins for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is banking on greater Fire tablet presence to promote <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>subs growth where margins are much more attractive This strategy is not new for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did much the same thing for its Kindle ereader selling the Kindle for a bargain lowmargin price to promote the ebook sales The strategy worked for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and resulted in millions of ebook sales We believe the Fire tablet will yield similar results Fire tablet users will be swamped with Prime offers and we believe this will inevitably have a positive flowthrough effect of Prime subs growth More Prime subs has a huge effect on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime subs spend on average more than x the nonPrime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customer on Amazoncom This finding that Prime subs spend far more than nonPrime subs is consistent with RBC Capital Markets research They believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime has million subs in the US and to million globally and affirm that Prime growth will continue to fuel strong revenue growth Moreover the Fire Kids Edition seems perfectly created for kids as it already comes in encased in a rubber exterior to prevent damage and already has adult content blocked on the device two precautionary steps that parents would otherwise have to take in addition to paying for the tablet We believe creating this kids version and appealing to the familyoriented consumers will yield strong benefits for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as we believe it will also increase Fire tablet unit sales among parents and other nonkid family members <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to invest heavily in technological infrastructure such as building out its AWS platform and we believe this will inevitably have a hugely beneficial impact on the top and bottomline Overall we are very comfortable with the analysts consensus revenue growth estimates for nearly this year and next year and believe continued adoption of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime globally coupled with AWS growth which is accelerating will drive net revenue growth north of per year into As the company realizes the benefits of massive spending efforts we believe margins should expand into RBC recognizes that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should taper off a roughly fiveyear investment cycle of new US distribution so this should help profit margins over the next year period Moreover we believe higher Prime subs will drive higher profit margins due to Amazons ability to leverage scale AWS should also reach higher profit margins over time One of the major benefits of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is its cash flow The company consistently reports operating cash flow dramatically north of reported net earnings and in the company actually reported that operating cash flow was in excess of billion more than net income As a result operating cash flow has grown every year since including a billion jump last year As revenue and margins grow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should continue to benefit from its healthy cash flow reconciliations and so operating cash flow should see extremely healthy growth in the foreseeable future Free cash flow should see even healthier growth as the company has ramped up capital expenditures to right around billion per year to build out its ecosystem with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and AWS As soon as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>pulls back these capital expenditures to a more normalized billion annual runrate free cash flow is set to explode benefiting dually from increased operating cash flow and decreased capex We qualitatively feel that the company will maintain high capital expenditure levels through but believe the ecosystems will be built up enough by and after roughly billion in capex over years to where the company will not need to spend as much to support future growth Overall we see the company netting free cash flow north of billion by up from billion in Using an discount rate and a free cash flow perpetuity rate higher than we normal use to account for Amazons growth potential even beyond we believe the net present value of all of Amazons future free cash flows is billion Using MRQ share count of million this equates to roughly per share Amazons net current asset value using MRQ current assets and total liabilities figures is roughly billion On a million diluted share count this is roughly per share in NCAV Summing NCAV and the NPV of future FCF we arrive at a fair value of billion Again using MRQ fully diluted share count of million this equates to a fair value just south of per share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt cheap by traditional metrics but if you consider the longterm growth prospects of the company to grow revenues at a consistent doubledigit clip drastically expand margins and ramp up free cash flow the stock is actually trading at a discount to its fair value The company is taking strategic steps to grow its Prime sub base and the juggernaut that Prime currently is and will continue to be both domestically and internationally should fuel strong revenue growth We believe shares are worth so at per share we believe AMZN is actually a buy despite the multiples Disclosure I amwe are long AMZN MoreI wrote this article myself
