( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Recently , rumors began circulating that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> be planning to open between 300 and 400 book stores . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although this <b>may</b> seem like a good move to some , the fact of the matter is that this space is already struggling meaningfully and is unlikely to add value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One alternative is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> be trying to replicate the success Apple has seen in retail , but the company 's core focus <b>may</b> make this impossible . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This does not change my view regarding the long-term potential <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has , but it does <b>suggest</b> that management should be focusing <i>more</i> on R&D moving forward . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>According to the CEO Mathrani of General Growth Properties ( NYSE : GGP ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is in the process of planning the opening of between 300 and 400 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Books locations . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although there has been some pushback since Mr. Mathrani stated this , new details have emerged that , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's rollout may not be that large , some initiatives are being planned that the company <b>hopes</b> to leverage its resources for the sake of its investors . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In what follows, I will detail my own thoughts on the issue and discuss that, while potential does exist here, I don't think any move by the company to open stores will be all that it's cracked up to be.The first <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Books retail location was opened in Seattle , Washington . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>On its company website , the online e-tail giant states that its store offers books - many of which are rated 4 stars or <i>higher</i> - that also <b>appear</b> on its website .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The prices of these books change to reflect the change of prices on the business 's website , so that customers never have to pay <i>more</i> than they would on Amazon.com . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In addition to this , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> offers reviews from its website throughout the store , an image of which you can see in the picture below . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> likely than not , the company is probably <b>hoping</b> to use its strong logistics operations to undercut other physical retailers on price , while simultaneously increasing its profit margins .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This would, most certainly, have a major negative impact on rivals like Barnes & Noble (NYSE: BKS ) and the now private Books-A-Million (NASDAQ: BAMM ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What success in this category will <b>possibly</b> look like , though , is something I will delve into shortly .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> importantly , I think the main objective for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be to eventually try to replicate the success Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) has had with retail . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In 2000 , Steve Jobs hired Ron Johnson , the man who would <b>nearly</b> destroy retail giant J.C. Penney ( NYSE : JCP ) many years later , to begin work on the first Apple retail outlet .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite pushback from his board, Jobs eventually opened the first store in 2001.From there, the concept exploded, with the coup de grace - the company's Fifth Avenue location in Manhattan - eventually opening in 2006.With around 50,000 visitors per week in its first year, the store became the largest-grossing (both in terms of per square foot and in absolute dollars) store in the world.By 2010, Apple Store locations were generating an average of $34 million per year apiece ($9.8 billion collectively each year), and today, the business has 463 locations, making up 5.3 million square feet of retail store space.My own personal opinion is that this is , to some degree , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's aim . While the company is primarily focusing on the sale of physical books in its Seattle location, it does currently push its own devices, such as the Kindle, Echo, FireTV, and Fire Tablet, in its stores.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Of course , I <b>doubt</b> that the business expects to have the same kind of market grab that Apple has had , just because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is <i>more</i> focused on logistics than products ; but using its core strengths to sell books , while maintaining a physical existence for its technology-oriented products would be a wise and potentially profitable move . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This is a great aim no matter how you stack it, but selling technology products within bookstores has been tried, and with little material success.Today, both Barnes & Noble and Books-A-Million provide a wide array of technology-oriented products as well as non-tech consumer goods.In the case of Books-A-Million, the technology has been diversified quite a bit.As I covered in a previous article , the picture hasn't been quite the same with Barnes & Noble, which has also placed a heavy emphasis on its own technology products, namely the Nook.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although I was supportive of the company at that time , the fundamental changes in its operations as well as this news from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> leave me feeling <i>less</i> comfortable than before . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Whether or not this is the aim of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't really matter , because the outcome of physical locations for the company will likely be the same , regardless : failure in this endeavor . You see, in the last three quarters for which public data exists, Books-A-Million, which operates 256 retail locations, generated revenue associated with its bookstores totaling $304.38 million, but saw its operating loss come in at a hefty $17.85 million.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is <i>worse</i> than the $ 15.15 million the company saw a year <i>earlier</i> , with <i>higher</i> sales .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Some investors <b>may</b> think that Barnes & Noble is a different story , since the company 's market share is much <i>larger</i> than that of Books-A-Million .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>During its latest year-to-date results , the retailer operated a whopping 647 stores , and despite seeing sales associated with this segment total <b>nearly</b> $ 1.80 billion , the company 's operating loss came in at $ 5.14 million .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This represents a major reversal from the greater-than $ 34 million gain seen the same period a year <i>earlier</i> , and is at least partially related to a change in structure , but the margins ( if operating income happened to be positive ) would be minuscule at best .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given its strong logistical position , I suspect <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be able to undercut the competition in terms of price , but I have to <b>wonder</b> whether opening any physical locations - whether it 's 10 or 1,000 - will be something that can or will add to shareholder value in any way . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Regarding the company as a whole , I do <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> represents one of the most interesting ( and potentially most rewarding ) long-term growth stories ever seen , but I think it would be in the best interest of shareholders for the online giant to allocate any capital used for stores toward research & development activities - something that is <i>more</i> likely to add <i>greater</i> value many years from now than a physical retail presence .
