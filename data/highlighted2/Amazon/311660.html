You see, in the last three quarters for which public data exists, Books-A-Million, which operates 256 retail locations, generated revenue associated with its bookstores totaling $304.38 million, but saw its operating loss come in at a hefty $17.85 million.This is worse than the $15.15 million the company saw a year earlier, with higher sales.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some investors <b>may</b> think that Barnes & Noble is a different story , since the company 's market share is much larger than that of Books-A-Million .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>During its latest year-to-date results , the retailer operated a whopping 647 stores , and despite seeing sales associated with this segment total <b>nearly</b> $ 1.80 billion , the company 's operating loss came in at $ 5.14 million .  (Uncertainty) </span>This represents a major reversal from the greater-than $34 million gain seen the same period a year earlier, and is at least partially related to a change in structure, but the margins (if operating income happened to be positive) would be minuscule at best.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given its strong logistical position , I suspect <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be able to undercut the competition in terms of price , but I have to <b>wonder</b> whether opening any physical locations - whether it 's 10 or 1,000 - will be something that can or will add to shareholder value in any way . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Regarding the company as a whole , I do <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> represents one of the most interesting ( and potentially most rewarding ) long-term growth stories ever seen , but I think it would be in the best interest of shareholders for the online giant to allocate any capital used for stores toward research & development activities - something that is more likely to add greater value many years from now than a physical retail presence .
