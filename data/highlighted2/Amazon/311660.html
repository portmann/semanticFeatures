style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may be planning to open between and book stores Although this may seem like a good move to some the fact of the matter is that this space is already struggling meaningfully and is unlikely to add value One alternative is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may be trying to replicate the success Apple has seen in retail but the companys core focus may make this impossible This does not change my view regarding the longterm potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has but it does suggest that management should be focusing more on RD moving forward According to the CEO Mathrani of General Growth Properties NYSE GGP <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is in the process of planning the opening of between and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Books locations Although there has been some pushback since Mr Mathrani stated this new details have emerged that while Amazons rollout may not be that large some initiatives are being planned that the company hopes to leverage its resources for the sake of its investors In what follows I will detail my own thoughts on the issue and discuss that while potential does exist here I dont think any move by the company to open stores will be all that its cracked up to be The first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Books retail location was opened in Seattle Washington On its company website the online etail giant states that its store offers books many of which are rated stars or higher that also appear on its website The prices of these books change to reflect the change of prices on the businesss website so that customers never have to pay more than they would on Amazoncom In addition to this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers reviews from its website throughout the store an image of which you can see in the picture below More likely than not the company is probably hoping to use its strong logistics operations to undercut other physical retailers on price while simultaneously increasing its profit margins This would most certainly have a major negative impact on rivals like Barnes Noble NYSE BKS and the now private BooksAMillion NASDAQ BAMM What success in this category will possibly look like though is something I will delve into shortly More importantly I think the main objective for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will be to eventually try to replicate the success Apple NASDAQ AAPL has had with retail In Steve Jobs hired Ron Johnson the man who would nearly destroy retail giant JC Penney NYSE JCP many years later to begin work on the first Apple retail outlet Despite pushback from his board Jobs eventually opened the first store in From there the concept exploded with the coup de grace the companys Fifth Avenue location in Manhattan eventually opening in With around visitors per week in its first year the store became the largestgrossing both in terms of per square foot and in absolute dollars store in the world By Apple Store locations were generating an average of million per year apiece billion collectively each year and today the business has locations making up million square feet of retail store space My own personal opinion is that this is to some degree Amazons aim While the company is primarily focusing on the sale of physical books in its Seattle location it does currently push its own devices such as the Kindle Echo FireTV and Fire Tablet in its stores Of course I doubt that the business expects to have the same kind of market grab that Apple has had just because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is more focused on logistics than products but using its core strengths to sell books while maintaining a physical existence for its technologyoriented products would be a wise and potentially profitable move This is a great aim no matter how you stack it but selling technology products within bookstores has been tried and with little material success Today both Barnes Noble and BooksAMillion provide a wide array of technologyoriented products as well as nontech consumer goods In the case of BooksAMillion the technology has been diversified quite a bit As I covered in a previous article the picture hasnt been quite the same with Barnes Noble which has also placed a heavy emphasis on its own technology products namely the Nook Although I was supportive of the company at that time the fundamental changes in its operations as well as this news from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>leave me feeling less comfortable than before Whether or not this is the aim of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt really matter because the outcome of physical locations for the company will likely be the same regardless failure in this endeavor You see in the last three quarters for which public data exists BooksAMillion which operates retail locations generated revenue associated with its bookstores totaling million but saw its operating loss come in at a hefty million This is worse than the million the company saw a year earlier with higher sales Some investors may think that Barnes Noble is a different story since the companys market share is much larger than that of BooksAMillion During its latest yeartodate results the retailer operated a whopping stores and despite seeing sales associated with this segment total nearly billion the companys operating loss came in at million This represents a major reversal from the greaterthan million gain seen the same period a year earlier and is at least partially related to a change in structure but the margins if operating income happened to be positive would be minuscule at best Given its strong logistical position I suspect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will be able to undercut the competition in terms of price but I have to wonder whether opening any physical locations whether its or will be something that can or will add to shareholder value in any way Regarding the company as a whole I do believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>represents one of the most interesting and potentially most rewarding longterm growth stories ever seen but I think it would be in the best interest of shareholders for the online giant to allocate any capital used for stores toward research development activities something that is more likely to add greater value many years from now than a physical retail presence Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next
