( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Retailers were hit by Wal-Mart news , and tech issues by Netflix . I own Amazon.Com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and I 'm not selling the shares in my retirement account . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In fact , I am very likely to pick up a few <i>more</i> in a few weeks .  (Surprise) </span>Because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is about to be hit by a wave of selling pressure . There is a lot of bearish sentiment around.When Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) goes down, stocks go down.The Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) debacle has extended to other big box names, like Target (NYSE: TGT ), Kroger (NYSE: KR ) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR ), all of whom were hit yesterday.Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), another high-flying tech name, got hit after an earnings miss.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> important , I think that expectations for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , which reports earnings next Thursday , have been set too high . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The official "whisper number" is for a loss of 7 cents per share on revenues of $24.91 billion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But when you look at a market cap of $ 256 billion for a company that is mainly engaged in retail , and admit that 's at least 2.5 times sales , the real `` whisper-upon-whisper '' number is <b>probably</b> much , much <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think anything short of $ 25 billion in sales , and an actual profit , will prove to be a <b>disappointment</b> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For its second quarter , for instance , the company reported that cloud revenue through <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services was $ 1.8 billion , against $ 1 billion a year <i>earlier</i> , 80 % growth year-over-year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If AWS revenues do n't grow 80 % year-over-year for the third quarter , that will be a selling excuse .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or , analysts <b>could</b> dig into the profitability of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video , which competes with Netflix . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>What are its expenses?What portion of that $99/year charge is going to video, as opposed to subsidizing shipping?How much is it paying to license content from CBS (NYSE: CBS ) and other studios, which are also focused on building up rival Hulu .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The `` oh-noes '' <b>could</b> even hit through Wal-Mart , which said it would be investing in technology to compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> e-tailing over the next two years . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Wo n't that hit <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's top-line and bottom-line ? <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> so .  (Uncertainty) </span>Sell, sell, sell.All these are really just excuses, as if people need one in the current market.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services is killing other clouds and disrupting the entire technology marketplace . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not just `` giving away '' content through Prime - it 's selling and renting it too . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is working hard to disrupt the delivery space as well - taking on partners like Federal Express ( NYSE : FDX ) and UPS ( NYSE : UPS ) with stores and drones and even customers delivering packages to other customers . The fact is that when the bear market knives come out, they come out for everyone.Excuses are made, before or after the sell orders come in.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The August lows have to be tested , and retested , before anyone is going to <b>believe</b> that we 're heading <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In that environment , I would not be <b>surprised</b> to see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> trade below $ 500 again by the end of this month . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>I loved it at $300, I liked it at $400, I sold some at $530 and I'd be happy to buy it at $499.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
