(Uncertainty) </span>In the old broadcast distribution model, consumers had access or bought access to a number of different channels, often at a multiple of the cost of Netflix.Hastings also stated the intention to continue to grow the proportion of original content on Netflix.It's clear that he sees content becoming primarily original, just as in the case of the traditional network and cable channels.So, In Hastings' view, there would be little mutual exclusivity involved in the competition between the SVODs.Consumers would buy all or most of them, in order to select their preferred content.There's a problem with this thesis, however.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The problem is that there 's already far <i>more</i> content on the major SVODs than most people can watch .  (Surprise) </span>Most consumers will not choose to buy additional SVOD services that they don't need.So, in effect, the SVODs and virtual MPVDs are competing.That competitive impact is already being felt in the US market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix <b>may</b> already have reached a plateau in US subscribers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As of January , I had not foreseen the subscriber roll-off effect , but now that it 's starting to manifest , it makes the Peak Netflix thesis all the <i>more</i> compelling .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most of my attention in January was focused on the fact that operating income and net income before taxes had also <b>appeared</b> to peak back in 2014 , as the chart below shows .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Income <b>appears</b> to have recovered in 2016 , but it 's still off the 2014 Q2 peak .  (Uncertainty) </span>Revenue growth is still healthy at 28% y/y to $2.105 billion, but operating income is down 6% y/y to $70.37 million.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The sequential improvement in operating income was due to a <i>smaller</i> operating loss overseas .  (Surprise) </span>I had expressed concern about the increasing cost of servicing the Netflix debt, about $35 million per quarter.This is still a significant problem and accounts for much of the gap between operating income and net income before taxes.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Unfortunately , this is only going to get <i>worse</i> , as Netflix management has indicated that it will continue to increase debt in order to fund original content .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The need to sustain growth in overseas markets will <b>probably</b> continue to limit operating income .  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't see it recovering to the 2014 level any time soon.And, of course, non-GAAP free cash flow continues to be negative at -$254 million for the quarter.The profligate spending of Netflix would all make sense if it was faced with negligible competition.The spending is predicated on unlimited growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But we 're already seeing signs that the growth of Netflix is <b>probably</b> very limited .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's not that I think Netflix is doomed.Far from it.It has a strong product offering and is a leader in its industry.But that industry is maturing rapidly.Just about everyone has figured out by now that the Internet is the future of content distribution of all types.The mainstream media companies are moving rapidly to fill the void that Netflix had all to itself.Under the best case scenario, Netflix grows into its valuation.But even in this scenario, the stock doesn't appreciate significantly.Unfortunately, I don't see the best case scenario as being likely.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think it 's far <i>more</i> likely that Netflix will fail to live up to the lofty expectations of investors , and the share price will correct accordingly .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Those corrections are likely to be <b>sudden</b> and steep drops as we saw after-hours following the Q2 report .  (Uncertainty) </span>But the worst is yet to come.Netflix institutional ownership is a very high 84%, according to Google Finance.As institutions realize that Netflix is done as a momentum play, they're likely to bail out, putting large volumes of shares on the market.For this reason, I rate Netflix a short opportunity.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Short Ideas, Services , Music & Video Stores, Expert Insight</div></body></html>
