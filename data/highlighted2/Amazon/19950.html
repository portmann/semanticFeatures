(Amazon: Surprise) </span>ETF Hub Apr.1, 2015 11:50 AM ET �|� About: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) , Includes: AMZN , GOOG , GOOGL , MSFT by: Brian Nichols IBM announced new cloud services on Tuesday, and even stole The Weather Channel from AMZN as a customer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>IBM 's plan to incorporate underutilized data to improve enterprise operations <b>might</b> sound innovative , but in reality it wo n't be for long .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>IBM 's plan to invest $ 3 billion <b>might</b> also sound encouraging , but IBM is playing from behind with the slowest cloud growth and minimal organic growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced a plan to invest $3 billion over the next four years to bolster its Internet of Things ((IoT)) offerings.Specifically, IBM wants to help clients use the 90% of data collected by devices that's never used.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>IBM 's first test subject in its IoT/data analytics initiative is a partnership with The Weather Channel to use its 10 billion discrete forecasts per day to help businesses that are impacted by the weather make <i>better</i> decisions .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In essence , this <b>could</b> be a meaningful relationship for IBM , but <i>more</i> importantly is that it 's seen as a big loss for Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) because The Weather Channel was previously a partner with its cloud business AWS . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So the big question becomes whether cloud leader <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should be <b>worried</b> ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> controls <b>nearly</b> 30 % of the worldwide cloud infrastructure services market , which grew 48 % year-over-year i n 2014 and finished with <b>nearly</b> $ 5 billion in total revenue during the fourth quarter according to Synergy Research . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In retrospect , it is a small market relative to the size of the companies that control it - <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , IBM and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) - but with AWS valued at $ 50 billion , it 's an industry with very high long-term expectations . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , with Amazon.com being the unquestioned leader in cloud infrastructure services , it <b>might</b> seem like quite a big deal for IBM , which controls 7 % of the market , to steal a major customer . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But in reality, it's no big deal, nor is the initiative a game changer for IBM's cloud business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While IBM <b>might</b> be the first company to combine cloud infrastructure services and big data analytics with future plans for IoT , it wo n't be the last .  (Uncertainty) </span>For example , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's AWS was founded in 2006 , several years before competing platforms . IBM essentially bought its cloud business, whereas Microsoft's Azure was homegrown before launching in 2010.Yet, today there are very few distinguishing products and services from each service provider.In essence, storage is storage, apps are apps and data is data regardless of whose platform is being used.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The key is to combine different products/services and innovate to appeal to different customers in <i>more</i> useful ways , but it does n't take long for competitors to catch up .  (Surprise) </span>It's for this reason that an all out price war started in late 2013 and ran throughout most of 2014.Companies such as Microsoft and Google were trying to gain market share , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was trying to keep it , therefore cutting prices on countless key services to do so . Had one company actually had a distinguished product or service, a game changer of sorts, the need to cut prices would not have been so prevalent.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That company would have had a <i>better</i> competitive angle than cutting prices and ultimately slowing revenue growth .  (Surprise) </span>In other words , this news from IBM is not that big of a deal , as it wo n't take long for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Microsoft and Google , among others , to start offering similar services and attacking the same market . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , IBM is actually at a disadvantage , because its cloud platform is mostly acquired , meaning it was never built from the ground up and <b>optimized</b> as one service .  (Uncertainty) </span>Instead, IBM's cloud is just a big collection of services under different names.Amazon.com offers all of its cloud services through AWS , and Microsoft on Azure . While IBM's cloud services are diverse, it still sells some services like infrastructure-as-a-service as SoftLayer, and markets platform-as-a-service as SAP and Oracle's (NYSE: ORCL ) applications.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said , I find it hard to <b>believe</b> that IBM can do something that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Microsoft , Google or salesforce.com ( NYSE : CRM ) ca n't do on the cloud , regardless of how much money it spends . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>IBM has already spent <b>nearly</b> $ 5 billion over the last few years to improve its cloud offerings , and while its cloud infrastructure services revenue grew 48 % year-over-year during the fourth quarter - it underperformed <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Microsoft , and Google in growth - it 's hard to know how much of its growth is organic . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In a cloud industry that 's growing fast , organic growth is the true measure of success , and right now , we have to <b>assume</b> that not much of IBM 's cloud growth is organic due to acquisitions .  (Uncertainty) </span>Furthermore, that's a trend that is likely to continue due to its commitment to investment $3 billion, likely to be acquisitions.In other words , despite IBM taking The Weather Channel , it is hardly a long-term threat to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> or even Microsoft , not yet or anytime soon .
