( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Concerns over valuation and cash flow growth are over-blown , as this company should be evaluated from a growth perspective . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The growth catalysts are showing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's push towards a fourth major revenue stream , which <b>could</b> seriously put this company out of reach for competitors . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm not one to pick up big-name equities as I <b>believed</b> they get wrecked by the market in aggregate compared to less-known names .  (Uncertainty) </span>That being said , I 'm looking to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) to change my mind . We 're just a few months away from the biggest e-commerce season of the year and I 'm asking the bold question , how will <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> hold up versus expectations in the holiday season ? <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my opinion , we have to evaluate <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> from a growth perspective and I fully <b>believe</b> that this stock is going to continue to drive top-line growth and end up beating expectations in Q4 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>YTD <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock has performed exceptionally well , with only the recent spike in <b>volatility</b> causing havoc in its price . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The substantial runs outside of earnings seasons completely outpace major market indexes.After observing this trend for quite some time , I 've noticed that any substantial changes in the RSI prove to be rather short-lived and that it actually tends to be relatively stable compared to what I 've seen from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's peers . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Below , you can see said trend : This performance is backed by strong financials , but they could be even <i>better</i> and I <b>believe</b> are on track to do so .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Revenue is up <b>nearly</b> $ 4 billion YOY to $ 23.19 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>The 5Q revenue trend, absent of the holiday season Q4, shows nothing but consistent growth.What's notable about their top-line is that Q4 is historically the strongest.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This should come as no <b>surprise</b> to any investor as it 's the holiday shopping season .  (Surprise) </span>Q4 last year reported total revenue of $29.33 billion, up from $20.58 billion, in just three months.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is their best quarter to date and now that we 're factoring the company posting positive earnings for the first time , we have to <b>wonder</b> what Q4 is going to look like .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Backing up a bit , I 'd reasonably expect for revenue for Q3 to be in the high $ 23 billion to low $ 24 billion range , and if Q4 revenue this year does n't top $ 30.5 billion , I 'd be honestly <b>surprised</b> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Naturally , I 'd expect a bearish sentiment to take over the stock ; yet , I do n't <b>believe</b> that this scenario is likely to take place based upon their growth catalysts , which I 'll mention shortly .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's also worth noting that this top line was damaged by FX losses (they recorded a YOY revenue increase of 27% before FX considerations).Major currency pairs under consideration for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( i.e. EUR/USD , GBP/USD , JPY/USD ) have all been relatively flat during Q3 operations and should not have a largely negative effect on earnings . Now, who knows what's in store for Q4 FX headwinds/tailwinds, but keep in mind that this is a potentially major factor affecting Q4 ER.I've been hearing buzz about this company that it's matured.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This company has maintained that their focus is growth and that if it takes on <i>more</i> debt to do so , then so be it .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't <b>believe</b> that this company has matured in the slightest and think their search for a fourth major revenue stream is what keeps them highly relevant and innovative .  (Uncertainty) </span>A very new catalyst is Flex - currently just available in Seattle, it allows anyone over 21 with an Android phone to deliver packages that were ordered via Prime Now.On a human standpoint , this gives the workforce a boost , but for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - the potential is incredibly high . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If they <b>could</b> expand their reach of drivers to any shipping speed and if other smartphones are incorporated , then the attraction certainly grows .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the same sort of wavelength , the Prime Now shipping has begun to extend its reach internationally and this <b>may</b> potentially be a huge catalyst moving forward .  (Uncertainty) </span>Full disclosure , I personally do not use the service as I have patience , but I understand the value-added component <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) has now been around for nine years and is showing the fastest growth rate in terms of segments ; in Q2 it did $ 1.82 billion in revenue , with the YTD total coming in at $ 3.39 billion . This is pretty substantial considering Q2 2014 revenue was only $1 billion.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> features and a growing renewable energy power source are going to be key to this segment 's LT development What 's also notable about AWS is that its geographic reach is expanding .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now in 11 locations , AWS is expanding to India starting next year ; sidebar , we have seen a few crashes here and there on the EC2 , and any further breaches of data are going to have a negative effect on the equity Marketplace remains arguably their most important segment and is seeing a significant growth rate , however it is lagging behind AWS ; since this provides the majority of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's total revenue , this needs to see a pickup <b>sometime</b> soon Paying $ 99 a year for Prime is a bargain because you get free shipping and a large amount of free video , music , and e-book content . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Additionally , Prime user growth is really the key in evaluating this segment , and it 's up 15 % in just two years Expansion into Japan is a great step in the international rollout in the form of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Instant Video and Fire TV ; Prime members will also be able to pay an annual fee to access Japanese content Twitch has plans to expand into the VR market , which is presenting itself as a multi-billion dollar revenue stream many years down the line . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'd expect initial revenue from the VR market to hit <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>sometime</b> around Q3 or Q4 2016 Continued expansion in North America is vital ; OI is up 113 % YOY right now and net sales are up 26 % YOY - both trends are showing staggering growth but can continue to outpace competitors . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire TV Gaming Edition really has a lot going for it in terms of being able to garner sales ; it directly competes with Apple TV 4 , and even has a controller and SD card bundled up for $ 140 . I fully expect this to help them boost their streaming market share , in the wake of increasing competition from Hulu I keep hearing concerns about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in terms of valuation and , relatively speaking , whether or not I can justify it for a certain time horizon . Since I'm mostly looking at trades that'll take me through Q1 2016, I'm on a short-term track.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is much <i>larger</i> than many of the companies I trade and I 'll see if I ca n't justify it from a <i>more</i> technical perspective . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I chose a bit different comparable universe , one that was focused <i>more</i> perhaps on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's core business : OCF : $ 15.6 billion in Q2 , FCF : $ 13.55 billion in Q2 Even when I invest on a short-term basis , I am looking for a company 's ability to generate long time horizon sustainable cash flows , because I use this as a benefit of the <b>doubt</b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I have my doubts about the sustainability of both Ebay and Alibaba to provide stable cash flows , and as a caveat , I understand that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's high rate of spending is going to affect its future cash flows , yet I know the revenue base is far <i>more</i> <b>predictable</b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple is the only one out of the above comparable universe that pays a dividend , and while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should n't pay a dividend until FCF passes $ 1 billion consistently , I <b>believe</b> it 's in a <i>better</i> position to pay out than Alibaba and Ebay . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Speculating</b> , however , it 'd be in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's best interest to compete with these players on a financial front by providing a kickback to shareholders and enticing <i>more</i> entries . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>What is this company going to look like when it stops spending so much?That's a question that we all want answered, of course.Right now, the company has a debt to equity of 70.11, a quick of 0.79 and a current of 1.10.While these metrics are pretty in line with the industry , we all want <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to reduce its future debt burden . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>LT debt stands at over $ 15 billion and has grown <b>nearly</b> $ 9 billion in five quarters .  (Uncertainty) </span>Looking at expenses in light of R&D on a yearly basis, we see that the 5Y trend has been quite steep.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since 2010 , R&D has increased <b>nearly</b> $ 7 billion to a 2014 total of $ 8.72 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So far , the company has spent $ 5.77 billion in R&D this year and if that pace continues , R&D will be up 32.3 % versus 2014 .  (Uncertainty) </span>OCF doesn't come close to covering this, and that presents a serious problem in and of itself.However , at some point , R&D is going to level off , most likely when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> finds that `` fourth space '' to operate in . That's the catalyst that we have to bet on.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also , I 'm not <b>worried</b> about the maturities stacking against them , however , because they only have $ 1.75 billion worth of LT debt maturing in the next 2.5 years , and current cash flows will be able to cover that just fine .  (Uncertainty) </span>Furthermore, TTM FCF is at $4.37 billion for Q2, which has quadrupled YOY.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the trade you make today and five years from now laugh at your <i>younger</i> self for not getting in <i>sooner</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Do you remember 1997 when this stock debuted at $18/share?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I do n't ( granted , I was 2 years old - I <b>hope</b> you have a <i>better</i> excuse ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That's the time you should've bought in.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Would ` ves , <b>could</b> ` ves , should ` ves , but the fact remains that historical performance so far has done nothing to dissuade investors .  (Uncertainty) </span>For example, the top line has increased $54 billion in just five years.I 'm not going to bet against <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> unless significant headwinds develop and right now I feel the growth catalysts are too good to pass up . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
