class='textDiv'>Why Im Buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Right Now Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Concerns over valuation and cash flow growth are overblown as this company should be evaluated from a growth perspective The growth catalysts are showing Amazons push towards a fourth major revenue stream which could seriously put this company out of reach for competitors Im not one to pick up bigname equities as I believed they get wrecked by the market in aggregate compared to lessknown names That being said Im looking to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN to change my mind Were just a few months away from the biggest ecommerce season of the year and Im asking the bold question how will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hold up versus expectations in the holiday season In my opinion we have to evaluate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>from a growth perspective and I fully believe that this stock is going to continue to drive topline growth and end up beating expectations in Q YTD Amazons stock has performed exceptionally well with only the recent spike in volatility causing havoc in its price The substantial runs outside of earnings seasons completely outpace major market indexes After observing this trend for quite some time Ive noticed that any substantial changes in the RSI prove to be rather shortlived and that it actually tends to be relatively stable compared to what Ive seen from Amazons peers Below you can see said trend This performance is backed by strong financials but they could be even better and I believe are on track to do so Revenue is up nearly billion YOY to billion The Q revenue trend absent of the holiday season Q shows nothing but consistent growth Whats notable about their topline is that Q is historically the strongest This should come as no surprise to any investor as its the holiday shopping season Q last year reported total revenue of billion up from billion in just three months This is their best quarter to date and now that were factoring the company posting positive earnings for the first time we have to wonder what Q is going to look like Backing up a bit Id reasonably expect for revenue for Q to be in the high billion to low billion range and if Q revenue this year doesnt top billion Id be honestly surprised Naturally Id expect a bearish sentiment to take over the stock yet I dont believe that this scenario is likely to take place based upon their growth catalysts which Ill mention shortly Its also worth noting that this top line was damaged by FX losses they recorded a YOY revenue increase of before FX considerations Major currency pairs under consideration for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ie EURUSD GBPUSD JPYUSD have all been relatively flat during Q operations and should not have a largely negative effect on earnings Now who knows whats in store for Q FX headwindstailwinds but keep in mind that this is a potentially major factor affecting Q ER Ive been hearing buzz about this company that its matured This company has maintained that their focus is growth and that if it takes on more debt to do so then so be it I dont believe that this company has matured in the slightest and think their search for a fourth major revenue stream is what keeps them highly relevant and innovative A very new catalyst is Flex currently just available in Seattle it allows anyone over with an Android phone to deliver packages that were ordered via Prime Now On a human standpoint this gives the workforce a boost but for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the potential is incredibly high If they could expand their reach of drivers to any shipping speed and if other smartphones are incorporated then the attraction certainly grows On the same sort of wavelength the Prime Now shipping has begun to extend its reach internationally and this may potentially be a huge catalyst moving forward Full disclosure I personally do not use the service as I have patience but I understand the valueadded component <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS has now been around for nine years and is showing the fastest growth rate in terms of segments in Q it did billion in revenue with the YTD total coming in at billion This is pretty substantial considering Q revenue was only billion More features and a growing renewable energy power source are going to be key to this segments LT development Whats also notable about AWS is that its geographic reach is expanding Now in locations AWS is expanding to India starting next year sidebar we have seen a few crashes here and there on the EC and any further breaches of data are going to have a negative effect on the equity Marketplace remains arguably their most important segment and is seeing a significant growth rate however it is lagging behind AWS since this provides the majority of Amazons total revenue this needs to see a pickup sometime soon Paying a year for Prime is a bargain because you get free shipping and a large amount of free video music and ebook content Additionally Prime user growth is really the key in evaluating this segment and its up in just two years Expansion into Japan is a great step in the international rollout in the form of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Instant Video and Fire TV Prime members will also be able to pay an annual fee to access Japanese content Twitch has plans to expand into the VR market which is presenting itself as a multibillion dollar revenue stream many years down the line Id expect initial revenue from the VR market to hit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sometime around Q or Q Continued expansion in North America is vital OI is up YOY right now and net sales are up YOY both trends are showing staggering growth but can continue to outpace competitors The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire TV Gaming Edition really has a lot going for it in terms of being able to garner sales it directly competes with Apple TV and even has a controller and SD card bundled up for I fully expect this to help them boost their streaming market share in the wake of increasing competition from Hulu I keep hearing concerns about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in terms of valuation and relatively speaking whether or not I can justify it for a certain time horizon Since Im mostly looking at trades thatll take me through Q Im on a shortterm track However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is much larger than many of the companies I trade and Ill see if I cant justify it from a more technical perspective I chose a bit different comparable universe one that was focused more perhaps on Amazons core business OCF billion in Q FCF billion in Q Even when I invest on a shortterm basis I am looking for a companys ability to generate long time horizon sustainable cash flows because I use this as a benefit of the doubt I have my doubts about the sustainability of both Ebay and Alibaba to provide stable cash flows and as a caveat I understand that Amazons high rate of spending is going to affect its future cash flows yet I know the revenue base is far more predictable Apple is the only one out of the above comparable universe that pays a dividend and while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shouldnt pay a dividend until FCF passes billion consistently I believe its in a better position to pay out than Alibaba and Ebay Speculating however itd be in Amazons best interest to compete with these players on a financial front by providing a kickback to shareholders and enticing more entries What is this company going to look like when it stops spending so much Thats a question that we all want answered of course Right now the company has a debt to equity of a quick of and a current of While these metrics are pretty in line with the industry we all want <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to reduce its future debt burden LT debt stands at over billion and has grown nearly billion in five quarters Looking at expenses in light of RD on a yearly basis we see that the Y trend has been quite steep Since RD has increased nearly billion to a total of billion So far the company has spent billion in RD this year and if that pace continues RD will be up versus OCF doesnt come close to covering this and that presents a serious problem in and of itself However at some point RD is going to level off most likely when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>finds that fourth space to operate in Thats the catalyst that we have to bet on Also Im not worried about the maturities stacking against them however because they only have billion worth of LT debt maturing in the next years and current cash flows will be able to cover that just fine Furthermore TTM FCF is at billion for Q which has quadrupled YOY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the trade you make today and five years from now laugh at your younger self for not getting in sooner Do you remember when this stock debuted at share I dont granted I was years old I hope you have a better excuse Thats the time you shouldve bought in Wouldves couldves shouldves but the fact remains that historical performance so far has done nothing to dissuade investors For example the top line has increased billion in just five years Im not going to bet against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>unless significant headwinds develop and right now I feel the growth
