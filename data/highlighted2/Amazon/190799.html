( NASDAQ : AAPL ) | Seeking Alpha Jeff Bezos plays hardball , bans Apple TV and Google Chromecast . There is no such thing as store neutrality.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has all the right to forbid rival products on its online marketplace . The new games-centric Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) TV 4 already prompted <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) to immediately counter it with the $ 140 Fire TV Gaming Edition . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , even though Apple 's streaming video TV box is <i>more</i> expensive , Jeff Bezos still felt the need to ban it from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's marketplace . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The Verge says <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's decision is a baffling question but it is so easy to understand . Apple 's decision to release a console gaming iOS TV device and its ambition to become a streaming video service provider are seen as threats by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Bezos therefore promptly exercised his prerogative to eliminate current and upcoming threats to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> there is no such thing as retail store neutrality .  (Uncertainty) </span>The store owner has every right to exclusively sell its own products.It is in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's best interest to stop helping Apple and its third-party partners sell the new vastly improved Apple TV 4 units . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is <b>anxious</b> to protect its Fire TV and Prime Video business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Bezos is no longer happy that Apple and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) are exploiting <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's online store and customer base to propagate their competing products and video streaming business . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was only being polite in using the excuse that the Apple TV and Chromecast are not compatible with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's release of the games/apps-friendly Fire TV stick last year helped it outsell the Apple TV 3 . This was largely due to Apple's non-inclusion of games and apps on its Apple TV 3.However, Apple's decision to make its new TV box games/apps-friendly eliminated the only advantage of the Fire TV.It is true that Apple is having a hard time getting a content licensing deal with content owners, which led to the postponement of that company's subscription-based streaming TV/video service.However, 2016 is just around the corner.Tim Cook is hell-bent that Apple will have its own streaming video business next year.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> knows all too well that Apple has enough cash to eventually pay what Hollywood is demanding for it content library . Banning the Apple TV is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's little way of further delaying/limiting the dissemination of a rival hardware/service . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is wrong for people to <b>assume</b> that this will not have an impact on sales of the Apple TV 3 and 4 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Yes, Apple has its own online shop and retail stores to offload its streaming device.However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's vast marketplace definitely helped sell many units of the Apple TV products in North America and in other markets where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> operates . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ban is going to hurt sales of the Apple TV to the point that it will continue to lag behind the Fire TV . It is an intentional attack specifically against Apple TV.Bezos will still allow Roku to sell its products because that firm does n't seem to have any intention of competing with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and Instant Video . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will also still allow the sale of Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) Xbox One and PlayStation 4 . Unlike Apple, Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Microsoft have not made any overt announcement that they will build their own subscription-based streaming media business in the U.S. Billions of dollars are at stake in the U.S. streaming TV/video industry.This is not only about hardware sales.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> vicious battle is over getting the most people to sign up for paid streaming services .  (Surprise) </span>Bezos made the ruthless preemptive strike by banning the Apple TV.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>He did this knowing he is <b>risking</b> a retaliatory ban for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Prime Video iOS app . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>According to NPD Group's chart below, 33% of U.S. homes will have streaming media gadgets by next year.The big fight is over who will get the most paying subscribers out of those 31 million American households.Tim Cook definitely wants some of those monthly subscriptions that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and Instant Video now enjoys . It is still up to Tim Cook if he will really retaliate against <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a few apps on the iTunes App Store . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple <b>could</b> use the same excuse that these <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> apps are not compatible with iOS 9 and are therefore worthy of the ban hammer .
