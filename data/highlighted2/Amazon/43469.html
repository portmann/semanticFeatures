A quick search of ceiling fan installers in my area showed two with prices ranging from $165-$210.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'm sure that number will grow over time and prices will become even <i>more</i> competitive .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That said , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Home Services is for <i>smaller</i> projects and I <b>believe</b> it will always only ever be for <i>smaller</i> projects that can easily be attached to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> products . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>ANGI, on the other hand, is for projects large and small.ANGI helps facilitate large projects like full kitchen remodels, for example, which require coordination of many different vendors and schedules, not to mention city permits and other headaches.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is where I <b>believe</b> ANGI really adds value and can lock in dominance if it 's done right .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is where there 's a <i>larger</i> barrier to entry that requires the foundation of trust ANGI has built over the years through its member-fueled site and the laser focus on local services AMZN just does n't have .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Also , ANGI is innovating around tools like SnapFix , which uses a customer 's camera phone to schedule simple projects , to continue to compete for the <i>smaller</i> gigs .  (Surprise) </span>Much like LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) is a one-stop-shop for career building, ANGI is building out an infrastructure as the one-stop-shop for trusted local services.ANGI is laying pipe to be the main conduit in several key areas in the local services space, which will distance it from its competitors.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Innovations like SnapFix and Angie 's List Concierge make it <i>easier</i> than ever for ANGI members to coordinate home projects start to finish .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The recently announced partnership with OnDeck Capital makes it <i>easier</i> than ever for service providers to get financing .  (Surprise) </span>And the exclusive relationships with manufacturers like Shaw Industries and Benjamin Moore give ANGI members valuable discounts on premium brands.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't mean to dismiss the competition or <b>suggest</b> ANGI does n't face strong headwinds .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are significant challenges ahead, both external and internal.ANGI is fighting hard to maintain market share and AMZN entering the fray certainly will not help.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But the <i>bigger</i> risk , I believe , is this flood of competition <b>could</b> cause some critical unforced errors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>ANGI has already had to get creative with promotional packages to try to reverse the trend of declining member growth.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>ANGI also is working hard to expand its non-member marketplace of packaged services with <b>hopes</b> of getting <i>more</i> eyes on the brand .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If ANGI goes too far with all of this and loses focus on serving its core customer , it <b>could</b> backfire .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> ANGI 's membership model works and I do n't want to see that eroded .  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't want ANGI to alienate its core customer, the 40-something Costco mom who helped build the business, by not serving her well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And then there 's that cloud of <b>uncertainty</b> that now surrounds the C-suite at ANGI .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Co-founder and CEO Bill Oesterle unexpectedly announced his departure in mid-April , <b>presumably</b> to return to Indiana politics .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Oesterle will stay until a replacement is found , but until then , there <b>might</b> as well be a big fat question mark sitting in his chair .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These are big <b>risks</b> to weigh when considering ANGI stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I believe the <b>risks</b> are <i>more</i> than priced in at ANGI .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I see a stock trading near its 52-week low.I also see a profitable company operating in the expanding home improvement space (I barely even mentioned healthcare) with double-digit revenue growth and $53 million in cash on hand.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> Wall Street has underestimated ANGI and overestimated its rivals , making this stock worth a second look .
