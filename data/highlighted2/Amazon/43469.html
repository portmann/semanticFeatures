class='textDiv'>Building A Contrarian Case For Angies List Angies List Inc NASDAQANGI Seeking Alpha Contrarian investors may want to take a look at Angies List The membershipbased business model for Angies List is a strength not a weakness The bears say local services portal Angies List NASDAQ ANGI has a busted business model and bigger players are entering the space Many bulls are simply holding on for dear life praying that a savior will swoop in and buy the company ANGI has had a rocky life on Wall Street and many dont expect ANGI to survive Thats exactly why I decided to dig deeper Were all contrarians After all the best time to buy a stock is when expectations are low and potential is high Who doesnt want to find that tiny glimmer of hope in the pile of poop that is the muchhated company of the day snapping up the likes of Netflix NASDAQ NFLX at after it tried to pull a Qwikster on us and riding it up to the contentcreating powerhouse stock it is today ANGI is not NFLX at least not yet But Im here to make a case for ANGI as a hidden gem that much like NFLX may be much more than what it appears to be on the surface I have two main points ANGIs business is built on trust People trust ANGI to direct them to professionals who arent going to work them over ANGI is betting that most people who care about important things like their health home and main mode of transportation will pay a small membership fee to guarantee they are well taken care of ANGI now has more than million members with an average renewal rate of according to its Q results Thats a strong base providing predictable revenue for ANGI along with the more intangible benefits Ill discuss later Growth in membership is slowing some down yearoveryear according to Q results and the renewal rate declined slightly down from according to Q results Thats something ANGI will have to shore up But ANGI is learning how to acquire new members more efficiently ANGIs cost per acquisition is down from one year ago according to Q results ANGIs first quarter showed revenue growth of yearoveryear to million and ANGI turned in an unexpected profit of per share for the quarter Not bad for a forgettable stock Revenue was a slight disappointment but earnings blew away analyst estimates of per share ANGI explained in the Q report revenue from members declined due to more promotional membership packages However income from participating service providers more than made up the difference It reflected ANGIs strategy to aggressively grow its membership base in order to drive advertising where it gets most of its revenue For ANGIs business model to work customers have to be willing to pay for membership Thats what drives everything Stupid The bears say After all why would people pay up front just to get ratings and reviews they can get at other sites for free Why would people pay just to get in the front door This model cant be sustained I disagree ANGI continues to grow its member base and that forms a solid foundation to launch a more comprehensive business strategy First the typical ANGI member is in the demographic sweet spot for service providers The very fact that members are willing to pay a small fee for ratings from ANGI works like a selfselection tool that practically ensures a highquality base of customers Much like the Costco NASDAQ COST customer willing to pay annually for the right to buy peanut butter by the gallon the ANGI member is costconscious yet more affluent than the average customer According to the business overview section of ANGIs annual report the typical member is between the ages of and is married owns a home is college educated and earns an annual household income of at least ANGI leans on that member base as a major selling point to potential advertisers Second members provide a level of authenticity to the reviews and ratings on the ANGI site only member reviews influence service provider ratings This is an extremely important differentiator in the space ANGI plays in After all a home remodel or repair can be very expensive especially if you hire the wrong contractor ANGI used to be alone in this space Now there is significant competition I could talk about websites like Home Advisor which is ANGIlike and free and Houzz which is kind of like Pinterest for home renovation Both have their advantages But these are smaller competitors and ANGI could adopt bits of what works best on both sites and continue to compete Good companies bob and weave without losing balance I want to talk about one of the big guys the one I believe is really weighing on ANGIs stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is a Death Star that kills companies and it is now orbiting ANGI AMZN has targeted ANGI directly with its recently launched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home Services and the kill shot is coming the bears say Im not so sure I predict AMZN will do very well with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home services It will be a convenient tool for customers to quickly pair an installer with a ceiling fan they just bought on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for example The services on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home Services are easily searchable and the prices are clearly posted A quick search of ceiling fan installers in my area showed two with prices ranging from Im sure that number will grow over time and prices will become even more competitive That said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home Services is for smaller projects and I believe it will always only ever be for smaller projects that can easily be attached to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>products ANGI on the other hand is for projects large and small ANGI helps facilitate large projects like full kitchen remodels for example which require coordination of many different vendors and schedules not to mention city permits and other headaches This is where I believe ANGI really adds value and can lock in dominance if its done right This is where theres a larger barrier to entry that requires the foundation of trust ANGI has built over the years through its memberfueled site and the laser focus on local services AMZN just doesnt have Also ANGI is innovating around tools like SnapFix which uses a customers camera phone to schedule simple projects to continue to compete for the smaller gigs Much like LinkedIn NYSE LNKD is a onestopshop for career building ANGI is building out an infrastructure as the onestopshop for trusted local services ANGI is laying pipe to be the main conduit in several key areas in the local services space which will distance it from its competitors Innovations like SnapFix and Angies List Concierge make it easier than ever for ANGI members to coordinate home projects start to finish The recently announced partnership with OnDeck Capital makes it easier than ever for service providers to get financing And the exclusive relationships with manufacturers like Shaw Industries and Benjamin Moore give ANGI members valuable discounts on premium brands I dont mean to dismiss the competition or suggest ANGI doesnt face strong headwinds There are significant challenges ahead both external and internal ANGI is fighting hard to maintain market share and AMZN entering the fray certainly will not help But the bigger risk I believe is this flood of competition could cause some critical unforced errors ANGI has already had to get creative with promotional packages to try to reverse the trend of declining member growth ANGI also is working hard to expand its nonmember marketplace of packaged services with hopes of getting more eyes on the brand If ANGI goes too far with all of this and loses focus on serving its core customer it could backfire I believe ANGIs membership model works and I dont want to see that eroded I dont want ANGI to alienate its core customer the something Costco mom who helped build the business by not serving her well And then theres that cloud of uncertainty that now surrounds the Csuite at ANGI Cofounder and CEO Bill Oesterle unexpectedly announced his departure in midApril presumably to return to Indiana politics Oesterle will stay until a replacement is found but until then there might as well be a big fat question mark sitting in his chair These are big risks to weigh when considering ANGI stock I believe the risks are more than priced in at ANGI I see a stock trading near its week low I also see a profitable company operating in the expanding home improvement space I barely even mentioned healthcare with doubledigit revenue growth and million in cash on hand I believe Wall Street has underestimated ANGI and overestimated its rivals making this stock worth a second look Source Building A Contrarian Case For Angies List
