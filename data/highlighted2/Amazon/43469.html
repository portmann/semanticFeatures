( NASDAQ : ANGI ) | Seeking Alpha Contrarian investors <b>may</b> want to take a look at Angie 's List .  (Uncertainty) </span>The membership-based business model for Angie's List is a strength, not a weakness.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The bears say local services portal Angie 's List ( NASDAQ : ANGI ) has a busted business model and <i>bigger</i> players are entering the space .  (Surprise) </span>Many bulls are simply holding on for dear life, praying that a savior will swoop in and buy the company.ANGI has had a rocky life on Wall Street and many don't expect ANGI to survive.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's exactly why I decided to dig <i>deeper</i> .  (Surprise) </span>We're all contrarians.After all, the best time to buy a stock is when expectations are low and potential is high.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Who does n't want to find that tiny glimmer of <b>hope</b> in the pile of poop that is the much-hated company of the day , snapping up the likes of Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) at $ 70 after it tried to pull a Qwikster on us and riding it up to the $ 560 content-creating powerhouse stock it is today .  (Uncertainty) </span>ANGI is not NFLX, at least not yet.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But I 'm here to make a case for ANGI as a hidden gem that , much like NFLX , may be much <i>more</i> than what it <b>appears</b> to be on the surface .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I have two main points: ANGI's business is built on trust.People trust ANGI to direct them to professionals who aren't going to work them over.ANGI is betting that most people who care about important things like their health, home and main mode of transportation will pay a small membership fee to guarantee they are well taken care of.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ANGI now has <i>more</i> than 3.1 million members with an average renewal rate of 75 % according to its 2015 Q1 results .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That 's a strong base providing predictable revenue for ANGI along with the <i>more</i> <b>intangible</b> benefits I 'll discuss later .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Growth in membership is slowing some (down 20% year-over-year, according to Q1 results) and the renewal rate declined slightly (down from 76%, according to Q1 results).That's something ANGI will have to shore up.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But ANGI is learning how to acquire new members <i>more</i> efficiently .  (Surprise) </span>ANGI's cost per acquisition is $71, down from $82 one year ago, according to Q1 results.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ANGI 's first quarter showed revenue growth of 15 % year-over-year to $ 83.5 million and ANGI turned in an <b>unexpected</b> profit of $ 0.07 per share for the quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>Not bad for a forgettable stock.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Revenue was a slight <b>disappointment</b> , but earnings blew away analyst estimates of $ 0.00 per share .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ANGI explained in the Q1 report revenue from members declined due to <i>more</i> promotional membership packages .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , income from participating service providers <i>more</i> than made up the difference .  (Surprise) </span>It reflected ANGI's strategy to aggressively grow its membership base in order to drive advertising, where it gets most of its revenue.For ANGI's business model to work, customers have to be willing to pay for membership.That's what drives everything."Stupid!"The bears say.After all, why would people pay up front just to get ratings and reviews they can get at other sites for free?Why would people pay just to get in the front door?This model can't be sustained.I disagree.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ANGI continues to grow its member base and that forms a solid foundation to launch a <i>more</i> comprehensive business strategy .  (Surprise) </span>First, the typical ANGI member is in the demographic sweet spot for service providers.The very fact that members are willing to pay a small fee for ratings from ANGI works like a self-selection tool that practically ensures a high-quality base of customers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Much like the Costco ( NASDAQ : COST ) customer willing to pay $ 50 annually for the right to buy peanut butter by the gallon , the ANGI member is cost-conscious , yet <i>more</i> affluent than the average customer .  (Surprise) </span>According to the business overview section of ANGI's 2014 annual report the "typical member is between the ages of 35 and 64, is married, owns a home, is college educated and earns an annual household income of at least $75,000" ANGI leans on that member base as a major selling point to potential advertisers.Second, members provide a level of authenticity to the reviews and ratings on the ANGI site (only member reviews influence service provider ratings).This is an extremely important differentiator in the space ANGI plays in.After all, a home remodel or repair can be very expensive, especially if you hire the wrong contractor.ANGI used to be alone in this space.Now, there is significant competition.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>could</b> talk about websites like Home Advisor , which is ANGI-like and free , and Houzz , which is kind of like Pinterest for home renovation .  (Uncertainty) </span>Both have their advantages.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But these are <i>smaller</i> competitors and ANGI <b>could</b> adopt bits of what works best on both sites and continue to compete .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Good companies bob and weave without losing balance.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I want to talk about one of the big guys , the one I <b>believe</b> is really weighing on ANGI 's stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is a Death Star that kills companies and it is now orbiting ANGI . AMZN has targeted ANGI directly with its recently launched <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Home Services and the kill shot is coming , the bears say . I'm not so sure.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>predict</b> AMZN will do very well with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Home services . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It will be a convenient tool for customers to quickly pair an installer with a ceiling fan they just bought on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , for example . The services on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Home Services are easily searchable and the prices are clearly posted . A quick search of ceiling fan installers in my area showed two with prices ranging from $165-$210.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'm sure that number will grow over time and prices will become even <i>more</i> competitive .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That said , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Home Services is for <i>smaller</i> projects and I <b>believe</b> it will always only ever be for <i>smaller</i> projects that can easily be attached to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> products . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>ANGI, on the other hand, is for projects large and small.ANGI helps facilitate large projects like full kitchen remodels, for example, which require coordination of many different vendors and schedules, not to mention city permits and other headaches.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is where I <b>believe</b> ANGI really adds value and can lock in dominance if it 's done right .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is where there 's a <i>larger</i> barrier to entry that requires the foundation of trust ANGI has built over the years through its member-fueled site and the laser focus on local services AMZN just does n't have .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Also , ANGI is innovating around tools like SnapFix , which uses a customer 's camera phone to schedule simple projects , to continue to compete for the <i>smaller</i> gigs .  (Surprise) </span>Much like LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) is a one-stop-shop for career building, ANGI is building out an infrastructure as the one-stop-shop for trusted local services.ANGI is laying pipe to be the main conduit in several key areas in the local services space, which will distance it from its competitors.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Innovations like SnapFix and Angie 's List Concierge make it <i>easier</i> than ever for ANGI members to coordinate home projects start to finish .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The recently announced partnership with OnDeck Capital makes it <i>easier</i> than ever for service providers to get financing .  (Surprise) </span>And the exclusive relationships with manufacturers like Shaw Industries and Benjamin Moore give ANGI members valuable discounts on premium brands.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't mean to dismiss the competition or <b>suggest</b> ANGI does n't face strong headwinds .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are significant challenges ahead, both external and internal.ANGI is fighting hard to maintain market share and AMZN entering the fray certainly will not help.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But the <i>bigger</i> risk , I believe , is this flood of competition <b>could</b> cause some critical unforced errors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>ANGI has already had to get creative with promotional packages to try to reverse the trend of declining member growth.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>ANGI also is working hard to expand its non-member marketplace of packaged services with <b>hopes</b> of getting <i>more</i> eyes on the brand .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If ANGI goes too far with all of this and loses focus on serving its core customer , it <b>could</b> backfire .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> ANGI 's membership model works and I do n't want to see that eroded .  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't want ANGI to alienate its core customer, the 40-something Costco mom who helped build the business, by not serving her well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And then there 's that cloud of <b>uncertainty</b> that now surrounds the C-suite at ANGI .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Co-founder and CEO Bill Oesterle unexpectedly announced his departure in mid-April , <b>presumably</b> to return to Indiana politics .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Oesterle will stay until a replacement is found , but until then , there <b>might</b> as well be a big fat question mark sitting in his chair .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These are big <b>risks</b> to weigh when considering ANGI stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I believe the <b>risks</b> are <i>more</i> than priced in at ANGI .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I see a stock trading near its 52-week low.I also see a profitable company operating in the expanding home improvement space (I barely even mentioned healthcare) with double-digit revenue growth and $53 million in cash on hand.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> Wall Street has underestimated ANGI and overestimated its rivals , making this stock worth a second look .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : Building A Contrarian Case For Angie 's List Disclosure : The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned , but <b>may</b> initiate a long position in ANGI over the next 72 hours .
