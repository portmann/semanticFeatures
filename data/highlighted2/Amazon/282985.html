(Uncertainty) </span>Back in the 1970s, it was the "Nifty 50" (mostly American) multinationals that were taking over the world.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the late 1980s , junk bonds , believe it or not , <b>assumed</b> this role ( Institutional Investor magazine actually ran a cover story titled `` The Unsinkable Junk Bond '' ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the late 1990s, it was a handful of hot tech companies that made up for their lack of earnings with surging numbers of "eyeballs."In the 2000s, it was five or six big banks whose traders were, as CNBC liked to put it, "the smartest guys in the world."All of those delusions ended in tears.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yet , here we are again , with a market supported by a few fast-growing tech companies that everyone now <b>assumes</b> to be bulletproof .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and Google ( now Alphabet ) ( GOOG , GOOGL ) , - known as the FANGs - along with Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , have largely sustained an otherwise thin and declining Dow , S&P 500 and Nasdaq over the past year .

(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Shares of Amazon.com are down $ 14.89 or 2.2 % following a downgrade by Monness Crespi & Hardt from a ` buy ' rating to a ` neutral ' rating . From a total of 26 analysts covering Amazon.com stock , 23 rate it a `` Buy '' , 0 a `` Sell '' , and 3 a `` Hold '' . This means that 88% of the ratings are positive.There are at least two red flags here.One is that despite the overwhelmingly positive analyst consensus, a downgrade from a single boutique research shop can knock $20 billion from its market value.The second red flag is analyst opinion generally.Market historians should commission a study to see if any stock has ever risen when 88% of analysts rated it a Buy and no one rated it a Sell.Meanwhile, Apple, after passing Exxon (NYSE: XOM ) and General Electric (NYSE: GE ) to become the most valuable stock ever, has been trending down for several months, and lately, has hit an air pocket on stalling iPhone sales.Apple Falls on Nikkei Report That Sees iPhone Production Cut 30% (Bloomberg) - Apple Inc. fell after Japan's Nikkei Asian Review reported the U.S. company would reduce the output of its latest iPhones by about 30 percent in the first quarter of 2016.Shares of the world's most valuable company dropped 2.8 percent to $102.42 at 12:17 p.m. in New York.They declined 4.6 percent in 2016.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple had initially told parts suppliers to keep production of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models for the January-March period at the same level as for their predecessors iPhone 6 and 6 Plus a year <i>earlier</i> , the Nikkei reported .
