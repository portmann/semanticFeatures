( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Accusations that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is cooking up the books can not be substantiated . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Its definition and use of Free Cash Flow is both correct and contributing to <i>better</i> insight .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As the unique aspects of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business model become <i>more</i> <b>apparent</b> , its financial reporting will inevitably become <i>more</i> transparent , turning skepticism into admiration and finally <i>higher</i> valuation . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>While `` Transparent '' is a richly awarded Comedy in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Original TV Series , having received 11 Emmy Awards and two Golden Globes so far , transparency is not usually associated with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's style of financial reporting . However , harsh criticism that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is cooking up the books should be dismissed . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recently , a highly critical tone was struck again in a Seeking Alpha article written by John Spaid , under the title , Capital Lease <b>Confusion</b> , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Financial Engineering Strategy for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It harks back to another article already published in December of last year by SA contributor Slim Shady with the title , Understanding How <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Use of Capital Leases Overstates Its Cash Flow Metrics . Although both articles reveal profound knowledge of financial accounting , they also , in my humble opinion , demonstrate a myopic focus on accounting practices and a neglect of some unique features of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business model . In both articles , it is being claimed that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> deliberately overstates its Free Cash Flow figure by making use of capital leases to finance a big chunk of its capital spending on Property , Plant and Equipment ( PP&E ) . Capex financed by capital leases, as they correctly state, never shows up as a cash outlay in the operating cash flow but are dealt with in the financing section of the Cash Flow Statement.As Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operations minus capex, free cash flow is overstated by this same amount of capex as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Moreover , as all capex <b>appears</b> on the asset side on the balance sheet , including the part financed by capital lease ( which is capitalized ) , all depreciation on PP&E is added back to the operating cash flow and consequently included in the free cash flow .  (Uncertainty) </span>Thus, capital lease accounting gives rise to double instances of overstating: part of capex is not included as cash outlay whereas all depreciation is added back to the operating cash flow.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The authors admit that , strictly speaking , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doing nothing wrong but should be <i>less</i> vocal when it shows off its FCF in presentations and during conference calls . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's use of FCF <b>may</b> be formally correct , they contend that in its unannotated version , it is grossly and intentionally misleading . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In my opinion, it is a difficult position to defend that a correct application of accounting principles can be at the same time highly misleading.In spite of all the harsh words used and suspicions made , the accusation that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is cooking up the book can not be substantiated . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's three measures of Free Cash Flow It is all about the definition of FCF one uses . There are different concepts of FCF and in the case of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , three of them are especially relevant . In its SEC 10-K reports , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> takes great effort in annotating the FCF concept it uses . In fact, it explicitly reports the FCF at three different levels which logically follow from each other: 1) the classic FCF (operating cash minus 'out of cash' capital spending), 2) the same as the classic FCF but minus repayments on capital and financial leases and 3) the classic FCF minus all capex irrespective of being paid out of cash or financed by a capital lease agreement.Applied to the FY 2014 figures, the FCF1= $1.949 million, FCF2 = $529 million while FCF3= minus $2,194 million.There is no mystery or concealment.It is for everyone to see and free to interpret in the best way he can.Now, we should not expect every investor to read the SEC 10-K report from cover to cover, but we can be sure that any financial analyst who takes his or her task seriously, knows where to find this information and will use it in understanding the company.Indeed , there is something to learn from these different FCF concepts as applied by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . For that , we should not solely stare at accounting figures but must use some imagination as well and try to reconstruct and understand <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business and earnings model . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has grown into a rather complicated business model in which it currently combines at least three different companies : 1 ) it is an online retailer , 2 ) a retail and wholesale enabler and fulfiller for others and 3 ) a provider of web services and cloud computing . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This list is probably not exhaustive as we <b>may</b> already add a streaming media company/content producer as well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One day it <b>may</b> even start operating a parcel delivery company of its own when it has enough scale to compete with UPS ( NYSE : UPS ) and FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) ( which is imminent , I think ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>All these activities are being developed within the same model of an online retailer which actually does no longer fit them but is nevertheless being maintained as to make it not too easy for competitors to understand ( and copy ) what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doing . As the highly disruptive company it is , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the natural focal point for many who wish to grab a share of the fast growing online retail market or incumbents who must defend their position . As Jeff Bezos demonstrated himself, in the first pioneering years there were, besides creative imagination and true entrepreneurship, hardly any entry barriers to newcomers.The only really effective one, scale, was still to be established.Obtaining that scale necessitated full focus on growing volume first rather than earnings.It also required that Bezos kept his cards close to the chest.An online business is open to any visitor, whether customer or competitor.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is true that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's figures are not as transparent as analysts <b>might</b> wish but shareholders have in that respect the same interest as the company and its founder . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Shareholders have long been left in the dark about the size , the growth and profitability of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's web services . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since the first quarter of this year , now that this cloud computing business has established itself as the uncontestable market leader , shareholders and others are allowed <i>more</i> insight into this part of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Would it have been in the shareholder 's interest when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would have been utterly transparent at an early stage about its strategy ? How would its main competitors, deep pocketed giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ), have reacted?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They too have been taken by <b>surprise</b> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And a positive <b>surprise</b> it has been , at least for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's shareholders . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>My take on this is that the reason why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> willingly directed ( as it still does ) all attention to the formal , first version of FCF , was that the company <b>could</b> not afford to report on new businesses as transparently as a company would do at a much <i>more</i> mature stage of development . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The use of capital leases must also be regarded in that respect.It allowed for developing and financing revolutionary web and cloud services without attracting too much attention to them.With hindsight, investors can only admit that it was the best thing and in their best interest to do.A true economic rationale for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's use of conventional Free Cash Flow But there is also a true economic rationale and justification to still keep using the conventional FCF as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does in its quarterly presentation . It reveals that it is growing fast and that the '12 trailing months' figures have reached a level of $4,474 million in the second quarter of this year.This figure expresses closest the free cash flow of the oldest core of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , i.e. its online retail business . It would have blurred the true insight in this part of the business if the large investments in AWS would have been treated in the same way as the capital spending in the online retail business.Most of the capital spending at AWS is in servers, which have an expected useful life of three years and are depreciated accordingly.On the other hand, AWS's revenue are essentially based on some form of subscription and payment as you go.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This business <b>appears</b> to be quite sticky .  (Uncertainty) </span>Customers face serious exit barriers, as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) who is one of the largest among them, will acknowledge.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once a customer , always a customer <b>seems</b> to be a reality here ( the same holds , by the way , also for FBA , fulfilled by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , the part of the online retail business in which <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> acts as an enabler and fulfiller on behalf of third parties ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Because of these special characteristics, it is quite appropriate to have this part of capital spending financed by capital lease agreements.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By doing so , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> not only separates capex in retail business from web services , thus giving a <i>better</i> analytic insight into the latter 's true FCF than when everything had been lumped together . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But by matching AWS 's revenue with the capital lease repayments ( which are almost all related to AWS ) , analysts obtain the insight that this part of the business , as highly profitable as it already <b>may</b> be , does not generate positive cash flows yet .  (Uncertainty) </span>Again , as in online retail , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is with AWS fully focused on obtaining scale and must therefore keep allocating considerable amounts on capex . But most importantly, this treatment of the FCF underscores the favorable characteristics of delivering cloud computing services - (1) perfect pricing based on fully measured usage, (2) stickiness of customers, and (3) immediate and continuous scalability.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does not need to reinvest its fast growing positive FCF from its retail business in AWS but can fully rely on capital leases whenever the need arises . In a way , the main rationale of cloud computing for users , which is using computing power when and where needed at the required scale without investment , has been extended to AWS as a whole and has become a highly favorable feature of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business model . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this feature of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's model is well understood , criticism <b>may</b> turn into appreciation . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In the table below , it is shown that not only FCF-1 , the conventional free cash flow definition that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> rightfully focuses on , is positive and has been growing sharply during the last 10 quarters but also that FCF-2 has begun following a comparable path . Only FCF-3, the cash flow definition that comprises all PP&E that is acquired under capital lease, is still negative.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , this final cash flow version will , because of the high profitability of web services , <b>probably</b> turn positive rather <i>sooner</i> than later .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In case it would remain negative much <i>longer</i> , it would be because of continued extraordinary growth , in which case , it would be a highly positive factor in the valuation of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's profits . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Specific asset related capital leasing does not set constraints on valuation , it is automatically extended upon purchase of equipment and does not interfere with other parts of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . It is the most appropriate form of financing for AWS in its current high growth phase.Beyond Free Cash Flow : fast growing earnings This year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenue will exceed the $ 100 billion level . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It might be the tipping point , at least in the USA , where delivery costs <b>could</b> switch from costs into revenue as the part of retail sales fulfilled by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( FBA ) , which have already surpassed <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's own retail activities , will grow <i>steeper</i> , reaching sufficient scale to sustain a closely knit delivery network . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In that situation , delivery charges carried on to customers <b>may</b> outstrip total delivery costs .  (Uncertainty) </span>The home market will be the first to reach this tipping point followed by overseas operations later on.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>AWS , and most likely FBA too , command considerably <i>higher</i> margins than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's own retail activities , which <b>might</b> at some future point be seen as the necessary start that positioned <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to becoming in the end a pure trade enabler and fulfiller in the broadest sense , including all computing and software services for online retailers and service providers to conduct their business . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The overall operating profit margin will be in accordance with this high service level and, at a mature stage, is poised to reach a multiple of that of traditional retailers in their heyday.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenue has grown since 2011 by an average 22.8 % per year . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With all the recently extended delivery services under Prime and the international expansion well underway , it is highly <b>probable</b> that a 15-20 % revenue growth rate can be maintained for many years to come .  (Uncertainty) </span>That part of the equation is the least hard to fill in.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It will all <b>depend</b> on the operating profit margin how this will work out in future net income .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If that profit margin would be around 10 % or above , which I think is quite reasonable to expect , the stock is not excessively priced and still offers good LT potential .
