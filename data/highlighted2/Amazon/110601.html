( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Day is a basic merchandising clearance sale . Look at the top line, not the bottom line.Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) announced it will hold a `` Prime Day '' on July 15 , with big sales on electronics , ostensibly to celebrate its 20th anniversary . Some analysts , with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's encouragement , are already comparing this to Alibaba 's ( NYSE : BABA ) `` Singles Day '' event , or the `` Black Friday '' that occurs the day after Thanksgiving . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But nothing <b>could</b> be further from the truth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's a clearance sale , nothing <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But nothing <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> needs to clear its warehouse of remainders and overstocks so it will have room for its next two big events , its next electronics launch and the Back to School shopping season . It just so happens that mid-July is the site's anniversary.The news tells us several things about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , some bad and some good . Start with the bad.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is overstocked . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to dump some merchandise , just like an ordinary bricks-and-mortar store . Making it a "celebration" is a great distraction from these problems.Now in with the good.This sale is aimed at its best customers, those who are already paying it $99/year to belong to Prime.Rewarding your best customers, rather than new customers, is simply good merchandising.The fact that this general law has dawned on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> management is a good thing . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Over the next 10 days , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going to also bang the drum on this event in <b>hope</b> of selling <i>more</i> Prime memberships . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The fact is that membership has become as important to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's bottom line as it is to Costco 's ( NASDAQ : COST ) . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has always been cagey over just how many Prime members there are - the most recent analyst estimate is 40 million . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At $ 99 per member , we 're talking over $ 4 billion per year on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's top line , just from membership fees , and billions <i>more</i> from the extra purchases Prime members make - conversion rates on Prime shopping baskets are ginormous . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The sale , coming about a week before the company 's next earnings report , also indicates the company <b>may</b> be working <i>harder</i> to court investors .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The second and third quarters of the year are usually a retailer's worst, and analysts are expecting a loss of 15 cents this quarter, and another loss next quarter.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> uses stock in its executive compensation and buybacks to keep the share count level . The number to watch is the top line, expected to be $22.35 billion which would be 15% ahead of what it did a year ago.That would seem to be an easy number to clear given the strength of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> needs to please analysts given the 41 % gain investors have become since the start of the year . Most of that was booked right after the full 2014 numbers came out in January.The stock moved sideways after the January report, then scored another huge jump after the first quarter numbers came out, and it has moved sideways since.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has done a number of small things over the last quarter aimed at boosting its bottom line at minimal cost , like selling ads on boxes . Bears will say it smacks of desperation, bulls will say it's just smart.For now I go with the bulls.Source : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Day Is Not Alibaba 's Singles Day Disclosure : I am/we are long AMZN , COST . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
