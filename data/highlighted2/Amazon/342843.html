(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha On Monday, rumor has it a new iPad model will replace the iPad Air 2.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Reports <b>suggest</b> Apple will abandon the Air concept and create a slightly <i>smaller</i> Pro .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Shifting from an Air to Pro philosophy is probably not the worst idea , but it wo n't reverse the <b>nearly</b> 40 % decline in iPad unit sales .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple's continued fidelity to Steve Jobs's insistence that tablets not become mere consumption devices is undermining Apple's second most important product line.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Lower</i> cost iPads will be necessary to compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Samsung , but Apple can preserve margin on these devices and boost profits by expanding digital sales on the platform . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple needs to embrace iPad as a content consumption device that <b>could</b> potentially revolutionize television the way iPod revolutionized music .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although it has been delayed a week from its original launch , <b>rumors</b> continue to buzz that Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) will debut a new iPad Monday .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Usually reliable sources <b>suggest</b> the new iPad will shift the product line away from the Air philosophy of the last two iterations and towards the Pro model , which was debuted in larger-screen form last year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple 's ( presumed ) move actually keeps with the <b>prediction</b> of Seeking Alpha 's own Mark Hibben .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , it <b>may</b> not be the correct move .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Typical of the `` consumers do n't know what they want '' company , Apple <b>appears</b> to have decided to go against the prevailing trend in the tablet market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This time , it <b>may</b> hurt them .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The thesis of this article is that the company that created the tablet market <b>may</b> be misreading where it is going next .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am not accusing Apple of being idle.To his credit, Apple CEO Tim Cook has not tried to hide anything.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When iPod sales got small enough and Apple Watch sales <b>disappointed</b> , Apple simply folded them into <i>larger</i> categories to hide the gory details .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite some suggestions he <b>might</b> do the same with iPad as sales went into freefall , Cook has taken the open and honest route .  (Uncertainty) </span>He is also hard at work trying to reverse the trend.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite being in the shadow of perhaps America 's greatest CEO in history , Cook has not been <b>afraid</b> to reverse Jobs-era policies when he feels they are hurting the company .  (Uncertainty) </span>One such move: enterprise, which Jobs famously shunned , but Cook has made a full-court press to woo.The recent release of the oversized iPad Pro was the latest step, and the biggest.Cook already had Apple working with his former employer, IBM (NYSE: IBM ), to push Apple hardware to enterprise customers and collaborate on vertically integrated software for specific businesses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now he has a piece of hardware to match Apple 's new ambitions , with a number of features built into the iPad Pro that suggest it <b>might</b> be the first tablet actually built with businesses , not consumers , in mind .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is also tackling the software side.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition to creating new apps with IBM for enterprise , Apple is also working on Classroom , to help make iOS <i>more</i> appealing to schools .  (Surprise) </span>Marketing is getting a refresh too, with not just Cook, but the entire senior leadership of Apple dispatched to give interviews and showcases about Apple products, especially iPad, to enterprise customers.The strategy is bearing some fruit, as Apple continues to expand its enterprise partnerships.But it was not enough.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple 's recent sales figures showed another decline in tablet sales , down <b>almost</b> 40 % in unit sales from the 2013 peak and down 25 % from even last year 's depressed number .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's <b>possible</b> iPad Pro simply was too new and not available in sufficient quantities .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> it has n't been given enough time to move the needle .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's certainly Apple's preferred take on it.Cook says drawing enterprises into the iPad ecosystem will take time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given Apple 's twelve-figure cash hoard , Apple can certainly afford to be patient with a new strategy , but what it ca n't afford to do is ignore evidence it <b>may</b> be on the wrong track , especially when that evidence comes in the form of a competitor in hot pursuit to supplant it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Certainly , there is no immediate danger of that , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is going to try . It's $50 Fire tablet vaulted it all the way back to third place for tablet sales over the holiday period last year, a 175% increase in a single year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Samsung ( OTC : SSNLF ) falls victim to the same sales decline as Apple , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> posts another strong year of growth , it <b>may</b> take over second place this holiday season . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's tablets have long been mocked as `` fruitcake tablets , '' things people buy for children or loved ones as gifts , but do n't want for themselves . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They are <i>smaller</i> , <i>less</i> powerful , and have <i>lower</i> resolutions .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But they are much , much <i>cheaper</i> .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has long since made its philosophy , and strategy , clear . It sees tablets as mere gateways to customers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Fire is sold <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> at cost to encourage the purchase of both digital content , and <i>more</i> importantly , Prime memberships , which spur sales of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's physical goods in the general retail sector . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is anathema to Apple , which not only considers itself exclusively a purveyor of premium products , but also inherited from its late founder a visceral distaste for any <b>suggestion</b> a tablet should settle for such a small role in the human condition .  (Uncertainty) </span>When Steve Jobs released the first iPad in 2010, he had only one regret, as documented in his official biography.He had set the bar too low.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> than one reviewer said they loved using their tablet to consume content , but it lacked the necessary tools to really be a creator of content .  (Surprise) </span>Jobs, who usually didn't have much use for outside criticism of his ideas, took the reviews hard because he thought they were right.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When he designed the iPad 2 , one of the last products before his death , he pushed to incorporate content creation tools like a second camera and <i>more</i> powerful software .  (Surprise) </span>This attitude, that tablets are for content creation as well as consumption, has outlived its creator at Apple to the present day.Tim Cook himself made explicit reference to it when launching the iPhone 5s in September 2013.Apple was just starting to get some early evidence that iPad's growth was levelling, and he spent a considerable amount of time at the keynote pushing the theme.Apple devices, he said, were "great for consuming content," but they were "incredible for creating content."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To make sure everyone got the message that tablets were for creating things , he took Apple 's five best content creation apps , which usually cost $ 20 apiece , and announced that henceforth they would all be free , an <b>unusually</b> generous giveaway by the unapologetically stingy Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Less</i> than a month after the event , Cook called all reporters back for another product launch where he unveiled iPad Air , priced at the same $ 499 despite the proliferation of lower-cost alternatives , and with <i>more</i> tools than ever for artists .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You could <b>almost</b> hear Apple 's engineers and management shouting `` create , dammit , create ! ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Meanwhile, "The Everything Store" was positively embracing the ideal of consumption.Fifty dollars is a breakthrough price, but it also means consumers know they aren't getting everything they would get with a $500 iPad.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to make trade-offs to hit that price target , and their success <b>hinges</b> on if they can identify correctly which aspects of a tablet 's functions , specs and capabilities customers value most and which ones they are willing to go without to achieve savings . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This is sort of the mirror image of Apple's problem, which is to keep coming up with new capabilities that persuade people to keep paying up for their top-of-the-line model.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has come to focus <b>almost</b> exclusively on content consumption as a tablet 's reason for being . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Its cameras are mediocre, its screens just big enough to enjoy a movie but not really big enough to work on.But it gives literally thousands of free apps to every Fire owner, and free trials of its Prime Music and Prime Video services.And it keeps cutting prices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The fact that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> tablet sales rose while Apple sales fell suggests <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> be on to something . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At the very least , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>seems</b> to have a <i>better</i> finger than Apple does on the pulse of what consumers want to see as incremental improvements in their tablets . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Lower</i> costs for hardware and content <b>seems</b> to trump <i>stronger</i> processor power , <i>bigger</i> screens or <i>better</i> cameras .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even Cook 's ambition to put iPads in every school <b>may</b> fall short , as schools on tight government budgets will certainly consider cost as one of the prime factors in determining whose tablets they purchase .  (Uncertainty) </span>The refresh rate on tablets is further evidence of the trend.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Confounding predictions that they would be replaced every two years or so like smartphones , people are holding onto their tablets for three , four years , <b>sometimes</b> even <i>longer</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And when they finally do replace them, they often pass down their current model to a family member who finds its adequate to their needs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This behavior is consistent with people finding that <i>older</i> equipment with <i>older</i> processors is <i>more</i> than enough for the tasks they actually use the tablet for , namely content consumption .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They simply are n't motivated to constantly shell out $ 500 <i>more</i> to get the latest content creation tools .  (Surprise) </span>Rather than continuing to fight this trend, Apple should learn to embrace it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The fact that most iPads are being used as mini-TVs , not mini art boards , is no reason to be <b>disappointed</b> .  (Surprise) </span>TV is as desperately in need of a revolution today as just about any other industry.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple is <i>more</i> than capable of beating <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at its own game . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video has become considerably <i>more</i> compelling content-wise over the last few years , it is still essentially little <i>more</i> than a poor man 's Netflix . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It has no news, no sports, and even the scripted fare is not as good as Netflix.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does not have the cash flow or profits to make its tablets the center of an entertainment revolution . But Apple does.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's cash hoard is <i>more</i> than sufficient to bring TV kicking and screaming into the 21st century .  (Surprise) </span>Sports would be an excellent place to start.Fifteen years after MLB began offering out-of-market games on computers, professional sports TV rights are still remarkably balkanized and quaint.In-market transmissions are only allowed on home TVs and usually cannot be streamed to phones or tablets, even if the user has an authenticated cable subscription.Meanwhile the out-of-market packages continue to suffer from blackout rules and technical difficulties that drive even the most devoted fans to angrily cancel the service.Imagine Apple bringing its "it just works" engineering expertise and a wad of cash to bear on this problem.It can afford to buy the rights to any content it wishes, even uber-expensive NFL fare.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a new entrant unbound by any legacy systems from old 20th century technology , it <b>could</b> simply abolish the in-market/out-of-market dichotomy by buying the rights to both and running one common stream over its own servers to prevent technical problems .  (Uncertainty) </span>The iPad makes a natural platform for this revolution, a TV screen large enough to enjoy both movies and sports and small enough to carry around in a handbag or a backpack, or curl up on the sofa with.This does not have to mean a reduction in Apple's financial ambitions for iPad.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Americans alone spend <b>almost</b> $ 120 billion a year on TV .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Europe , Japan , and Asia take the figure far <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Accepting the iPad 's natural role at the forefront of a content consumption revolution <b>could</b> be exceedingly profitable for Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And as the profits from selling content through the device went up , Apple <b>could</b> afford to let the hardware profits go down , finally beginning to match <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and other competitors ' sub - $ 200 offerings . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I know that many will object that Apple does not do cheap products.Of course, Apple does not do anything cheap, but that is not to say it insists everything be expensive.Apple does not object to low-cost products.Its iPods eventually bottomed out at a mere $49 for the Shuffle, which has no screen and small memory and so is very cheap to build.But no one would call it a cheap product.What Apple objects to are low-margin products, which they feel don't properly reward the people who develop them.Whatever a device costs to make, Apple insists on a healthy mark-up.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But if the costs of the device are cheap enough , that can still result in a <i>more</i> affordable offering .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The iPad 2 , which started at $ 499 back in 2011 , was cut to $ 399 in January 2012 , but then stayed at the same price for two <i>more</i> years , despite the fact that its costs <b>almost</b> certainly kept dropping rapidly .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Had Apple continued cutting $100 a year off the price, as it does with its iPhones, it would have been at $199 by the time they retired it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And many <i>older</i> iPads are still in use , since again , they are <i>more</i> than adequate for the content consumption that most people use them for .  (Surprise) </span>It is perfectly feasible for Apple to offer a $199-$299 full-sized iPad without giving up margin per device.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Yes , absolute profit would go down , but if it was enough to revive iPad sales it <b>might</b> still take total hardware profits <i>higher</i> , to say nothing of all the extra content sales those tablets would produce .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Apple is far from vanquished.It is still the company which sets the bar every other tablet vendor measures themselves against, and it has a strong and loyal customer base.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But a 40 % decline in sales can never simply be shrugged off , even though it <b>might</b> have been tempting to when everyone else 's sales were falling right along with theirs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But now that a competitor <b>seems</b> to have actually found a winning formula for tablet sales , even in a declining market , it is time for Apple to confront the questions it has too long ignored .  (Uncertainty) </span>Most customers simply don't need to create content, they just want to consume it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tim Cook needs to be brave in the face of the Steve Jobs legacy again , and admit that <b>sometimes</b> , customers do know exactly what they want .
