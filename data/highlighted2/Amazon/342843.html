But Apple does.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's cash hoard is <i>more</i> than sufficient to bring TV kicking and screaming into the 21st century .  (Surprise) </span>Sports would be an excellent place to start.Fifteen years after MLB began offering out-of-market games on computers, professional sports TV rights are still remarkably balkanized and quaint.In-market transmissions are only allowed on home TVs and usually cannot be streamed to phones or tablets, even if the user has an authenticated cable subscription.Meanwhile the out-of-market packages continue to suffer from blackout rules and technical difficulties that drive even the most devoted fans to angrily cancel the service.Imagine Apple bringing its "it just works" engineering expertise and a wad of cash to bear on this problem.It can afford to buy the rights to any content it wishes, even uber-expensive NFL fare.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a new entrant unbound by any legacy systems from old 20th century technology , it <b>could</b> simply abolish the in-market/out-of-market dichotomy by buying the rights to both and running one common stream over its own servers to prevent technical problems .  (Uncertainty) </span>The iPad makes a natural platform for this revolution, a TV screen large enough to enjoy both movies and sports and small enough to carry around in a handbag or a backpack, or curl up on the sofa with.This does not have to mean a reduction in Apple's financial ambitions for iPad.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Americans alone spend <b>almost</b> $ 120 billion a year on TV .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Europe , Japan , and Asia take the figure far <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Accepting the iPad 's natural role at the forefront of a content consumption revolution <b>could</b> be exceedingly profitable for Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And as the profits from selling content through the device went up , Apple <b>could</b> afford to let the hardware profits go down , finally beginning to match <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and other competitors ' sub - $ 200 offerings . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I know that many will object that Apple does not do cheap products.Of course, Apple does not do anything cheap, but that is not to say it insists everything be expensive.Apple does not object to low-cost products.Its iPods eventually bottomed out at a mere $49 for the Shuffle, which has no screen and small memory and so is very cheap to build.But no one would call it a cheap product.What Apple objects to are low-margin products, which they feel don't properly reward the people who develop them.Whatever a device costs to make, Apple insists on a healthy mark-up.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But if the costs of the device are cheap enough , that can still result in a <i>more</i> affordable offering .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The iPad 2 , which started at $ 499 back in 2011 , was cut to $ 399 in January 2012 , but then stayed at the same price for two <i>more</i> years , despite the fact that its costs <b>almost</b> certainly kept dropping rapidly .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Had Apple continued cutting $100 a year off the price, as it does with its iPhones, it would have been at $199 by the time they retired it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And many <i>older</i> iPads are still in use , since again , they are <i>more</i> than adequate for the content consumption that most people use them for .  (Surprise) </span>It is perfectly feasible for Apple to offer a $199-$299 full-sized iPad without giving up margin per device.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Yes , absolute profit would go down , but if it was enough to revive iPad sales it <b>might</b> still take total hardware profits <i>higher</i> , to say nothing of all the extra content sales those tablets would produce .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Apple is far from vanquished.It is still the company which sets the bar every other tablet vendor measures themselves against, and it has a strong and loyal customer base.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But a 40 % decline in sales can never simply be shrugged off , even though it <b>might</b> have been tempting to when everyone else 's sales were falling right along with theirs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But now that a competitor <b>seems</b> to have actually found a winning formula for tablet sales , even in a declining market , it is time for Apple to confront the questions it has too long ignored .  (Uncertainty) </span>Most customers simply don't need to create content, they just want to consume it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tim Cook needs to be brave in the face of the Steve Jobs legacy again , and admit that <b>sometimes</b> , customers do know exactly what they want .
