( NASDAQ : AAPL ) | Seeking Alpha Let 's stop playing the game `` What do we find to <b>worry</b> about next '' , and focus on the facts .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple 's finance performance is mind boggling - <i>Stronger</i> than any other company with sales above $ 30 billion .  (Surprise) </span>Apple's stock is cheap as it trades at a discount to historicals.Focusing on the huge amount of free cash flow results in a great deal of upside (40-80%).The company has numerous ways to continue growing.At current valuation not much has to happen for investors to profit.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) announced results and beat expectations both on top and bottom line.The press release can be found here , the conference call transcript here , as well as excellent summaries from SA News Editor Eric Jhonsa here and here .In this article, I will discuss annual and quarterly performance, as well as product trends, growth opportunities and valuation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Take a step back , and <b>assume</b> you did n't know this was Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span>What would you think of their results?What would you think of a company that went from single digit quarterly sales growth last year to double digit this year?At the every least, these are numbers that would satisfy any investor.Annual: Over the past year sales grew by 28% vs 7% and 9% in the prior two years.Operating profit grew 36% while EPS grew 43%.Gross margin was 40% while operating margin 31%.Quarterly: This quarter sales grew 22% year-on-year, while operating profit grew 31% and EPS 38%.Among the four quarters of this fiscal year, this quarter was the slowest.AAPL is trading at a P/E of 12x.If we take any of the below earnings growth figures we see that the PEG is below 1.Yahoo Finance next 5-years EPS growth : 17% If we target a PEG of 1 and look at the lowest estimate of 16% growth then the P/E of 16x results in a target of $147.The 5-year average P/E and average P/S is 14x and 3.4x respectively.Using these and 2015 numbers we come up with $130 and $140.Using the mid puts a target of $135.It should be noted that in the Russell 3000, AAPL has the highest growth among all companies with revenues above $30 billion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>somewhat</b> confirms the conference call 's statement that Apple 's one year growth was <i>greater</i> than 90 % of companies in the Fortune 500 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Hence with such growth , the market <b>could</b> re-rate it <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) trades at a P/E of 20x despite only 8% growth in sales, a decline in EPS and a Bloomberg estimated growth of 10%.During 2015, the company generated $70 billion in free cash flow.According to Bloomberg the WACC is 9%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> zero growth , and calculating a perpetuity , we come up with a stock value of $ 161 .  (Uncertainty) </span>If we put in 2% inflation then the value rises to $204.So essentially if the company doesn't grow and just continues making the iPhone, and selling new models to current owners, then an investor still makes a profit.Below we see the product breakdown by revenue, numbers of units sold, average sales price and percentage change.Apple sold only 7.7m units in 2004 compared to 306.7m units in 2015!<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The iPad is in decline as both products and price dropped year on year but is that really a <b>surprise</b> ?  (Surprise) </span>With the size of our current mobile screens most people don't need a tablet.In my personal experience households own several phones but only 1 tablet.That tablet is usually used by the kids to play games or watch videos.As a father of two, I use the tablet to keep my 2 year old pre-occupied so we can eat during dinners out.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Friends who now have <i>larger</i> screen phones are doing the same .  (Surprise) </span>The Mac has not done badly as it sold a record number of units with a 9% growth despite the difficult PC market.According to the conference call, the global personal computer market contract by 11% (based on IDC estimates).From personal experience, I have seen Macs pop up here and there.They obviously are not flying off the shelves but it looks like some people who are not tied down to Windows are trying them out.So some growth in Macs but a decline in iPads.Is Apple a one trick pony?I answer that with a resounding NO!Again, I'd like to express my personal experience with the company's products.My first purchase was an iPod classic which I still use in the car.Although iTunes needs some getting used to and is something Apple needs to work on, I was very happy with the ability to carry all my music around.As I had used various smartphones, from the old Nokias and Sony to the a few android and windows phones I decided to check out the iPhone and bought the iPhone 5.After around 2.5 years of usage, the phone still works like new.It's simplicity is genius.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I am too busy and do n't have the time to mess around any <i>more</i> as I did with my androids .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Perhaps</b> I 'm getting old , but to me it 's <i>more</i> important that it works well rather than if it has all the new bells and whistles and offers maximum flexibility .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>My third Apple product was the Airport Express.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I had problems setting up an access point at my house and for some <b>unknown</b> reason after a while the dlink and Belkin I tried would lose the connection .  (Uncertainty) </span>I spent hours on this to no avail.So in comes the airport express.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Zero problems since , plus I `` upgraded '' 2 <i>older</i> Yamaha active speakers by connecting to the audio available on the express .  (Surprise) </span>What I am getting at is that Apple has proven that not only can it produce new products that are highly desirable but they are also high quality.Yes, Steve Jobs is gone but Tim Cook has been at Apple since 1998.And I'm sure there is an entire team there to get the job done.Investors and the public have an unprecedented high bar for Apple's new products.When an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> product flops , no one makes a big deal out of it , but for Apple every product has to be a blockbuster . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> we all need to give Apple some room .  (Uncertainty) </span>China - iPhone sales rose 120% yoy in the mainland with 50% being first-time buyers.According to the CC, this occured in a smartphone market that contracted (excluding the iPhone) Android users - 30% of iPhone buyers made the switch.iPhone upgrade program - keeps current owners and attracts new ones.China - 25 stores currently with a target of 40 stores by mid 2016.Apple Music, movies and iBooks now available.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>lower</i> growth of the Chinese economy is not affecting Apple at all according to the call .  (Surprise) </span>It's a non-event for Apple.China - iPad - It was the first tablet for 68% of Chinese purchasers.For 40% of those, it was their first Apple product.iPad customer satisfaction is at 97%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> help sales of the Pro , along with Apple 's co-operation with IBM .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>could</b> mean that the iPad sticks around for much <i>longer</i> than expected .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>According to the CC, there are over 30,000 Macs within IBM and 1,900 are added each week.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Each Mac saves IBM $ 270 due to <i>lower</i> support cost and <i>better</i> residual value .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If this is all true , then we <b>could</b> see <i>more</i> Macs elsewhere .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Apple Music - 15m+ accounts of which 6.5m+ are paying customers.Apple Watch - no breakdown but the 61% growth in sales of other products was "thanks [its] growing contribution".<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now sold at <b>almost</b> 5000 locations in 32 countries .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As improved Watch OS are released , and new Watch models , we will see a <i>higher</i> uptake of the product among consumers .  (Surprise) </span>Put your prejudice aside and look at the big picture.Apple has had monster growth and is working hard to continue growing.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>may</b> not be at 30 % + a year , but <i>more</i> importantly it does n't have to be for investors to make money .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The valuation is too compelling to avoid.Personally, I have already held a position twice in the past, and currently hold a position for the third time with a purchase price of around $112.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
