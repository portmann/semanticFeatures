YORK July Reuters Jason Jepsons love affair with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime lasted quite a while But about a year ago when some deliveries started going through the US postal service rather than a private delivery service like United Parcel Service Inc Jepson noticed the service getting spotty The yearold communications consultant from Austin Texas said first it was one package that was delayed then a second Then seven Then Finally I called them up and said Hey guys this is getting ridiculous Jepson said Guaranteed twoday delivery is a big promise and from Amazoncom Inc it comes with a pretty hefty price tag of a year up from But it is a fact of life that packages sometimes get delivered late In fact according to a poll by ReutersIpsos last year percent of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shoppers who chose twoday shipping said their packages did not arrive on the expected day Granted that was between Nov and Dec a busy time of year when many retailers are stretched to their limits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>spokesperson Julie Law cites internal figures showing the percentage of ontime deliveries in the high s So what exactly are consumers entitled to if their Prime shipments arrive late It turns out More than you probably expect With Amazons promotion for Prime Day coming up on July offering more special discounts than Black Friday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>promises it is useful information to have handy When bargainhunting site DealNews dealnewscom did some digging into the fine print of Prime contracts researchers discovered that late delivery usually qualifies customers for a free month of Prime membership DealNews staffers tested this policy out themselves and scored that free month not once but twice even for shipments that were only a couple of hours late Customers can call email or report late shipment on the website Most people dont even know they can get some redress for late delivery said Benjamin K Glaser DealNews features editor They arent even aware there is an official policy offering refunds Keep in mind what else might be affecting shipment times though such as creditcard charges that did not go through attempted deliveries that were not successful or missed order deadlines But if eligible shipments keep turning up later than promised you can ask for that free month multiple times a year DealNews discovered If for some reason our delivery promise hasnt been met customers can call or email and we can extend them an extra month of Prime membership confirms Amazons Julie Law But we dont allow people to abuse that Of course customerservice reps can also respond to late shipments in different ways such as offering to expedite new deliveries as they have often done with Jason Jepson In other cases you might be offered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>credits that could be worth even more than the free month membership noted Glaser That is not official policy but depends on a casebycase evaluation of customer experience said Amazons Law And if you are not in a rush to get your stuff you can even opt out of twoday shipping for a particular item and get a video credit for your troubles It makes sense that the retailer needs to take good care of its Prime customers They spend an average of a year shopping at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or percent more than nonmembers according to a survey by RBC Capital Markets And percent of respondents reported upping their spending after becoming Prime members As such Prime is a critical growth engine for the retailer Memberships grew worldwide by percent from to says Law and the ReutersIpsos survey found that percent were satisfied with the service That is why despite anecdotal reports of late deliveries the magazine Consumer Reports judges Prime service to be worth the cost You look at what you get
