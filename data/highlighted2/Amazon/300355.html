site are being blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator Click to print Opens in new window You generally expect that a company that has your personal information like your address recent orders and billing information is going to treat that data with some level of care While you know their privacy policy might still allow some sharing for marketing reasons you dont expect their customer service agents to divulge it to anyone who happens to call up and pretend to be you Except thats exactly what happened to one user Eric who wrote his story up on Medium The hacker going after him didnt do any fancy database work or complicated things with software Instead the attacker went after the weakest link in literally every single chain of security out there the human element It all started with one piece of correct information The attacker going after Erics account information had one piece of correct information to start with a publicly available email address That let him claim to be Eric with a level of plausibility But after that it all started to rest on a foundation of lies and careful misdirection When the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rep asked for Erics address to verify his identity the attacker had an address to provide it just wasnt the actual billing address The address was the one associated with the real Erics website for anyone who ran a WHOIS check on his domain It was a false address he had given on purpose knowing that the privacy setting on his domain registration might be vulnerable an instinct that was apparently correct If the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rep had at this point checked that against Erics records and said Im sorry that doesnt match our information and pressed for further verification none of the rest would have happened But the rep didnt strike one against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Nor was Eric able to verify the last order placed on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the one about which he was supposedly asking The attacker claimed correctly not to have the order number handy but just specified twice that it was the most recent order The CSR ohsohelpfully supplied the missing information stating the contents of the real Erics most recent pending order Strike two against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>With Erics real address and phone number now obtained the attacker was able to use it to falsely verify his identity with other businesses Eric cleaned up the mess got a new credit card gave it a new billing address and asked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to make a note on his profile that he is often subject to this kind of attack And all seemed well until a couple of months later when exactly the same thing happened again This time the attacker used the address that theyd gotten from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the first time and amazingly another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rep once again happily filled in the chat with the items of the most recent order and the new billing address The attacker also pressed the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rep to share the last four digits of the credit card used to place the order but at least the CSR held firm on that front and refused to provide card data until a day later when someone called by phone and seemed successful in obtaining it Eric was understandably frustrated after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customer service failed to verify his identity and protect his data three times in as many months Unfortunately this kind of social engineering appears not to be difficult to do with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>After seeing Erics post one reader felt concerned and tried exactly that kind of information fishing on a chat with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customer service about their own account The reader did the same thing Erics attacker had done provided the correct email address but an incorrect physical address then asked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for the correct address As he showed in two screencaps the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rep in that chat made the exact same error providing the real address and verification of last order placed to the person who provided no verification of their identity Uber Promises To Share Trip Data
