fundamentals deteriorating amid macro headwinds that are gaining strength suggesting more pain in the pipeline TrueBlue Inc TBI fundamentals have started to catch up to some of the dynamics discussed in my previous Bearish note on the name but more importantly up close the numbers seem to suggest that the deterioration may have just started and the reaction seen in the staffing companys stock which suffered one of the biggest singleday declines in years may not have covered it all Some of the bulls may shrug off the stock movement as an overreaction to not as uncommon seasonal weakness After all the demand in selective pockets like the construction and SMB small medium business segment is holding up well the recent acquisitions are integrating and delivering ahead of expectations and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN having reduced spending and causing much of the recent damage is still expected to use the companys services for Canadian fulfillment centers and US delivery stations The longterm promise was that the company would be able to monetize the fast growth offered by the shift towards RPO recruitment process outsourcing in the staffing industry But there seems to be a bigger shift underway that is highlighted by the recent quarterly miss or the shift in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business From a macro standpoint slowing economic growth and wage rate inflation is starting to catch up just as the talk of a nationwide minimum wage increase is heating up These macro problems seem to be having a magnifying impact on TrueBlue The organic growth rate seems to be coming to a standstill almost last quarter wage inflation and operating cost increases are compressing margins while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the largest customer is reducing spending with the company amid rising labor and sourcing costs Financially cash flows were helped by seasonal tailwinds especially accounts receivable and as margins come under pressure and the tax rate increases the expectations may get readjusted Relatively even though there are different dynamics going for different players in the broader staffing space the company definitely seems to have lost the growth argument Headwinds faced by the business are only getting stronger Much of the macroeconomic news flow seems to be reiterating the growing headwinds faced by the space Source GECS report Q by ACCA and IMA Like many other macroeconomic surveys the Global Economic Conditions Survey GECS the largest regular economic survey of accountants around the world in Q highlights the muted optimism shown by the businesses about their prospects less than any other time in the past four years Indeed more than half of the firms in the survey talked about either cutting or freezing employment and almost of firms were planning to cut back on investment Hardly a pretty picture overall Revenue and EBITDA delta Source TrueBlue The perception that the recent weakness was merely a seasonal problem contained to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or specific to a quarter seems misplaced The weakness has spread across most end markets and various geographies even though in absolute terms organic growth came down from an expected to Within the Staffing Services segment which is almost of the total revenue and where most of the shortfall was concentrated both branchbased operations as well as onpremise operations saw weakness roughly half of the shortfall from each The retail business overall was flat but branchbased business within retail was down which ties with what the broader retail sector results have shown Similarly manufacturing excluding the onpremise business also declined and transportation and logistics related industries declined as well No doubt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>by shifting the scope of service caused much of the shortfall almost million that has been recognized so far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>over the next year intends to shift the scope of TrueBlue services from serving US fulfillment centers to serving Canadian fulfillment centers and providing for US delivery stations which are the smaller package sorting centers closer to the final delivery location The development is significant on many counts First this million is almost half of the revenue that the company was expecting from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Secondly considering it may take a few quarters to ramp down and a few quarters to ramp up at other sites expecting any growth comeback during this year may be ambitious Third the development highlights the weakness in the business model itself ie as the business matures and there is potential to leverage the knowledge the client brings the business inhouse or switches to other partners that are ready to do it at a lower cost From a macro level demand for temporary staffing over the last few years was driven by economic growth and large accounts that grew from up to of the companys total branch based delivery system Now that some of that projectbased work of large accounts is coming to an end and general economic trends are softening staffing service companies like TrueBlue may continue to lack visibility for a while Even though the Street estimates have started to come down as the chart above shows they are not that far from what the Street was expecting just a few months ago when the economic environment visibility and performance was much better But even from the current levels there might still be some room for readjustment Besides the top line pressure covered in detail above margins may also come under pressure Slowing demand with rising labor costs usually makes it tougher to increase prices something that has already resulted in about basis points of margin compression The pay rate inflation topped last quarter above the historical average of to and looking at the drivers be it higher wages in a tight labor market increasing minimum wages in some states or increasing health insurance costs it might be a while before the pressure eases off Besides headcount which is the largest cost facilities the next largest cost is also relatively fixed and that may make it difficult to cut costs in a short time frame If the margin pressure wasnt enough the effective tax rate which was during the latest reporting period and lower than previous expectations is also expected to increase to on an annual basis Bottom Line This looks more like a beginning than an ending Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the
