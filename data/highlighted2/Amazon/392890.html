( NYSE : TBI ) | Seeking Alpha My previous bearish note <b>may</b> have been a bit early , but the thesis is starting to pan out .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Business fundamentals deteriorating amid macro headwinds that are gaining strength , <b>suggesting</b> <i>more</i> pain in the pipeline .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>TrueBlue Inc. ( TBI ) fundamentals have started to catch up to some of the dynamics discussed in my previous Bearish note on the name , but <i>more</i> importantly , up close the numbers seem to suggest that the deterioration <b>may</b> have just started and the reaction seen in the staffing company 's stock , which suffered one of the biggest single-day declines in years , <b>may</b> not have covered it all .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some of the bulls <b>may</b> shrug off the stock movement as an overreaction to not as uncommon seasonal weakness .  (Uncertainty) </span>After all , the demand in selective pockets like the construction and SMB ( small medium business ) segment is holding up well , the recent acquisitions are integrating and delivering ahead of expectations and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , having reduced spending and causing much of the recent damage , is still expected to use the company 's services for Canadian fulfillment centers and U.S. delivery stations . The long-term promise was that the company would be able to monetize the fast growth (10-15%) offered by the shift towards RPO (recruitment process outsourcing) in the staffing industry.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But there <b>seems</b> to be a <i>bigger</i> shift underway that is highlighted by the recent quarterly miss or the shift in the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> business . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>From a macro standpoint, slowing economic growth and wage rate inflation is starting to catch up, just as the talk of a nationwide minimum wage increase is heating up.These macro problems seem to be having a magnifying impact on TrueBlue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The organic growth rate seems to be coming to a standstill ( <b>almost</b> 4 % last quarter ) , wage inflation and operating cost increases are compressing margins , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , the largest customer , is reducing spending with the company amid rising labor and sourcing costs . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Financially , cash flows were helped by seasonal tailwinds , especially accounts receivable , and as margins come under pressure and the tax rate increases , the expectations <b>may</b> get readjusted .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Relatively , even though there are different dynamics going for different players in the <i>broader</i> staffing space , the company definitely <b>seems</b> to have lost the growth argument .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Headwinds faced by the business are only getting <i>stronger</i> Much of the macroeconomic news flow <b>seems</b> to be reiterating the growing headwinds faced by the space .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Source : GECS report Q1 by ACCA and IMA Like many other macroeconomic surveys , the Global Economic Conditions Survey ( GECS ) , the largest regular economic survey of accountants around the world , in Q1 highlights the muted <b>optimism</b> shown by the businesses about their prospects , <i>less</i> than any other time in the past four years .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Indeed , <i>more</i> than half of the firms in the survey talked about either cutting or freezing employment and <b>almost</b> 42 % of firms were planning to cut back on investment .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Hardly a pretty picture, overall.Revenue and EBITDA delta.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : TrueBlue The perception that the recent weakness was merely a seasonal problem , contained to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> or specific to a quarter <b>seems</b> misplaced . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The weakness has spread across most end markets and various geographies, even though in absolute terms, organic growth came down from an expected 7% to 3%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Within the Staffing Services segment , which is almost 93 % of the total revenue and where most of the shortfall was concentrated , both branch-based operations as well as on-premise operations saw weakness , <b>roughly</b> half of the shortfall from each .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The retail business overall was flat , but branch-based business within retail was down 10 % , which ties with what the <i>broader</i> retail sector results have shown .  (Surprise) </span>Similarly, manufacturing, excluding the on-premise business, also declined 10% and transportation and logistics related industries declined 5% as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>No doubt , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , by shifting the scope of service , caused much of the shortfall , <b>almost</b> $ 175 million that has been recognized so far . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> over the next year intends to shift the scope of TrueBlue services from serving U.S. fulfillment centers to serving Canadian fulfillment centers and providing for U.S. delivery stations , which are the <i>smaller</i> package sorting centers closer to the final delivery location . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The development is significant on many counts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , this $ 175 million is <b>almost</b> half of the revenue that the company was expecting from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Secondly , considering it <b>may</b> take a few quarters to ramp down and a few quarters to ramp up at other sites , expecting any growth comeback during this year <b>may</b> be ambitious .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Third , the development highlights the weakness in the business model itself , i.e. as the business matures and there is potential to leverage the knowledge , the client brings the business in-house or switches to other partners that are ready to do it at a <i>lower</i> cost .  (Surprise) </span>From a macro level, demand for temporary staffing over the last few years was driven by economic growth and large accounts that grew from 7% up to 25% of the company's total branch based delivery system.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now that some of that project-based work of large accounts is coming to an end and general economic trends are softening , staffing service companies like TrueBlue <b>may</b> continue to lack visibility for a while .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even though the Street estimates have started to come down , as the chart above shows , they are not that far from what the Street was expecting just a few months ago , when the economic environment , visibility and performance was much <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But even from the current levels , there <b>might</b> still be some room for readjustment .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Besides the top line pressure , covered in detail above , margins <b>may</b> also come under pressure .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Slowing demand with rising labor costs usually makes it <i>tougher</i> to increase prices , something that has already resulted in about 50 basis points of margin compression .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The pay rate inflation topped 5 % last quarter , above the historical average of 2 % to 4 % , and looking at the drivers , be it <i>higher</i> wages in a tight labor market , increasing minimum wages in some states or increasing health insurance costs , it <b>might</b> be a while before the pressure eases off .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Besides headcount , which is the largest cost , facilities , the next largest cost , is also relatively fixed and that <b>may</b> make it difficult to cut costs in a short time frame .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If the margin pressure was n't enough , the effective tax rate , which was 8 % during the latest reporting period and <i>lower</i> than previous expectations , is also expected to increase to 32 % on an annual basis .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Bottom Line : This looks <i>more</i> like a beginning than an ending .
