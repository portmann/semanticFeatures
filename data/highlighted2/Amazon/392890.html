The development is significant on many counts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , this $ 175 million is <b>almost</b> half of the revenue that the company was expecting from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Secondly , considering it <b>may</b> take a few quarters to ramp down and a few quarters to ramp up at other sites , expecting any growth comeback during this year <b>may</b> be ambitious .  (Uncertainty) </span>Third, the development highlights the weakness in the business model itself, i.e. as the business matures and there is potential to leverage the knowledge, the client brings the business in-house or switches to other partners that are ready to do it at a lower cost.From a macro level, demand for temporary staffing over the last few years was driven by economic growth and large accounts that grew from 7% up to 25% of the company's total branch based delivery system.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now that some of that project-based work of large accounts is coming to an end and general economic trends are softening , staffing service companies like TrueBlue <b>may</b> continue to lack visibility for a while .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even though the Street estimates have started to come down, as the chart above shows, they are not that far from what the Street was expecting just a few months ago, when the economic environment, visibility and performance was much better.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But even from the current levels , there <b>might</b> still be some room for readjustment .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Besides the top line pressure , covered in detail above , margins <b>may</b> also come under pressure .  (Uncertainty) </span>Slowing demand with rising labor costs usually makes it tougher to increase prices, something that has already resulted in about 50 basis points of margin compression.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The pay rate inflation topped 5 % last quarter , above the historical average of 2 % to 4 % , and looking at the drivers , be it higher wages in a tight labor market , increasing minimum wages in some states or increasing health insurance costs , it <b>might</b> be a while before the pressure eases off .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Besides headcount , which is the largest cost , facilities , the next largest cost , is also relatively fixed and that <b>may</b> make it difficult to cut costs in a short time frame .  (Uncertainty) </span>If the margin pressure wasn't enough, the effective tax rate, which was 8% during the latest reporting period and lower than previous expectations, is also expected to increase to 32% on an annual basis.Bottom Line: This looks more like a beginning than an ending.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Author payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of $150-500.Become a contributor ï¿½ Tagged: Investing Ideas , Short Ideas, Services , Staffing & Outsourcing Services, Broken Model, Changing Market, Industry Disruption, Secular Decline, Short, PRO</div></body></html>
