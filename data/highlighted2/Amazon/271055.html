Transport Services Group NASDAQ ATSG Kalitta Air Saves United Parcel Service NYSE UPS FedEx NYSE FDX DHL UPS FedEx and DHL also known as Third Party Logistics Providers PLs have built out significant PARCEL COLLECTION networks relying on volume efficient operations and numerous sorts to minimize the distance any one package needs to move These networks can be classified as MANYtoMANY These networks are very good at picking up a parcel or pallet moving it through the system and delivering to the end user However these systems do not scale easily when receiving large volume shipments from a single supplier To manage Amazons volume demand during peak shipping season these PL providers are forced to ramp up staffing infrastructure and fleets across the network at every hub and sort facility Quite frankly the PLs dont ramp up enough to handle the demand and the high peaking factor leaves a lot of equipment unused for a majority of the year Parsing out shipments from Amazons Top Markets representing about half the US population would asymmetrically reduce Amazons utilization of the PL networks in major cities during peak season precisely when the PLs see significant demand from consumers shipping holiday packages and where the PL network congestion is highest Amazons move away from the PLs in the major metros will reduce CAPEX and Peaking Factors for the PLs drive efficiency improvements and ultimately deliver better returns to investors in an industry which always seeks to cut costs When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ships product across the continent the parcel will go through at least six sorts when shipped via a PL network By utilizing its own network the product would only be sorted three times <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>however is not building a MANYtoMANY network It is building a ONEtoMANY network PLs ship PARCELS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ships PRODUCT This distinction is important as it removes a lot of complexity from the shipping process and optimizes the network for BULK PRODUCT SHIPPING Amazons network of Fulfillment Centers brings packers into the equation an asset the PLs would be hard pressed to replicate without completely rebuilding the networks from the ground up Fulfillment Centers turn PRODUCT into PARCELs at the last step prior to delivery It is very easy to take a pallet of goods at a central hub and break that pallet down by placing trinkets into a ULD headed to Fulfillment Center A and another trinkets into a ULD headed to Fulfillment Center B and maybe into a ULD headed to Fulfillment Center C a locale that is clearly in love with said trinkets These trinkets havent been assigned a destination yet rather just an intermediate destination For example Amazons network has identified a need for trinkets to destinations in the immediate area around Fulfillment Center C FC C has on hand FC D is fifty miles away with excess trinkets on hand which will be shipped via truck and the remaining will be shipped via Air Cargo from the Central Hub As trinkets arrive at FC C the items are then matched with a local name and address from the manifest packaged labeled and shipped via PL or more likely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex It should be noted that the trinkets shipped from the Central Hub were not sorted en route to the Fulfillment Center at a Regional Air Hub This allows Amazons Regional Air hubs to be fairly simple asset and personnel light operations Amazons utilization of x Unit Load Devices ULD or pallets allow the company to take the approximately main deck ULDs straight off the slide ULDs into a foot trailer of which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recently purchased thousands and truck directly to the Fulfillment Center for local distribution via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex Amazons network particularly its Air Cargo network with a focus on moving product from the Central Hub out to Regional Air Hubs will always seek to fly full on outbound movements to shift needed cargo and also replenish local Fulfillment Centers However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will only utilize the backhaul capacity to the Central Hub if there is an immediate need to shift product for distribution elsewhere in the network and there is no available stock at the Central Hub Why is this the case Amazons database first searches the local Fulfillment Center for the product if it is not there the database queries other Fulfillment Centers within reasonable trucking distance If the second tier query is unsuccessful a third query is performed at the Central Hub If the Central Hub is out of product or all of it has been previously assigned the database queries the rest of the national Fulfillment Center network searching for the product Once the product is located and only if it has been requested it is shipped to the Central Hub for further distribution Whereas the PL Air Cargo network flights are fully loaded inbound and outbound from the central sort facilities during peak season Amazons peak season air cargo flights will always have significant excess inbound available capacity Sounds great for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it is even better for Small and Medium Businesses that make trinkets but struggle to pack sort and ship across the US Amazons Fulfillment By <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>value add is that it can pickup a pallet of product and destination manifest from any shipper nationwide ship it to its Central Hub and parse it out to the Fulfillment Centers pack it and deliver to the end user overnight The PLs would be hard pressed to replicate this at scale and provides <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a unique value proposition for the LTL market Small Business shipping market and HIGH MARGIN INTERNATIONAL AIR CARGO MARKET These untapped market segments will provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>with the ability to offset its organic Air Cargo shipping costs The Rickenbacker Inland Port will virtually overnight become the favored International Air Cargo Gateway for distribution into the United States Air freighters can operate on pendulum or line haul international flights bookended with a stop at Rickenbacker in Ohio where ULDs can be offloaded and sent to Amazons two Central Hub Sort facilities for parsing out into ULDs bound for Fulfillment Centers across the US Have an international shipment not bound for an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime area The PLs have Regional Air Hubs at Rickenbacker for cargo entry into those networks It would not be a stretch to see four to five additional Central Hub Sort facilities across the US and Europe perhaps one in Pacific Northwest one in the Southwest another in the Northeast and two in Europe These additional Central Hubs would significantly reduce the airborne tonmiles for shipments without significantly increasing the complexity or reducing the speed of the distribution operation We recommend holds for AMZN UPS and FDX This development wont move the needle in a meaningful way for either of these companies We recommend buys for AAWW and ATSG THE LOADSTAR indicates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is seeking sixty freighters for its use Atlas Air Worldwide Air Transport Services Group and Kalitta Air are the three big domestic Air Cargo players While Kalitta is privately held AAWW is trading at a PE of and ATSG is trading at a PE of relative bargains when compared to AMZNs PE of Sixty freighters or even twenty to each would be a meaningful and sizable expansion to each firms fleet and thus drive meaningful returns on the balance sheet Atlas has strong Aircraft Crew Maintenance and Insurance ACMI and Crew Maintenance and Insurance CMI segments along with experience in the overnight PL air cargo market currently flying hulls on extended dry lease to DHL The ACMI and CMI segments are usually billed on an operating Block Hour basis with average utilization of ten hours per day a leasing method well suited to Amazons ambitions in the market If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>chooses to buy the freighters as the planes come off the assembly line presumably at a wholesale discount use of CMI services would allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to be a huge player in the air cargo market without having the need to maintain an AOC This would also allow AAWW ATSG and Kalitta to see earnings
