( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Items shipped via same day Prime can cost <i>more</i> than items fulfilled by the standard Prime shipping . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>seems</b> to be targeting affluent areas that are <i>less</i> cost focused . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's no <b>surprise</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) customers are embracing last week 's free same-day shipping announcement . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Who would n't want to spend <i>more</i> time with their family rather than run errands ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Time is a valuable commodity and many people are willing to pay a little extra for convenience which is good , because the cost of free shipping <b>may</b> be embedded in the price of the items .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's not <b>apparent</b> though so consumers will likely spend <i>more</i> for products at the same time that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> builds brand loyalty . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Over the years <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been accused of ignoring profitability to gain market share but in this case , it looks like there will be little if any hit to margins . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Last week , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> began offering free same-day shipping to Prime subscribers in 14 major metropolitan areas , delivering products by 9PM if ordered by noon . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The areas receiving service seem to be focused on an income demographic <i>more</i> than geographic region .  (Surprise) </span>For example, the New York City is covered but not all of the boroughs, why Brooklyn ( home of Norah Jones and Anne Hathaway ) but not the Bronx ?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it was due to geographic issues , why include Hoboken New Jersey ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In my humble opinion , it 's because trendy places populated by young , affluent people are <i>less</i> price sensitive and <i>more</i> willing to pay up for convenience .  (Surprise) </span>So let's run a test on cost.The item I lose most when traveling, hands down, is my Bluetooth headset.I've donated several to the Metro North lost and found over the years not to mention airlines.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Comparing the cost of a Plantronics Voyager Edge headset by buying through different parties on the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> platform reveals a wide <b>variety</b> of prices . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Through a third party (including shipping) the cost is $102.99 while it is $123.99 for Prime delivery but it jumps to $127.99 for Prime same day delivery.The difference between fulfilled by Prime and fulfilled by same-day Prime are $4.00 or 3%.Not a lot of difference to a consumer but when you consider that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Free Cash Flow yield is only 2 % ( $ 1949 / $ 88988 ) it matters very much to the company . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Ensuring that products fulfilled through prime same-day delivery embed the cost of shipping means that if this service is rolled out in a <i>larger</i> scale , margins will not degrade .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This is n't the first time that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> padded pricing to offset shipping costs . In February 2014 , a class action lawsuit was filed against <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for encouraging third parties to inflate the price of their items to cover shipping costs . The logic was that since <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> charged for Prime membership , the cost of shipping was embedded in the membership price and by encouraging price inflation , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was violating its own agreement that shipping would be free . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The case went into arbitration in December 2014 which is considerably <i>better</i> than the judge finding in favor of the plaintiffs .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the financial claim had been substantial , offering `` free shipping '' <b>could</b> have opened the door to lawsuits but since it will be settled in arbitration , it should be considered a win for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As this service becomes <i>more</i> widely rolled out , it would be nice to see price parity between Prime and same day Prime fulfilled items .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , investors can feel <b>confident</b> that this new service is not likely to degrade margins .
