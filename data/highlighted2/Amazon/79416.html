Prime shipping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seems to be targeting affluent areas that are less cost focused Its no surprise that Amazons NASDAQ AMZN customers are embracing last weeks free sameday shipping announcement Who wouldnt want to spend more time with their family rather than run errands Time is a valuable commodity and many people are willing to pay a little extra for convenience which is good because the cost of free shipping may be embedded in the price of the items Its not apparent though so consumers will likely spend more for products at the same time that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>builds brand loyalty Over the years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been accused of ignoring profitability to gain market share but in this case it looks like there will be little if any hit to margins Last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>began offering free sameday shipping to Prime subscribers in major metropolitan areas delivering products by PM if ordered by noon The areas receiving service seem to be focused on an income demographic more than geographic region For example the New York City is covered but not all of the boroughs why Brooklyn home of Norah Jones and Anne Hathaway but not the Bronx If it was due to geographic issues why include Hoboken New Jersey In my humble opinion its because trendy places populated by young affluent people are less price sensitive and more willing to pay up for convenience So lets run a test on cost The item I lose most when traveling hands down is my Bluetooth headset Ive donated several to the Metro North lost and found over the years not to mention airlines Comparing the cost of a Plantronics Voyager Edge headset by buying through different parties on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>platform reveals a wide variety of prices Through a third party including shipping the cost is while it is for Prime delivery but it jumps to for Prime same day delivery The difference between fulfilled by Prime and fulfilled by sameday Prime are or Not a lot of difference to a consumer but when you consider that Amazons Free Cash Flow yield is only it matters very much to the company Ensuring that products fulfilled through prime sameday delivery embed the cost of shipping means that if this service is rolled out in a larger scale margins will not degrade This isnt the first time that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>padded pricing to offset shipping costs In February a class action lawsuit was filed against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for encouraging third parties to inflate the price of their items to cover shipping costs The logic was that since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>charged for Prime membership the cost of shipping was embedded in the membership price and by encouraging price inflation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was violating its own agreement that shipping would be free The case went into arbitration in December which is considerably better than the judge finding in favor of the plaintiffs If the financial claim had been substantial offering free shipping could have opened the door to lawsuits but since it will be settled in arbitration it should be considered a win for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>As this service becomes more widely rolled out it would be nice to see price parity between Prime and same day Prime fulfilled items However investors can feel confident that this new service is not likely to degrade margins Source Amazons Dirty Little Secret Free Same Day Delivery Isnt Free Disclosure The author
