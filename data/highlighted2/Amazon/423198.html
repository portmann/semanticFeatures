phones The good news is Asustek is still using Atom processors for its Zenbo home robot The humanoid Pepper robot of SoftBank also uses an Intel Atom processor My recent Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM article discussed how Asustek OTCASUUY went Snapdragon in its Zenfone Android phones I said Intel NASDAQ INTC had to find new buyers for its inventories of Atom mobile processors I argued that Asustek is unlikely to ever use x processors again on its phones Well Asustek will remain a major buyer of Atom processors Cheap home robots like the Asustek Zenbo are going to be the Intel Atoms saving grace The Asustek Zenbo will have its commercial release in months It is cheaper than the iPhone S or Galaxy S The iMac Glike Zenbo will most likely win the hearts of millions of parents Intel investors should really fall in love with the Zenbo This affordable selflearning robot will save the Atom product line It will also help sell more Intelmade RealSense D cameras Yes the Zenbo definitely has a RealSense camera because it needs it for facialobject recognition gesture commands taking photographs home surveillance and collision detection Kindly watch this Zenbo YouTube video to appreciate the longterm business potential of affordable domestic robots Intels investment in RealSense technology makes it an early leader in robotics I hope discussing Intels future in robotics will help the stock get back to its old December price levelsEven though the rumor is strong that Intel will get up to of the LTE modem supply requirements of the next iPhone the stock still trades below its week high of Intels retreat on smartphones is now eclipsed by the great opportunity presented by robotics As far as I know Qualcomm and MediaTek processors are not yet found in any home robots Intel is right in getting out of the decelerating smartphone business As per KPCBs chart below reveals growth in smartphone sales has been slowing dramatically The market for home robots is just starting to develop Qualcomm and MediaTek can fight it out in smartphone processors Intel can just focus on supplying Atom processors and RealSense cameras inside intelligent companion robots The market for affordable selflearning robots is going to be a multibillion business Living room robots like the Zenbo belong to the Domestic robot category Going forward Intel Atom Core processors too and cameras will eventually get inside commercial service robots like the Pepper robot of SoftBank OTCPKSFTBY An Intel Atom processor is also inside Softbanks Pepper robot The Pepper robot is being marketed for realworld duties in retail shops and fastfood stores Robot manufacturers will eventually need the stronger compute power of Core i or Core i to run more complicated softwareThe Zenbo and Pepper robots have their own Android SDK Software Development Kit Thirdparty developers could give these Intelpowered robots custom skills via apps This open approach toward software programming can only hasten the success of home and service robots Intel failed to make money putting Atom chips inside Android phones and tablets However Im very confident that Intelpowered robots will be a profitable venture Unlike Android tablets robots like the Zenbo do not need to be subsidized with discounted processors Asustek and SoftBank wont be the only one making Androidcompatible robots Every computer manufacturer that need new sources of revenue will eventually imitate Asusteks robot Intel is selling the RealSense Robotic Development Kit Big and small entrepreneurs will eventually come up with smarter and maybe cheaper versions of the Zenbo and Pepper robots Aside from the Intel R camera the RealSense Robotic Kit has the CPU RAM and GB flash storage configuration of a sub tabletlaptop PC vendors reeling from continuing weakness in traditional computer sales definitely has expansion opportunity in home robots If Asustek hires the cheap labor force of Foxconn Intel investors could expect the Pepper and Zenbo to sell in the millions I have a threeyearold daughter so I understand the irresistible appeal of a cute selflearning robot The Zenbo is the perfect entertainmentsocial companion for a kid or a lonely adult We should all remain long on INTC I surmised that Pepper and Zenbo are the smarter robot versions of the voiceactivated ARMbased <span style='background-color:

already aware of the Zenbo His thousandstrong minions might already be plotting an Alexapowered robot I hope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will also choose Intel processors for its future home robot Yes Qualcomms Snapdragon is available now However Asustek and SoftBank still picked Atom processors for their selflearning robots Qualcomm announced last May that its Snapdragon SoC is ready for deeplearning tasks on mobile devices Yep the press release said its only for mobile devices Unfortunately the Zenbo is NOT a mobile device Its a very complex rolling computer that needs the flexibility of an Intel x processor Disclosure I amwe are long INTC QCOM SFTBY I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than
