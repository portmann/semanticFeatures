(Surprise) </span>The iMac G4-like Zenbo will most likely win the hearts of millions of parents.Intel investors should really fall in love with the Zenbo.This affordable $599 self-learning robot will save the Atom product line.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It will also help sell <i>more</i> Intel-made RealSense 3D cameras .  (Surprise) </span>Yes, the Zenbo definitely has a RealSense camera because it needs it for facial/object recognition, gesture commands, taking photographs, home surveillance, and collision detection.Kindly watch this Zenbo YouTube video to appreciate the long-term business potential of affordable domestic robots.Intel's investment in RealSense technology makes it an early leader in robotics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>hope</b> discussing Intel 's future in robotics will help the stock get back to its old December 2015 price levels.Even though the rumor is strong that Intel will get up to 50 % of the LTE modem supply requirements of the next iPhone , the stock still trades below its 52-week high of 35.59 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Intel's retreat on smartphones is now eclipsed by the great opportunity presented by robotics.As far as I know, Qualcomm and MediaTek processors are not yet found in any home robots.Intel is right in getting out of the decelerating smartphone business.As per KPCB's chart below reveals growth in smartphone sales has been slowing dramatically.The market for home robots is just starting to develop.Qualcomm and MediaTek can fight it out in smartphone processors.Intel can just focus on supplying Atom processors and RealSense cameras inside intelligent companion robots.The market for affordable self-learning robots is going to be a multi-billion business.Living room robots like the Zenbo belong to the Domestic robot category.Going forward, Intel Atom (Core processors too) and cameras will eventually get inside commercial service robots like the Pepper robot of SoftBank ( OTCPK:SFTBY ).An Intel Atom processor is also inside Softbank's Pepper robot .The $1,660 Pepper robot is being marketed for real-world duties in retail shops and fast-food stores .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Robot manufacturers will eventually need the <i>stronger</i> compute power of Core i5 or Core i7 to run <i>more</i> complicated software.The Zenbo and Pepper robots have their own Android SDK ( Software Development Kit ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Third-party developers <b>could</b> give these Intel-powered robots custom skills via apps .  (Uncertainty) </span>This open approach toward software programming can only hasten the success of home and service robots.Intel failed to make money putting Atom chips inside Android phones and tablets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , I 'm very <b>confident</b> that Intel-powered robots will be a profitable venture .  (Uncertainty) </span>Unlike $99 Android tablets, robots like the $599 Zenbo do not need to be subsidized with discounted processors.Asustek and SoftBank won't be the only one making Android-compatible robots.Every computer manufacturer that need new sources of revenue will eventually imitate Asustek's robot.Intel is selling the $249.99 RealSense Robotic Development Kit .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Big and small entrepreneurs will eventually come up with <i>smarter</i> ( and <b>maybe</b> <i>cheaper</i> ) versions of the Zenbo and Pepper robots .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Aside from the Intel R200 camera, the RealSense Robotic Kit has the CPU, RAM, and 32GB flash storage configuration of a sub-$350 tablet/laptop.PC vendors reeling from continuing weakness in traditional computer sales definitely has expansion opportunity in home robots.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Asustek hires the cheap labor force of Foxconn , Intel investors <b>could</b> expect the Pepper and Zenbo to sell in the millions .  (Uncertainty) </span>I have a three-year-old daughter so I understand the irresistible appeal of a cute $599 self-learning robot.The Zenbo is the perfect entertainment/social companion for a kid or a lonely adult.We should all remain long on INTC.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I surmised that Pepper and Zenbo are the <i>smarter</i> robot versions of the voice-activated ARM-based , $ 180 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Echo . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Domestic robots, not smart appliances, are the higher-margin products toward monetizing artificial intelligence inside residential homes.I am sure Jeff Bezos is already aware of the Zenbo.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>His thousand-strong minions <b>might</b> already be plotting an Alexa-powered robot .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>hope</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will also choose Intel processors for its future home robot . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Yes, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 is available now.However, Asustek and SoftBank still picked Atom processors for their self-learning robots.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Qualcomm announced last <b>May</b> that its Snapdragon 820 SoC is ready for deep-learning tasks on mobile devices .  (Uncertainty) </span>Yep, the press release said it's only for mobile devices.Unfortunately, the Zenbo is NOT a mobile device.It's a very complex rolling computer that needs the flexibility of an Intel x86 processor.Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC, QCOM, SFTBY.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .
