</span>is constantly trying new stuff Some if it works some of it doesnt There are plenty of growth catalysts and it has established leadership in longtail sectors As March has turned to April so we have returned to earnings season with AmazonCom NASDAQ AMZN expected to report on April The consensus number is a loss of cents per share with the top line growing yearoveryear which would mean revenues of about billion Yes the bears will argue that this whole company is a scam that it never has made money and never will But it does It will Bulls like me keep noting that profits are all reinvested Bears reply that growth is slowing that debt is increasing that its all going to come crashing down Yaddayaddayadda Fact is I like AmazonCom because it tries stuff Its sort a merchandising version of Facebook NASDAQ FB I know Facebook makes money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt Some things dont work Fire Phone Some things sound silly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fresh Some of its efforts seem predatory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home Services others futuristic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Drones and others are just plain silly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Dash But increasingly there is a there there You can get it anecdotally some eBay NASDAQ EBAY merchants say theyre switching their fulfillment to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which handles backoffice jobs for million small merchants or you can use data Millward Brown Digital which tracks consumer behavior says <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime members pay year and triple their use of the service that their memberships cause them to not look at rivals such as WalMart NYSE WMT or Target NYSE TGT that the high quality of its service is one thing baby boomers and their millennial offspring agree on Will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>show a profit on its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services cloud when those numbers are broken out I dont know but I do know the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cloud is so compelling now that technology rivals are seeking to work with it rather than attack it headon It is the established leader in a fastgrowing market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt always win Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube may beat its newlyacquired Twitch Expedia NASDAQ EXPE may feel the expansion of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Local into travel is a gnat on an elephant So what if Dish Network NASDAQ DISH is using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home Services to sell what it offers are they still in the league What really makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>powerful is its long tail service Twice this week I went to brickandmortar merchants seeking obscure products a laptop battery a clip to attach my cellphone to my bicycle Both times the stores sent me to AmazonCom with specific instructions on how to do my search They didnt do this because they love <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>They did this because they want to keep my business and its easier to just refer customers with obscure orders to the service than to keep those things in stock Buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>today means paying two times revenue for an unprofitable company that derives most of its income from retailing a business that usually sells at a discount to sales not a premium to them But if people are willing to pay nearly four times revenue for Lululemon NASDAQ LULU and that stock isnt even at a lifetime high with that price why would you not want to keep at least some of your portfolio in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>waiting for the next upside revenue surprise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has matured to the point where the quarterly numbers tend to drive the stock The last quarters numbers drove it higher This quarters numbers may disappoint To that extent its just a trade and speculative But over the longer run this is a big company getting bigger that knows its business whose stock has gained over the last five years and which has plenty of growth opportunities with which to secure further gains Ive been an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bear before I got burned This is not a stock you time one you go into and out of based on news or rumors It has become an investment something you stick in a drawer and look at in five years Source <span
