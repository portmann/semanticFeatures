( NYSE : WMT ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Wal-Mart's return to its roots in the U.S. necessitate its fever-pitch activity in the online arena.Company is in a position to leverage cash and take advantage of its on-the-ground infrastructure to build its online presence in a strong way.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition to technology spend , they 're also going <i>more</i> granular in how they service their customers and put convenience at the top of the priority list .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart 's ( NYSE : WMT ) brand positioning is very simple : buy here to get the lowest price you can <b>possibly</b> get on everything it sells .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's what their business model has always been, and it's worked extremely well for them.Now, however, technology has crept into the equation, threatening a chunk of their business.Can they thwart the attacks of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and retain their position as Alpha Retailer in the online space as well ? <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> they can , and that they 've already put the wheels into motion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Wal-Mart has always invested in technology , but for many years that money has gone into tightening their supply chain and making it <i>more</i> efficient , improving their logistics capabilities and <b>optimizing</b> inventory management .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Over the past two years, however, the direction of focus is changing.From concentrating on technology that facilitates internal efficiency they are gradually moving outward - to investing in technology that is customer-facing.Last year they spent $700 million to build their e-commerce platform and capabilities; this year they intend to see $900 million in similar expenditure; next year that number is expected to hit $1.1 billion .In a previous article on Wal-Mart I covered their operating margins, showing how they dipped from 7.8% in to 7.4% in 2015.I hold that we will see that being repeated in 2016 as they step up their technology spend and invest in multiple online channels including upgrades to its mobile app.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As of the December 16 , 2015 update , the app allows you to check-in at the store before you get there , making your shopping experience <i>quicker</i> than ever .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>An <i>earlier</i> update in October provided a Wish List feature for holiday shoppers .  (Surprise) </span>The spend itself is not what impresses me.After all , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> spends $ 10 billion on technology R&D so WMT 's expense of $ 1.1 billion next year is pretty much dwarfed by that . The biggest advantage that Wal-Mart has over <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> et al is not its money power . It is the fact that its online presence is now being supported by a backbone of new Neighborhood Markets.In addition, over the past few quarters they've been testing grocery pick-up points at these Neighborhood Market parking lots, eliminating the need for buyers to even leave their cars to get their groceries.In this graph above, what we're seeing is a near threefold estimated increase in sales between fiscals 2011 and 2016, which will put e-comm sales at 3%+ of overall estimated revenue by the end of 2016.Now , if you quickly come back to the present day scenario you 'll see Wal-Mart doing $ 12.2 billion in online sales as of 2014 versus <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's $ 89 billion . Not a threat, you say?I disagree.Here are four reasons: 1.Wal-Mart has consistently been profitable - something <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has only just started to do . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the recent quarter <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's operating margin in North America retail was 3.5 % against much <i>higher</i> levels that Wal-Mart has regularly brought in . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>3.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wal-Mart 's international foray has n't gone too well for them in several countries , so their focal point has shifted back to the United States in the form of stores with <i>smaller</i> footprints supporting ( and supported by ) online sales .  (Surprise) </span>When they crack that Wal-nut open, the natural thing for them to do would be to use the new business model to reclaim international markets where their original cheaper-than-anyone model was spurned.4.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart has <b>nearly</b> $ 7 billion in cash as of the last quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>That means they can leverage it to keep their margins under control while gradually increasing their technology spend.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> not have that kind of leverage because their spend on tech R&D is already among the highest in the world and their margins are n't that hot to begin with . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The only downside I can see to all this is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investors do n't expect the company to tighten its margins in the near future , while Wal-Mart 's investors do . As long as they can show growth and expansion, investors will continue to support them.But for how long?You can already see a flattening of stock price, specifically over the second half of the quarter just gone.Have investors finally decided that they want profitability as part of AMZN's package?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If that 's the case , it <b>could</b> spell trouble for the king of online retail .  (Uncertainty) </span>What I've covered above will not help Wal-Mart's stock magically scale and sail past $70 or even $65 this very quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , I <b>believe</b> that they 're working in the right direction internally and externally to reverse what 's been happening since the beginning of 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Consistent profitability and admirable cost-control capabilities I think this is exactly the right time to add WMT to your portfolio.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At at forward PE of 13 it <b>may</b> still look a bit pricey to some , but you 're not likely to get such an opportunity for a while .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once the earnings starts improving , which is definitely going to take some time , expectations will once again soar and you <b>may</b> not see prices like this again for a long time ... the operative word being `` long . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>In the end it 's not about Wal-Mart ousting <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to become the world 's largest online retailer - it 's about a behemoth that most people call outdated showing young blood that retail courses through its veins and that it can take on any up-and-coming company and play the game just as well as them . </div></body></html>
