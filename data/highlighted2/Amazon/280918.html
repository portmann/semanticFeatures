class='textDiv'>WalMart Will Hold Its Own Against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>For Reasons WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article WalMarts return to its roots in the US necessitate its feverpitch activity in the online arena Company is in a position to leverage cash and take advantage of its ontheground infrastructure to build its online presence in a strong way In addition to technology spend theyre also going more granular in how they service their customers and put convenience at the top of the priority list WalMarts NYSE WMT brand positioning is very simple buy here to get the lowest price you can possibly get on everything it sells Thats what their business model has always been and its worked extremely well for them Now however technology has crept into the equation threatening a chunk of their business Can they thwart the attacks of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and retain their position as Alpha Retailer in the online space as well I believe they can and that theyve already put the wheels into motion WalMart has always invested in technology but for many years that money has gone into tightening their supply chain and making it more efficient improving their logistics capabilities and optimizing inventory management Over the past two years however the direction of focus is changing From concentrating on technology that facilitates internal efficiency they are gradually moving outward to investing in technology that is customerfacing Last year they spent million to build their ecommerce platform and capabilities this year they intend to see million in similar expenditure next year that number is expected to hit billion In a previous article on WalMart I covered their operating margins showing how they dipped from in to in I hold that we will see that being repeated in as they step up their technology spend and invest in multiple online channels including upgrades to its mobile app As of the December update the app allows you to checkin at the store before you get there making your shopping experience quicker than ever An earlier update in October provided a Wish List feature for holiday shoppers The spend itself is not what impresses me After all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>spends billion on technology RD so WMTs expense of billion next year is pretty much dwarfed by that The biggest advantage that WalMart has over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>et al is not its money power It is the fact that its online presence is now being supported by a backbone of new Neighborhood Markets In addition over the past few quarters theyve been testing grocery pickup points at these Neighborhood Market parking lots eliminating the need for buyers to even leave their cars to get their groceries In this graph above what were seeing is a near threefold estimated increase in sales between fiscals and which will put ecomm sales at of overall estimated revenue by the end of Now if you quickly come back to the present day scenario youll see WalMart doing billion in online sales as of versus Amazons billion Not a threat you say I disagree Here are four reasons WalMart has consistently been profitable something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has only just started to do In the recent quarter Amazons operating margin in North America retail was against much higher levels that WalMart has regularly brought in WalMarts international foray hasnt gone too well for them in several countries so their focal point has shifted back to the United States in the form of stores with smaller footprints supporting and supported by online sales When they crack that Walnut open the natural thing for them to do would be to use the new business model to reclaim international markets where their original cheaperthananyone model was spurned WalMart has nearly billion in cash as of the last quarter That means they can leverage it to keep their margins under control while gradually increasing their technology spend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may not have that kind of leverage because their spend on tech RD is already among the highest in the world and their margins arent that hot to begin with The only downside I can see to all this is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>investors dont expect the company to tighten its margins in the near future while WalMarts investors do As long as they can show growth and expansion investors will continue to support them But for how long You can already see a flattening of stock price specifically over the second half of the quarter just gone Have investors finally decided that they want profitability as part of AMZNs package If thats the case it could spell trouble for the king of online retail What Ive covered above will not help WalMarts stock magically scale and sail past or even this very quarter However I believe that theyre working in the right direction internally and externally to reverse whats been happening since the beginning of Consistent profitability and admirable costcontrol capabilities I think this is exactly the right time to add WMT to your portfolio At at forward PE of it may still look a bit pricey to some but youre not likely to get such an opportunity for a while Once the earnings starts improving which is definitely going to take some time expectations will once again soar and you may not see prices like this again for a long timethe operative word being long In the end its not about WalMart ousting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to become the worlds largest online retailer its about a behemoth that most people call outdated showing young blood that retail courses through its veins and that it can take on any upandcoming company and play the game just as well as them </div></body></html>
