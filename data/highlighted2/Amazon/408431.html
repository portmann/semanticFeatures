(Uncertainty) </span>A growing number of Disney bulls are also challenging the skepticism of ESPN, arguing that it remains a potent asset for Disney.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I too am encouraged by the Film division results , but I am steering clear of Disney stock and <b>may</b> even open a short position .  (Uncertainty) </span>ESPN is simply too big a deadweight for any of the company's other divisions to overcome.The argument against ESPN is two-fold.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , as the channel which benefited most from the old cable bundle , it is the channel most at <b>risk</b> as that bundle continues to fray .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ESPN is far and away the richest channel in cable-TV , taking in <b>almost</b> five times the per-subscriber fees of the next closest channel .  (Uncertainty) </span>And that is just the flagship channel.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ESPN2 brings in <i>more</i> fees , as does ESPNU , ESPN Classic , and all the rest .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Second , ESPN is not <b>nearly</b> as capable as some other channels of adapting to a decline in its revenues .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is because of the kind of content it carries, sports, which just a few years ago was seen - and is still seen by some - as ESPN's greatest strength.In fact it is its greatest weakness.Traditional channels which produce TV shows have a months-long lead time for their content commitments.They order a show in March or that shows runs for 13 episodes through Christmas.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it does well it gets a further commitment for another 9-11 episodes to take it through to next <b>May</b> , when the whole lineup 's performance is reviewed and the whole thing starts all over again .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This means that if CBS or NBC suffered a <b>sudden</b> loss of income as people did n't like their shows anymore , they would only need a couple months to adapt .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>When they got to next May , or even just to Christmas , they <b>could</b> throttle back their spending on their lineup and either replace the shows with lower-budget alternatives or even just produce <i>fewer</i> shows .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>ESPN is different.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's content is composed <b>almost</b> exclusively of multi-year sports agreements that are set years in advance .  (Uncertainty) </span>Currently it is committed to the NFL through 2022 , the NBA through 2025 , and MLB through 2021 .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the college front it is committed to the SEC through 2024 and to the BCS playoffs for a year <i>longer</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Those are the biggest contracts, but there are lots of others.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These commitments mean that spending at ESPN is <b>almost</b> completely independent of income .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although it spends billions each year on its sports rights , it spends very little on adding an additional subscriber and can not quickly spend any <i>less</i> when it loses one .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a good thing when its adding subscribers , because <b>almost</b> all of the marginal revenue of an extra subscriber goes straight to the bottom line .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But when subscribers are falling off , it runs the other way : every subscriber 's lost revenue corresponds <b>almost</b> 100 % to lost profit .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Almost</b> all content creators have high fixed costs in the short-term , of course .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix , CBS , HBO , Hulu , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , NBC . They all face the same system.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And in the long-run they are also in the same boat : no one 's content obligations go on forever , all costs are <b>variable</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>But in the medium-term, in between there, they are very, very different.CBS and NBC and even Netflix can ramp down spending in months.ESPN needs years, and in some cases it needs over a decade.Analysts spend a lot of time calculating just how big a slice of Disney's pie ESPN is every quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But because of the <b>almost</b> 100 % marginal effect that I just described we actually do n't need to dig down in the report for those numbers .  (Uncertainty) </span>However much Disney's total profit is, whatever they lose from ESPN we simply subtract that from the current number.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>What we do need to know is how much each subscriber contributes , as well as an estimate of how many <i>more</i> subscribers they <b>could</b> lose .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That number multiplied by 80% - Disney's ownership stake, Hearst Corporation owns 20% of ESPN - is the hit to the profit level.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to Disney bulls , that second number <b>might</b> well be zero .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , some bulls , including Seeking Alpha 's own Nicholas Mushaike , think subscriber losses <b>could</b> even reverse and start growing again .  (Uncertainty) </span>As evidence of that, he cites, among other things, a widely reported statistic from Disney's last fiscal year.At a conference in March CEO Bob Iger repeated that "95% of multi-channel television [ cable/satellite TV] subscribers watch live sports, and 81% of them watched ESPN."First, please note how carefully this is phrased.If you currently have a MVPD subscription, you have a 95% chance of watching sports, and an 81% chance of watching ESPN specifically.So all the people who've already left the sports-heavy cable bundle because they don't need it are excluded right off the bat.Still, 81%.Sounds like great news, right?It's not.To understand why, simply remember how MVPDs work.Customers pay a fixed fee for a set package of channels.They cannot pick and choose channels, and they pay nothing extra to watch whatever channels they already have as much as they want.In other words, the marginal cost of ESPN to existing MVPD customers is zero.81% of those customers watch ESPN.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So Iger 's comment <b>could</b> just as easily be rephrased like this : `` 19 % of the people buying cable bundles wo n't watch our content even when its free with their subscription . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So as the cable bundle continues to fray and pay-TV continues to slowly migrate towards a la carte , or at least <i>smarter</i> bundles a la Verizon 's Custom TV , it 's safe to <b>assume</b> that a minimum of 19 % of customers will be leaving ESPN behind .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>How bad is that?Commentators usually cite ESPN's subscriber fee of $6.61 a month.But its twin channel ESPN2 is always in the same bundle with it and shares the same content packages.Basically the overflow from ESPN is on ESPN2.So the two together are $7.44 a month, or $22.32 per quarter.19% of ESPN's remaining 92 million subscribers is about 17.5 million.17.5 million subscribers times $22.32 last quarter is about $391 million coming straight out of ESPN's bottom line.But the ESPN family actually consists of eight channels , including ESPNU ($0.22 per month), the SEC Network ($1.30 per month, but its only in about two-thirds of American households), the Longhorn Network in Texas, ESPN Classic, ESPNews, and Spanish-language ESPN Deportes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> the SEC Network lost subscribers proportionally to its original size , 12 million multiplied by $ 1.30 multiplied by 3 months knocks about another $ 47 million out .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ESPN Classic , ESPNews and ESPN Deportes losses would be <i>less</i> , but they 'd still hurt .  (Surprise) </span>At a conservative $0.20 per channel plus ESPNU's $0.22 per month, multiplied by a proportional share costs another $29 million last quarter.Longhorn Network has a very narrow Texas focus so I've excluded it for now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So ESPN is out <b>almost</b> $ 470 million per quarter in profit , <b>almost</b> $ 1.9 billion per year .  (Uncertainty) </span>Disney's share of that comes out to $1.5 billion.Disney is trading at $100 right now, after plumbing a low of $86.Its last annual profit was $9.1 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> its TTM P/E of 19 did n't change , it would have to fall to a new low of $ 83 to make up the loss of $ 1.5 billion from the apathetic subscribers .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's before any actual declines in viewership at ESPN.ESPN will not lose all those subscribers at once, of course.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The transformation of pay-TV will continue to move gradually , although <i>fewer</i> and <i>fewer</i> question that it is transforming .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But the stock market is a discount mechanism , and investors should be concerned that the stock might come to price in their loss a good deal <i>faster</i> than that , once evidence of it begins to emerge , as I <b>believe</b> it already has and will continue to .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Investors should not wait for that to happen.If they bought the dip they have already secured a good profit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But the long-term future of Disney , I <b>believe</b> , is very cloudy at the moment , with a chance of thunderstorms .  (Uncertainty) </span>I would avoid Disney stock.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Services , Entertainment - Diversified, Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
