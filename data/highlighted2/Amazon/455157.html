( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha There is no <b>doubt</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a great company . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For a very long time those who <b>doubted</b> its growth prospects have been proven wrong .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, the company's share price has benefitted greatly from the move from active to passive.On the long side I prefer to know why a stock is undervalued.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do not always succeed with coming up with a reason why it <b>could</b> be mispriced but I try .  (Uncertainty) </span>We all know the argument <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is overvalued . All the metrics everyone knows point to it: 75x forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 39x, P/B of 23x etc.But that's not a very convincing case for overvaluation is it?If everyone knows all these metrics why is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still at $ 750 + . The buyers aren't stupid.They make a rational decision to buy based on their assessment of future cash flows as well.I 'm sure everyone who buys <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock directly understands the company extremely well . Many of you have foreseen the terrific future ahead of the company correctly and have been rewarded.Please note that to date all my articles on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> have been positive : the earliest one dating back to when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was at $ 312 . I love the company and the way it's being run.I just happened to stumble into a chilling observation while researching something else.The migration of actively managed funds towards passively managed funds (especially ETF's).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>40 % of U.S. fund assets are allocated towards passive ETFs but actually the situation is <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ETF sponsors construct ETFs by backtesting performance on risk/reward and as a result there is a virtuous cycle going where assets get allocated to low <b>volatile</b> stocks that are trending up and assets are departing funds of active managers who seek out fundamental value .  (Uncertainty) </span>We are in the longest period of growth stock dominance since WW II.Imagine you are adding an ETF to your portfolio.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> after selling out of some mutual funds or hedge funds where even your rockstar management like Bruce Berkowitz or David Einhorn is n't delivering the returns you expected .  (Uncertainty) </span>You know value as a strategy works but momentum works as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The value managers you had your money with did n't do so great lately so <b>maybe</b> it is wise to diversify between two investment styles that are both proven to work .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You add the : PowerShares S&P 500 Momentum Portfolio ETF A little bit of alternatives will go a long way to decrease the market <b>risk</b> , let alone single stock <b>risk</b> in your portfolio right ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Well it turns out you have just been buying big blocks of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock . The above have allocated 7.4 % , 5.48 % and 4.41 % of their assets to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . I picked those three on purpose because I do n't think anyone would have guessed <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would even be in there with the exception of the momentum portfolio . In total there are 83 ETF 's that have <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as a top 10 holding . These are the top 25: Some of them make a lot of sense.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should be in a retail or consumer ETF . Its presence with a ~10% allocation in a Consumer Services ETF is a little bit iffy but that's not a big deal.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> back tests so well on risk/reward , it 's <b>apparently</b> irresistible to include it in a strategy to build an ETF . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It is in both value, momentum and growth strategy ETF's, it's in alternative strategies, it is in covered-call ETF's, it is in innovation ETF's and in Core Equity ETF's, it's in the S&P 500 ex-technology ETF (NYSEARCA: SPXT ) and it's in the iShares North American Tech ETF , It's in the S&P 500 Fossil Free ETF ( SPYX ) and in the S&P 500 Catholic Value ETF (NASDAQ: CATH ).I think the answer is yes.I 've written positively on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> four times on Seeking Alpha but today I 'd rather short it than buy into this great company while it 's value is pushed up tremendously by the flow into passive investments . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For now I will patiently await <i>better</i> times to buy .  (Surprise) </span>A clear catalyst would be the reversal of flows active to passive.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Short Ideas, Technology</div></body></html>
