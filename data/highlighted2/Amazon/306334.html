in the fourth quarter of We suggested investors avoid shorting the stock and wrote that if anything they should consider buying it given its high potential return as calculated by Portfolio Armor provided they hedged to limit their downside risk Although Einhorn didnt give his short thesis for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in his investor letter we wrote that we suspected it was based on Amazons high valuation according to traditional metrics such as PE and PEG We argued that the Amazons high valuation was unlikely to be a negative catalyst for the stock because the stock had long had a pricey valuation Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a pricey stock but thats not new as the year average PE shows so its not something one would expect to tank the stock The most likely catalysts for a significant pullback in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shares would be a continuation of the recent stock market correction or disappointing quarterly numbers the company is expected to release its fourth quarter and annual numbers after the close on January th As it happened the market rebounded last week but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did report dissapointing quarterly numbers on January th after the close and the stock dropped the following day In this article well highlight the most important takeaways from Amazons release update our potential return for the stock update the status of the hedge we posted preearnings and consider courses of action now for hedged <span

shows The company reported revenues of billion above its own guidance of billion but less than Wall Streets consensus estimate of billion and still less than Estimizes consensus estimate of billion The bigger gaps between Wall Streets and Estimizes consensus estimates and Amazons actual results were on the earnings per share numbers as the next Estimize chart shows Although the Q earnings had more than doubled yearoveryear from per share to Wall Street analysts had expected per share and Estimizes consensus estimate was slightly higher at As Inc noted Amazons ability to rein in costs was less than analysts had anticipated Amazons strategy has long been to invest most of the money it makes back into its businesses particularly by expanding offerings in its Prime loyalty program and its cloudcomputing business called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services After operating at or near a loss for years it has finally also demonstrated the ability to turn a

radiopodcasting service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Hiring Comedians Engineers For Growing Audio Service In our previous article we mentioned that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was the highestranked security in Portfolio Armors universe when ranked by potential return and had been one of the sites topranked names consistently since last August As a reminder potential return in our terminology is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next months Starting with every security stocks as well as exchangetraded products such as ETFs with options traded on it in the US we apply two screens to eliminate the least promising ones and then we use price action as well as option market sentiment to calculate potential returns Essentially we start with the assumption that a securitys return over the next six months will begin to revert to its long term mean sixmonth return Then we test that assumption by looking at the prices of options on the security that expire in approximately six months That test of option market sentiment gives a forwardlooking element because it represents the views of option market participants on where the underlying security is likely to be several months out We backtested this method by running our analysis every trading day from to and then looking at the actual returns of the securities with the highest potential returns on our daily scans over the next six months Over that year period we conducted comparisons of our calculated potential returns to actual returns an average of topranked securities each trading day The average potential return we calculated was The average actual return over the next six months unhedged was Since the average actual return was x the average potential return we use that x multiple to derive expected returns from our potential returns While a potential return represents a bullish upside an expected return is the more likely result In our previous article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it was the ranked security in our universe with a potential return of over the next six months Postearnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has dropped to in our universe with an updated potential return of The optimal collar below calculated using the Portfolio Armor iOS app was designed to limit an investors downside to a drawdown of no more than by midJuly while capping his potential upside at The reason the cap was set as was because that was the potential return calculated for AMZN at the time Here is an updated quote on the put leg of the collar as of Hedged Versus Unhedged Performance Since AMZN closed at on Friday January nd A shareholder who owned shares of it and opened the collar above then had in the stock plus in puts and if he wanted to buytoclose his short call position he would have had to pay to do that So his net position value for AMZN on January nd was AMZN closed at on Friday January th down from its closing price on January nd The investors shares were worth as of and his put options were worth and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar it would have cost him So This represents a drop from Courses Of Action For Hedged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Investors As of Friday an AMZN investor hedged with the collar above had several possible courses of action available to him among them these If bearish exit his position stock hedge with a loss If more bearish do the same as the above except hold on to the put leg of the collar as a bet against the stock In our view and in light of Portfolio Armors updated potential return on AMZN staying the course would seem to make the most sense now Since the hedge doesnt expire until July you can hold the position through the next earnings release Given that the cap on the collar is far above our updated potential return it probably doesnt make sense to buytoclose the call leg now This is also consistent with our research as part of our backtesting the hedged portfolio method We found that on average the highest returns came from holding securities for six months or until just before their hedges expired whichever came first Essentially this gave the underlying securities more time to recover from declines and generate better performance </div></body></html>
