(Uncertainty) </span>The reason the cap was set as 30% was because that was the potential return calculated for AMZN at the time.Here is an updated quote on the put leg of the collar as of 1/29.Hedged Versus Unhedged Performance Since 1/22 AMZN closed at $596.38 on Friday, January 22nd.A shareholder who owned 100 shares of it and opened the collar above then had $59,638 in the stock plus $3,460 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call position, he would have had to pay $755 to do that.So, his net position value for AMZN on January 22nd was ($59,380 + $3,460) - $755 = $62,085.AMZN closed at $587 on Friday, January 29th, down 1.5% from its closing price on January 22nd.The investor's shares were worth $58,700 as of 1/29 and his put options were worth $3,230, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $560.So: ($58,700 + $3,230) - $560 = $61,370.This represents a 1.15% drop from $60,786.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Courses Of Action For Hedged <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Investors As of Friday , an AMZN investor hedged with the collar above had several <b>possible</b> courses of action available to him , among them these : If bearish , exit his position ( stock + hedge ) with a 1.15 % loss . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>If more bearish, do the same as the above, except hold on to the put leg of the collar, as a bet against the stock.In our view, and in light of Portfolio Armor's updated potential return on AMZN, staying the course would seem to make the most sense now.Since the hedge doesn't expire until July, you can hold the position through the next earnings release.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given that the cap on the collar is far above our updated potential return , it <b>probably</b> does n't make sense to buy-to-close the call leg now .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is also consistent with our research as part of our backtesting the hedged portfolio method .We found that, on average, the highest returns came from holding securities for six months, or until just before their hedges expired, whichever came first.Essentially, this gave the underlying securities more time to recover from declines and generate better performance.</div></body></html>
