( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In a recent article , we noted David Einhorn had shorted <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and we <b>suggested</b> readers should n't follow his example . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>We argued the stock's high valuation was unlikely to tank it.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>What <b>could</b> tank the stock , we wrote , was <b>disappointing</b> quarterly numbers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Now that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has posted <b>disappointing</b> numbers , we discuss what they mean and update our potential return for it . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>We also update the status of the hedge we posted for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and discuss courses of action for hedged <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investors . In a recent article ( '' Einhorn Shorted <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - You Should n't '' ) , we noted that value investor David Einhorn had disclosed that he 'd shorted <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) in the fourth quarter of 2015 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We suggested investors avoid shorting the stock , and wrote that , if anything , they should consider buying it , given its high potential return as calculated by Portfolio Armor , provided they hedged to limit their downside <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Although Einhorn did n't give his short thesis for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in his investor letter , we wrote that we suspected it was based on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's high valuation according to traditional metrics such as P/E and PEG . We argued that the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's high valuation was unlikely to be a negative catalyst for the stock , because the stock had long had a pricey valuation : Yes , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a pricey stock , but that 's not new , as the 5 year average P/E shows , so it 's not something one would expect to tank the stock . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The most likely catalysts for a significant pullback in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares would be a continuation of the recent stock market correction , or <b>disappointing</b> quarterly numbers ( the company is expected to release its fourth quarter and annual numbers after the close on January 28th ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>As it happened , the market rebounded last week , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did report dissapointing quarterly numbers on January 28th , after the close , and the stock dropped 7.6 % the following day . In this article , we 'll highlight the most important takeaways from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's release , update our potential return for the stock , update the status of the hedge we posted pre-earnings , and consider courses of action now for hedged <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shareholders . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenues beat the company 's guidance , but missed the consensus estimates of Wall Street and Estimize , as the chart from Estimize below shows . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company reported revenues of $ 35.7 billion , above its own guidance of $ 35.1 billion , but <i>less</i> than Wall Street 's consensus estimate of $ 35.9 billion , and still <i>less</i> than Estimize 's consensus estimate of $ 35.98 billion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>bigger</i> gaps between Wall Street 's and Estimize 's consensus estimates and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's actual results were on the earnings per share numbers , as the next Estimize chart shows . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although the Q4 earnings had <i>more</i> than doubled year-over-year from $ 0.45 per share to $ 1 , Wall Street analysts had expected $ 1.61 per share , and Estimize 's consensus estimate was slightly <i>higher</i> at $ 1.64 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As Inc. noted , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ability to rein in costs was <i>less</i> than analysts had <b>anticipated</b> : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's strategy has long been to invest most of the money it makes back into its businesses , particularly by expanding offerings in its Prime loyalty program and its cloud-computing business , called <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>After operating at or near a loss for years, it has finally also demonstrated the ability to turn a consistent profit.On Friday , Bloomberg reported another example of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investing in its businesses by expanding its offerings , in the form of its new radio/podcasting service ( `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Hiring Comedians , Engineers , For Growing Audio Service '' ) . In our previous article , we mentioned that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was the highest-ranked security in Portfolio Armor 's universe when ranked by potential return , and had been one of the site 's top-ranked names consistently since last August . As a reminder, potential return, in our terminology, is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next 6 months.Starting with every security (stocks as well as exchange-traded products such as ETFs) with options traded on it in the US, we apply two screens to eliminate the least promising ones, and then we use price action as well as option market sentiment to calculate potential returns.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Essentially , we start with the <b>assumption</b> that a security 's return over the next six months will begin to revert to its long term mean six-month return .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then , we test that assumption by looking at the prices of options on the security that expire in <b>approximately</b> six months .  (Uncertainty) </span>That test of option market sentiment gives a forward-looking element, because it represents the views of option market participants on where the underlying security is likely to be several months out.We backtested this method by running our analysis every trading day from 1/2/2003 to 10/31/2013 and then looking at the actual returns of the securities with the highest potential returns on our daily scans over the next six months.Over that 11-year period, we conducted 25,412 comparisons of our calculated potential returns to actual returns, an average of 9.4 top-ranked securities each trading day.The average potential return we calculated was 22.4%.The average actual return over the next six months, unhedged, was 6.84%.Since the average actual return was 0.3x the average potential return, we use that 0.3x multiple to derive expected returns from our potential returns.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While a potential return represents a bullish upside , an expected return is the <i>more</i> likely result .  (Surprise) </span>In our previous article on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , it was the # 1-ranked security in our universe , with a potential return of 30 % over the next six months . Post-earnings , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has dropped to # 10 in our universe , with an updated potential return of 16 % . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The <b>optimal</b> collar below , calculated using the Portfolio Armor iOS app , was designed to limit an investor 's downside to a drawdown of no <i>more</i> than 15 % by mid-July , 2016 , while capping his potential upside at 30 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The reason the cap was set as 30% was because that was the potential return calculated for AMZN at the time.Here is an updated quote on the put leg of the collar as of 1/29.Hedged Versus Unhedged Performance Since 1/22 AMZN closed at $596.38 on Friday, January 22nd.A shareholder who owned 100 shares of it and opened the collar above then had $59,638 in the stock plus $3,460 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call position, he would have had to pay $755 to do that.So, his net position value for AMZN on January 22nd was ($59,380 + $3,460) - $755 = $62,085.AMZN closed at $587 on Friday, January 29th, down 1.5% from its closing price on January 22nd.The investor's shares were worth $58,700 as of 1/29 and his put options were worth $3,230, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $560.So: ($58,700 + $3,230) - $560 = $61,370.This represents a 1.15% drop from $60,786.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Courses Of Action For Hedged <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Investors As of Friday , an AMZN investor hedged with the collar above had several <b>possible</b> courses of action available to him , among them these : If bearish , exit his position ( stock + hedge ) with a 1.15 % loss . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If <i>more</i> bearish , do the same as the above , except hold on to the put leg of the collar , as a bet against the stock .  (Surprise) </span>In our view, and in light of Portfolio Armor's updated potential return on AMZN, staying the course would seem to make the most sense now.Since the hedge doesn't expire until July, you can hold the position through the next earnings release.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given that the cap on the collar is far above our updated potential return , it <b>probably</b> does n't make sense to buy-to-close the call leg now .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is also consistent with our research as part of our backtesting the hedged portfolio method .We found that, on average, the highest returns came from holding securities for six months, or until just before their hedges expired, whichever came first.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Essentially , this gave the underlying securities <i>more</i> time to recover from declines and generate <i>better</i> performance .  (Surprise) </span></div></body></html>
