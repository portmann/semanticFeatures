(Uncertainty) </span>"Staying power can be dramatically underrated by traders, even while it is the lifeblood of long-term investors," said Cramer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To make money in <b>uncertain</b> markets for the long term , it 's best to invest in stocks with staying power .  (Uncertainty) </span>"There is just one problem.On any given day, we don't know who is really stuck in a downward spiral or who is just pausing while gathering strength; who is being overrun by new forces and who can withstand them, or even adapt to them over time," he said.Consider the two companies, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Macy's (NYSE: M ), which reported earnings.Disney missed earnings for the first time in 5 years, which led to a bearish discussion on the fall-out of ESPN, which is an important revenue stream for the company.This discussion came in light of growing technologies that make TV irrelevant in times of on-demand content on smartphones.The company's broadcast numbers were below expectations, and it took a $147M charge from the closure of the Infinity console games business."These are all subpar.I am not making excuses for them.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , I think the negatives here mask a much <i>bigger</i> long-term picture , '' said Cramer .  (Surprise) </span>Disney grew its EPS by 11%, and management is running the company with a long-term view.It has enough intellectual property to produce a mega-blockbuster movie every quarter for a long time.There is lot in the pipeline for Disney, and rating it based on ESPN is not fair."As much as I like Disney long term, I can't feel the same about Macy's," said Cramer.The company is not the same when you look at the future.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Anything sold at Macy 's can be found at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) for <i>cheaper</i> rates . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>`` If things go extremely well , they <b>might</b> just get back to a <i>better</i> level , but if things go awry ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Let's just call them terminated," concluded Cramer.He saw similar fate for Staples (NASDAQ: SPLS ) and Office Depot (NASDAQ: ODP ), which fell tremendously after their merger was denied by a federal government.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The game in the office supply space <b>seems</b> to be over .  (Uncertainty) </span>The same theory applies to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That company has changed billions of lives , and not many know what it has in the pipeline , but whatever it <b>may</b> be , people will kill to get their hands on it .  (Uncertainty) </span>It has staying power like Disney.CEO interview - Shutterstock (NYSE: SSTK ) Shutterstock is a digital image repository for high-quality photos, videos, illustrations and music.In a digital world, Shutterstock is making it easy to create imagery that many companies are looking for.The stock has rebounded after last year and is up 25% in 2016.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company posted an earnings beat for the quarter , and Cramer interviewed CEO Jon Oringer to know <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Oringer mentioned that Shutterstock is a leader in commercial images and is moving into the editorial space following the partnership with Associated Press.All of their images will be available to Shutterstock's enterprise accounts, which has 30,000 agencies."We have 1.5 million customers.They are businesses of all sizes that use our images to sell their products and services.That equates to selling five images every single second," he added.The company's 25% revenue from enterprise accounts, and 60% of its revenue comes from outside the US.It has translated to 20 different languages, which show that Shutterstock is a global company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Oringer explained the Shutterstock business model , and he is <b>optimistic</b> about the way the company is growing .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company has no debt and invests in its buyback program.It generates $500M in annual revenue.Cramer said Shutterstock is a good company with solid growth.As the world economies bounce back, oil goes to $50 and the greenback returns to where it was 15 days prior, the industrial stocks will be on a roll.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>`` I 'm still a believer in the thesis that the dollar is headed <i>lower</i> , and things <b>could</b> be looking up for the industrial cohort , '' said Cramer .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>He found 6 off-the-radar industrial plays that outperformed recently and calls them "dirty half-dozen" industrials.The first stock is Albemarle Corp. (NYSE: ALB ), which makes technologically advanced specialty chemicals for various industries, including rechargeable batteries.The company reported a blowout quarter which sent its stock up 10%.ALB is up 33% for the year.The second stock is AptarGroup (NYSE: ATR ), which is a top player in the packaging industry that makes dispensing systems for products in the beauty, personal care, home care, pharmaceutical and food and beverage markets.The stock rebounded from its lows, and the weak dollar is giving a rise to its sales in Europe, which accounts for 56% of the company's revenue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The third stock is Carlisle Companies ( NYSE : CSL ) , a diversified manufacturer of products for <i>smaller</i> markets that include roofing , construction , energy , mining , food-service and transportation .

(Surprise) </span>There are about 600 perfumers in the world, and IFF employs 70 of them.The company caters to consumers around the globe, and the Middle-East is doing well for IFF.Figbig mentioned that the company is able to do well since it equally split between emerging markets and the developed world, and also half and half between foods and fragrances, which are stable businesses.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In the <i>earlier</i> days , no one wanted to buy ancillary Disney plays , since they <b>could</b> buy Disney stock .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Those roles have reversed, as investors have left Disney but are buying ancillary plays like Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ) and Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS ) which greatly benefit from partnership with the company.Investors will ultimately realize that what is good for these companies will be good for Disney too.Is the Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA )-Rite Aid (NYSE: RAD ) merger likely to get stuck?While Cramer is positive the deal will go through, he doesn't know what the federal government will come up with.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ): Open any good gaming device and you will find an Nvidia device in it.Cramer likes the stock.Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ): It's a tough stock, since it has a good dividend and balance sheet, but doesn't have momentum.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Jim Cramer 's Action Alerts PLUS : Check out Cramer 's multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks <b>could</b> be HUGE winners .
