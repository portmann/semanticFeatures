International Flavors Fragrances and Shutterstock Stocks discussed on the indepth session of Jim Cramers Mad Money Program Wednesday May Staying power can be dramatically underrated by traders even while it is the lifeblood of longterm investors said Cramer To make money in uncertain markets for the long term its best to invest in stocks with staying power There is just one problem On any given day we dont know who is really stuck in a downward spiral or who is just pausing while gathering strength who is being overrun by new forces and who can withstand them or even adapt to them over time he said Consider the two companies Disney NYSE DIS and Macys NYSE M which reported earnings Disney missed earnings for the first time in years which led to a bearish discussion on the fallout of ESPN which is an important revenue stream for the company This discussion came in light of growing technologies that make TV irrelevant in times of ondemand content on smartphones The companys broadcast numbers were below expectations and it took a M charge from the closure of the Infinity console games business These are all subpar I am not making excuses for them However I think the negatives here mask a much bigger longterm picture said Cramer Disney grew its EPS by and management is running the company with a longterm view It has enough intellectual property to produce a megablockbuster movie every quarter for a long time There is lot in the pipeline for Disney and rating it based on ESPN is not fair As much as I like Disney long term I cant feel the same about Macys said Cramer The company is not the same when you look at the future Anything sold at Macys can be found at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN for cheaper rates If things go extremely well they might just get back to a better level but if things go awry Lets just call them terminated concluded Cramer He saw similar fate for Staples NASDAQ SPLS and Office Depot NASDAQ ODP which fell tremendously after their merger was denied by a federal government The game in the office supply space seems to be over The same theory applies to Apple NASDAQ AAPL That company has changed billions of lives and not many know what it has in the pipeline but whatever it may be people will kill to get their hands on it It has staying power like Disney CEO interview Shutterstock NYSE SSTK Shutterstock is a digital image repository for highquality photos videos illustrations and music In a digital world Shutterstock is making it easy to create imagery that many companies are looking for The stock has rebounded after last year and is up in The company posted an earnings beat for the quarter and Cramer interviewed CEO Jon Oringer to know more Oringer mentioned that Shutterstock is a leader in commercial images and is moving into the editorial space following the partnership with Associated Press All of their images will be available to Shutterstocks enterprise accounts which has agencies We have million customers They are businesses of all sizes that use our images to sell their products and services That equates to selling five images every single second he added The companys revenue from enterprise accounts and of its revenue comes from outside the US It has translated to different languages which show that Shutterstock is a global company Oringer explained the Shutterstock business model and he is optimistic about the way the company is growing The company has no debt and invests in its buyback program It generates M in annual revenue Cramer said Shutterstock is a good company with solid growth As the world economies bounce back oil goes to and the greenback returns to where it was days prior the industrial stocks will be on a roll Im still a believer in the thesis that the dollar is headed lower and things could be looking up for the industrial cohort said Cramer He found offtheradar industrial plays that outperformed recently and calls them dirty halfdozen industrials The first stock is Albemarle Corp NYSE ALB which makes technologically advanced specialty chemicals for various industries including rechargeable batteries The company reported a blowout quarter which sent its stock up ALB is up for the year The second stock is AptarGroup NYSE ATR which is a top player in the packaging industry that makes dispensing systems for products in the beauty personal care home care pharmaceutical and food and beverage markets The stock rebounded from its lows and the weak dollar is giving a rise to its sales in Europe which accounts for of the companys revenue The third stock is Carlisle Companies NYSE CSL a diversified manufacturer of products for smaller markets that include roofing construction energy mining foodservice and transportation The company makes strategic acquisitions to grow Its stock is up since February ParkerHannifin NYSE PH the maker of motion and control systems for the industrial aerospace and mobile machinery markets is next The company started to cut costs after its November low and has been able to do a good job Weaker dollar is also helping ParkerHannifin The stock is up since January and Cramer thinks it has more room to run The next stock is RPM International NYSE RPM which has a long track record of smart acquisitions to grow The company makes paints coatings sealants roofing systems and specialty chemicals The shares are up from their February lows Lastly Rockwell Automation NYSE ROK which sells industrial automation solutions is up since January Rockwell had two good quarters and Cramer believes the management will continue to do well All these players have one common thread They are all vital to their customers and as the environment improves I bet that spells success for all of concluded Cramer CEO interview International Flavors Fragrances NYSE IFF International Flavors Fragrances is a leading suppliers of flavors and fragrances for food beverage personal care and household products It posted a terrific earnings beat with raised guidance I like the describe IFF as a stealth technology company It may seem frivolous but what these guys do is all about science said Cramer The company invents proprietary compounds with a specific taste or scent and then licenses it to the food beverage and consumer packaged industry As the dollar continues to weaken it will help the IFF stock Cramer interviewed CEO Andreas Fibig to know more about the prospects of the company I would say we are in the business of art and science That describes us very very well Many of our perfumes create all of these wonderful fragrances and all the wonderful tastes that you can basically taste in every ice cream or beverage you drink said Figbig There are about perfumers in the world and IFF employs of them The company caters to consumers around the globe and the MiddleEast is doing well for IFF Figbig mentioned that the company is able to do well since it equally split between emerging markets and the developed world and also half and half between foods and fragrances which are stable businesses In the earlier days no one wanted to buy ancillary Disney plays since they could buy Disney stock Those roles have reversed as investors have left Disney but are buying ancillary plays like Electronic Arts NASDAQ EA and Hasbro NASDAQ HAS which greatly benefit from partnership with the company Investors will ultimately realize that what is good for these companies will be good for Disney too Is the Walgreens NASDAQ WBA Rite Aid NYSE RAD merger likely to get stuck While Cramer is positive the deal will go through he doesnt know what the federal government will come up with Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Open any good gaming device and you will find an Nvidia device in it Cramer likes the stock WalMart NYSE WMT Its a tough stock since it has a good dividend and balance sheet but doesnt have momentum Jim Cramers Action Alerts PLUS Check out Cramers multimillion
