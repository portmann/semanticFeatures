mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article AMZN reported a disappointing Q on soft revenue and an EPS miss Weak profit is a function of higher logistics capex which I believe will remain elevated in the near term Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Q caught the market by surprise given the structural migration towards ecommerce and the robust holiday sales figures that we saw late last year However worth noting is that much of the revenue miss was driven by the weakness in international sales while the bottomline miss was driven by higherthanexpected investment in fulfilment and logistics Ultimately investors have to ask themselves is AMZN heading into another investment cycle that may continue to cap the companys profit The answer I got after the quarterly call is yes and that profitoriented investors will continue to be disappointed as the company scales up its logistics platform That said AMZN remains a revenue story in the foreseeable future With the stock down after the results I believe the correction is reasonable given that it more than doubled in For growth investors I would still be a buyer of the stock as long as revenue growth remains intact the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime ecosystem continues to expand and AWS is taking more shares from local datacentercloud providers Revenue of b yy was in line with consensus but EPS of missed by a whopping Guidance of bb yy was largely in line with the b consensus North America remains AMZNs key market with yy growth and accounts for of total revenue As I have said in my previous notes the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime ecosystem has been gaining traction across the region given its value proposition in both ecommerce and online video However the growing demand for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime has put logistics pressure on the company which is considering building its own logistics fleet of trucks and airplanes given the inadequacy of its logistics partners That said lower profit margin due to higher logistics cost from the growing demand for its Prime ecosystem is a problem that I can live by On the other hand international revenue growth of exc FX is slightly disappointing and could be a function of logistics and lack of Prime penetration Additionally I believe that AMZN may also be facing early signs of competition in the overseas market from local ecommerce providers in the region given that the local platforms may have better merchant relationship and logistics network than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This is a demand issue that the company needs to address and could potentially impact its revenue growth profile in the coming years Heading forward profitoriented investors should exit the stock because it appears that AMZN is once again becoming a revenue growth story In my view Prime and FBA will continue to drive AMZNs nearterm revenue profile and this will require additional spending on logistics which will further pressure profit growth As long as AMZNs North America revenue is strong I believe it is a good indicator that the company may see similar success once it rolls out Prime across its overseas market AMZN will turn a profit eventually but given the low ecommerce penetration around the world with China at of total retail spending US at and Europe at there is still a lot of runway for the structural rise in ecommerce so a sustainable profit may not materialize this decade As for the overseas growth it may be too early to conclude whether local competition may have impacted AMZNs growth profile but worth noting is that Otto Group and Tesco NASDAQ TESO are both ramping up their ecommerce platforms in Europe Alibaba NYSE BABA and JDcom NASDAQ JD have been scaling up their crossborder ecommerce capabilities in Asia and MercadoLibre NASDAQ MELI has been making steady gains in Latin America In the near term AMZN will continue to dominate Europe and North America ecommerce but longterm growth will depend on how quickly it can ramp up Prime and global logistics Conclusion I remain bullish on AMZN and continue to like how it is positioned for the ecommerce trend However I would be more constructive on the stock at the level as I suspect additional profitoriented investors may wind down their AMZN positions in the next week or so Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
