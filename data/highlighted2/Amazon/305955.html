( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AMZN reported a <b>disappointing</b> Q4 on soft revenue and an EPS miss .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Weak profit is a function of <i>higher</i> logistics capex , which I <b>believe</b> will remain elevated in the near term .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Q4 caught the market by <b>surprise</b> given the structural migration towards e-commerce and the robust holiday sales figures that we saw late last year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>However, worth noting is that much of the revenue miss was driven by the weakness in international sales while the bottom-line miss was driven by higher-than-expected investment in fulfilment and logistics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Ultimately , investors have to ask themselves `` is AMZN heading into another investment cycle that <b>may</b> continue to cap the company 's profit ? ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The answer I got after the quarterly call is `` yes , '' and that profit-oriented investors will continue to be <b>disappointed</b> as the company scales up its logistics platform .  (Surprise) </span>That said, AMZN remains a revenue story in the foreseeable future.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the stock down -11 % after the results , I <b>believe</b> the correction is reasonable given that it <i>more</i> than doubled in 2015 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For growth investors , I would still be a buyer of the stock as long as revenue growth remains intact ; the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime ecosystem continues to expand , and AWS is taking <i>more</i> shares from local datacenter/cloud providers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Revenue of $35.75b, +22% y/y, was in line with consensus, but EPS of $1.00 missed by a whopping $0.56.Guidance of $26.5b-29b (+17-28% y/y) was largely in line with the $27.65b consensus.North America remains AMZN's key market with +24% y/y growth and accounts for 60% of total revenue.As I have said in my previous notes , the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime ecosystem has been gaining traction across the region given its value proposition in both e-commerce and online video . However , the growing demand for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime has put logistics pressure on the company which is considering building its own logistics fleet of trucks and airplanes given the inadequacy of its logistics partners . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That said , <i>lower</i> profit margin due to <i>higher</i> logistics cost from the growing demand for its Prime ecosystem is a problem that I can live by .  (Surprise) </span>On the other hand, international revenue growth of +12% (+22% exc.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>FX ) is slightly <b>disappointing</b> and <b>could</b> be a function of logistics and lack of Prime penetration .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Additionally , I believe that AMZN <b>may</b> also be facing early signs of competition in the overseas market from local e-commerce providers in the region given that the local platforms <b>may</b> have <i>better</i> merchant relationship and logistics network than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a demand issue that the company needs to address and <b>could</b> potentially impact its revenue growth profile in the coming years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Heading forward , profit-oriented investors should exit the stock because it <b>appears</b> that AMZN is once again becoming a revenue growth story .  (Uncertainty) </span>In my view, Prime and FBA will continue to drive AMZN's near-term revenue profile, and this will require additional spending on logistics, which will further pressure profit growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As long as AMZN 's North America revenue is strong , I believe it is a good indicator that the company <b>may</b> see similar success once it rolls out Prime across its overseas market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AMZN will turn a profit eventually , but given the low e-commerce penetration around the world with China at 10 % of total retail spending , US at 8 % and Europe at 5-7 % , there is still a lot of runway for the structural rise in e-commerce , so a sustainable profit <b>may</b> not materialize this decade .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As for the overseas growth , it <b>may</b> be too early to conclude whether local competition <b>may</b> have impacted AMZN 's growth profile , but worth noting is that Otto Group and Tesco ( NASDAQ : TESO ) are both ramping up their e-commerce platforms in Europe , Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) and JD.com ( NASDAQ : JD ) have been scaling up their cross-border e-commerce capabilities in Asia , and MercadoLibre ( NASDAQ : MELI ) has been making steady gains in Latin America .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the near term , AMZN will continue to dominate Europe and North America e-commerce , but long-term growth will <b>depend</b> on how quickly it can ramp up Prime and global logistics .  (Uncertainty) </span>Conclusion - I remain bullish on AMZN and continue to like how it is positioned for the e-commerce trend.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , I would be <i>more</i> constructive on the stock at the $ 550 level as I suspect additional profit-oriented investors <b>may</b> wind down their AMZN positions in the next week or so .
