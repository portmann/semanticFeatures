(Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a demand issue that the company needs to address and <b>could</b> potentially impact its revenue growth profile in the coming years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Heading forward , profit-oriented investors should exit the stock because it <b>appears</b> that AMZN is once again becoming a revenue growth story .  (Uncertainty) </span>In my view, Prime and FBA will continue to drive AMZN's near-term revenue profile, and this will require additional spending on logistics, which will further pressure profit growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As long as AMZN 's North America revenue is strong , I believe it is a good indicator that the company <b>may</b> see similar success once it rolls out Prime across its overseas market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AMZN will turn a profit eventually , but given the low e-commerce penetration around the world with China at 10 % of total retail spending , US at 8 % and Europe at 5-7 % , there is still a lot of runway for the structural rise in e-commerce , so a sustainable profit <b>may</b> not materialize this decade .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As for the overseas growth , it <b>may</b> be too early to conclude whether local competition <b>may</b> have impacted AMZN 's growth profile , but worth noting is that Otto Group and Tesco ( NASDAQ : TESO ) are both ramping up their e-commerce platforms in Europe , Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) and JD.com ( NASDAQ : JD ) have been scaling up their cross-border e-commerce capabilities in Asia , and MercadoLibre ( NASDAQ : MELI ) has been making steady gains in Latin America .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the near term , AMZN will continue to dominate Europe and North America e-commerce , but long-term growth will <b>depend</b> on how quickly it can ramp up Prime and global logistics .  (Uncertainty) </span>Conclusion - I remain bullish on AMZN and continue to like how it is positioned for the e-commerce trend.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , I would be <i>more</i> constructive on the stock at the $ 550 level as I suspect additional profit-oriented investors <b>may</b> wind down their AMZN positions in the next week or so .
