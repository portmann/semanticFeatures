(Uncertainty) </span>In this scenario, Netflix still makes an extra $27 million per month (or $327 million per year) in revenue.The attrition rate would need to be 20% for the revenue lost to negate the revenue gained completely.In summary, I expect the number of existing Netflix customers to leave due to the price hike to be closer to 1-2% as opposed to the 3-4% number that analysts are expecting.And even if the number is on the higher end, Netflix is still going to make a boatload of new revenue.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Services , Music & Video Stores, Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
