Cable costs increase every year, but it's estimated that only 1% of customers actually cancel their cable TV service every year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And the perception of cable is much <i>lower</i> than that of Netflix .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While it 's not an apples-to-apples comparison , and considering the fact that this is the first real price hike for existing customers , I still feel like the actual percentage of customers that leave due to the price hike is <i>closer</i> to the 1-2 % range .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Consider also the new $ 10/month price for Netflix is still <i>cheaper</i> than Hulu 's $ 12/month rate , although <i>more</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's $ 99/year fee . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's new $ 9/month Prime Video membership plan could result in some attrition for Netflix , but considering that Netflix management credited the company 's original programming lineup for fueling domestic subscriber growth I think the hit will be <i>lower</i> than <b>anticipated</b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Either way, Netflix will be just fine.Even if the customer attrition rate is 4%, the company comes out way ahead.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> 17 million customers are affected , that would mean 16.32 million pay the extra $ 2/month and Netflix loses $ 8/month on 680,000 .  (Uncertainty) </span>In this scenario, Netflix still makes an extra $27 million per month (or $327 million per year) in revenue.The attrition rate would need to be 20% for the revenue lost to negate the revenue gained completely.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In summary , I expect the number of existing Netflix customers to leave due to the price hike to be <i>closer</i> to 1-2 % as opposed to the 3-4 % number that analysts are expecting .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And even if the number is on the <i>higher</i> end , Netflix is still going to make a boatload of new revenue .
