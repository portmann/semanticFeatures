( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Analysts are forecasting a 3-4 % attrition rate for existing customers hit with the $ 2 per month rate hike .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>believe</b> the number will be <i>closer</i> to the 1-2 % range .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Even at a 4% attrition rate, Netflix stands to gain over $320 million in additional annual revenue with the rate hike.The rate hike revenue will help to begin offsetting a trailing 12-month free cash flow figure that is approaching -$1B.Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) reported its first quarter results after the market close on Monday.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As has been the case historically , the markets looked <b>almost</b> exclusively at the number of subscribers and the rate of forecast subscriber growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I like to pay <i>closer</i> attention to the company 's cash flow burn , which has been increasing in recent quarter thanks to the focus on international expansion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In Q1 , Netflix posted free cash flow of - $ 237 million , bringing its total trailing 12-month cash outflow to <b>nearly</b> - $ 1 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now that the company's international expansion is largely complete, it's time to start showing that all the investment is going to pay dividends.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The price for existing customers would add <i>more</i> than $ 408 million in revenue annually ( <b>assuming</b> no attrition due to the price hike ) , which should help the cash flow situation .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But , according to the management team , real results <b>may</b> not come until the second half of 2017 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , for this quarter the most interesting thing <b>may</b> be what management has to say about the impending monthly price increase for customers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> specifically , how many of those customers are going to ultimately reject Netflix 's service at the new price point ?  (Surprise) </span>Reed Hastings said in the shareholder letter that he expects the company to see "only modestly increased churn from unÂ­grandfathering," but there are a wide array of thoughts on the subject.To set the table, new customers began paying the new rate about two years ago, but existing customers were grandfathered into the old rate of $8/month until now.Some 17 million of Netflix's estimated 81 million customers (that's the Q1 estimate at least) will be affected.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>How many customers will actually attrite is a matter of some speculation but there seem to be <b>differing</b> opinions .  (Uncertainty) </span>Here are some things we do know... This comes according to a study from JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There 's some downside to hitting customers with <i>higher</i> costs when they were n't expecting it , but it 's also <b>unclear</b> how many of those folks watch their bills closely .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That's a gross exaggeration since nowhere near that number will actually leave.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This article talks about how this UBS ( NYSE : UBS ) survey number <i>more</i> reflects people 's opposition to <i>higher</i> costs as opposed to actually cancelling their service .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's still a lot <i>lower</i> than the 68 % number when customers are asked about cancelling their cable TV subscription .  (Surprise) </span>So there's that.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is <i>closer</i> to the actual number but still way too high .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think these surveys demonstrate tough talk about having to pay <i>higher</i> fees for the same service but say little about actual action from customers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While this is <b>probably</b> a reasonable estimate , I still think it 's too high .  (Uncertainty) </span>Consider this.The trend of `` cutting the cord '' has been gaining steam for a while thanks to the emergence of services like Netflix , Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Prime . Cable costs increase every year, but it's estimated that only 1% of customers actually cancel their cable TV service every year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And the perception of cable is much <i>lower</i> than that of Netflix .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While it 's not an apples-to-apples comparison , and considering the fact that this is the first real price hike for existing customers , I still feel like the actual percentage of customers that leave due to the price hike is <i>closer</i> to the 1-2 % range .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Consider also the new $ 10/month price for Netflix is still <i>cheaper</i> than Hulu 's $ 12/month rate , although <i>more</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's $ 99/year fee . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's new $ 9/month Prime Video membership plan could result in some attrition for Netflix , but considering that Netflix management credited the company 's original programming lineup for fueling domestic subscriber growth I think the hit will be <i>lower</i> than <b>anticipated</b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Either way, Netflix will be just fine.Even if the customer attrition rate is 4%, the company comes out way ahead.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> 17 million customers are affected , that would mean 16.32 million pay the extra $ 2/month and Netflix loses $ 8/month on 680,000 .  (Uncertainty) </span>In this scenario, Netflix still makes an extra $27 million per month (or $327 million per year) in revenue.The attrition rate would need to be 20% for the revenue lost to negate the revenue gained completely.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In summary , I expect the number of existing Netflix customers to leave due to the price hike to be <i>closer</i> to 1-2 % as opposed to the 3-4 % number that analysts are expecting .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And even if the number is on the <i>higher</i> end , Netflix is still going to make a boatload of new revenue .
