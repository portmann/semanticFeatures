hike I believe the number will be closer to the range Even at a attrition rate Netflix stands to gain over million in additional annual revenue with the rate hike The rate hike revenue will help to begin offsetting a trailing month free cash flow figure that is approaching B Netflix NASDAQ NFLX reported its first quarter results after the market close on Monday As has been the case historically the markets looked almost exclusively at the number of subscribers and the rate of forecast subscriber growth I like to pay closer attention to the companys cash flow burn which has been increasing in recent quarter thanks to the focus on international expansion In Q Netflix posted free cash flow of million bringing its total trailing month cash outflow to nearly billion Now that the companys international expansion is largely complete its time to start showing that all the investment is going to pay dividends The price for existing customers would add more than million in revenue annually assuming no attrition due to the price hike which should help the cash flow situation But according to the management team real results may not come until the second half of However for this quarter the most interesting thing may be what management has to say about the impending monthly price increase for customers More specifically how many of those customers are going to ultimately reject Netflixs service at the new price point Reed Hastings said in the shareholder letter that he expects the company to see only modestly increased churn from ungrandfathering but there are a wide array of thoughts on the subject To set the table new customers began paying the new rate about two years ago but existing customers were grandfathered into the old rate of month until now Some million of Netflixs estimated million customers thats the Q estimate at least will be affected How many customers will actually attrite is a matter of some speculation but there seem to be differing opinions Here are some things we do know This comes according to a study from JPMorgan NYSE JPM Theres some downside to hitting customers with higher costs when they werent expecting it but its also unclear how many of those folks watch their bills closely Thats a gross exaggeration since nowhere near that number will actually leave This article talks about how this UBS NYSE UBS survey number more reflects peoples opposition to higher costs as opposed to actually cancelling their service Its still a lot lower than the number when customers are asked about cancelling their cable TV subscription So theres that This is closer to the actual number but still way too high I think these surveys demonstrate tough talk about having to pay higher fees for the same service but say little about actual action from customers While this is probably a reasonable estimate I still think its too high Consider this The trend of cutting the cord has been gaining steam for a while thanks to the emergence of services like Netflix Hulu and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Prime Cable costs increase every year but its estimated that only of customers actually cancel their cable TV service every year And the perception of cable is much lower than that of Netflix While its not an applestoapples comparison and considering the fact that this is the first real price hike for existing customers I still feel like the actual percentage of customers that leave due to the price hike is closer to the range Consider also the new month price for Netflix is still cheaper than Hulus month rate although more than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Primes year fee Amazons new month Prime Video membership plan could result in some attrition for Netflix but considering that Netflix management credited the companys original programming lineup for fueling domestic subscriber growth I think the hit will be lower than anticipated Either way Netflix will be just fine Even if the customer attrition rate is the company comes out way ahead Assuming million customers are affected that would mean million pay the extra month and Netflix loses month on In this scenario Netflix still makes an extra million per month or million per year in revenue The attrition rate would need to be for the revenue lost to negate the revenue gained completely In summary I expect the number of existing Netflix customers to leave due to the price hike to be closer to as opposed to the number that analysts are expecting And even if the number is on the higher end Netflix is still going to make a boatload of new revenue Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and
