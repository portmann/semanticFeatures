Outlook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>And The Retail Sector Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long WMT ORCL MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article On the flipside physical retail stocks were crushed s trend may reverse If nothing else look for the brick and mortar retailers to have a better year The inexorable bull market has hit a pause with the SP NYSEARCA SPY down slightly not including dividends The Fed waited until the bitter end but in the end they delivered the longawaited rate hike putting the finishing touch to ZIRP Emerging markets got utterly destroyed hit hard by the doubleblows of a surging US dollar and collapsing commodity prices Chinese stocks enjoyed a stunning surge followed by a huge plunge and an economic slowdown Over the next two weeks Ill be discussing the in my subjective opinion most important stories of and how they will continue impacting the market in First up the th most important story of the year It was a best of times worst of times sort of situation for the US retail NYSEARCA XRT sector Retail stocks got hit hard with the sector closing the year at the lows and way down from the Spring highs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN on the other hand was up a truly shocking Sure stocks double in a year from time to time But usually not megacaps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>entered the year with a roughly billion market cap no small amount and managed to more than double that in a single year In just calendar year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>added more than billion to its market cap the equivalent of adding an entire Intel NASDAQ INTC Oracle NYSE ORCL Citigroup NYSE C or Home Depot NYSE HD to your business in one short year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is now the th largest market cap company listed on a US exchange and is one or two good trading sessions away from passing the struggling Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB to enter the top Other than for a short period during the dot com bubble it is unprecedented for such a marginally profitable company to be so high up the market cap rankings Schrdingers cat was a famous thought experiment It suggested putting a cat in a box with a tiny vial of a radioactive substance Depending on the actions of various uncontrollable subatomic particles the cat would live or be killed If the radioactive particles decayed fast enough the radioactivity would discharge and kill the cat If not the cat would live Importantly thered be no way to know whether or not this cat was alive until the box was unsealed Thus the cat is both simultaneously alive and dead to the outside world until the box is opened I feel similarly about Amazons prospects The bull and bear arguments are widely known and well worn The company may put most of the retail sector out of business become the WalMart NYSE WMT of the digital age then raise prices and finally make the behemoth profits long anticipated If so shares even after the run would be worth much much more Or the bears may be right that the company is not profitable and that selling on cost isnt a winning strategy As the old adage goes anyone can be a great salesman if theyre selling dollar bills for cents I chuckled seeing a comment the other day that said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a long runway ahead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a history of two decades This is long enough to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>weather thick and thin There you have it two decades of aggressively growing market share while consistently generating negative accounting profits A long history and a long runway simultaneously since the company still doesnt seem interested in making money or returning capital to shareholders My take is that both the bulls and bears are correct at the same time If their respective thesis plays out both sides are correct Problem is the data isnt yet available to determine which one is right <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is unlikely to compound gradually over the next years or more It will either monopolize retail or spectacularly go bust To know which you have to know how government regulation will evolve consumer tastes change sales tax battles go competitors such as WalMart respond and whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can maintain share if and when it raises prices The outcomes to these questions are about as predictable as the movement of the subatomic particles that determine the Schrdingers cats viability And the companys fate wont be decided in the nearterm either As such my opinion is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is either profoundly overpriced or way too cheap The current price is badly off fair valuation But I have no idea to which direction the error lies I have no interest in either buying or shorting it None Amazons gain was at the sectors direct expense WalMart was the highest profile victim as its shares tumbled It was the worst performer in the Dow Jones NYSEARCA DIA for the year Many premature obituaries were written for the company as shares sunk from the s to the s over the course of the year I went long the stock in October following the historic oneday plunge Sentiment washed out with many decrying the Dividend Aristocrat as a washedup old economy stock sinking under the competitive weight Following the drop I wrote this up and my opinion hasnt changed To the bears who always make themselves heard after the YTD decline heres a few pointers to keep in mind WalMart is not primarily competing with Amazoncom The demographics really arent that similar The better comps are companies such as Kroger NYSE KR and Costco NASDAQ COST For one WalMart has tons of overseas business in places like Mexico where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hardly has any presence and wont develop much of one due to an ontheground logistical nightmare If youve spent any time in the developing world youll laugh ruefully if you try to imagine a business model based on cheap day shipping working down here Remember more than half of WalMarts stores are located outside of the US WalMart is another of those flyover state type stocks that the investment bigwigs mostly cloistered in New York and San Francisco dont understand Sure you and I might prefer a root canal to shopping at WalMart regularly But we arent ordinary members of society We may value clean stores friendly employees fast checkouts and fresh merchandise but the marginal value of a dollar to those of us who have large amounts of money in a retirement account is fairly low We may pay up for better service If a person is low on funds its easy to see WalMarts appeal Try imagine living on a five dollar a day grocery budget would your choice of stores change WalMart shares trade now where they did when I wrote that previously A better than yield PE and a long history of steady growth await new investors at current prices WalMart was down for full year but it isnt out The worlds largest retailer has many edges to protect it from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>For one it mostly sells things that you want and need quickly If you need a stick of butter for breakfast or a tube of toothpaste you probably arent going to wait two days for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to deliver Secondly WalMart has a huge portion of its operations overseas where it is largely insulated from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>threat at least for quite a few more years Take a large middleincome emerging economy like Colombia where only of the population has a credit card A foreign etailer wont be supplying a sizable portion of a country like thats groceries or cheap consumables for decades to come For a broader perspective the safest retailers have positions that are more resistant to the Web threat Unique brands products with high shipping costs consumable products such as groceries and foreign stores are all moats from the online barrage Companies like Best Buy NYSE BBY are arguably the most vulnerable As a longterm investment Id avoid retailers that can easily serve as an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>showroom But brick and mortar retail isnt going away particularly overseas People do enjoy shopping after all many folks though not your author enjoy going to the mall simply for the thrill of the hunt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is efficient but it isnt nearly as fun For both utilitarian products such as groceries and more touch feel and try goods a large portion of business will stay with physical retailers The takeaway Amazons valuation is almost entirely unknowable It will be shaped to a large degree by unpredictable future events Your guess is as good as mine if it ends up the worlds top retailer or a bust thirty years from now For the physical retailers there are plenty of spots of value now WalMart is the obvious one But there will be plenty of them that come out of this fine The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>threat is real and certain types of retailers should be concerned But one of the most overblown stories of was the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>effect dooming physical retail The sky isnt falling </div></body></html>
