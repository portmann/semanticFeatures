( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure : I am/we are long WMT , ORCL . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.On the flipside, physical retail stocks were crushed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>2015 's trend <b>may</b> reverse .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If nothing else , look for the brick and mortar retailers to have a <i>better</i> year .  (Surprise) </span>The inexorable bull market has hit a pause, with the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) down slightly not including dividends.The Fed waited until the bitter end, but in the end they delivered the long-awaited rate hike putting the finishing touch to ZIRP.Emerging markets got utterly destroyed, hit hard by the double-blows of a surging US dollar and collapsing commodity prices.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Chinese stocks enjoyed a <b>stunning</b> surge , followed by a huge plunge and an economic slowdown .  (Surprise) </span>Over the next two weeks, I'll be discussing the (in my subjective opinion) 10 most important stories of 2015 and how they will continue impacting the market in 2016.First up, the 10th most important story of the year.It was a best of times, worst of times sort of situation for the US retail (NYSEARCA: XRT ) sector.Retail stocks got hit hard, with the sector closing the year at the lows and way down from the Spring highs.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , on the other hand , was up a truly shocking 118 % . Sure stocks double in a year from time to time.But usually not mega-caps.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> entered the year with a <b>roughly</b> $ 150 billion market cap , no small amount , and managed to <i>more</i> than double that in a single year . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In just calendar year 2015 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> added <i>more</i> than $ 150 billion to its market cap , the equivalent of adding an entire Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) , Oracle ( NYSE : ORCL ) , Citigroup ( NYSE : C ) or Home Depot ( NYSE : HD ) to your business in one short year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is now the 6th largest market cap company listed on a US exchange , and is one or two good trading sessions away from passing the struggling Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE : BRK.A ) ( NYSE : BRK.B ) to enter the top 5 . Other than for a short period during the dot com bubble, it is unprecedented for such a marginally profitable company to be so high up the market cap rankings.Schrödinger's cat was a famous thought experiment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>suggested</b> putting a cat in a box with a tiny vial of a radioactive substance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Depending</b> on the actions of various uncontrollable subatomic particles , the cat would live or be killed .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the radioactive particles decayed fast enough , the radioactivity would discharge and kill the cat .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If not , the cat would live .  (Uncertainty) </span>Importantly, there'd be no way to know whether or not this cat was alive until the box was unsealed.Thus, the cat is both simultaneously alive and dead to the outside world until the box is opened.I feel similarly about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's prospects . The bull and bear arguments are widely known and well worn.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company may put most of the retail sector out of business , become the Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) of the digital age , then raise prices and finally make the behemoth profits long <b>anticipated</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If so , shares , even after the 2015 run , would be worth much much <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or the bears <b>may</b> be right that the company is not profitable and that selling on cost is n't a winning strategy .  (Uncertainty) </span>As the old adage goes, anyone can be a great salesman if they're selling dollar bills for 95 cents.I chuckled seeing a comment the other day that said : `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a long runway ahead -LSB- ... -RSB- <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a history of two decades . This is long enough to see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> weather thick and thin . '' There you have it, two decades of aggressively growing market share while consistently generating negative accounting profits.A long history, and a long runway simultaneously, since the company still doesn't seem interested in making money or returning capital to shareholders.My take is that both the bulls and bears are correct, at the same time!If their respective thesis plays out, both sides are correct.Problem is, the data isn't yet available to determine which one is right.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is unlikely to compound gradually over the next 20 years or <i>more</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It will either monopolize retail or spectacularly go bust.To know which , you have to know how government regulation will evolve , consumer tastes change , sales tax battles go , competitors such as Wal-Mart respond , and whether <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can maintain share if and when it raises prices . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The outcomes to these questions are about as <b>predictable</b> as the movement of the subatomic particles that determine the Schrödinger 's cat 's viability .  (Uncertainty) </span>And the company's fate won't be decided in the near-term either.As such , my opinion is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is either profoundly overpriced , or way too cheap . The current price is badly off fair valuation.But I have no idea to which direction the error lies.I have no interest in either buying or shorting it.None.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's gain was at the sector 's direct expense . Wal-Mart was the highest profile victim, as its shares tumbled.It was the worst performer in the Dow Jones (NYSEARCA: DIA ) for the year.Many premature obituaries were written for the company as shares sunk from the 90s to the 50s over the course of the year.I went long the stock in October following the historic one-day plunge.Sentiment washed out, with many decrying the Dividend Aristocrat as a washed-up old economy stock sinking under the competitive weight.Following the drop, I wrote this up , and my opinion hasn't changed: To the bears - who always make themselves heard after the 30% YTD decline - here's a few pointers to keep in mind.Wal-Mart is not primarily competing with Amazon.com . The demographics really aren't that similar.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>better</i> comps are companies such as Kroger ( NYSE : KR ) and Costco ( NASDAQ : COST ) .  (Surprise) </span>For one , Wal-Mart has tons of overseas business in places like Mexico where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> hardly has any presence - and wo n't develop much of one due to an on-the-ground logistical nightmare . If you've spent any time in the developing world, you'll laugh ruefully if you try to imagine a business model based on cheap 2-day shipping working down here.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Remember , <i>more</i> than half of Wal-Mart 's stores are located outside of the US .  (Surprise) </span>Wal-Mart is another of those fly-over state type stocks that the investment bigwigs, mostly cloistered in New York and San Francisco, don't understand.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sure you and I <b>might</b> prefer a root canal to shopping at Wal-Mart regularly .  (Uncertainty) </span>But we aren't ordinary members of society.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>may</b> value clean stores , friendly employees , fast check-outs and fresh merchandise , but the marginal value of a dollar to those of us who have large amounts of money in a retirement account is fairly low .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>may</b> pay up for <i>better</i> service .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If a person is low on funds, it's easy to see Wal-Mart's appeal.Try imagine living on a five dollar a day grocery budget - would your choice of stores change?Wal-Mart shares trade now where they did when I wrote that previously.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>better</i> than 3 % yield , 13 PE and a long history of steady growth await new investors at current prices .  (Surprise) </span>Wal-Mart was down 29% for full year 2015, but it isn't out.The world 's largest retailer has many edges to protect it from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . For one, it mostly sells things that you want and need quickly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you need a stick of butter for breakfast or a tube of toothpaste , you <b>probably</b> are n't going to wait two days for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to deliver . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Secondly , Wal-Mart has a huge portion of its operations overseas , where it is largely insulated from the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> threat , at least for quite a few <i>more</i> years . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Take a large middle-income emerging economy like Colombia, where only 10% of the population has a credit card.A foreign etailer won't be supplying a sizable portion of a country like that's groceries or cheap consumables for decades to come.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For a <i>broader</i> perspective , the safest retailers have positions that are <i>more</i> resistant to the Web threat .  (Surprise) </span>Unique brands, products with high shipping costs, consumable products such as groceries, and foreign stores are all moats from the online barrage.Companies like Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) are arguably the most vulnerable.As a long-term investment , I 'd avoid retailers that can easily serve as an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> showroom . But brick and mortar retail isn't going away, particularly overseas.People do enjoy shopping after all, many folks (though not your author) enjoy going to the mall simply for the thrill of the hunt.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is efficient but it is n't <b>nearly</b> as fun . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For both utilitarian products such as groceries and <i>more</i> touch , feel and try goods , a large portion of business will stay with physical retailers .  (Surprise) </span>The takeaway?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation is <b>almost</b> entirely unknowable . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It will be shaped to a large degree by <b>unpredictable</b> future events .  (Uncertainty) </span>Your guess is as good as mine if it ends up the world's top retailer or a bust thirty years from now.For the physical retailers, there are plenty of spots of value now.Wal-Mart is the obvious one.But there will be plenty of them that come out of this fine.The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> threat is real , and certain types of retailers should be concerned . But one of the most overblown stories of 2015 was the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> effect dooming physical retail . The sky isn't falling.</div></body></html>
