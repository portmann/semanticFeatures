race against Google Inc to store data on human DNA seeking both bragging rights in helping scientists make new medical discoveries and market share in a business that may be worth billion a year by Academic institutions and healthcare companies are picking sides between their cloud computing offerings Google Genomics or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services spurring the two to oneup each other as they win highprofile genomics business according to interviews with researchers industry consultants and analysts That growth is being propelled by among other forces the push for personalized medicine which aims to base treatments on a patients DNA profile Making that a reality will require enormous quantities of data to reveal how particular genetic profiles respond to different treatments Already universities and drug manufacturers are embarking on projects to sequence the genomes of hundreds of thousands of people The human genome is the full complement of DNA or genetic material a copy of which is found in nearly every cell of the body Clients view Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as doing a better job storing genomics data than they can do using their own computers keeping it secure controlling costs and allowing it to be easily shared The cloud companies are going beyond storage to offer analytical functions that let scientists make sense of DNA data Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines are also competing for a slice of the market The cloud refers to data or software that physically resides in a server and is accessible via the internet which allows users to access it without downloading it to their own computer Now an estimated million to million business globally the cloud genomics market is expected to grow to billion by said research analyst Daniel Ives of investment bank FBR Capital By that time the entire cloud market should have billion to billion in annual revenue up from about billion now The cloud is the entire future of this field Craig Venter who led a private effort to sequence the human genome in the s said in an interview His new company San Diegobased Human Longevity Inc recently tried to import genomic data from servers at the J Craig Venter Institute in Rockville Maryland The transmission was so slow scientists had to resort to sending disks and thumb drives by FedEx and human messengers or sneakernet he said The company now uses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services So does a collaboration between Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Pennsylvaniabased Geisinger Health Systems to sequence genomes Raw DNA data is uploaded to Amazons cloud where software from privatelyheld DNAnexus assembles the millions of chunks into the full billionletter long genome DNAnexuss algorithms then determine where an individual genome differs from the reference human genome the companys chief scientist Dr David Shaywitz said in hopes of identifying new drug targets Showing how important Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>view this business and how they hope to use existing customers to lure future ones each is hosting wellknown genomics datasets for free Neither company discloses the amount of genomics data it holds but based on interviews with analysts and genomic scientists as well as the companies own announcements of what customers theyve won <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services may be bigger Data from the Genomes Project an international publicprivate effort that identified genetic variations found in at least percent of humans reside at both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Google without charge said Kathy Cravedi of the US National Institutes of Health NIH one of the projects sponsors Other paying clients with a more specific focus are picking sides Google for instance won a project from the Autism Speaks foundation to collect and analyze the genomes of affected children and their parents for clues to the genetic basis of autism Another customer is Tute Genomics whose database of billion human DNA variants can be searched for how frequently any given variant appears what traits its associated with and how people with a certain variant respond to particular drugs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is hosting the Multiple Myeloma Foundations project to collect completegenome sequences and other data from patients to identify new drug targets It also wonthe Alzheimers Disease Sequencing Project which has similar aims <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>charges about to a month to store one full human genome and Google about to a month The companies also charge for data transfers or computing time as when scientists run analytical software on stored data Amazons databaseanalysis tool Redshift costs cents an hour or per terabyte per year the company said A terabyte is trillion bytes or gigabytes about enough to hold hours of highquality video Another part of the cloud services pitch to wouldbe customers is that their analytic tools can fish out genetic gold a drug target say or a DNA variant that strongly predicts disease risk from a sea of data Any discoveries made through such searches belong to the owners of the data On the local university server it might take months to run a computationallyintense analysis said Alzheimers project leader Dr Gerard Schellenberg of the University of Pennsylvania On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>its how fast do you need it done and they do it Another selling point is security Universities are generally pretty porous said Ryan Permeh chief scientist at cybersecurity company Cylance Inc of Irvine California and the security of federal government computers is not at the top of the class While academic and pharmaceutical research projects are the biggest customers for genomics cloud services they will be overtaken by clinical applications in the next years said Google Genomics director of engineering David Glazer Individual doctors will regularly access a cloud service to understand how a patients genetic profile affects his risk of various diseases or his likely response to medication We are at that transition point now Glazer said Matt Wood general manager for Data Science at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services sees cloud demand in genomics now as a perfect storm as the amount of data being created the need for collaboration and the move of genomics into clinical care accelerate Experts on DNA and data say without access to the cloud modern genomics would grind to a halt Bioinformatics expert Dr Atul Butte of the University of California San Francisco said that now when researchers at different universities are jointly working on NIH and other genomic data they dont have to figure out how to make their computers talk to each other In March NIH cleared the way for major research on the cloud when it began allowing scientists to upload important genomic data Healthy highfat diet
