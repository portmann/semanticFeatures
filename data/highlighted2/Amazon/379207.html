(NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha VMware co-founder Diane Greene has launched a media offensive for Google Cloud.Software and key customer wins are all in the frame.The Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), formerly known as Google, is sort of the Rip Van Winkle of cloud.For years it chose to see cloud as valuable only for its own operations.It was a consumer service, not a b2b player.Google 's apathy let Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) steal the market with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) , building out a huge global footprint on customers ' dimes while Google focused solely on its own knitting . This changed late last year with the hiring of VMware (NYSE: VMW ) founder Diane Greene.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Her job is to make Google <b>appear</b> hungry for corporate cloud business .  (Uncertainty) </span>The charge is having a small impact today on stock prices.Google shares are up Thursday morning , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> down . Since the start of the year Google has held its value , down 2 % , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares have lost 16 % . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Part of the pitch is that large companies are suddenly afraid of being locked-in to a company that <b>could</b> compete with them whenever it wants to .  (Uncertainty) </span>So Spotify (Private: MUSIC ) says they're moving into Google's Cloud and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is loudly pledging allegiance, even while investing heavily to replace third party clouds with its own.But to be clear, most of what is happening is marketing.The AlphaGo tournament, in which Google's Cloud plays the world's best Go players, is a marketing stunt.In general , Google wants to be seen as the most `` flexible '' cloud , as a reliable alternative to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for companies that are geographically dispersed . So, software.You want market analytics?Want to move your database off servers?How about machine learning and recommendation engines?Partners?We got partners.How about migration tools?The battle is now on, big-time, to make companies move their key database applications to clouds and turn off their internal servers.Once your crown jewels are on the cloud, you're committed to the technology, as the pig on the breakfast plate is committed.So Google 's fight is as much with Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) as it is with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and features like custom machine types , which let companies migrate applications and data from Windows or Linux servers as-is , are key to that . To maintain its current stock price, Google has to maintain a 20% top-line growth rate.That's what it has done for the last four years, going from $37 billion in revenue for 2012 to $66 billion last year.It also needs to hold up profit margins, which have been slowly declining throughout that period.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> do $ 12 billion in AWS business this year , with margins of 28 % , and if Google can do half that - a stretch - it will be halfway to its corporate growth goal . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But the play is also not about this year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Cloud is growing <i>faster</i> than search , and will continue to do so for years to come .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Greene is going to have to deliver a lot <i>more</i> than press releases for Google , to be worth buying strictly based on its Cloud .  (Surprise) </span>The game is afoot, but it has just begun.I like all the major players here.I own some Google , and I own some <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . I even own some Microsoft and Apple.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But if I had to buy one <i>more</i> share of any of these outfits today , it would <b>probably</b> be Alphabet , formerly known as Google .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Disclosure: I am/we are long GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Internet Information Providers</div></body></html>
