Microsoft's cloud capabilities should no longer be underestimated.Sure, there's still ground to make up before Microsoft can be mentioned in the same breath as salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ).But its cloud performance shows Microsoft is not being left behind.Thus it's ridiculous that Microsoft stock is not already over $50, or back to their November high.All told, Nadella has made Wall Street forget the lost decade Microsoft suffered under the leadership of Steve Ballmer.By showing it can create the type of value-added services to grow beyond just Office and Windows, it's clear innovation and growth is now back in Redmond.So I don't see a scenario where Microsoft stock ends 2015 in the red.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>$ 50 per share <b>seems</b> like the next target , based on fiscal 2016 estimates of $ 2.85 , which puts the P/E at 15 , compared to a forward P/E of 17 for the S&P 500 .
