(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Personal computers are dead and Microsoft 's ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) CEO Satya Nadella wants no part of them - at least , that 's what his cloud vision <b>suggests</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>And investors should rejoice.And for that reason, Microsoft stock has become a " no-brainer " - to quote Carl Icahn.Sure, there's "still a place" in our society for the PC.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But any notion suggesting that PC 's are `` on a slow decline '' or `` <b>may</b> revive at some point '' ignores what 's obvious - consumers no longer care about their desktops .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's why Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are investing billions each year to grow their mobile ad capabilities.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And good luck getting a decent search ranking on Google if your website is not '' mobile friendly , '' or <b>optimized</b> for the <i>smaller</i> screens on smartphones .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>How long will it take before Google 's algorithm enforces <i>smaller</i> screens like those on Apple 's ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) Apple Watch , which officially releases Friday .  (Surprise) </span>Essentially, the PC - or various functions of it - now fits on your wrist.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And that 's ( wearables ) going to become a <i>faster-growing</i> market than the PC market Microsoft once thrived upon .  (Surprise) </span>But for now, the company's shareholders should rejoice that Microsoft's "cloud-first" mentality , ushered in by Nadella, has begun to take shape.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For that reason , investors should be piling in on Microsoft stock , which is down <b>roughly</b> 7 % on the year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Save for Apple stock , there 's <b>perhaps</b> no <i>cheaper</i> alternative on the market than Microsoft , when combining its 2.86 % annual dividend yield .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>With its P/E at 17, Microsoft stock is trading at meaningful discount to the S&P 500, which trades at a P/E of 21.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This means if Microsoft traded on par with the rest of the market , the stock would trade today at around $ 55 ( 27 % <i>higher</i> ) , not $ 43 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Sure, Microsoft's growth is still tied to the PC.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That its bulk of revenue and profit comes from Windows and Office may <b>suggest</b> slow growth , thus the discounted P/E .  (Uncertainty) </span>But sales in its commercial division grew 5% to $12.8 billion in the fiscal third quarter.And that commercial cloud revenue grew 106% - the seventh consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth - shows how quickly Nadella is expanding Microsoft's cloud capabilities.This means Microsoft's commercial cloud segment, which comes from its enterprise Office 365 product, Dynamic CRM Online as well as its Azure cloud business, is now its fastest-growing segment .While the company doesn't reveal exact quarterly or annual revenue figures for the cloud business, Microsoft does say that the segment is running at an annualized rate of $6.3 billion.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) on Thursday finally revealed its dominant AWS cloud segment generates $ 5 billion annually . Wall Street responded , sending <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares up 13 % in after-hours . Microsoft's cloud capabilities should no longer be underestimated.Sure, there's still ground to make up before Microsoft can be mentioned in the same breath as salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ).But its cloud performance shows Microsoft is not being left behind.Thus it's ridiculous that Microsoft stock is not already over $50, or back to their November high.All told, Nadella has made Wall Street forget the lost decade Microsoft suffered under the leadership of Steve Ballmer.By showing it can create the type of value-added services to grow beyond just Office and Windows, it's clear innovation and growth is now back in Redmond.So I don't see a scenario where Microsoft stock ends 2015 in the red.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>$ 50 per share <b>seems</b> like the next target , based on fiscal 2016 estimates of $ 2.85 , which puts the P/E at 15 , compared to a forward P/E of 17 for the S&P 500 .  (Uncertainty) </span>And by buying the shares today, investors are assured at least a 7% gain even if Microsoft stock ended the year flat.Source: Microsoft's Cloud-First Mentality Is The Brilliance Of Satya Nadella's Vision Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) The author wrote this article themselves , and it expresses their own opinions .
