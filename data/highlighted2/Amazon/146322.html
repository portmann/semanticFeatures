price increase by a factor of times A recent surge has put the companys market cap over billion even as profits have temporarily declined Bulls attribute this to more aggressive investment especially overseas as evidenced by strong increases in foreign subscriber growth Given some of my recent comments and the admittedly sensational title of this article you might be surprised to learn that the only other article Ive written on Netflix NASDAQ NFLX was actually bullish I argued that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN should buy them out given how cheap Netflix has gotten after the latest selloff Of course that was almost three and a half years ago at less than onetenth the current market cap Needless to say I wish Id taken my own advice and bought shares This may sound like sour grapes after having missed out on the stocks spectacular run since then but Im sure I would have sold it somewhere along the way as the valuation grew to what I now consider to be an absurd level I began to get somewhat skeptical of the valuation last year at a market cap of roughly half of where it is today Then like my investing idol David Einhorn in the second quarter shareholder letter of his investment firm Greenlight Capital NASDAQ GLRE I started to get very bearish this year with the stock around a share after its for split Of course the stock actually soared again after their last earnings report when Netflix showed higher than expected user growth This plus a slight earnings beat more than offset a revenue miss and more negative free cash flow and propelled the stock up almost This even despite the fact that CEO Reed Hastings noted on the conference call that when the stock was half this price I described it as euphoric The stock has not slowed down one bit following this rising another to alltime highs last week While the stock was down slightly on Friday the rest of last week showed all the signs of a classic blowoff top After catching its breath from the previous run Monday on Tuesday the stock was up after announcing a September nd launch date for the service in Japan despite the fact that the company already announced in February that they would be expanding there this fall On Wednesday it was up following a positive mention by Bob Iger on Disneys NYSE DIS conference call as well as media attention regarding their generous parental leave policy And Thursday it was up another as traditional media stocks struggled and DISH Networks NASDAQ DISH Charlie Ergen mentioned Netflix as a possible reason why While having industry luminaries recognize the disruption Netflix is causing may be a reason to like the company that doesnt mean you should pay any price for it At a B market cap Netflix is the size of Disney despite having only the net income last year And while Disney continues to grow earnings Netflix is only expected to earn the same amount this year and the next combined as they did last year This means Disney will earn almost B more in the next two years as Netflix or about times as much Its relatively low fiveyear expected earnings growth rate means Netflix currently trades at a higher PEG ratio than Disneys PE Obviously investors are counting on much longer term high growth rates Ive seen many analysts suggest considering what the company will look like with M subscribers At month this would be annual revenue of B meaning Netflix would currently be trading at times sales Even at double last years record profit margins of this would be B in net income meaning Netflix would be trading at times these earnings Netflix is already being priced like they have M subscribers when in fact they only have less than onethird this many And I think the company could have more difficulty growing subscriber count than bulls are counting on Ive seen writers and analysts say everything from Netflix is showing accelerating to even exponential subscriber growth I guess technically this is correct as long as the exponent is very small such that it would resemble the more linear growth that Netflix has actually showed so far We can do linear and exponential curve fits to this subscriber data and then extrapolate each to show what kind of growth they would entail To reach the million subscribers that many analysts are predicting with their exponential growth forecasts they would have to be adding million new users per quarter or almost a fifth of their entire current subscriber base The truth is probably somewhere in between and while they may continue to show exponential growth for a few more quarters as they launch in new markets and add the low hanging fruit of early adopters it becomes more difficult to add incremental users as they reach saturation in each market In contrast to this many people think it will become easier to add users pointing to a virtuous cycle where as they add more users they can spend more to add more content whose cost can be spread out among more users This may be true but theyre already spending more to attract new users as evidenced by the temporary drop in earnings as they expand internationally To attract additional users that are on the fence they may just have to spend more Meanwhile the only thing actually going parabolic is Netflixs stock price Even after treading water for a few days Netflixs run recently is showing all the signs of a classic bubble At this inflated valuation even a slightly weak user growth number next earnings report could cause the stock to fall precipitously Theres no disputing that this is a great company but expectations have just gotten too high so I would avoid the stock or possibly short it via puts if you can handle the volatility Disclosure I amwe are long GLRE MoreI wrote this article myself and
