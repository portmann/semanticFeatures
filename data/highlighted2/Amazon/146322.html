'' <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Of course , that was <b>almost</b> three and a half years ago at <i>less</i> than one-tenth the current market cap .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Needless to say, I wish I'd taken my own advice and bought shares.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This may sound like sour grapes after having missed out on the stock 's spectacular run since then , but I 'm sure I would have sold it <b>somewhere</b> along the way as the valuation grew to what I now consider to be an absurd level .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I began to get somewhat skeptical of the valuation last year at a market cap of <b>roughly</b> half of where it is today .  (Uncertainty) </span>Then, like my investing idol David Einhorn in the second quarter shareholder letter of his investment firm Greenlight Capital (NASDAQ: GLRE ), I started to get very bearish this year with the stock around $100 a share after its 7-for-1 split.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course , the stock actually soared again after their last earnings report when Netflix showed <i>higher</i> than expected user growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This plus a slight earnings beat <i>more</i> than offset a revenue miss and <i>more</i> negative free cash flow and propelled the stock up <b>almost</b> 20 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This even despite the fact that CEO Reed Hastings noted on the conference call that "when the stock was half this price I described it as euphoric."The stock has not slowed down one bit following this, rising another 10% to all-time highs last week.While the stock was down slightly on Friday, the rest of last week showed all the signs of a classic blow-off top.After catching its breath from the previous run Monday, on Tuesday the stock was up 7% after announcing a September 2nd launch date for the service in Japan, despite the fact that the company already announced in February that they would be expanding there this fall.On Wednesday it was up 4% following a positive mention by Bob Iger on Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) conference call, as well as media attention regarding their generous parental leave policy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And Thursday it was up another 2 % as traditional media stocks struggled and DISH Network 's ( NASDAQ : DISH ) Charlie Ergen mentioned Netflix as a <b>possible</b> reason why .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While having industry luminaries recognize the disruption Netflix is causing <b>may</b> be a reason to like the company , that does n't mean you should pay any price for it .  (Uncertainty) </span>At a $53B market cap, Netflix is 1/3.5 the size of Disney despite having only 1/28 the net income last year.And while Disney continues to grow earnings, Netflix is only expected to earn the same amount this year and the next combined as they did last year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This means Disney will earn <b>almost</b> $ 18B <i>more</i> in the next two years as Netflix , or about 80 times as much .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Its relatively low five-year expected earnings growth rate means Netflix currently trades at a <i>higher</i> PEG ratio than Disney 's P/E .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Obviously , investors are counting on much <i>longer</i> term high growth rates .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 've seen many analysts <b>suggest</b> considering what the company will look like with 200M subscribers .  (Uncertainty) </span>At $10/month, this would be annual revenue of $24B, meaning Netflix would currently be trading at 2 times sales.Even at double last year's record profit margins of 5%, this would be $2.4B in net income, meaning Netflix would be trading at 22 times these earnings.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix is already being priced like they have 200M subscribers when in fact they only have <i>less</i> than one-third this many .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And I think the company <b>could</b> have <i>more</i> difficulty growing subscriber count than bulls are counting on .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I've seen writers and analysts say everything from Netflix is showing accelerating to even exponential subscriber growth.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I guess technically this is correct , as long as the exponent is very small such that it would resemble the <i>more</i> linear growth that Netflix has actually showed so far : We can do linear and exponential curve fits to this subscriber data and then extrapolate each to show what kind of growth they would entail : To reach the 200 million subscribers that many analysts are predicting with their exponential growth forecasts , they would have to be adding 10-15 million new users per quarter , or <b>almost</b> a fifth of their entire current subscriber base .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The truth is probably somewhere in between , and while they <b>may</b> continue to show exponential growth for a few <i>more</i> quarters as they launch in new markets and add the low hanging fruit of early adopters , it becomes <i>more</i> difficult to add incremental users as they reach saturation in each market .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In contrast to this , many people think it will become <i>easier</i> to add users , pointing to a virtuous cycle where as they add <i>more</i> users they can spend <i>more</i> to add <i>more</i> content whose cost can be spread out among <i>more</i> users .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>may</b> be true , but they 're already spending <i>more</i> to attract new users , as evidenced by the temporary drop in earnings as they expand internationally .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To attract additional users that are on the fence they <b>may</b> just have to spend <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Meanwhile, the only thing actually going parabolic is Netflix's stock price.Even after treading water for a few days, Netflix's run recently is showing all the signs of a classic bubble.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At this inflated valuation , even a slightly weak user growth number next earnings report <b>could</b> cause the stock to fall precipitously .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's no disputing that this is a great company , but expectations have just gotten too high , so I would avoid the stock or possibly short it via puts if you can handle the <b>volatility</b> .
