( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha A flight to safety or preference for dividends will sink <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is hard to value , but invaluable to the whole . I have drawn a lot of criticism here over my pounding the table for Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . Things got testy in March, when I called the shares cheap when they were below $380.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When I talked about re-pricing its `` secret sauce , '' <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , in <b>May</b> , the shares had just passed $ 425 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Full disclosure.I started buying <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on the way down , eventually gathering up 100 shares at an average price of $ 330 for my retirement account . The shares fell below $300 for a time, a time where I compared them with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at $400.It is important to note at this point that, at some time in the future, the bears will be right.Nothing rises forever.But at its current valuation of $210 billion, you're still paying a little over $2 for each $1 in estimated 2015 revenue, which should run at about $100 billion.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Or <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>You will still get your investment out.What makes things hard for everyone to value is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It looks like a `` Free Shipping '' deal , a subsidy to regular customers which the bears <b>assume</b> must be costing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> a fortune . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They forget <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's complex pricing algorithms that can roll those costs into the prices shown on a user 's screen - which <b>may</b> be different for two users looking at the same item at the same time . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They also ignore <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's infrastructure for breaking bulk and shipping cheap , which means its operating costs are far <i>lower</i> than anyone else in the e-commerce industry . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In other words, there's retail margin there, operating profit being made available to other operations.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime creates loyalty for profitable business , the money is run <i>more</i> like Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime includes a ton of `` free '' music and `` free '' video , plus something Netflix does not offer - stuff you can buy on top of all that . You can rent or buy all sorts of stuff that's not on Prime, using the same studio "window" they use for Blu-Ray sales, with Christmas releases like "Unbroken" and even later releases like "The Kingsmen" available now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In practice , this means incremental revenue for video , on top of the <b>roughly</b> $ 8/month customers are paying for the `` free '' video .  (Uncertainty) </span>The reason it does n't show up as profit is because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> uses this money to grow the business . The studio is scaling, just like the warehouses and cloud are scaling.It can be hard to pull this out from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's reported results . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the company did deliver on its promise to break out <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services last quarter , a business that <b>could</b> be worth $ 50 billion , and while we know about how many <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime customers there are ( about 40 million ) , meaning that 's a $ 4 billion top line by itself , we do n't get visibility into all the moving parts and how they inter-relate . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>How many additional rentals are made by Prime customers and how many purchases?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We know that Prime customers are far <i>more</i> loyal than any other e-shoppers , abandoning far <i>fewer</i> shopping carts before completing their purchases .  (Surprise) </span>So is Prime part of the marketing budget?Yes, it is.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What <b>could</b> cause <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to miss its `` whisper number , '' which presently stands at a loss of 12 cents per share on revenue of $ 22.36 billion ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe the European tax man will finally get his due - that <b>could</b> cause a shortfall on the bottom line .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> cloud customers are finally turning away from `` bare iron '' infrastructure toward structured software and services , although I have seen no evidence of it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's consumers just did not buy much last quarter , which is why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going out of its way to create `` Prime Day '' today , with tons of stuff on sale ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> it 's just an over-hyped clearance sale , not a new holiday at all .  (Uncertainty) </span>Let's summarize.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Out of a market cap of $ 206 billion there 's $ 50 billion for cloud , <b>probably</b> $ 40 billion for Prime , and $ 110 billion in market cap to cover what looks like another $ 90 billion in 3025 revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span>In this market that's not unreasonable.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When the market changes , when it starts demanding dividends , or when there 's a flight to safety and a flight out of <b>risk</b> , then <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will fall . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But not to zero.At $ 463 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is priced to perfection , as is Netflix , and only a few other companies in the investment world . All such stocks have their Waterloo.But it won't be this week.Now, read the following discussion thread closely, and listen to what the bears say.Consider it carefully before you make an investment.Without predators, prey like bulls over-populate and starve for lack of forage.I like bears.In this case I just don't happen to be one.Source : When Will The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Bears Be Right ?
