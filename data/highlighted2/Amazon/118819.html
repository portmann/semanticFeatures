style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is hard to value but invaluable to the whole I have drawn a lot of criticism here over my pounding the table for Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN Things got testy in March when I called the shares cheap when they were below When I talked about repricing its secret sauce <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime in May the shares had just passed Full disclosure I started buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on the way down eventually gathering up shares at an average price of for my retirement account The shares fell below for a time a time where I compared them with Apple NASDAQ AAPL at It is important to note at this point that at some time in the future the bears will be right Nothing rises forever But at its current valuation of billion youre still paying a little over for each in estimated revenue which should run at about billion Or more You will still get your investment out What makes things hard for everyone to value is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime It looks like a Free Shipping deal a subsidy to regular customers which the bears assume must be costing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a fortune They forget Amazons complex pricing algorithms that can roll those costs into the prices shown on a users screen which may be different for two users looking at the same item at the same time They also ignore Amazons infrastructure for breaking bulk and shipping cheap which means its operating costs are far lower than anyone else in the ecommerce industry In other words theres retail margin there operating profit being made available to other operations While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime creates loyalty for profitable business the money is run more like Netflix NASDAQ NFLX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime includes a ton of free music and free video plus something Netflix does not offer stuff you can buy on top of all that You can rent or buy all sorts of stuff thats not on Prime using the same studio window they use for BluRay sales with Christmas releases like Unbroken and even later releases like The Kingsmen available now In practice this means incremental revenue for video on top of the roughly month customers are paying for the free video The reason it doesnt show up as profit is because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>uses this money to grow the business The studio is scaling just like the warehouses and cloud are scaling It can be hard to pull this out from Amazons reported results While the company did deliver on its promise to break out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services last quarter a business that could be worth billion and while we know about how many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime customers there are about million meaning thats a billion top line by itself we dont get visibility into all the moving parts and how they interrelate How many additional rentals are made by Prime customers and how many purchases We know that Prime customers are far more loyal than any other eshoppers abandoning far fewer shopping carts before completing their purchases So is Prime part of the marketing budget Yes it is What could cause <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to miss its whisper number which presently stands at a loss of cents per share on revenue of billion Maybe the European tax man will finally get his due that could cause a shortfall on the bottom line Maybe cloud customers are finally turning away from bare iron infrastructure toward structured software and services although I have seen no evidence of it Maybe Amazons consumers just did not buy much last quarter which is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going out of its way to create Prime Day today with tons of stuff on sale Maybe its just an overhyped clearance sale not a new holiday at all Lets summarize Out of a market cap of billion theres billion for cloud probably billion for Prime and billion in market cap to cover what looks like another billion in revenue In this market thats not unreasonable When the market changes when it starts demanding dividends or when theres a flight to safety and a flight out of risk then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will fall But not to zero At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is priced to perfection as is Netflix and only a few other companies in the investment world All such stocks have their Waterloo But it wont be this week Now read the following discussion thread closely and listen to what the bears say Consider it carefully before you make an investment Without predators prey like bulls overpopulate and starve for lack of forage I like bears
