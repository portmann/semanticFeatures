Little Known Ways to Save Money at Amazoncom One very well known thing is I love shopping at Amazoncom I am a prime member and I shop online regularly That doesnt mean I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the best price all of the time For instance I just bought a desk finally for my home office While I searched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for a desk I found my desk at Staplescom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Staples both charge sales tax but Staples was cheaper and the shipping was free Just because you love <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt mean you always save money For this reason I figured I would show you there is onebonuses little know ways to save money at Amazoncom or make sure you get the best deal I am always willing to help others save that money cash so consider this my gift to you I am only adding this one to my list because people still ask me about it or seem amazed it exists <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a little known section of their site which encompass deals from returns or broken boxes during shipments They analyze their entire stock and inventory and ones they cant sell as new goes into their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse Deals section I have written a whole article on it before so go ahead and read it Trust me this is a great place to start looking for items to purchase I found my wife a nice digital camera zoom lens which would have been expensive I got it for off because the box was busted during shipment to Amazons warehouse They didnt want to sell the item as new because of the busted box but the lens worked perfectly and was in near mint condition Ever since that moment I always check <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals I have to admit this one is a tip many dont know about but it isnt effective I add it here because I have seen it work and have done it myself This tactic is something I like to call forcing a promotion Why You are trying to push <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to give you a promotion for an item you want to buy Now they might not like this but it can work here and there What you do is shop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>like you normally would When you are done shopping and have all your items in your cart leave them there You have to be signed into your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account for this to work Dont actually buy the items Just leave them in your shopping cart and leave <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for a few days I have found times when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will send you an email about finishing your checkout but then gives you a promotion or discount code for the items in your cart I have saved up to one time when doing this method but again this is hit or miss You really cant hurt yourself trying it so why not If you need an item quickly then you shouldnt try to force a promotion It can take a few days and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has to believe you are just sitting on the items On top of Amazons warehouse deals they also have an outlet section You can go there and find deep discounts on new items every day Currently they have stuff up to off Amazons outlethas overstocks closeouts markdowns and last years models If they need to get rid of inventory they go into the outlet section Those products are all still new and ready for you to purchase and save You can even pick a category and the amount of savings associated and shop for the products that meet that criteria I like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>outlet and have saved good money using it I would hope you can find some good savings at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>outlet Now what in the hell is a name like that I for one cannot tell you why a company named their site this but they have a system which works CamelCamelCamel is one of my gto tools when shopping on Amazoncom You enter the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>URL you want or search for keywords and CamelCamelCamel analyzes the price history of said product Not only do they analyze the historical prices but they put those prices into an easy to see chart You can also set up price drop notifications to make sure you are getting the best deal at Amazoncom CamelCamelCamel analyzes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prices on a constant basis If you want the best price then head over to CamelCamelCamel and put in your email and get notified when the price drops on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a subscribe and save section for everyday items They have had this program for some time but many dont even know about it You can shop Amazons Subscribe and Save section to see all of the products they have to offer This program sends out regular shipments of the items you need on a regular basis They offer discounts on said items If you have or moresubscriptions delivered on your monthly delivery day then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>takes off You can setup what you want then when you want it by each month The discounts are identified on the product pages You dont have to worry about buying them each month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>just sends them to you at a discount If you dont like it anymore you can cancel and the items come with free shipping One of the most secretive ways to save on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is to run your own little price comparison First you log into your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account like you normally would do when shopping on Amazoncom Find the product you want to purchase but dont add it to your cart Next open a new browser better if it were a completely different browser like open <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>originally in your favorite browser then open up Amazoncom again in a new browser Clear you cookies to make sure you are starting fresh Navigate to the same <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>product page and check the price The point of this trick is there are times when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will show lower prices to nonAmazon customers because they want them to buy They show slightly higher prices to loggedin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers because they know you will pay the price for the product This trick can be used on a number of retail ecommerce sites I have seen it work and have done it myself Now as with the add to cart trick this is not but it does work You can even sometimes ask a friend in a different city to check the price and they might have a different one Im a business owner blogger father and husband I used credit cards too much and found myself in over in debt I paid it off started this blog and my financial life has changed I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here I run a Wordpress management company along with another blog It is Empowered Shopper which helps people get information about products they want to buy These are timely with holiday season approaching Can you believe it I just took my kid back to college and Im talking about the holidays Shiver Weve used and successfully but I wasnt aware of the warehouse or the outlet Thanks Grayson So I have been working on a very similar article and I planned to post it this week I think Ill wait lol What timing These are great tips though I didnt even think about adding items to your shopping cart and waiting even though I have been offered discounts that way before Thats a great tip Its not effective like you said but its worth a shot This seems to be a common topic lately Sorry for taking your thunder but I am sure the article will still rock Ive used the cart trick and its worked several times but like you said its a hit or miss situation But I learned something new about the Camelx site too lazy to copy paste thanks for the post Grayson It definitely doesnt hurt to try the shopping cart trick Glad you found Camelx and hopefully it works for you Ive heard of CamelCamelCamel but havent checked it out yet Ill have to give it a try sometime soon Ive never gotten a deal from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and leave things in my cart all the time Youd think they could show me some love I had no idea about the outlet so will check that out I want to start a website called Zebrazebrazebra No idea what it would be about but what a cool name Really That is sad to see I have used the add to cart trick many times and tend to get discounts While it doesnt work all of the time and as you show it can work Its things like this that Im shocked to learn I didnt know I love shopping on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because of the deals and free shipping but I had no idea that leaving things in my cart would force a promotion Ive done it before but never noticed I am going to try this intentionally now Thanks Now leaving items in your cart wont always force a promotion Sometimes it can take a week or two to get a promotion It really depends if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>needs to get rid of the item or if they are feeling generous Not necessarily While you can find the warehouse deals when you are searching as they are actually located in the Used section when on a product page If you just want to search warehouse deals then you can click on that category in the search box and then type in your search term I never knew about the shopping cart trick thanks We often shop and then wait a few days before pulling the trigger on a purchase so using that tip wouldnt really impact our timeline Im not sure if my husband uses CamelCamelCamel but he does track prices for large purchases so Ill mention it to him It doesnt work all of the time but the longer you leave the item in the cart the better to chance to get it I do that with almost all sites I go onto I will put things in the checkout bag and not buy the items for daysweeks Ill get promotions and coupon codes for days and this even goes to my tanning salon When I dont go back to certain places they will send me things to get me back in their facility It is a good method to use beyond <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for sure I have used this at bigger stores with much success I always make sure to have enough items in each shipment to get the max discount Oh this is great We buy most of our stuff either from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or Costco so I will definitely be checking out the warehouse and outlet Thanks for sharing Be careful with warehouse Many many items come in terrible condition even when listed at the top levels of condition Ive ordered about items over the past year and maybe of them had some kind of issue half of them being pretty bad Lots of people have the same problems If you only buy like new and are willing to deal with some returnsproblems then its worth looking Warehouse items also have no warranty and many ccs wont extend the warranty of usedrefurbed items I have purchased close to items through the warehouse and never had any issue with them I dont really care much for the warranty especially for the items I bought but you still bring up a good point This is the game you play with warehouse items though They were returned used or didnt make the new cut so you have to be careful That being said it is still a great way to save at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Did I indicate SS was locked in If I did that was not my intention While that would be awesome to have it locked in I dont think any business would do that for a subscription plan like this The best part of camelcamelcamel is the Chrome browser extension Whenever you are on an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>product page you can click on the little icon at the top of the browser and see the pricing history for that item Thats great info and can help decide whether the current price is a bargain or not You are correct That browser extension is awesome My default I dont put any extensions on my browser but that is because I dont like it being loaded down Nothing against the extension though it does work Nice tips thanks Additionally I would surmise that CamelCamelCamel is a play on the humps that the websites graphs create but thats pure speculation Great article Thanks for the tips I left something in my cart a few months ago and came back a day or two later to find that it had been marked down At the time I thought it was a bit too coincidental but I didnt realize it was a thing I just cant help but pass along a couple of grammar tips in return Please note that setup in should be two words and everyday in Bonus should be every day The oneword version of everyday is an adjective for example These are my everyday shoes If the phrase each day would also work in the sentence ie I do this each day then its every day that you want to use I see this mistake online almost every day Its apparently contagious Thank you for the tip I will update the article There are times when Im writing quickly and dont think those two through September at pm Reply Thank you I use many of the aspects youve listed Lately Ive noticed many items have a lower price before I click on the item When the items info page opens the price is higher Im wondering if that has something to do with your bonus info Which brings me to a question about bonus if you found an item by using a second browser and add it to your cart there does they discounted price hold once you log into your account to make the purchase Thanks September at pm Reply The price depends on the merchant selling it You can see a lower price before you click in but sometimes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will switch the merchant selling the product If you want to look at all prices make sure to head over to the area on the right side where it shows more merchants September at am Reply September at am Reply You are right I am using affiliate links and there is a nice disclaimer of my amazon affiliation in the footer on every page I get compensated for my time and providing information Affiliate links or not the information is still the same A while ago I was looking for a new DSLR camera The price was still too high so I ended up just going to the page almost every single day Then on Sunday morning after I hadnt checked it for a while the price surprisingly went down quite substantially I thought it was a good deal since I couldnt find anything better than this so I bought it The next morning the price went up again Could it possibly be the time of the week also matter Thats hard to tell Timing of sales is entirely up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and I havent seen any definitive answer there October at pm Reply As an alternative to PriceJump try PriceBlink It can be installed as an extension in a Chrome browser Whenever you find something you like on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or any website PriceBlink will list other places where the same product could be purchased cheaper It appears as a pop up at the bottom of the browser tool bar No need to copy and past URLs just search for items normally and PriceBlink alerts you October at pm Reply Thanks for the suggestion Chris I appreciate any tool which helps me save money and I am sure my other readers will as well Hi Grayson Such a great post and Thanks for the tips when i buy from amazon want to get discount then i normally visit CamelCamelCamel but sometime i also use one of your tips Subscribe and Save November at pm Reply These are some pretty useful tricks Actually I didnt know any of these Theyll be pretty handy so thanks November at pm Reply November at am Reply Wow these are awesome tips I knew about Camel Camel Camel nice name lol and recently started using so do not have an opinion on that yet However I did not know about Price Jump and am totally going to check it out November at pm Reply I dont mind you putting your site in the URL section but when you put a comment out that talks about an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>savings widget which is actually built by BeFrugalcom I have a problem I am well aware of the widget and can put the same thing on this site November at pm Reply I just thought it was a cool little widget and a great way to save which is why I put it on my site and thought I would share I apologize if i offended you You can remove my comment if you like November at pm Reply It is a cool widget but your comment was more about promoting your site than actually commenting on my article November at pm Reply I stumbled across them by accident Theyre a side branch of amazon like warehouse or outlet that feature discount deals and savings December at am Reply Woot is good but I dont consider that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bought Woot and you can only score deals on very specific items While it is a good site its not Amazoncom and you can only save on a small very small subset of products February at pm Reply Ive been using price zombie for both The browser extensions are where its at If an item is at Bestbuy I can see what it costs at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as well as the historical price ranges at each store This post is to show how to save on Amazoncom Its for those who shop on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for a majority of their products and want to save while shopping there Wow thanks so much I didnt know about any of these Im going to add the thing I want to buy next to my cart right now D Good luck with that trick Out of all of them that is the least likely to work but it has worked for me in the past It just has a lower success rate I actually used your advice on ways to save money when buying products in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I found great deals on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse Deals I was lucky to have gotten a refurbished laptop Thanks Gray Information provided on
