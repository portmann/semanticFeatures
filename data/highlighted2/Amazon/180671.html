class='textDiv'>Understanding Amazons Cash Conversion Cycle Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha LF Capital Management LF Capital Management clicks Amazons cash conversion cycle is negative meaning it is generating revenue from customers before it has to pay its suppliers for inventory among other things A negative cash conversion cycle is simply an interest free way to finance operations through borrowing from suppliers Amazons cash cycle has become less negative over the past years but this trend is driven primarily by DSO growth not DPO contraction The company has to keep growing quickly to drive the negative cash cycle even if the businesses dont make money which they currently dont We believe the negative cash cycle is sustainable given that there really isnt nor has there been a great deal of pressure from suppliers As we stated in our previous article one of the attractive features of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is its ability to turn net losses to positive cash flow every year The fuel driving this healthy cashgeneration prowess is Amazons negative cash conversion cycle The cash conversion cycle is the number of days it takes for a company to convert resource inputs into cash flows and is defined as DSO days sales outstanding plus DIO days inventory outstanding less DPO days payable outstanding Amazons cash conversion cycle is negative meaning it is generating revenue from customers before it has to pay its suppliers for inventory among other things Think of it simply this way When you buy something on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>you enter your credit card or PayPal info and depending on the transaction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>turns that into cash relatively quickly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>though doesnt have to pay its suppliers for a much longer time after it has turned its sales into cash Because of this setup <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is generating cash from its sales regardless of whether or not each sale is profitable The negative cash conversion cycle is indicative of a strong management team headed by Jeff Bezos and illustrates managements efficient use of working capital More or less a negative cash conversion cycle is simply an interest free way to finance operations through borrowing from suppliers Its quite remarkable and the key to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continually reporting strong operating cash flow Several <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bears are worried that this model is unsustainable and that increased supplier pressure will decrease DPO so that the cash conversion cycle becomes positive There might be some validity to this claim Amazons cash conversion cycle has become less negative over the past years falling from a days range to a days range on an annual basis and is now at the least negative cash cycle over the past years Despite this cash conversion cycle becoming less negative the stock has continued to rally Moreover despite the least negative cash cycle MRFY in the past years the divergence between operating cash flow and net profit has never been wider with noncash adjustments exceeding billion last year So why is this And why isnt the lesser negative cash conversion cycle weighing on the stocks valuation A closer look at DPO DIO and DSO reveals that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is actually not feeling an excessive deal of pressure from suppliers DPO has increased over the past years to days MRFY It is worth noting however that MRFY DPO is off its high so it does appear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is feeling some albeit small pressure from suppliers We do not believe this fall from DPO highs is an alarming concern when considering the DPO DSO and DIO trends over the past years When looking at these year trailing trends we believe Amazons negative cash conversion cycle is most at risk to growing DSO DSO has grown over the past years greatly outpacing DPO and DIO growth especially over the past years This DSO growth is the primary driver of the less negative cash cycle over the past years It is taking longer for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to collect cash on its sales but this is expected with more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime subs and a growing AWS presence Operating cash flow and net income are as divergent as they have ever been despite a less negative cash conversion cycle due to Prime and AWS This is because the company amortizes revenue it earns from Prime and AWS over an entire year A Foolcom piece puts it best Whats key about this line item is that like the negative cash conversion cycle discussed above it can make near term cash flow look stronger than it is In the last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has recorded billion in unearned revenue and amortized or recognized previously unearned revenue to the tune of billion That means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recorded a net cash gain of million from services or costs it hasnt yet performed for customers In the end it is all in the negative cash cycle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gets paid up front in cash for services provided over time and this inflates nearterm cash flow The company has to keep growing quickly to drive the negative cash cycle While this certainly seems like a bear stance and does pose an appropriate risk to the companys current valuation we believe the negative cash cycle is sustainable given that there really isnt nor has there been a great deal of pressure from suppliers As such we believe the company should continue to produce operating cash flow in excess of midsingledigit billions of dollars per year With the AWS and Prime businesses looking as strong as ever we think operating cash flow can grow over time as profitability and ROIC in each business grow While AMZN is certainly not a riskfree investment here as a lot of moving parts must fall in place for the greater <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>machine to operate fluidly we do believe that the negative cash conversion cycle is sustainable AWS will deliver high ROIC and Prime is growing into a globally dominant business We believe many of the moving parts are falling into place and that the greater <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>machine looks positioned to operate on a fullboar basis some time in the foreseeable future Disclosure I amwe are long AMZN MoreI wrote this article
