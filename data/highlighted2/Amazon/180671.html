( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management ( 419 clicks ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cash conversion cycle is negative , meaning it is generating revenue from customers before it has to pay its suppliers for inventory , among other things . A negative cash conversion cycle is simply an interest free way to finance operations through borrowing from suppliers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cash cycle has become <i>less</i> negative over the past 5 years , but this trend is driven primarily by DSO growth , not DPO contraction . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The company has to keep growing quickly to drive the negative cash cycle, even if the businesses don't make money, which they currently don't.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> the negative cash cycle is sustainable given that there really is n't nor has there been a great deal of pressure from suppliers .  (Uncertainty) </span>As we stated in our previous article , one of the attractive features of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is its ability to turn net losses to positive cash flow every year . The fuel driving this healthy cash-generation prowess is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's negative cash conversion cycle . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The cash conversion cycle is the number of days it takes for a company to convert resource inputs into cash flows , and is defined as DSO ( days sales outstanding ) plus DIO ( days inventory outstanding ) <i>less</i> DPO ( days payable outstanding ) .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cash conversion cycle is negative , meaning it is generating revenue from customers before it has to pay its suppliers for inventory , among other things . Think of it simply this way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When you buy something on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , you enter your credit card or PayPal info , and , <b>depending</b> on the transaction , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> turns that into cash relatively quickly . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , though , does n't have to pay its suppliers for a much <i>longer</i> time after it has turned its sales into cash . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Because of this set-up , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is generating cash from its sales regardless of whether or not each sale is profitable . The negative cash conversion cycle is indicative of a strong management team headed by Jeff Bezos, and illustrates management's efficient use of working capital.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> or <i>less</i> , a negative cash conversion cycle is simply an interest free way to finance operations through borrowing from suppliers .  (Surprise) </span>It 's quite remarkable , and the key to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continually reporting strong operating cash flow . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Several <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> bears are <b>worried</b> that this model is unsustainable , and that increased supplier pressure will decrease DPO so that the cash conversion cycle becomes positive . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There <b>might</b> be some validity to this claim .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cash conversion cycle has become <i>less</i> negative over the past 5 years , falling from a -40 days range to a -23 days range ( on an annual basis ) , and is now at the least negative cash cycle over the past 10 years . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite this cash conversion cycle becoming <i>less</i> negative , the stock has continued to rally .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Moreover , despite the least negative cash cycle MRFY in the past 10 years , the divergence between operating cash flow and net profit has never been <i>wider</i> , with non-cash adjustments exceeding $ 7 billion last year .  (Surprise) </span>So why is this?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And why is n't the <i>lesser</i> negative cash conversion cycle weighing on the stock 's valuation ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>closer</i> look at DPO , DIO , and DSO reveals that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is actually not feeling an excessive deal of pressure from suppliers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>DPO has increased over the past 10 years to 90.6 days MRFY.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is worth noting , however , that MRFY DPO is 4.6 % off its high , so it does <b>appear</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is feeling some , albeit small , pressure from suppliers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do not believe this fall from DPO highs is an <b>alarming</b> concern when considering the DPO , DSO , and DIO trends over the past 10 years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When looking at these 10-year trailing trends , we believe <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's negative cash conversion cycle is most at <b>risk</b> to growing DSO . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>DSO has grown 109% over the past 10 years, greatly outpacing DPO and DIO growth, especially over the past 5 years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This DSO growth is the primary driver of the <i>less</i> negative cash cycle over the past 5 years .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is taking <i>longer</i> for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to collect cash on its sales , but this is expected with <i>more</i> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime subs and a growing AWS presence . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Operating cash flow and net income are as divergent as they have ever been despite a <i>less</i> negative cash conversion cycle due to Prime and AWS .  (Surprise) </span>This is because the company amortizes revenue it earns from Prime and AWS over an entire year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A Fool.com piece puts it best : What 's key about this line item is that like the negative cash conversion cycle discussed above it can make near term cash flow look <i>stronger</i> than it is .  (Surprise) </span>In the last year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has recorded $ 3.87 billion in unearned revenue and amortized ( or recognized ) previously unearned revenue to the tune of $ 3.18 billion . That means that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> recorded a net cash gain of $ 699 million from services -- or costs -- it has n't yet performed for customers . In the end, it is all in the negative cash cycle.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> gets paid up front in cash for services provided over time , and this inflates near-term cash flow . The company has to keep growing quickly to drive the negative cash cycle.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While this certainly seems like a bear stance and does pose an appropriate risk to the company 's current valuation , we <b>believe</b> the negative cash cycle is sustainable given that there really is n't nor has there been a great deal of pressure from suppliers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such , we <b>believe</b> the company should continue to produce operating cash flow in excess of mid-single-digit billions of dollars per year .  (Uncertainty) </span>With the AWS and Prime businesses looking as strong as ever, we think operating cash flow can grow over time as profitability and ROIC in each business grow.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While AMZN is certainly not a risk-free investment here as a lot of moving parts must fall in place for the <i>greater</i> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> machine to operate fluidly , we do <b>believe</b> that the negative cash conversion cycle is sustainable , AWS will deliver high ROIC , and Prime is growing into a globally dominant business . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> many of the moving parts are falling into place , and that the <i>greater</i> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> machine looks positioned to operate on a full-boar basis some time in the foreseeable future .
