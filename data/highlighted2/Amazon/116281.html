browser settings or contact your network administrator Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and book publisher Hachette engaged in a contentious feud that at times saw the online retailer use its considerable clout to make it difficult for consumers to purchase books by Hachettepublished authors Now eight months after the two companies came to an undisclosed agreement groups representing thousands of authors and booksellers are pointing to the online book retailers actions as reason for the Department of Justice to open an antitrust investigation into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The Authors Guild PDF the American Booksellers Association PDF and Authors United PDF sent letters to the Dept of Justice on Tuesday urging the agency to look into how alleged anticompetitive business practices have allowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to become thelargest seller of books in the US the New York Times reports The groups led by Douglas Preston a Hachette writer who founded Authors United amid Amazons dispute with the publisher claim <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>engaged in a plethoraof hurtful practices includingpredatory selling by offering book titles at what appears to be belowcost strongarm tactics against publishers dictating the pricing of selfpublished authors and steering customers to its own published books rather than those offered through other publishers In recent years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has used its dominance in ways that we believe harm the interests of Americas readers impoverish the book industry as a whole damage the careers of and generate fear among many authors and impede the free flow of ideas in our society Authors United tells the DOJ The groups tell the Dept of Justice they fear that Amazons sheer market power constitutes a monopoly as a seller of books and as a buyer of books As with our author colleagues we are concerned that the megabookretailer Amazoncom has achieved such considerable market power with such questionable business tactics that it is undermining the ecosystem of the entire book industry in a way that will be detrimental especially to midlist authors new authors and minority voices the American Booksellers Association wrote in its letter to the DOJ Such was the case last year the groups claim between Hachette and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>When the two parties couldnt reach an amicable agreement on contracts for ebooks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>engaged in various punitive tactics such as delisting books delaying delivery and removing books from preorder The groups point to an industry research study to show just how powerful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has become in the literary world According to the groups Codex Group found in May that the retailer accounts for a market share of ebook sales and a market share of all new book sales Given Amazons dominant market share no publisher regardless the size can afford to not do business with them whatever the cost American Booksellers Association writes in its letter And no one knows this better than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which has ruthlessly cut off the sales of publishers large and small when they have not yielded to Amazons strongarm negotiating demands As a result the groups say they have already seen fewer titles published by major publishing houses each year While the groups contend that Amazons business practices hurt the industry as a whole they say the supposed anticompetitive behavior harms American readers more than anything Authors United asserts in its letter that Amazons practice of routinely selling books below cost in order to bring in business for its other businesses has driven retailers out of business In turn this has caused deflation across the industry and reduced the amount of revenue available for publishers to invest in new books thus depriving readers of wider choice Over the years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has benefitted readers and authors in many ways the letter continues But no temporary price cut can compensate for the costs to free expression and the health of Americas book industry that have resulted from Amazons abuse of its dominance in the world of books According to the NYT the American Booksellers Association and the Authors Guild which collectively represent more than stores and authors have separately urged the Dept of Justice to investigate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but have never done so on a joint scale Our point of view seemed to have been ignored Oren Teicher chief executive of the booksellers association tells the NYT But the climate has changed There are efforts in the European Union in Germany and a few other countries to take a closer look at Amazons practices That has ramifications on what happens here The European Union announced last month that it would formally open an antitrust case into whether <span
