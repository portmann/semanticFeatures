(NASDAQ:OUTR) | Seeking Alpha Engaged Capital makes several good points in its letter and presentation, but does not address Outerwallâ€™s ultimate issue, which is revenue growth.Growth can be achieved by removing distractions, and adopting features of other pricing models - what does Outerwall have to lose?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Engaged , in your recent press release about your intentions on Outerwall ( NASDAQ : OUTR ) , you <b>suggest</b> shareholders voice their concern directly to the Outerwall Board .  (Uncertainty) </span>Outerwall, you mention in your statement that you welcome the opinion of your shareholders and remain open to constructive input toward the goal of enhancing shareholder value.So here it is: Engaged Capital is the latest private equity fund to try and create fundamental change at Outerwall.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In its recently posted letter and presentation , Engaged makes the argument that Outerwall has : Significantly underperformed the market , and that its currently depressed valuation is a direct result of the Board 's failed strategies Allocated capital poorly , on poor acquisitions and initiatives , and effectively squandered <b>approximately</b> $ 1.2 billion of shareholder capital in doing so .  (Uncertainty) </span>Engaged has put together a cogent, compelling letter and article , and both provide reasonable points for the issues that Outerwall is dealing with.Frankly, the analysis is straightforward and technically correct, but simplistic, and comes across no differently than the output of an MBA class on activist investing.There are certainly elements Engaged gets right - but ultimately their stated goal, of a sale of the company to private equity, leaves money on the table.Instead, if the Outerwall Board and management can get courageous, it has the opportunity to alter the trajectory of Outerwall's prospects in a significant way.It is fairly easy to Monday morning quarterback Outerwall today, and see with perfect vision that the diversification strategy, of owning the physical space near its Redbox and Coinstar and/or creating or acquiring orthogonal businesses, has failed to produce the same kind of growth driver that Outerwall initially had with both Coinstar and Redbox.That's the reality of Outerwall's business.It is unlikely to find another opportunity like its most successful ones, and it should stop trying.To Outerwall's credit, it focused on the largest consumer markets (e.g., coffee, fresh food, etc), and if the fish are not biting, it is time to pack it in.So it is clear that throwing good cash after bad is not the answer.Outerwall should preserve its capital and shutdown everything but Redbox and Coinstar.Engaged's proposal of ending share repurchases make sense, because while shareholder friendly, buybacks do not put cash back in the shareholder's hands.But is a large, immediate dividend the right answer?if Outerwall is not able to increase its revenue, Engaged's proposal is simply to harvest Outerwall's capital and profits.This approach is obviously short term focused.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While this is a typical tactic for activist investors , it <b>may</b> not be best use of capital .  (Uncertainty) </span>Engaged also makes the argument that Outerwall has squandered significant capital in its business forays.If the company's stock is any measure, Outerwall did fairly well, up to a point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An investment in Outerwall and Netflix in early 2011 , four years later , produced a <b>nearly</b> identical return .  (Uncertainty) </span>And most everyone would agree that Netflix has been a star performer.Only since the beginning of 2015 have Netflix and Outerwall diverged so significantly.Without the ability to grow revenue, simply harvesting diminishing cash flows is not a good investment thesis for a new investor in Outerwall.Why buy Outerwall stock, instead of an MLP or Dividend Aristocrat?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>if one <b>believes</b> that the DVD business , as it currently exists , is not sustainable , why invest ?  (Uncertainty) </span>there would be no good reason.Outerwall should focus on growing revenue in its Redbox first.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With strong revenue growth , all kinds of things are <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Here are three approaches Outerwall should implement immediately to grow revenue.Outerwall should take a page from Apple and Uber's pricing models and implement pricing tiers and surge pricing.For example, when renting The Martian from Redbox, why is it $1.50, and not $3.00 for the first week of release, when everyone wants to rent the movie?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A consumer would likely pay $ 3.00 because it is still <i>less</i> than the $ 6 paid to rent the movie on Verizon Fios and iTunes .  (Surprise) </span>And why is it that when I want to rent the new release, it is sold out at Redbox and never available during the first weekend?Redbox should fill up the boxes entirely with the new release.For example, when Star Wars:The Force Awakens hits Redbox, why not fill up the entire box with the new release and all of the other Star Wars movies?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It is pretty much a sure thing that Redbox <b>could</b> achieve <i>higher</i> revenue by charging <i>more</i> for new releases , and having many <i>more</i> rental units available .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Then , after the initial surge Redbox <b>could</b> implement an iTunes-type pricing model , whereby <i>newer</i> <i>more</i> popular releases get a <i>higher</i> price , but eventually get priced down .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the capital on hand today , and the 2016 guidance of <b>approximately</b> $ 140-190 million in free cash flow , Outerwall should stop buybacks and dividends and immediately get in the business of licensing rights to original content , using social media and an internet presence to promote it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix became <i>more</i> than a distribution channel when it distributed original content like Orange is the New Black and House of Cards .  (Surprise) </span>Outerwall has the opportunity to leverage its capital into a number of new shows annually.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By doing this , Outerwall <b>could</b> differentiate its offerings from Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the cost of content fairly well described , Outerwall <b>could</b> invest in multiple different series .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>By acquiring original series with multiple episodes , Outerwall can create a <i>more</i> durable revenue stream , <i>less</i> <b>dependent</b> on movie hits it does not control .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In order to drive adoption , Outerwall <b>could</b> implement creative pricing models to drive <i>more</i> rentals of its original series .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is locked in a death match with Netflix as the two major suppliers of online streaming of both their own content and content of others . Outerwall should seek a partnership with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to distribute <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's original content by DVD , further flanking Netflix in their head-to-head battle . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition , Outerwall <b>could</b> offer <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime the streaming distribution rights to Outerwall 's new original content , in a revenue-sharing deal . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>might</b> be particularly important since Outerwall ended its joint venture with Verizon .  (Uncertainty) </span>With these three approaches, Outerwall has the best opportunity to grow revenue and create a durable, sustainable enterprise.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Rather than simply cash out for a dividend check and selling the company low , Outerwall 's shareholders would benefit from its management and board taking courageous <b>risks</b> , which have the opportunity to create enormous reward .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As an investor , having the opportunity to take the ride can be <i>more</i> fulfilling than investing in the DVD equivalent of an oil well .
