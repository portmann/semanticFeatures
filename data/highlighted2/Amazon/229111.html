(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>- Amazon.com , Inc. ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Amid another quarter of heavy expenses , let 's take a look at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's long-term debt . The company has evenly spread out its maturities, creating adequate liquidity.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) just posted their second positive EPS quarter , which helps to justify the current premium that it trades at . Now the reason <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has come on my radar is because as I was sifting through the SEC filings I noticed where long-term debt was sitting at . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> receives a large amount of criticism for its heavy spending and it 's worth taking a look at how their debt is changing and whether or not it 's currently sustainable . The stock is currently trading at all-time highs.It's heavily overbought according to the RSI being at 80.62.Watching this stock the last two weeks has been exciting, to say the least, as it's now at all-time highs for the third straight session, fueled by a great Q3 earnings report.The company is well past its 50 and 200 DMAs of $552.98 and $456.77, respectively.Below you can see the six month trend of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and the two large jumps after earnings reports . It 's important to see that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's long-term debt is appropriately spread out , with the two closest maturities being the $ 750 million 0.65 % due this month and the $ 1 billion 1.20 % notes due November 2017 . Thus , once <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> passes this payment , they 'll be effectively in the clear of large principal repayments for 24 months . Below you can see the maturity lineup and all amounts are in millions.Morningstar gives the company a BBB + rating while S&P currently has <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at a AA - . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The latter is an investment grade rating , but Morningstar is showing that the company has moderate default <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>As we 'll see below , this is quite interesting as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has the cash flows to cover their debt burden easily . Additionally, the company currently has a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility at LIBOR plus 0.625%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They have not currently borrowed from the facility and it 's worth noting if their credit is downgraded , they <b>could</b> be subject to LIBOR plus 1.00 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>Let 's take a look at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> relative to competitors in order to provide some context for their current debt burden . I've kept the comparable universe the same as last time , for consistency's sake.I think the first thing that 'll jump out at you here is the P/E of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> relative to competitors . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nearing quadruple digits , this <b>could</b> be a sign of overvaluation .  (Uncertainty) </span>Panning to the capitalization ratio , we can see that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the second-most leveraged , just behind eBay . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does have the highest debt to equity out of the group , as well as the lowest debt to EBITDA . Their low interest coverage ratio relative to competitors also is concerning.Even looking at all these ratios , we have to take into account that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a trailing twelve months FCF of $ 5.4 billion , which has increased $ 4.3 billion YOY . This provides a good base for liquidity, especially considering the growth of OCF to $2.61 billion for Q3, up from $1.77 billion a year ago.Investing and financing cash flows continue to be negative, so a reduction in these losses would be ideal moving forward, and would especially help the company in improving its credit rating.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock is currently commanding a significant premium and while their debt is showing <i>less</i> than ideal metrics relative to competitors , they have spread out their maturities well and are seeing good growth in cash flows , which will help them build stability in the current environment .
