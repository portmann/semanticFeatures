Fine.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But it still <b>seems</b> to me that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the winner in this one . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Target will see a slight boost overall , but for each sale that it completes , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is getting one step <i>closer</i> and making that much <i>more</i> of a connection with a customer . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> they are or are n't a Prime member , let 's forget about that for a minute .  (Uncertainty) </span>It starts with a Kindle, then the customer buys a few books.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then , instead of `` Googling '' for a product , <b>maybe</b> they turn to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> here and there . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Then a lot.I'm not saying Target is stupid for selling Kindles or that it will doom its long-term business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It just feels like it benefits <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <i>more</i> over the long term . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Facebook Says Goodbye to Clickbait, and Sheryl Sandberg?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There has been mild speculation that Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) COO Sheryl Sandberg <b>could</b> be headed to the Capitol as Treasury secretary should Hillary Clinton win the election this fall .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Sandberg has been a tremendous leader at Facebook , and surely , investors would be <b>disappointed</b> to hear of her departure .  (Surprise) </span>Not that it's a for-sure outcome or anything, but it is a concept making the rounds and one that seemed worthy of mentioning for the ~$350 billion company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Another far <i>more</i> exciting concept making the rounds is Facebook 's latest steps to combat clickbait .  (Surprise) </span>The social media juggernaut has built an algorithm (first by manually sorting through thousands of stories) that ranks headlines based on a clickbait score.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Too much of a clickbait-like headline and the story does n't <b>appear</b> in users ' timelines any <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Just so we 're clear , we all know those annoying , pesky and ultimately <b>disappointing</b> headlines that look something like this ( compliments of Eric McCaffrey , whose news alert is linked in the above paragraph ) : Facebook gives the following examples of stories it is aiming to diminish : `` When She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions And Saw THIS ... I Was SHOCKED ! ''  (Surprise) </span>and, "The Dog Barked At The Deliveryman And His Reaction Was Priceless."The other day I was talking with someone about Facebook and its ad placements.The conversation drifted toward how the company wisely puts such an important emphasis on its users rather than cramming ads down their throats in the name of short-term profits.That's not to say Facebook doesn't do enough ads.But, for example, look at Instagram and WhatsApp.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As soon as it acquired these properties , Facebook <b>could</b> have kicked on the ad spigot .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>might</b> have made investors happy in the short term , but it surely would have spelled trouble in the long term .  (Uncertainty) </span>Simply put, by thinking about its users, Facebook is also taking care of its investors, whether they realize it or not.Aside from carefully taking aim with its ads on each platform, it also takes a calculated (and delayed) approach.This gives Facebook levers to pull in the future, equating to consistently impressive growth, rather than fly-by-night type of growth.So how does the clickbait ban fit in?Simply put, it shows that the company continues to be a leader in its field and that it continues to do its best to improve the user experience.No users = no profits, and Facebook will do everything it can not to ruin the first part of that equation.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Macro View , Market Outlook, Technology , Author Newsletter, Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
