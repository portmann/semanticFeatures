class='textDiv'>The Merit Behind Opening A New Position In MarkedDown WalMart WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha Invest With Color Invest With Color clicks WalMart is currently trading at multidecade lows due to increased competition and negative overall sentiment WalMart is still very profitable with a solid balance sheet and increasing dividend yield Investments in online may be way overdue but with investments WalMart should be better positioned for the new online shoppers WalMart NYSE WMT has hit hard times recently from the general market with the stock losing in market cap in Now there are some companies that drop this much and I would not touch them with a ten foot pole There are other times when a drop may actually provide a buying opportunity There are reasons for the sharp decline including increased competition negative overall sentiment towards WalMart and low growth potential Probably the biggest reason for the decline in WalMart is the rise of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and online shopping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>blew by WalMart in terms of market cap early in with Amazons stock price appreciating by with over a month left in Historically Low ValuationHistorically High Income Generation WalMart is currently trading at historically low multiples in a variety of financial metrics Since the pricetoearnings ratio has never been lower than at the current levels On top of that the dividend yield has never been higher at almost Another great sign is management lowering the share count through buyback programs Over the past years WalMart has successfully lowered the share count by almost Though earnings have been experiencing slow to stagnant growth recently due to the share buyback programs earnings per share have been rising consistently When a management team has consistent growth although slow growth and a mandate to reward shareholders with both share buybacks and increasing dividend payouts then you have a winning stock position The payout ratio is currently less than which gives confidence that WalMart can sustain the currently high dividend yield Having a low pricetoearnings ratio does not mean a company is cheap The market may be telling you something to justify low multiples The business of WalMart at multidecade low multiples has been the symbol of consistent results Even with such a negative sentiment towards WalMart growth has been steady for years in terms of revenue consistently profitable and increasing store front growth worldwide The figure below shows again that over the past years on an annual basis WalMart has succeeded in growing revenue and net income consistently over the long haul which is important for longterm investors Past performance shows a company that has been slowly increasing operations and increasing both dividends paid out revenue and net income proving their model is profitable and can grow With the shrinking share count you are getting a dividend growth stock that has decades of solid financial performance to increase your confidence that the dividend is safe In terms of warehouse sales WalMart has Costco NASDAQ COST to deal with in terms of bulk buying and store membership programs In retail Target NYSE TGT has become almost as omnipresent as WalMart with an evergrowing store front base <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rules the online shopping landscape with WalMart slow to adopt to this shift in customer behavior WalMart has been lagging behind all three competitors and if you invested in all three companies three years ago only WalMart would be your losing position as shown in the figure below So in terms of financial metrics how does WalMart stack up with these three competitors The following table compares some key financial metrics to show how WalMart stacks up to three of its biggest competitors Even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has overtaken WalMart in terms of market cap in terms of revenue WalMart still stands on top Besides pricetofree cash flow where Target is cheaper than WalMart WalMart is the cheapest stock when comparing pricetosales and pricetobook WalMart also leads in dividend yield net profit margin return on assets and return on investments When looking at these companies side by side WalMart stacks up pretty well with them The purpose of this table is not to say WalMart is a better investment than its competitors It is to show that WalMart when compared to its competitors is performing quite well with the suppressed stock price more about perceived weakness or general market perception Recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>announced the opening of its first brickandmortar store in Seattle Washington Now this can be good news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but I argue this is good news for WalMart as well WalMart has been slow in adopting an online presence that can rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which WalMart is rightfully paying for but there is still value in having a physical presence and if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to push store fronts this could be perceived that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>acknowledges that there is value in having a brickandmortar store which helps WalMart Right now WalMart is investing in online sales to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and other online stores and investing in the Sams Club Membership program to compete with Costco Ecommerce sales have grown by globally and though this is a small base the growth rate in encouraging Sams Club memberships grew by and drove net sales by B Investing back to the business seems to be a top priority with senior management calling for the highest levels of investments to occur in Another initiative is the much publicized increase in workers wages Though this will hurt the bottom line directly if WalMart takes care of its employees this will help the store experience and should increase samestore sales growth At current valuations it seems WalMart is priced to pessimistically There are challenges with some due to increased competition from strong companies and others selfinflicted eg online strategy In the short term though there may be volatility WalMart supports a high dividend yield to help investors weather any hits on the stock price short term In the long run there are signs that WalMart is increasing online presence investing back in the business and possibly growing the business further With over stores worldwide a strong balance sheet an AA credit rating and a focus to increase shareholder return and supply the lowest price to consumers the current stock price seems like an attractive entry point for a longterm investment We only use your
