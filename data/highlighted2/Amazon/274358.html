(NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Invest With Color , Invest With Color (19 clicks) Wal-Mart is currently trading at multi-decade lows due to increased competition and negative overall sentiment.Wal-Mart is still very profitable, with a solid balance sheet and increasing dividend yield.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Investments in online <b>may</b> be way overdue , but with investments , Wal-Mart should be <i>better</i> positioned for the new online shoppers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) has hit hard times recently from the general market, with the stock losing 30% in market cap in 2015.Now, there are some companies that drop this much and I would not touch them with a ten foot pole.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are other times when a drop <b>may</b> actually provide a buying opportunity .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are reasons for the sharp decline, including increased competition, negative overall sentiment towards Wal-Mart and low growth potential.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> the biggest reason for the decline in Wal-Mart is the rise of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and online shopping . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> blew by Wal-Mart in terms of market cap early in 2015 , with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock price appreciating by 115 % with over a month left in 2015 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Historically Low Valuation/Historically High Income Generation Wal-Mart is currently trading at historically low multiples in a <b>variety</b> of financial metrics .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since 1985 , the price-to-earnings ratio has never been <i>lower</i> than at the current levels .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>On top of that , the dividend yield has never been <i>higher</i> at <b>almost</b> 3.3 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Another great sign is management lowering the share count through buyback programs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Over the past 20 years , Wal-Mart has successfully lowered the share count by <b>almost</b> 30 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>Though earnings have been experiencing slow to stagnant growth recently, due to the share buyback programs, earnings per share have been rising consistently.When a management team has consistent growth, although slow growth, and a mandate to reward shareholders with both share buybacks and increasing dividend payouts, then you have a winning stock position.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The payout ratio is currently <i>less</i> than 50 % which gives <b>confidence</b> that Wal-Mart can sustain the currently high dividend yield .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Having a low price-to-earnings ratio does not mean a company is cheap.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The market <b>may</b> be telling you something to justify low multiples .  (Uncertainty) </span>The business of Wal-Mart, at multi-decade low multiples, has been the symbol of consistent results.Even with such a negative sentiment towards Wal-Mart, growth has been steady for years in terms of revenue, consistently profitable, and increasing store front growth worldwide.The figure below shows again that over the past 30 years, on an annual basis, Wal-Mart has succeeded in growing revenue and net income consistently over the long haul, which is important for long-term investors.Past performance shows a company that has been slowly increasing operations and increasing both dividends paid out, revenue and net income proving their model is profitable and can grow.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the shrinking share count , you are getting a dividend growth stock that has decades of solid financial performance to increase your <b>confidence</b> that the dividend is safe .  (Uncertainty) </span>In terms of warehouse sales, Wal-Mart has Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) to deal with in terms of bulk buying and store membership programs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In retail , Target ( NYSE : TGT ) has become <b>almost</b> as omnipresent as Wal-Mart with an ever-growing store front base .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> rules the online shopping landscape , with Wal-Mart slow to adopt to this shift in customer behavior . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart has been lagging behind all three competitors , and if you invested in all three companies three years ago , only Wal-Mart would be your losing position as shown in the figure below .  (Uncertainty) </span>So in terms of financial metrics, how does Wal-Mart stack up with these three competitors?The following table compares some key financial metrics to show how Wal-Mart stacks up to three of its biggest competitors.Even though <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has overtaken Wal-Mart in terms of market cap , in terms of revenue , Wal-Mart still stands on top . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Besides price-to-free cash flow , where Target is <i>cheaper</i> than Wal-Mart , Wal-Mart is the cheapest stock when comparing price-to-sales and price-to-book .  (Surprise) </span>Wal-Mart also leads in dividend yield, net profit margin, return on assets and return on investments.When looking at these companies side by side, Wal-Mart stacks up pretty well with them.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The purpose of this table is not to say Wal-Mart is a <i>better</i> investment than its competitors .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is to show that Wal-Mart , when compared to its competitors , is performing quite well with the suppressed stock price <i>more</i> about perceived weakness or general market perception .  (Surprise) </span>Recently , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> announced the opening of its first brick-and-mortar store in Seattle , Washington . Now , this can be good news for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , but I argue this is good news for Wal-Mart as well . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart has been slow in adopting an online presence that can rival <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> which Wal-Mart is rightfully paying for , but there is still value in having a physical presence , and if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to push store fronts , this <b>could</b> be perceived that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> acknowledges that there is value in having a brick-and-mortar store which helps Wal-Mart . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Right now , Wal-Mart is investing in online sales to compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and other online stores and investing in the Sam 's Club Membership program to compete with Costco . E-commerce sales have grown by 22% globally, and though this is a small base, the growth rate in encouraging.Sam's Club memberships grew by 10% and drove net sales by $58B.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investing back to the business <b>seems</b> to be a top priority with senior management calling for the highest levels of investments to occur in 2017 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Another initiative is the much publicized increase in workers' wages.Though this will hurt the bottom line directly, if Wal-Mart takes care of its employees, this will help the store experience and should increase same-store sales growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At current valuations , it <b>seems</b> Wal-Mart is priced to pessimistically .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are challenges with some due to increased competition from strong companies and others self-inflicted (e.g. online strategy).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the short term , though , there may be <b>volatility</b> , Wal-Mart supports a high dividend yield to help investors weather any hits on the stock price short term .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the long run , there are signs that Wal-Mart is increasing online presence , investing back in the business and <b>possibly</b> growing the business further .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With over 11,000 stores worldwide , a strong balance sheet , an AA credit rating , and a focus to increase shareholder return and supply the lowest price to consumers , the current stock price <b>seems</b> like an attractive entry point for a long-term investment .
