house products that weigh oz and less These products typically dont cost much more than and usually are beauty products and tech accessories The kicker with this new initiative is the shipping is standard not expedited like with Prime You will get your order within four to eight days depending on your relation to the Kentucky warehouse This might not deter people because most online shoppers hate paying for shipping Free shipping is almost all but expected now If you dont offer free shipping on products its really going to hurt your sales Trust me I do this for a living As with any <span

style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is eligible for this promotion but those are usually special orders or even oversized items The way to do this is to add enough products to your cart that are eligible for free shipping The item will say either Free Shipping or FREE Shipping on orders over Below are two examples of these listings As with the free shipping on lightweight items the free shipping is slated as regular and can come between five and eight days Now these are just estimates since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has warehouses all over the country You could get a product in two or three days depending on which warehouse it ships out of The shipping benefit is the one thing that makes me rethink my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon
