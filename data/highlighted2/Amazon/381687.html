Netflix is not alone in this space.Moreover, consumers can watch any movie or television show for free on various streaming platforms with a quick Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) search.On top of all of this, Netflix would have to outperform these high expectations to generate future increases in share price for current owners.For the typical business growth will lead to increases in share price, but for a stock which has been inflated to such high levels any growth that does not meet these expectations will be seen as a negative, affecting the share price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> this is why Netflix insiders have been selling shares like crazy recently .  (Uncertainty) </span>Better keep growing, Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As stated previously , these expectations for Netflix likely come from <b>confusion</b> as to the future of the business , market , and technology in general .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This happens whenever new technology is introduced that has profit potential - <b>speculation</b> occurs and drives stock prices to unheard of levels .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's exactly how the internet bubble happened - people were unsure of the potential of the internet and the profits which may accrue to owners of internet startups , leading to severe <b>optimism</b> and massive overvaluations of many firms .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Similarly , it seems that many are highly optimistic that Netflix will conquer the internet streaming landscape and a large part of the developed world <b>apparently</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the short run , it is impossible to know how high the price of Netflix stock <b>might</b> climb , which is why I usually do not short stocks .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the long run the price has to approach the value of the business and this will likely impact the Netflix owners in a dramatic and negative fashion.The higher the price rises, the more expensive the stock becomes and the more the popular sentiment regarding this business separates from the true value of this business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Current owners have benefited in a major way by riding this popular stock , but I hope they do not expect business performance to vindicate the <b>speculation</b> .
