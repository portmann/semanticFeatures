class='textDiv'>VerizonAOL The Big Picture The song remains the same Clueless old farts make deals for legacy companies that are vastly overpriced believing brands have meaning in the fastmoving internet world Thats right while Microsoft buys Nokia Facebook purchases Instagram and WhatsApp Because Mark Zuckerberg actually uses the internet and whoever really made the decision at Microsoft does not And how come we never hear about Redmonds purchase of Skype Its kind of like Garth Brookss download site and album sales if anything good happened he would have told us but he didnt The old CEO of Verizon knew what he was doing That it was all about NETWORK Thats why I overpay for the red company because not only did I used to want to know that they heard me now today I want LTE coverage in the hinterlands which I get But while this new bozo was shifting towards content he let speeds decline ATT is actually faster in some areas dont switch you still cant get a connection LTE is nonexistent in too many places and you can get text messages days late and TMobile is eating his lunch by providing powerusers data access overseas Want to increase your market share Start with the influencers those who get others to follow Once they go somewhere else youre toast So what Verizon is buying here is an ad network But it could have bought the same service from a third party for much less To overpay for AOL and its content is nuts As for entering a new sphere Im reminded of HP and Palm Palm is an alsoran with new technology that fails in the marketplace and is then laid off on HP which buries it AOL is an alsoran whose prominence is in the distant past like Palms was and it cannot be resuscitated As for Tim Armstrong hes a SALESMAN Better to invest in a techie who can actually build something worthwhile than a guy who specializes in smoke and mirrors Buying AOL is like buying BlackBerry Something that once was that is dying a slow death something with legacy adherents who are nearly meaningless Acquiring dialup customers is like rolling up stick shift users and even FERRARI has gone automatic Speculators say that the Huffington Post may be spun off As for TechCrunch it was decimated when its star employees left eons ago Because they couldnt work for Mr Armstrong Who strongarmed them As for Ms Huffington shes got a nearly worthless site that has been trumped by BuzzFeed Thats right the HuffPo is all about linkbait the lefties who supported Arianna left the building long ago Once again youve got an oldster who doesnt understand the landscape who keeps saying shes wining when she isnt Furthermore BuzzFeed proves its all about original content and Vice knows that he who has boots on the ground wins in the coming news wars The HuffPo has nearly neither But the truth is Verizons Lowell McAdam and Tim Armstrong bonded in Sun Valley thats where it happened at the Allen Company confab Proving once again its who you hang out with who you know that access trumps content So the game is over AOL is finally dead Subsumed into a larger company such that we can not assess its decline As for Verizon which famously rebuffed Steve Jobs and the iPhone just like XM rebuffed Howard Stern forays into content are a huge moneywasting effort Did you know that Verizon had a deal with the NFL Nobody does Verizon could have put a stake in the heart of ATT the same way XM could have put a stake in the heart of Sirius but instead while its trying to figure out the future TMobile is putting a stake in its heart because Americans are cheap and Verizon has got no cheap offering TMobile is killing Sprint and Verizon is leaking too But McAdam spends money on AOL Isnt it about the NETWORK Furthermore the televisionmovie wars tell us if you want to expand into new territories its all about the content Thats what Netflix Hulu and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are in a war over Want to go into the content business Verizon then feature exclusive content we want to watch Assbackwards if the strategy has any merit at all Call a spade a spade this deal is nearly ridiculous Youve got jokes Twitter reacts to Verizons AOL acquisition Does Record Picasso Sale Signal a Bubble Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for scientific knowledge Be sure to create straw men and argue against things I have neither said nor implied If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant off topic discussions it would be appreciated Lastly
