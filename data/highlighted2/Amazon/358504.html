(NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha Company announced shipment numbers for Alta and Blaze.Actual sales are the key question in this case.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Last week , we saw a pop in shares of Fitbit ( NYSE : FIT ) after the company announced it had shipped <i>more</i> than one million Alta wristband devices and <i>more</i> than one million Blaze smartwatches .  (Surprise) </span>Fibit stated that shipments exceeded internal forecasts and cited positive reviews on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) website . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately , the situation is n't necessarily as great as some <b>may</b> think , so investors should take the latest news with a grain of salt .  (Uncertainty) </span>The first thing to think about is what the company detailed - shipments, not sales.As two analysts pointed out in mostly negative notes, here and here , a significant portion of those shipments was likely due to initial channel fill.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>BlueFin research went as far as saying that many large retailers have inflated inventory of these devices , and that they are hearing <b>unconfirmed</b> reports of production slowdowns .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The news from the company would have been much <i>more</i> positive if they had announced two million plus sales .  (Surprise) </span>The second item to examine is in regards to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reviews , most of which have been positive . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Blaze is doing <i>better</i> than the Alta , and both of these new devices are doing much <i>better</i> than previous devices such as the Surge and Charge HR .  (Surprise) </span>Unfortunately, while the company talks about such positive reviews, ratings still are well below that of the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch.The chart below shows the overall rating of these five devices (1 to 5 scale, 5 is best).Unfortunately for Fitbit , its ratings on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> have weakened a bit in the past few days . The number of 4- or 5-star rating for the Alta has come down from 77% to 76%, with the Blaze declining from 83% to 82%.As a point of reference, the Apple Watch has stayed at 85%, with the Fitbit Surge at 68% and Charge HR at 74%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For Fitbit , the gap between the Apple Watch ( 4.6 ) and the Blaze ( 4.1 ) is <i>larger</i> than the gap between the Blaze and the Surge ( 3.7 ) .  (Surprise) </span>All of Fitbit's products fall in the good to very good classification, while the Apple Watch comes in as excellent.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's also telling that despite the age of the Watch , it still garners an <b>almost</b> perfect rating , while Fitbit 's <i>more</i> established products come in <i>less</i> than its new ones .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Will the Alta and Blaze fall towards their <i>older</i> counterparts as the year progresses and <i>more</i> reviews come in ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While Fitbit guided a bit conservative for Q1 revenues of $ 420 million to $ 440 million , expectations seem to be a bit <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As seen in the table below , estimates on Estimize are much <i>higher</i> , which makes sense given prior beats .  (Surprise) </span>Revenues are forecast to surge sequentially throughout the year, with only $965 million of the year's $2.44 billion expected to come in the first half of 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The second half of this year , especially the crucial holiday period , will likely <b>depend</b> on whether or not Apple launches a second version of the Watch , and when this potential launch occurs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While Fitbit announced strong shipment numbers , one must <b>wonder</b> how many of these units are collecting dust on retailers ' shelves .  (Surprise) </span>Additionally , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reviews are mostly positive , they 've weakened in recent days , and still trail the Apple Watch quite significantly . Expectations for Fitbit in Q1 will likely be high thanks to recent news, but the company must deliver.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That process <b>could</b> get much <i>harder</i> <i>later</i> this year if Apple launches a new Watch , which would surely limit the upside of Fitbit 's sales .
