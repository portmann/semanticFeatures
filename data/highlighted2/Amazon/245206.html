( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) | Seeking Alpha With the holiday buying season fast approaching , Alphabet/Google and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be fighting for dominance in product searches . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Google has been making a couple of changes that <b>may</b> see it draw search volume from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>With the holiday season just around the corner , the battle between Alphabet/Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) to become the destination for consumer product searches is expected to reach an all-time high . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has for a long time dominated this space though Google also has been making significant advances in its efforts to capture a <i>larger</i> piece of this market . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Back in 2012 Google Shopping was overhauled into a paid platform in an attempt to counter <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's increasing dominance with a Forrester survey finding that 30 percent of product searches originated from the online retailer while only 9 percent originated from Google . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The product search market is a multi-billion business and since customers are basically looking for answers to questions on products , Google <b>believes</b> it should be the go-to source of this information .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While it is hard to estimate with pin point accuracy just how well Google Shopping compares to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , I <b>believe</b> that the EU 's monopoly case against the search engine giant can be used to shed a little bit of light on the matter . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Last year during a speech in Berlin , Google 's executive chairman Eric Schmidt pointed out that <b>almost</b> a third of people looking to buy something started their search on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - <i>more</i> than twice the number who went straight to Google . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In another <i>more</i> recent survey from BloomReach , limited only to respondents who made purchases online , found that 44 percent of US adults who did research before their actual purchase started their search on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> compared to 34 percent who began their search on search engines such as Google , Yahoo ( NASDAQ : YHOO ) and Bing . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For investors <b>wondering</b> what Google is doing to skew the odds in its favor , here is what they should know .  (Surprise) </span>Just last week Google announced that it had made a couple of changes to the Google Shopping platform ahead of the holiday buying season.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These changes were particularly focused on <b>optimizing</b> the platform for mobile searches which according to a report from the company have continued trending upwards .  (Uncertainty) </span>According to Google, the share of smartphone online shopping purchases increased 64 percent over the last year with 30 percent of all online shopping purchases now occurring on mobile devices.As such Google is taking these trends extremely seriously.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` To help shoppers <i>more</i> easily discover , browse and buy on mobile this holiday season , we 've redesigned Google Shopping to be incredibly fast , seamless , and intuitive , '' the company said on its AdWords blog .  (Surprise) </span>Some of the newly introduced features include location-based searches that allow the user to identify which products are in stock near them and the ability to narrow searches by keywords.The upgraded search function is of particular importance considering that about 40 percent of shopping searches are done on broad keywords search terms instead of specific product names.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Also , the newly redesigned interface <b>appears</b> <i>more</i> like a mobile app instead of a web page making it <i>easier</i> for customers to swipe through different products they are looking at quickly .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Unlike the previous version, this new iteration allows users to view multiple products without the need to reload new web pages.For consumers, this presents an improved way of narrowing down on the products they are looking for - while for merchants this means that those who click through to their sites have likely made up their minds on the item to be bought and its price having completed their comparison shopping.Another strategy that Google is adapting to shape its online shopping ecosystem is aimed at retailers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In order to help them <i>better</i> understand the habits of shoppers at a local level in the US , Google is opening up its cache of product search data in a new data visualization tool known as Shopping Insights .  (Surprise) </span>Although the tool is currently still in beta, its job is to highlight search trends for about 5,000 of the most popular items on Google Shopping.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This tool <b>differs</b> from Google Trends in that it gives the user the ability to see a product 's search trends over time displayed in a heat map as well as narrow down to city locations which can then be targeted in Adwords .  (Uncertainty) </span>For retailers, this means that they will be able to make a comparison of products' demand at a local level where they have outlets in order to make informed decisions on their inventory needs or regional budgets.However, one important thing to note is that the tool doesn't actually tell retailers what products are being bought or will be bought by the searchers but rely on keyword searches as an indicator of shopping intent.Lastly, the company said it will begin offering next-day delivery for shoppers in locations throughout Southern California, including Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County, the Inland Empire and other areas.In the past, the service catered to customers in Northern California and West Los Angeles, along with Manhattan, Boston, Chicago, Washington and in several states in the Midwest.Some of the participating merchants include Costco (NASDAQ: COST ), Target (NYSE: TGT ), Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ) and Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA ).<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> however responded to this move in a matter of hours by expanding its same day Prime Now delivery service in San Diego , meaning that customers in his region will be able to order some goods from local stores , ultimately reducing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's set-up costs for storage while boosting its inventory at the same time . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Google 's online shopping strategy may be playing catch-up to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> but I <b>believe</b> that it holds plenty of promise . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , with all these new changes being implemented Google <b>may</b> just end up being successful in drawing product search volumes from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Unconfirmed</b> sources peg the annual revenue from Google Shopping at close to $ 5 billion and once the strategy gets into high gear , investors should expect <i>more</i> upside from this part of the business .
