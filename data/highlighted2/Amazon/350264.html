(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's four-inch iPhone SE should be well received by consumers.My investment strategy for Apple is updated as the result of this event.I don't write about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) very often because it's been a long time since I thought the company embodied a very good investment opportunity.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In October of 2014 , I first wrote to say the stock was about to hit all-time highs related to its launch of a <i>larger</i> iPhone , but that the best use of that prediction might be for sophisticated long-term investors to wait a quarter or two and then use a short position on the stock as a hedge for <i>broader</i> market <b>volatility</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That analysis has panned out quite nicely - AAPL is essentially flat over the year and a half since the article was written.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , a short position entered anytime from 4-9 months after its publication would have returned 15 % -30 % annualized , even counting dividends and excluding the yield <b>optimization</b> strategies that such investors typically employ .  (Uncertainty) </span>Today, I'm writing about another iPhone launch and updating my strategic outlook, even while affirming other parts of the original thesis.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I have little <b>doubt</b> that the four-inch iPhone SE will be a compelling upgrade for many Apple fans .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>smaller</i> form factor is important for many users , and this is Apple 's first upgrade fitting that bill in two and half years .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple 's 2015 sales of 30M <i>older</i> four-inch models affirms the continued appeal , and this review gives good detail on the trade offs between <i>larger</i> and <i>smaller</i> phones .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apart from the size and bringing the ( sadly proprietary ) technology up to date , the main draws of the SE <b>seems</b> to be price and extended battery life .  (Uncertainty) </span>The SE can operate through about 10 hours of continuous screen use, but I'm not sure testing the battery life of small form factor phone based on screen usage is the best metric.Furthermore, it's clear that Apple has achieved these gains by skimping on the screen.It's now generally accepted that Apple will need to switch to AMOLED screens in the next year or so, and Korean reports indicate that Apple has already signed an agreement with Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) to supply them.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I had held out <b>hope</b> that a niche iPhone release with minimal screen size would be an opportunity for early Apple adoption .  (Uncertainty) </span>Sadly, the poor contrast noted by hands-on reviewers indicates this is not be.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In light of a strong near-term sales cycle and Apple 's moves to try to leap frog the display industry with AU Optronics ( NYSE : AUO ) , shorting AAPL no longer <b>seems</b> advisable , despite a much <i>dicier</i> market .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Screens are one of the most expensive components in a phone and the move to put old display technology in an otherwise updated product <b>may</b> result in good margins .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Nonetheless , this ( lack of ) development is all the <i>more</i> <b>disappointing</b> given recent reports that IHS is now claiming that mobile AMOLED screens can be produced <i>more</i> cheaply than their LTPS LCD counterparts .  (Surprise) </span>Given the strong consumer preference for AMOLEDs, I'm still quite firm in the opinion that AAPL will not exceed it previous highs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 've been pointing out all along that the architecture of AMOLED screens is inherently <i>simpler</i> , and thus theoretically <i>cheaper</i> , than that of LCDs .  (Surprise) </span>Reaching that inflection point has some important implications: In Korea, expect production lines to be converted at a rapid pace, given the strong consumer preference for AMOLEDs.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>may</b> , in turn , put even <i>more</i> pressure on the Chinese market .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Though this solidifies Samsung's position as the mobile price leader, its continued push into quantum dot televisions is either just rhetoric or doomed to be short-lived, especially in light of a recent Aixtron (AIXT) breakthrough .By contrast, the future looks bright for LG Display (NYSE: LPL ) on all fronts.It has demonstrated superiority in producing truly flexible displays and designing innovative smartphones.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite limited mobile AMOLED capacity , the company has been slowly , but steadily increasing its smartphone shipments , reaching <b>almost</b> 60M units last year .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the time being, though, LG is correctly focusing most of its effort on AMOLED televisions since it has no competition in that market.Continued build-out for all types of products should enable high margins going forward.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That leaves plenty of room for entry by other players , with AU Optronics being the clear technology leader and best candidate to capitalize on Apple 's need to catch up , as covered in <i>earlier</i> articles .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The announcement of the annual shareholders meeting indicates continued build out and partnership potential as well as a dividend that is <b>almost</b> twice what Apple offers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Of course, any product announcement from Apple also has implications for InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ).The Watch is clearly a flop, at least by Apple standards, and its price was lowered by $50 to $299.Much has been made in the media about InvenSense being left out of the Apple Watch, but diversity in a growing market is good for suppliers.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Such observers also fail to realize that the design time for the product was probably far <i>longer</i> than it is for Apple 's <i>larger</i> devices , and quite <b>possibly</b> precedes the Apple-InvenSense relationship .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The new iPad Pros use a new set of microphones , <b>perhaps</b> in a similar configuration to what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has been doing with the Echo to achieve superior voice response for Siri ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I'd say that both of these developments bode well for InvenSense, but that would be ignoring history .Instead, I'll look for tear downs of these devices next month.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The four-inch iPhone SE will have major appeal to Apple diehards who prefer a <i>smaller</i> phone .  (Surprise) </span>However, it will NOT have the same level draw that the first an only Apple phablet garnered.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even Apple fans are being drawn to <i>more</i> innovative products and plans , which have been available for months .  (Surprise) </span>With a PE of 11.5 AAPL is fairly priced going into another strong sales cycle.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , <i>greater</i> diversification in new markets , and Apple 's lack of vertical integration , means the company needs to offer a <i>better</i> yield , valuation and growth .  (Surprise) </span>The company will remain a market leader for some time to come, but market leaders don't always make the best investments.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
