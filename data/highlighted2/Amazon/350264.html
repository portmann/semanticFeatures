updated as the result of this event I dont write about Apple NASDAQ AAPL very often because its been a long time since I thought the company embodied a very good investment opportunity In October of I first wrote to say the stock was about to hit alltime highs related to its launch of a larger iPhone but that the best use of that prediction might be for sophisticated longterm investors to wait a quarter or two and then use a short position on the stock as a hedge for broader market volatility That analysis has panned out quite nicely AAPL is essentially flat over the year and a half since the article was written However a short position entered anytime from months after its publication would have returned annualized even counting dividends and excluding the yield optimization strategies that such investors typically employ Today Im writing about another iPhone launch and updating my strategic outlook even while affirming other parts of the original thesis I have little doubt that the fourinch iPhone SE will be a compelling upgrade for many Apple fans The smaller form factor is important for many users and this is Apples first upgrade fitting that bill in two and half years Apples sales of M older fourinch models affirms the continued appeal and this review gives good detail on the trade offs between larger and smaller phones Apart from the size and bringing the sadly proprietary technology up to date the main draws of the SE seems to be price and extended battery life The SE can operate through about hours of continuous screen use but Im not sure testing the battery life of small form factor phone based on screen usage is the best metric Furthermore its clear that Apple has achieved these gains by skimping on the screen Its now generally accepted that Apple will need to switch to AMOLED screens in the next year or so and Korean reports indicate that Apple has already signed an agreement with Samsung OTCSSNLF to supply them I had held out hope that a niche iPhone release with minimal screen size would be an opportunity for early Apple adoption Sadly the poor contrast noted by handson reviewers indicates this is not be In light of a strong nearterm sales cycle and Apples moves to try to leap frog the display industry with AU Optronics NYSE AUO shorting AAPL no longer seems advisable despite a much dicier market Screens are one of the most expensive components in a phone and the move to put old display technology in an otherwise updated product may result in good margins Nonetheless this lack of development is all the more disappointing given recent reports that IHS is now claiming that mobile AMOLED screens can be produced more cheaply than their LTPS LCD counterparts Given the strong consumer preference for AMOLEDs Im still quite firm in the opinion that AAPL will not exceed it previous highs Ive been pointing out all along that the architecture of AMOLED screens is inherently simpler and thus theoretically cheaper than that of LCDs Reaching that inflection point has some important implications In Korea expect production lines to be converted at a rapid pace given the strong consumer preference for AMOLEDs This may in turn put even more pressure on the Chinese market Though this solidifies Samsungs position as the mobile price leader its continued push into quantum dot televisions is either just rhetoric or doomed to be shortlived especially in light of a recent Aixtron AIXT breakthrough By contrast the future looks bright for LG Display NYSE LPL on all fronts It has demonstrated superiority in producing truly flexible displays and designing innovative smartphones Despite limited mobile AMOLED capacity the company has been slowly but steadily increasing its smartphone shipments reaching almost M units last year For the time being though LG is correctly focusing most of its effort on AMOLED televisions since it has no competition in that market Continued buildout for all types of products should enable high margins going forward That leaves plenty of room for entry by other players with AU Optronics being the clear technology leader and best candidate to capitalize on Apples need to catch up as covered in earlier articles The announcement of the annual shareholders meeting indicates continued build out and partnership potential as well as a dividend that is almost twice what Apple offers Of course any product announcement from Apple also has implications for InvenSense NYSE INVN The Watch is clearly a flop at least by Apple standards and its price was lowered by to Much has been made in the media about InvenSense being left out of the Apple Watch but diversity in a growing market is good for suppliers Such observers also fail to realize that the design time for the product was probably far longer than it is for Apples larger devices and quite possibly precedes the AppleInvenSense relationship The new iPad Pros use a new set of microphones perhaps in a similar configuration to what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN has been doing with the Echo to achieve superior voice response for Siri Id say that both of these developments bode well for InvenSense but that would be ignoring history Instead Ill look for tear downs of these devices next month The fourinch iPhone SE will have major appeal to Apple diehards who prefer a smaller phone However it will NOT have the same level draw that the first an only Apple phablet garnered Even Apple fans are being drawn to more innovative products and plans which have been available for months With a PE of AAPL is fairly priced going into another strong sales cycle However greater diversification in new markets and Apples lack of vertical integration means the company needs to offer a better yield valuation and growth The company will remain a market leader for some time to come but market leaders dont always make the best investments I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Technology Personal
