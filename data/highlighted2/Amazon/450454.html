( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart is behind <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , but it is working to catch up . Wal-Mart is offering a free 30 day trial to gain subscribers.If Wal-Mart has some success , it can force <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime to unbundle in order to directly compete with ShippingPass . Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) began beta testing the ShippingPass yearly subscription last year.It was priced at $50 per year for free unlimited 3-day shipping for about 1 million of the 7 million items on the website.It then switched to charging $49 per year and dropped the shipping length to 2 days.The items not available for 2 day shipping have free shipping of 4-6 days.Last week Wal-Mart started giving a free 30 day trial to really beef up the number of new users trying it out.We don't have any data from Wal-Mart on how great the sales have been, but as you can see the Google Trends search data shows an in improvement of late.However , if you plot it against traffic for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Prime , the line does n't even show up because it 's so little in comparison to Prime . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> have up to 50 million American Prime subscribers and 80 million worldwide , so Wal-Mart is starting at a disadvantage . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Wal-Mart 's online sales growth has been decelerating as last year 's holiday season saw 8 % growth compared to 22 % growth in the year <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Even now the ShippingPass is still in its pilot phase.ShippingPass is important because 66% of online carts are abandoned because of shipping costs.The only way for Wal-Mart to compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is to have this ShippingPass compete successfully with Prime . The benefit of Shipping Pass over Prime is it is half the price.Another advantage Wal-Mart has is its physical stores across the country where consumers can return items they don't like without the wait.The benefit of Prime over ShippingPass is that only 1 million items are available for 2-day shipping on ShippingPass compared to about 30 million for Prime.However, ShippingPass will likely be extended.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>may</b> be the reason behind why it 's still in pilot mode .  (Uncertainty) </span>There has to be some improvements Wal-Mart is working on to get it to full launch and I think speed and the amount of products which can ship quickly are the two likely improvements which will be made.The interesting part about this comparison is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also has its music , movies , cloud storage , and Kindle lending program included in Prime . This begs to question all things being equal if these extra products are worth the extra $50 per year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In terms of value they may be worth it , but they would <b>probably</b> have had trouble competing alone with firms like Netflix and Spotify if free shipping was n't a part of the Prime deal .  (Uncertainty) </span>As you can see from the Twitter poll below , unsurprisingly the best part of Prime is the free shipping.This creates a problem for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because Wal-Mart is competing by offering only what consumers actually want in the subscription . By giving the customers what they want Wal-Mart can steal some of them away from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . My point is not to say that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime will lose out to Wal-Mart . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My point is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> have to unbundle its services in order to properly compete against it . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If an unbundling occurs , it would hurt the library of services and content that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> worked so hard to create . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>These products will have to survive on their own.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We are already seeing a <b>possible</b> movement towards this with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> set to unveil its own streaming service which will have <i>more</i> songs than what Prime offers and will cost $ 9.99 per month outside of the Prime bundle . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This unbundling of products <b>could</b> be good for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> if it succeeds but does offer them up to <i>more</i> competition . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> music as a part of Prime does not directly compete with Spotify . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> streaming does directly compete with Spotify which makes the chances of success much <i>lower</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The key value in having a Prime customer is not the $99 subscription fee.It is the fact that it locks in a customer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once a subscriber is locked in for a year , it makes little sense to go to another website where shipping <b>may</b> not be free .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Prime subscribers order much <i>more</i> goods from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and grow over time . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Subscribers want to get their money 's worth , so it makes sense they would order <i>more</i> from the website .  (Surprise) </span>According to Weinstein , in 2015 non-Prime members spent under $1,000.Prime members who joined in January 2014 spent $2,147 in 2015 and those who joined in January 2012 spent $3,091 in 2015.Prime members increase their spending by 12% per year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Paying for this subscription is perfect for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> just offered the service for free and found a way to raise prices across the board , the subscribers would n't be locked in . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Any unbundling that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to do <b>could</b> disrupt the business model . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>$99 is a great price because consumers are able to rationalize their subscription after a few purchases.It is similar to a season pass at a theme park which makes economic sense if you visit twice.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Wal-Mart forces <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to lower prices or unbundle the Prime subscription it <b>could</b> begin to make sense for consumers to subscribe to multiple free shipping services which eliminates <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's virtual monopoly on Prime subscribers ' online purchases . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A <i>lower</i> subscription may change the psychology of the consumer and make them <i>less</i> <b>worried</b> about making sure they get their money 's worth on the subscription .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Wal-Mart is way behind <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in online subscriptions for free 2-day shipping . In fact Wal-Mart hasn't even ended the ShippingPass pilot program and launched it fully.However, Wal-Mart is showing it is serious about the program by dropping the 3-day shipping plan to 2 days and offering a free 30 day trial.Wal-Mart will likely never come out with any type of services such like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has with video and music . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This allows it to charge a <i>lower</i> price .  (Surprise) </span>This along with having physical stores to return items to gives it an edge in competing with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> when it expands the amount of products which have free 2-day shipping . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Wal-Mart can perfect this deal , so that it begins to steal customers from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> it <b>could</b> cause <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to unbundle the Prime service in order to compete on a level playing field . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is a potential negative for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because those other services will have to compete on their own and because it <b>may</b> begin to make sense to purchase multiple yearly subscriptions which would end <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's dominance .
