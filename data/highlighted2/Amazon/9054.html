(Uncertainty) </span>Live streaming aside consumers are still going to want a Netflix , Hulu or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> type subscription as a companion service and that 's going to bump their monthly price up . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This week the streaming landscape got even <i>more</i> crowded as Sony ( NYSE : SNE ) opened its Vue service in three markets and the Wall Street Journal outed Apple 's ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) plans to join the fray as well .  (Surprise) </span>But are these new services really a game changer or just cable 2.0?One fact that bears repeating is that not one of the services (Sling, Vue, Apple) have all the major broadcasters.Sling (through DISH Network (NASDAQ: DISH )) has none of them, Vue has all but ABC and Apple will reportedly have all but NBC.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Those are big holes as both ABC and NBC carry a strong sports presence and fans are not going to want to <b>risk</b> losing marquee events or those featuring their favorite teams .  (Uncertainty) </span>As a result they'll go searching for other ways to get their sports fix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While they are looking other streaming add-ons will present themselves including MLB , WWE ( NYSE : WWE ) Network and even non-sporting options like HBO ( and soon Showtime ) that <b>could</b> distract them from switching altogether .  (Uncertainty) </span>What's interesting is that while all of the above are one-offs, they helped fuel the overall cord-cutter movement by showing there was a market for mainstream streaming content.That fact reinforces why it is vital for the streamers to make a deal with the full-core four networks and the first service to lock that in will have the advantage.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One is that Vue and Apple aside if you take Sling at its most basic price point , add it to Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , Hulu or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and throw in a HBO-esque premium service you 're <b>somewhere</b> in the $ 40 a month range . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now add Apple or Vue in and all of <b>sudden</b> you 're pushing right up against ( or over ) that $ 64 national average for cable service in America .  (Uncertainty) </span>And that's only if you're taking a bare bones approach and not "collecting" other services.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Deep down you know the ultimate of ultimate cord-cutters will have just about every service out there and actually <b>may</b> be paying <i>more</i> than the average person either out of spite or because they do n't realize it .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Remember, all of these extra MLB/WWE specialty type services all fall into the premium categories that would usually come with an up-charge of some type as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Basically you will pay between $ 10 and $ 20 a month per service ( on top of your channel package ) <b>depending</b> on how many you want to subscribe to get your version of maximum value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yes , if Apple gets into the sector ( and it probably will because it 's Apple and nothing is out of bounds for them ) then between them Vue and Sling you could <b>conceivably</b> pick a package and eliminate the cable company middleman but will you actually ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Think about it for a second, all three services will have a few tiers to choose from, but that's really just a fancy word for bundles, which is the whole thing people were trying to get away from in the first place.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And look at some of the channels in the Sling packages - IFC , El Ray , Galavision and Maker , four great examples of channels you <b>may</b> get now and not even watch or realize you have .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And it gets <i>worse</i> in the premium tiers with the Cooking Channel , Duck TV , Baby TV and five <i>more</i> ESPN channels ( aside from ESPN and ESPN 2 ) that will rarely if ever have a marquee event .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>No disrespect to these channels as I'm sure they all have fine programming that plays to a specific niche, but this again speaks to being forced into paying for channels most people don't want.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And I 'm not meaning to pick on Sling with <i>more</i> channels I 'm sure Vue and Apple will have even <i>more</i> filler stations that right now reside so buried in your cable box even the cable company <b>probably</b> has forgotten they are there at one point or another .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>What's interesting with these new services is we've moved on from streaming sites fighting over series to fighting over the networks themselves, which is a unique progression in the dynamic.It 's no longer Netflix vs. Hulu vs. <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> other players have joined the party . That alone is something investors in any media company need to be vigilant about, as for now all we've really done is taken the current model and duplicated it online.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yes , it can be <i>cheaper</i> , but what 's the opportunity cost ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>People who want to pick their packages are still no <i>closer</i> to doing so , this is just re-arranging the pieces ( unless you plan to move to Canada ) .  (Surprise) </span>You can still order cable and a Netflix-like service and have access to everything you need, but what cord-cutters want is to escape out from the cable/satellite companies.Until one company has a pick-your-menu style option (which isn't on the table at the moment), there will always be drawbacks.Right now the services like Apple, Vue and Sling are making an impact and disrupting the conversation but not in the way you'd expect and as long as companies keep dancing around the overarching issues cable still wins ï¿½ as it has for a very long time.Source: Will Apple, Sony And DISH's Cord-Cutting Plans Really Make An Impact?Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) The author wrote this article themselves , and it expresses their own opinions .
