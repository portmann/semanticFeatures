missing a few key elements Sporting events remain a hot button topic as none of the three can confidently say they have the average sports fan covered Live streaming aside consumers are still going to want a Netflix Hulu or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>type subscription as a companion service and thats going to bump their monthly price up This week the streaming landscape got even more crowded as Sony NYSE SNE opened its Vue service in three markets and the Wall Street Journal outed Apples NASDAQ AAPL plans to join the fray as well But are these new services really a game changer or just cable One fact that bears repeating is that not one of the services Sling Vue Apple have all the major broadcasters Sling through DISH Network NASDAQ DISH has none of them Vue has all but ABC and Apple will reportedly have all but NBC Those are big holes as both ABC and NBC carry a strong sports presence and fans are not going to want to risk losing marquee events or those featuring their favorite teams As a result theyll go searching for other ways to get their sports fix While they are looking other streaming addons will present themselves including MLB WWE NYSE WWE Network and even nonsporting options like HBO and soon Showtime that could distract them from switching altogether Whats interesting is that while all of the above are oneoffs they helped fuel the overall cordcutter movement by showing there was a market for mainstream streaming content That fact reinforces why it is vital for the streamers to make a deal with the fullcore four networks and the first service to lock that in will have the advantage One is that Vue and Apple aside if you take Sling at its most basic price point add it to Netflix NASDAQ NFLX Hulu or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and throw in a HBOesque premium service youre somewhere in the a month range Now add Apple or Vue in and all of sudden youre pushing right up against or over that national average for cable service in America And thats only if youre taking a bare bones approach and not collecting other services Deep down you know the ultimate of ultimate cordcutters will have just about every service out there and actually may be paying more than the average person either out of spite or because they dont realize it Remember all of these extra MLBWWE specialty type services all fall into the premium categories that would usually come with an upcharge of some type as well Basically you will pay between and a month per service on top of your channel package depending on how many you want to subscribe to get your version of maximum value Yes if Apple gets into the sector and it probably will because its Apple and nothing is out of bounds for them then between them Vue and Sling you could conceivably pick a package and eliminate the cable company middleman but will you actually Think about it for a second all three services will have a few tiers to choose from but thats really just a fancy word for bundles which is the whole thing people were trying to get away from in the first place And look at some of the channels in the Sling packages IFC El Ray Galavision and Maker four great examples of channels you may get now and not even watch or realize you have And it gets worse in the premium tiers with the Cooking Channel Duck TV Baby TV and five more ESPN channels aside from ESPN and ESPN that will rarely if ever have a marquee event No disrespect to these channels as Im sure they all have fine programming that plays to a specific niche but this again speaks to being forced into paying for channels most people dont want And Im not meaning to pick on Sling with more channels Im sure Vue and Apple will have even more filler stations that right now reside so buried in your cable box even the cable company probably has forgotten they are there at one point or another Whats interesting with these new services is weve moved on from streaming sites fighting over series to fighting over the networks themselves which is a unique progression in the dynamic Its no longer Netflix vs Hulu vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>other players have joined the party That alone is something investors in any media company need to be vigilant about as for now all weve really done is taken the current model and duplicated it online Yes it can be cheaper but whats the opportunity cost People who want to pick their packages are still no closer to doing so this is just rearranging the pieces unless you plan to move to Canada You can still order cable and a Netflixlike service and have access to everything you need but what cordcutters want is to escape out from the cablesatellite companies Until one company has a pickyourmenu style option which isnt on the table at the moment there will always be drawbacks Right now the services like Apple Vue and Sling are making an impact and disrupting the conversation but not in the way youd expect and as long as companies keep dancing around the overarching issues cable still wins as it has for a very long time Source Will Apple Sony And DISHs
