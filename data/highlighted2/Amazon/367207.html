So what does Twitter winning mean?Essentially, TWTR has a lock on many of the tweets/comments related to those games.People are lazy.Why watch the feed on Twitter than move to FB to post your thoughts?Users will already be logged in to Twitter and can share their thoughts there.The negative press does not stop there.Recent days have seen a significant increase in articles questioning Facebook and their dominance.Additional articles ranging from this article to this article to this article and even this article have popped up on the radar screens of investors at a much more increased pace than past months have witnessed.Finally, I need to discuss quickly the technical breakdown in Facebook.The failure of FB to break out to new highs despite the overall market strength in the past few weeks has given momentum players ammunition to take FB down going into both the F8 conference and the upcoming earnings announcement.So what does it all mean?I have focused on it in the past but it needs to be repeated.With a stock price of $110 or higher, a market capitalization well in excess of $300 billion and a PE ratio that is over 80, the market is pricing FB for perfection due to its successes in the past.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With that being said , if there is no earth shattering announcement from FB at F8 or earnings do not beat expectations another ( significant ) round of selling <b>may</b> be at the doorstep of Facebook longs .
