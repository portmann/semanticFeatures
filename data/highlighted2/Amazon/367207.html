priced for perfection Anyone who follows my articles knows that I have questioned Facebook NASDAQ FB with regard to how long their business model can beat expectations On the eve of the F Developer Conference I thought now would be a good time to check the performance of my prior two calls and to give my opinions on the upcoming Conference Before I discuss the new clouds hanging over Facebook I need to clear the air It has been suggested by many that one is only as good as their track record So with that being said I decided to go back and check my performance related to Facebook My first article was published at night on February th In it my conclusion was With that being said our outlook for Facebook stock is for market underperformance in Please note that this does not translate into my stating that this is an opportunity or claim to short Facebook Rather as just stated it constitutes an expectation of market underperformance My second article was published at night on March th In that article my conclusion was At current levels Facebook cannot be recommended as a buy or hold Therefore a sell or short would be the only logical conclusion I bring these up because in both instances I have been attacked by every FB bull for questioning their beloved and well performing so far investment My thesis for both articles was that complacency in FB buy and hold may not be the most prudent decision So why write a new article Because we are on the eve of the F Developer Conference The last two weeks have seen some interesting stories devoted to Facebook The first article I saw is an article by Richard Saintvilus that raises questions surrounding the doubledigit decline in FB original posts In it he mentions reports from that showed personal posts were down and overall sharing of posts was down Mr Saintvilus also mentions that according to reports Facebook recently suffered a doubledigit decline in original posts These updates not only are a critical part of Facebooks advertising dominance they are how Facebook collects personal information about its users and a primary source of determining targeted advertising The second article I saw was an article written by Brian Deagon that brings into question what we can or should expect from Facebook at the F meetings In it he mentions Two sessions are dedicated to Messenger the first is at noon Tuesday and is titled Messenger Connecting People and Business At this event Facebook is expected to announce plans to integrate socalled chatbots into its mobile Messenger platform Also a second session on Messenger takes place Wednesday at noon entitled Messenger The Future of Communications The expectations are high With Facebook by their own admission page of their annual report stating that their user growth is slowing we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and we achieve greater market penetration FB needs new and creative venues to keep and grow the user engagement of their members Mr Deagon notes that the Live video streaming service for mobile device users and Oculus will also be main focuses of attendees attention The third article was an article written by Shirley Pelts where she discussed why Facebook withdrew their bid to stream NFL games The main reason for the withdrawal apparently was something FB has created called Facebook Sports Stadium As Sheryl notes Its purpose is to attract sports fans to follow playbyplay updates live scores and commentaries on games The new feature will allow users to share player statuses and videos as well as to discuss major sporting events with fans and followers Interestingly Twitter NYSE TWTR won the bid despite not being the high bidder and not even being mentioned as a contender in the bidding war Verizon NYSE VZ and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN were considered to be the other serious contenders So what does Twitter winning mean Essentially TWTR has a lock on many of the tweetscomments related to those games People are lazy Why watch the feed on Twitter than move to FB to post your thoughts Users will already be logged in to Twitter and can share their thoughts there The negative press does not stop there Recent days have seen a significant increase in articles questioning Facebook and their dominance Additional articles ranging from this article to this article to this article and even this article have popped up on the radar screens of investors at a much more increased pace than past months have witnessed Finally I need to discuss quickly the technical breakdown in Facebook The failure of FB to break out to new highs despite the overall market strength in the past few weeks has given momentum players ammunition to take FB down going into both the F conference and the upcoming earnings announcement So what does it all mean I have focused on it in the past but it needs to be repeated With a stock price of or higher a market capitalization well in excess of billion and a PE ratio that is over the market is pricing FB for perfection due to its successes in the past With that being said if there is no earth shattering announcement from FB at F or earnings do not beat expectations another significant round of selling may be at the doorstep of Facebook longs My call of March th stands Now is a good time to sell or short Facebook Disclaimer Investing in stocks such as Facebook can be risky There is no guarantee that your investment will be safe There is also a great
