( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha First-mover advantage is of prime importance . There was a recent Seeking Alpha article titled , `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's AWS : The Myth Of Scale And First-Mover Advantage '' . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This article attempts to downplay <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) cloud service AWS by suggesting that being the first mover does n't provide as much advantage as might be <b>assumed</b> at first blush . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The article then goes on to <b>suggest</b> that scale does n't provide as much advantage due to data residency laws along with the complications of providing redundant data storage given <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's lack of sufficient data centers in Europe . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>When discussing the cloud, you can always darken the picture or at least change it by trying to slice and dice it into pieces such as: Public Cloud versus Private Cloud or IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) versus PaaS (Platform as a Service).For the sake of this article, we are discussing public cloud services and both IaaS and PaaS.In July 2015 , Synergy Research Group published cloud provider research that showed the market share of the top four providers and highlighted both the growth of cloud services as well as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's disproportionate growth compared to Microsoft , IBM and Google . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 've always been <b>amazed</b> at the sources of some of the best new ideas in technology .  (Surprise) </span>In the 90s, Microsoft missed the World Wide Web completely.An upstart company called Netscape got it and launched the first commercial browser in 1994.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It took Microsoft <b>almost</b> a year to acknowledge the Web and launch IE .  (Uncertainty) </span>Granted, MSFT caught on quickly, but this was a move that it should have run with considering it was the front-runner in technology in those days.The Web should have been synonymous with Microsoft.A similar thing happened in the 2000s when an online bookstore launched the first cloud service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>could</b> n't help but think that this should have come from Google .  (Uncertainty) </span>I was impressed enough by this development that in 2008 , I wrote a short article titled `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Secret Plan to Take Over the Internet '' on my blog . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The article that I mentioned <i>earlier</i> spends a lot of time talking about data centers , data locality and data residency .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The idea is that customers have legal requirements about data security and locality with the <b>suggestion</b> that the location of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's data centers make this difficult to obtain . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , the author does not go on to describe how these issues are made <i>easier</i> by the other cloud providers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While these may be problems that cloud providers <b>might</b> help solve , they are not issues created by the existence of the cloud .  (Uncertainty) </span>Every company in the cloud has to deal with issues of data security to some extent or another.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some of these data issues are extreme enough that it would be <b>nearly</b> impossible to use the cloud as it exists today including companies in financial services and telecommunication .  (Uncertainty) </span>These issues are being addressed rapidly by the cloud industry and by potential customers.As an example , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's GovCloud segment of AWS has seen success in obtaining the CIA as a customer . While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has made concessions to make the GovCloud palatable to government agencies , it is still a public cloud service . The thing about the data issues faced by companies is that they don't go away if you host your own infrastructure.Each company still has to address each of the practical and legal needs of its customers' data from a privacy, security and redundancy perspective.The thing that is most interesting about the article is that it mentions some buzzwords such as data latency and gravity as if they further confirm the author's conclusions.They do not.The latency issue is one that would be faced either way whether you used the cloud or hosted your own infrastructure.In this case, latency is the delay resulting from attempts to transfer the data from one location to another either for the purpose of residency or redundancy.In the context of data locality, the issue of having to transfer data across the public Internet was raised.This was highlighted as a major problem, but the fact that all other cloud providers have the same issue wasn't mentioned.If you can't transfer data over the Internet using technologies such as SSL (secure sockets layer) and VPC (virtual private clouds), then a company has no choice but to employ their own data transfer mechanisms using leased lines other similar approaches.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But as the industry evolves , transferring data using a VPC is becoming <i>more</i> accepted as best practices for data security are applied .  (Surprise) </span>After all, if it's good enough for the CIA, it can't be too bad?(Author's note: I expect this last comment to cause a fuss among a certain crowd).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Data gravity is an even <i>more</i> interesting issue .  (Surprise) </span>The term "data gravity" was coined by David McCrory in a blog post in 2010.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The idea is that at some point , a company accumulates so much data that it becomes <i>less</i> expensive to build services and applications at the data 's locale rather than move the data to a new location .  (Surprise) </span>This turns out to be quite a significant observation, especially as we move into the age of big data.In 2013, research firm Nasumi estimated there was over 1 exabyte stored in the cloud.That is a billion gigabytes or a million terabytes.In September of this year, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) published projections of cloud data traffic to grow to 7.7 zettabytes a year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Having experienced it directly since I started using cloud services , I can confirm the concept of data gravity as the idea that it 's <i>easier</i> to build an application in the cloud around your data rather than move the data .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And yes , I know that providers are making it <i>more</i> expensive to get data out of the cloud than it is to get it there in the first place , but they are in the business to make money .  (Surprise) </span>Right?Now consider that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> launched S3 ( Simple Storage Service ) in 2006 with all other providers only launching recently . Now consider that the concept of data gravity drives service usage and think about the amount of data that has accumulated in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's storage service since its inception . I personally have data in S3 buckets since 2007 , and I know companies that have large amounts of data stored in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> data services since 2008 . Now, I want to talk about a related but different concept.I'll call it Cloud Gravity for the sake of coining my own new term.When a company moves to the cloud, they have to develop their roadmap for making this move.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Contrary to popular belief , the cloud is n't automatically <i>cheaper</i> than hosting your own infrastructure .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While you do n't incur the capital expense , these are managed services and you can <b>assume</b> that cost is built into the service charge .  (Uncertainty) </span>A lot of companies will take an approach referred to by some as "lift and move".This approach involves mirroring your infrastructure in the cloud with a one-to-one match for virtual machines to physical computers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While this is a lot <i>easier</i> transition to make , it is also the most expensive .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The monthly costs tend to be substantially <i>higher</i> than the costs of operating your own equipment .  (Surprise) </span>To make effective use of the cloud, you must take advantage of its elasticity.Cloud services offer capacity on demand, but to leverage this, you must develop your systems to auto-scale based on instantaneous demand.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When no one is using your system , the infrastructure scales itself down automatically , and when demand increases , the system enables <i>more</i> capacity .  (Surprise) </span>To do this requires leveraging infrastructure proprietary to your cloud provider.In other words, to really take advantage of the cloud you must build your system around your cloud provider's services.This is not an insignificant cost in and of itself.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To move to another provider , you would have to re-architect your system to use that cloud provider 's services <b>assuming</b> feature parity .  (Uncertainty) </span>Imagine for example, the cost for a company such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) to move from AWS to Microsoft's Azure.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The <i>more</i> you build around a particular cloud provider 's infrastructure , the <i>more</i> <b>dependent</b> you will be .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In my opinion, this is the most significant first-mover advantage.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , an online bookstore , invented the cloud . Companies such as Google should have driven this effort, but instead are doing a poor job playing catch-up.The first-mover advantage is very real, and while there are certainly big issues facing companies with regard to data storage, they are problems that already exist outside of the cloud.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
