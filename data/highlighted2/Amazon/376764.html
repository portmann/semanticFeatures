( OTCMKTS : CELH ) | Seeking Alpha Peter Lynch was <b>perhaps</b> best Known for his style of fundamental research which focused on finding the next 10-bagger . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Lynch used anecdotal evidence coupled with "boots on the ground" methods of discovering consumer trends early, and before they were reflected in a company's stock price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was not around during Lynch 's tenure , but provides a much <i>faster</i> and <i>easier</i> way to identify consumer buying habits versus <i>older</i> , <i>more</i> traditional methods . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>We 've developed an indicator that uses customer reviews on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to help us discover consumer trends taking place on the world 's largest Internet retailer 's web site . We call it `` The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Indicator '' and apply it to our research methodology for discovering companies with the potential for explosive revenue growth . For anyone that has been around Wall Street and the stock market for a while, the name of Peter Lynch evokes images of a white-haired, soft-spoken, disciplined mutual fund manager with a well-trained eye for finding companies in the early stages of growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lynch is <b>perhaps</b> best known for his unique style of fundamental research , which focused on using anecdotal evidence and `` boots on the ground '' research to discover companies that , over the years , have become known as `` 10-baggers '' ; appreciating some 10-fold in value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While still applying the traditional approaches of fundamental analysis , by pouring over balance sheets and income statements , Lynch began to integrate other , <i>less</i> traditional , methods in his work to provide <i>more</i> timely information , without having to wait months for the release of quarterly results from the companies that he followed .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>His methods were so simple , in fact , he said that any investor <b>could</b> apply them to making investment decisions because of their common sense nature .  (Uncertainty) </span>We have written about Peter Lynch and his investment style on Seeking Alpha before, but want to introduce a particular piece of the research puzzle that was not around while Mr. Lynch was at the helm of Fidelity's flagship Magellan mutual fund.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While most investors would not take it upon themselves to call suppliers and distributors to inquire how a product was being accepted in the marketplace , they <b>could</b> sit in the parking lot of a large home-building supply store , on a Saturday morning , to watch traffic patterns and to look to see what products consumers were purchasing and carrying out of the store .  (Uncertainty) </span>Or, as we have seen in a recent commercial from one of the big discount brokers, sitting in the food court at the mall watching to see people's eating habits.Today, however, we have something that was not around during the days when Peter Lynch ran the Fidelity Magellan Fund.It is called <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . As the world 's largest Internet retailer , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has become a source that many of today 's consumers turn to for the purchase of everything from diapers to digital gadgetry . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>What may not be so <b>apparent</b> to investors is the way that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can be used to discover new trends in consumer behavior and buying habits , along with instantaneous feedback of how consumers feel about those products and , <i>more</i> importantly , if they would purchase them again . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The feedback mechanism on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can be likened to an investor having the opportunity to briefly interview purchasers of a product to see what their likes and dislikes are . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's akin to having your own little focus group to learn <i>more</i> about consumer behavior .  (Surprise) </span>At Altitrade Partners , we have developed an indicator that we have appropriately named `` The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Indicator '' . We use this indicator as a way of gathering information and knowledge about products that consumers are first hearing about and then purchasing through the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> web site . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We then integrate our findings with other methods including channel checks , discussions with retailers , and other `` boots on the ground '' techniques to assess how products are selling and what impact that <b>could</b> have on future revenues for a company .  (Uncertainty) </span>One company , in particular , that we have successfully applied The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Indicator to is a small micro-cap company by the name of Celsius Holdings , Inc. ( OTCQX : CELH ) We have written extensively about this company since we discovered it in late 2007 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>may</b> find our reports on the Altitrade Partners web site , our blog page , and on Seeking Alpha .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What we want to bring to the attention of investors in this article specifically is what the company has been seeing from the reviews posted on the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> web site and what that <b>may</b> mean for future revenue growth going forward into 2016 and beyond . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Celsius CEO Gerry David pointed out on a company conference call as well as in an interview with The Wall Street Transcript that Celsius has received a significantly <i>higher</i> number of customer reviews than many of its competitors in the beverage category .  (Surprise) </span>The number of reviews on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is currently approaching one thousand ( 1,000 ) in number . There is a very limited universe of products on the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> web site than can boast having received such a large number of reviews by consumers . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Digging a bit <i>deeper</i> into those reviews , we see that a full 82 % of those consumers who have tried Celsius products have given them a 4-star or 5-star rating .  (Surprise) </span>Overall, taking all reviews into account, the Celsius brand enjoys a 4.4 star rating.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To put that into perspective , Red Bull has about half as many product reviews while Monster Energy also has a <i>fewer</i> number of reviews than Celsius on the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> web site . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What makes these statistics all the <i>more</i> interesting is that if you compare the level of sales and revenues that both Red Bull and Monster enjoy , as compared to Celsius , this little company is showing a tremendous advantage in its reviews-to-revenue ratio .  (Surprise) </span>And while we understand that not all of the sales of energy drinks will take place on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's web site , it is important to note that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> plays an important role in this marketplace for consumers . After the introduction of two new flavors in mid-December last year , Celsius Sparkling Grape Rush has quickly become the # 1 Best Seller on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in its category . The takeaway for us from all of this data is that the Celsius brand is gaining significant traction among consumers, and that users enjoy both the taste and the benefits of drinking Celsius.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company was also the subject of an article , which <b>appeared</b> in BeverageWorld Magazine , laying claim to just how hot Celsius has become recently .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While there is much <i>more</i> to pay attention to when making an investment decision , especially in the high-risk micro-cap space , we believe that Celsius Holdings , Inc. deserves the attention of those investors who have a <b>speculative</b> side to their portfolios .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The company is scheduled to release financial results for Q4 and FY 2015 on Thursday, March 24, 2016, after the close of the market.There will also be an investor conference call which will immediately follow at 4:30 PM ET.We will be looking for a couple of key factors.First, the company has shored up the balance sheet with the infusion of additional capital from the April 2015 financing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to the most recent filing , the company has total current assets of $ 16.54 million against current liabilities of $ 2.27 million ; for a current ratio of <b>approximately</b> 7-to-1 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Total liabilities amount to $6.77 million.All of the above numbers are as of the most recent reporting period ending September 30, 2015.We will be looking closely at SG&A expenses along with the cash position at year end.Margins have continued to show improvement.The last report showed that gross profit margins improved from 37.7% in FY2014 to 41.5% in the third quarter of 2015.The company continues to focus on cost savings initiatives and efficiencies to improve gross profit margins.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We would <b>hope</b> for continued margin expansion in Q4 and FY2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Margins had suffered dramatically prior to the implementation of a revamped strategic marketing plan by the new management team brought in during late 2011.That management team is credited with championing the turnaround of Celsius and literally bringing the company "back from the brink" .While having distribution in Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) was impressive, razor-thin margins and other costs associated with having a presence in the giant warehouse retailer made it an unprofitable relationship at the time.The subsequent move to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> created synergies that CEO Gerry David has been able to successfully build upon . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> accounts for a substantial portion of total Internet sales for Celsius , and it <b>appears</b> that margins have improved , in part , due to this relationship . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This is one of the reasons why we look to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as an important measure of both product acceptance by consumers as well as potential repeat sales by satisfied customers . If there is a weakness to the indicator, it is that it is narrowly focused on one distribution channel.The clear strength of the indicator is that it is real time in nature.We get immediate and useful feedback from those who purchased and consumed Celsius products.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In summary , if the data gleaned from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is any indication of the trend taking place overall across all retail outlets for the Celsius brand , it just <b>may</b> be a precursor of <i>more</i> to come as the build out of the brand continues . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It 's far too early to say , but given that the company has one of the hottest products in its category on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , is gaining market share , and is backed financially by a number of high-profile global icons , including celebrity entrepreneur Russell Simmons and Asia 's richest individual Li Ka-shing , we would certainly not be betting against the trends that are slowly beginning to unfold both in the United States and in China .
