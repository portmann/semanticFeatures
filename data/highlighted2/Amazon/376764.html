Alpha Peter Lynch was perhaps best Known for his style of fundamental research which focused on finding the next bagger Lynch used anecdotal evidence coupled with boots on the ground methods of discovering consumer trends early and before they were reflected in a companys stock price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was not around during Lynchs tenure but provides a much faster and easier way to identify consumer buying habits versus older more traditional methods Weve developed an indicator that uses customer reviews on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to help us discover consumer trends taking place on the worlds largest Internet retailers web site We call it The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Indicator and apply it to our research methodology for discovering companies with the potential for explosive revenue growth For anyone that has been around Wall Street and the stock market for a while the name of Peter Lynch evokes images of a whitehaired softspoken disciplined mutual fund manager with a welltrained eye for finding companies in the early stages of growth Lynch is perhaps best known for his unique style of fundamental research which focused on using anecdotal evidence and boots on the ground research to discover companies that over the years have become known as baggers appreciating some fold in value While still applying the traditional approaches of fundamental analysis by pouring over balance sheets and income statements Lynch began to integrate other less traditional methods in his work to provide more timely information without having to wait months for the release of quarterly results from the companies that he followed His methods were so simple in fact he said that any investor could apply them to making investment decisions because of their common sense nature We have written about Peter Lynch and his investment style on Seeking Alpha before but want to introduce a particular piece of the research puzzle that was not around while Mr Lynch was at the helm of Fidelitys flagship Magellan mutual fund While most investors would not take it upon themselves to call suppliers and distributors to inquire how a product was being accepted in the marketplace they could sit in the parking lot of a large homebuilding supply store on a Saturday morning to watch traffic patterns and to look to see what products consumers were purchasing and carrying out of the store Or as we have seen in a recent commercial from one of the big discount brokers sitting in the food court at the mall watching to see peoples eating habits Today however we have something that was not around during the days when Peter Lynch ran the Fidelity Magellan Fund It is called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN As the worlds largest Internet retailer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has become a source that many of todays consumers turn to for the purchase of everything from diapers to digital gadgetry What may not be so apparent to investors is the way that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can be used to discover new trends in consumer behavior and buying habits along with instantaneous feedback of how consumers feel about those products and more importantly if they would purchase them again The feedback mechanism on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can be likened to an investor having the opportunity to briefly interview purchasers of a product to see what their likes and dislikes are Its akin to having your own little focus group to learn more about consumer behavior At Altitrade Partners we have developed an indicator that we have appropriately named The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Indicator We use this indicator as a way of gathering information and knowledge about products that consumers are first hearing about and then purchasing through the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>web site We then integrate our findings with other methods including channel checks discussions with retailers and other boots on the ground techniques to assess how products are selling and what impact that could have on future revenues for a company One company in particular that we have successfully applied The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Indicator to is a small microcap company by the name of Celsius Holdings Inc OTCQXCELH We have written extensively about this company since we discovered it in late You may find our reports on the Altitrade Partners web site our blog page and on Seeking Alpha What we want to bring to the attention of investors in this article specifically is what the company has been seeing from the reviews posted on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>web site and what that may mean for future revenue growth going forward into and beyond Celsius CEO Gerry David pointed out on a company conference call as well as in an interview with The Wall Street Transcript that Celsius has received a significantly higher number of customer reviews than many of its competitors in the beverage category The number of reviews on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is currently approaching one thousand in number There is a very limited universe of products on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>web site than can boast having received such a large number of reviews by consumers Digging a bit deeper into those reviews we see that a full of those consumers who have tried Celsius products have given them a star or star rating Overall taking all reviews into account the Celsius brand enjoys a star rating To put that into perspective Red Bull has about half as many product reviews while Monster Energy also has a fewer number of reviews than Celsius on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>web site What makes these statistics all the more interesting is that if you compare the level of sales and revenues that both Red Bull and Monster enjoy as compared to Celsius this little company is showing a tremendous advantage in its reviewstorevenue ratio And while we understand that not all of the sales of energy drinks will take place on Amazons web site it is important to note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>plays an important role in this marketplace for consumers After the introduction of two new flavors in midDecember last year Celsius Sparkling Grape Rush has quickly become the Best Seller on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in its category The takeaway for us from all of this data is that the Celsius brand is gaining significant traction among consumers and that users enjoy both the taste and the benefits of drinking Celsius The company was also the subject of an article which appeared in BeverageWorld Magazine laying claim to just how hot Celsius has become recently While there is much more to pay attention to when making an investment decision especially in the highrisk microcap space we believe that Celsius Holdings Inc deserves the attention of those investors who have a speculative side to their portfolios The company is scheduled to release financial results for Q and FY on Thursday March after the close of the market There will also be an investor conference call which will immediately follow at PM ET We will be looking for a couple of key factors First the company has shored up the balance sheet with the infusion of additional capital from the April financing According to the most recent filing the company has total current assets of million against current liabilities of million for a current ratio of approximately to Total liabilities amount to million All of the above numbers are as of the most recent reporting period ending September We will be looking closely at SGA expenses along with the cash position at year end Margins have continued to show improvement The last report showed that gross profit margins improved from in FY to in the third quarter of The company continues to focus on cost savings initiatives and efficiencies to improve gross profit margins We would hope for continued margin expansion in Q and FY Margins had suffered dramatically prior to the implementation of a revamped strategic marketing plan by the new management team brought in during late That management team is credited with championing the turnaround of Celsius and literally bringing the company back from the brink While having distribution in Costco NASDAQ COST was impressive razorthin margins and other costs associated with having a presence in the giant warehouse retailer made it an unprofitable relationship at the time The subsequent move to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>created synergies that CEO Gerry David has been able to successfully build upon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>accounts for a substantial portion of total Internet sales for Celsius and it appears that margins have improved in part due to this relationship This is one of the reasons why we look to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as an important measure of both product acceptance by consumers as well as potential repeat sales by satisfied customers If there is a weakness to the indicator it is that it is narrowly focused on one distribution channel The clear strength of the indicator is that it is real time in nature We get immediate and useful feedback from those who purchased and consumed Celsius products In summary if the data gleaned from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is any indication of the trend taking place overall across all retail outlets for the Celsius brand it just may be a precursor of more to come as the build out of the brand continues Its far too early to say but given that the company has one of the hottest products in its category on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is gaining market share and is backed financially by a number of highprofile global icons including celebrity entrepreneur Russell Simmons and Asias richest individual Li Kashing we would certainly not be betting against the trends that are slowly
