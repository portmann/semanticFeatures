Fidelity Select Retailing Portfolio No Load FSRPX Includes AMZN HD by Big Dog Investments High expense ratio but good reference point for diversification The fund has shown strong growth over the last decade There are several industries that make up the consumer cyclical category Retail is one of these industries and has seen some changes over the last decade Theres more to come with new generations wanting convenience in their shopping experience Malls are an example of retail that is becoming outdated and starting to have vacancy problems Online retail has been one of the major factors in people not leaving their house to shop Its says a lot when you can go to a mall with over one hundred stores and still have to travel to another location to get your grocery shopping done Retail starting to see some changes brings great potential to any companies who can adapt to the future The Fidelity Select Retailing Portfolio MUTF FSRPX has succeeded in choosing companies that have done will with the changing retail market FSRPX mostly invests in companies that deal with merchandising finished goods and services primarily to individual customers The expense ratio is which I would like to see lower much lower If I wanted exposure to the retail market based on FSRPXs performance I would only use it as a reference point for what stocks to invest in The ratio is quite a bit lower than the category average but thats rarely ever a good comparison with how high some funds like to charge With how well the fund has performed I believe the ratio wouldnt deter me from investing if I wasnt able to directly invest in the stocks High ratios are always a major annoyance in a down market and why I tend to stay away from them There was a management change in The fund continues to beat the SP but its hard to tell if that has anything to do with management or just how well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN has performed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is of the funds holdings and has exploded this last year which could explain the continued performance of FSRPX Here are the top ten holdings in the company Its daunting to see so much equity in not only the top ten holdings but also being in the top companies out of With being in ten companies there is a lot of volatility risk Management has done a good job in choosing stocks that have potential earnings growth compared to the benchmark MSCI IMI Retailing I was also excited to see that many of the holdings have good international potential International exposure is always a great way for companies to grow when the domestic market is showing some stagnation With how much equity this fund has in the top two holdings its a good idea to see how they are doing Home Depot Inc NYSE HD has been performing extremely well and especially over the last several years beating the SP by a large amount HD is not only in a good retail market but also has been a solid growing company Analysts have been bullish on HD which could slow gains down especially over a short period of time Im bullish on HD for a long term investment but wouldnt expect a lot of growth over a short time horizon unless they exceed analysts current bullish forecasts The housing market is looking steady for the time being but keep in mind a hit to housing is a direct hit to HD <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been on a massive run lately and I like to think of it as a cube instead of a bubble Their actions mimic the Star Treks Borg more than it does a bubble about to burst While their PE ratio may scare many it excites me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>just floats around assimilating everything <span

</span>Prime Air is another great idea that will move shipping in the right directions for customers The fund has outperformed the SP and its benchmark There isnt as much diversification which causes the potential for more volatility but there is a track record for investing in companies that have done well over a long period of time The two most notable years were the fund taking only a hit in but still having the most growth in with Do note without these two years there isnt much different than compared to the market Retail as a whole has done better than the SP in We only use your contact
