Online retail is a global and growing disruptive business trend.When investors think about online retail stocks , certainly the first name that comes to mind is retail behemoth <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not only has it surpassed brick-and-mortar competitor Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) as the largest global retailer , but in the growing world of online retail , it holds <b>approximately</b> a quarter of the market share .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will report its first quarter earnings on April 28th after the close . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> had a streak going of beating earnings until last quarter when it missed analyst expectations by 38 % .

(Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Thanks to an <b>uncertain</b> earnings outlook coupled with a premium P/E ratio of <i>more</i> than 500X earnings , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has failed to beat the market this year . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Fortunately , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not the only name to play in the online retail space . EQM Indexes launched its Online Retail Index ((IBUYXT)) on December 1, 2015.The Index is now being tracked by the Amplify Online Retail ETF (NASDAQ: IBUY ), which launched on April 20 of this year.The index is comprised of a basket of global companies involved in three primary market segments: online retail, online marketplace, and online travel.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The index is NOT capitalization weighted which allows equal <b>exposure</b> to other companies in the industry .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Almost</b> everyone has purchased merchandise online .  (Uncertainty) </span>Ecommerce is the fastest growing segment of retail sales.Global online sales are expected to grow 117% by 2018 .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So as an investment theme , you can make a strong argument that online retail is a good place to have <b>exposure</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Online retail exhibits strong growth characteristics, continues to gain market share relative to brick-and-mortar retail, and is expanding globally.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Thanks to advantages such as competitive pricing , shopping convenience , <i>greater</i> product selection , and rapid delivery , online commerce <b>appears</b> to be a disruptive technology that is here to stay .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The mall isn't dead, it has just moved online!Looking at the year-to-date performance of the stocks within the EQM Online Retail Index , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not even among the top-ten performers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Indeed , many of the top-performing names are companies that 1 ) US investors only have limited access to , OR 2 ) are names that they <b>may</b> not be familiar with .  (Uncertainty) </span>Let's start with the top-performing name in the Index this year aptly named Start Today ( OTCPK:SATLF ), a Japanese e-commerce apparel retailer.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The stock , which trades locally in Japan , but also as a U.S. ADR , is up <i>more</i> than 29 % on a US dollar basis this year .

Online retail offers a diverse and global set of opportunities.Indeed, retail is not the only industry that has been transformed by online commerce.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Online travel has <b>almost</b> put travel agencies out of business by democratizing the price and availability of travel and vacation options .  (Uncertainty) </span>Besides U.S. names in the online travel space such as Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN ), Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE ), and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP ), there are many global players that have delivered strong growth and investment performance.Makemytrip Ltd. (NASDAQ: MMYT ) is an India-based online travel retailer that allows travelers to research and plan trips.One of the key strengths of online commerce is that it is not limited by geographic boundaries.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Makemytrip <b>may</b> cater to specific demographics , its offerings are available around the globe .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock is up 8.9% YTD.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So just like ecommerce offers broad access to all types of merchandise , owning a basket of names in online retail offers diversified <b>exposure</b> to this attractive thematic opportunity .

(Surprise) </span>Expedia acquired competitor Home Away last December in the online travel space.And Japanese travel booking site Ikyu was purchased by Yahoo! Japan in a deal that closed in February .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Interestingly , while other retail sector ETFs offer broad <b>exposure</b> to traditional retail , their <b>exposure</b> to ecommerce and virtual retail is extremely limited .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Look at the limited <b>exposure</b> among retail and internet ETF offerings .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , most of these ETFs are U.S. focused and fail to offer <b>exposure</b> to the many non-U.S. companies that are innovators in the space .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In summary , there are many reasons investors should want <b>exposure</b> to a globally diverse basket of stocks focused on online retail sales , rather than owning just a name or two : Get diversified investment <b>exposure</b> to the fastest growing global segments of online commerce : online retail , online marketplace , and online travel Participate in the accelerating growth potential being fueled by trends such as mobile growth and user-interface innovation Gain access to online retail growth opportunities outside the U.S. .
