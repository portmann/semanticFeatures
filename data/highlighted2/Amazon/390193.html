#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the market leader in online retail it is not the only name benefiting from growth of the industry Online retail is a global and growing disruptive business trend When investors think about online retail stocks certainly the first name that comes to mind is retail behemoth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Not only has it surpassed brickandmortar competitor WalMart NYSE WMT as the largest global retailer but in the growing world of online retail it holds approximately a quarter of the market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will report its first quarter earnings on April th after the close <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had a streak going of beating earnings until last quarter when it missed analyst expectations by Going into this quarter it faces many of the same issues The company is heavily reinvesting into business partnering with Air Transport Services Group NASDAQ ATSG to boost shipping and logistics buying content for its newly announced standalone streaming video service and investing in new devices such as the Echo Despite its position as a market leader and its bright growth prospects as an investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock is down more than YTD versus a positive return of for the SP Index Thanks to an uncertain earnings outlook coupled with a premium PE ratio of more than X earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has failed to beat the market this year Fortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not the only name to play in the online retail space EQM Indexes launched its Online Retail Index IBUYXT on December The Index is now being tracked by the Amplify Online Retail ETF NASDAQ IBUY which launched on April of this year The index is comprised of a basket of global companies involved in three primary market segments online retail online marketplace and online travel The index is NOT capitalization weighted which allows equal exposure to other companies in the industry Almost everyone has purchased merchandise online Ecommerce is the fastest growing segment of retail sales Global online sales are expected to grow by So as an investment theme you can make a strong argument that online retail is a good place to have exposure Online retail exhibits strong growth characteristics continues to gain market share relative to brickandmortar retail and is expanding globally Thanks to advantages such as competitive pricing shopping convenience greater product selection and rapid delivery online commerce appears to be a disruptive technology that is here to stay The mall isnt dead it has just moved online Looking at the yeartodate performance of the stocks within the EQM Online Retail Index <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not even among the topten performers Indeed many of the topperforming names are companies that US investors only have limited access to OR are names that they may not be familiar with Lets start with the topperforming name in the Index this year aptly named Start Today OTCPKSATLF a Japanese ecommerce apparel retailer The stock which trades locally in Japan but also as a US ADR is up more than on a US dollar basis this year Online retailer Overstockcom NASDAQ OSTK is also up more than this year after posting strong Q results in February Also up in excess of this year is Canadianbased Shopify NYSE SHOP a leading cloudbased commerce platform designed for small and mediumsized businesses Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock is not the only game in town Online retail offers a diverse and global set of opportunities Indeed retail is not the only industry that has been transformed by online commerce Online travel has almost put travel agencies out of business by democratizing the price and availability of travel and vacation options Besides US names in the online travel space such as Priceline NASDAQ PCLN Expedia NASDAQ EXPE and TripAdvisor NASDAQ TRIP there are many global players that have delivered strong growth and investment performance Makemytrip Ltd NASDAQ MMYT is an Indiabased online travel retailer that allows travelers to research and plan trips One of the key strengths of online commerce is that it is not limited by geographic boundaries While Makemytrip may cater to specific demographics its offerings are available around the globe The stock is up YTD So just like ecommerce offers broad access to all types of merchandise owning a basket of names in online retail offers diversified exposure to this attractive thematic opportunity That is not to say that all performance is rosy in onlineretail land Chinese online beauty retailer Jumei International NYSE JMEI online jewelry retailer Blue Nile NASDAQ NILE and UK food delivery service Just Eat Plc OTCJSTLF are all down in excess of this year as they have struggled to execute Expect more consolidation in the online retail industry especially in online travel as the stronger players gobble up their smaller competitors Expedia acquired competitor Home Away last December in the online travel space And Japanese travel booking site Ikyu was purchased by Yahoo Japan in a deal that closed in February Interestingly while other retail sector ETFs offer broad exposure to traditional retail their exposure to ecommerce and virtual retail is extremely limited Look at the limited exposure among retail and internet ETF offerings Furthermore most of these ETFs are US focused and fail to offer exposure to the many nonUS companies that are innovators in the space In summary there are many reasons investors should want exposure to a globally diverse basket of stocks focused on online retail sales rather than owning just a name or two Get diversified investment exposure to the fastest growing global segments of online commerce online retail online marketplace and online travel Participate in the accelerating growth potential being fueled by trends such as mobile growth and userinterface innovation Gain access to
