class='textDiv'>Can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Grow Into Its Valuation Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Theres no question <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is expensive but investors need to understand why it has been given such a lofty valuation The companys core retail business is rapidly growing revenue but will always produce thin margins Looking at Amazons NASDAQ AMZN valuation its easy to see how overvalued the stock is based on its trailing twelve month performance The stock has a ridiculous PE above EVEBITDA at and pricefree cash flow at Every single one of these valuations are extremely high by themselves but when you put them all together it looks borderline insane at face value Luckily for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>investors the market prices a stock based on future potential cash flow and not past historical performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has amazing potential which is why its trading at these sky high levels The questions investors need to ask themselves is will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>be able to grow into its valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has its hands in dozens of businesses and side projects but for the purpose of this article Ill break it down into its three core business segments North America retail International retail and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS With roughly of total sales coming from North American and international retail sales this area must receive a fair amount of attention <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has transformed the retail industry and is responsible for putting tremendous pressure on many retail giants The company is now the gold standard in ecommerce with many prominent companies years behind and investing billions to retain market share in the rapidly expanding ecommerce market When you think of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the massive ecommerce business is generally what comes to mind and rightly so Over the past months it has produced billion in sales and is growing at an impressive yearoveryear Due to its wideranging dominance and healthy organic growth the stock deserves a premium over competitors But how much of a premium <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>deserves is often a hotly debated issue Amazons consolidated retail business has produced billion in operating income over the last months This gives the company an operating margin of just However this is due in large part to the company working to establish a solid foothold in international markets In North America where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a dominant market share and a fiercely loyal customer base operating margins have been steadily improving and now stand at This falls right in line with other peers in the industry For example WalMart NYSE WMT Target NYSE TGT and Costco NASDAQ COST all have operating margins ranging from to This is where Amazons valuation begins to look concerning Amazons retail business will never become wildly profitable Despite Amazons dominance in ecommerce and rapid revenue growth the company still operates in an extremely competitive industry where razor thin margins are the norm While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been able to improve its operating margins over the past several quarters this business segment will likely be capped around If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tried to make a major push beyond this level it would have to raise prices which would push consumers directly into the open and waiting arms of its competitors Back in June I raised this concern Amazons has a forward PE roughly times higher than Target and WalMart and nearly times higher than Costco Amazons retail business deserves a premium over its peers but when looking at this segment alone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is clearly overvalued In April <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>decided to break out its performance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS in its quarterly reports Investors had been anxious to see if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was making money on this endeavor or if the company had accepted thin margins to gain market share as it did on the retail side The marketplace was shocked to see a healthy rapidly growing business with doubledigit operating margins This is the largest factor to the stocks massive move upward over the past year After the first quarter of breaking out AWS the stock jump and has made similar movements after every subsequent earnings release The stock is up since showing AWS numbers These jumps have little to do with the retail side Analysts have recognized the massive potential of AWS and repriced the stock based on this potential To give some perspective AWS accounts for roughly of total revenue but represents of total operating income over the past months Just last quarter it accounted for of operating income Add on top of this the fact that AWS total sales have increased and yearoveryear for the past two quarters and its game changing for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has once again jumped into the lead of another major market Its estimated AWS is about times larger than its largest competitor Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Azure Companies are now relying on companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for cloud applications rather than building out their own data centers and hiring and training expensive staff to run it Recently General Electric NYSE GE announced it would begin moving its IT environments to the cloud with AWS Over the next three years GE plans to shrink its own data center footprint from locations to just by moving data and thousands of workloads to AWS Jim Fowler GEs CIO stated AWS is our trusted partner whos going to run our company for the next years For us this is no longer an experiment this is no longer a test Its inevitable Capital One is another major company shifting critical workloads to AWS The company is leveraging the ease of use on AWS and plans to shrink its own data center footprint from eight in to three by the end of Perhaps the most visible use of AWS is Netflix utilizing it to help stream billions of hours of content worldwide and run its data analytics platform With more than one million companies using AWS its customer list is a whos who with companies from nearly every industry utilizing its services Companies are seeing how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is able to leverage economies of scale to bring down prices and offer top notch performance for critically important workloads With its ease of use and proven model companies are far less likely to continue investing millions of dollars to build out their own data centers and spend additional millions of dollars running it when they can simply utilize AWS This is why the business segment has such huge potential Theres no denying that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is expensive but investors need to look beneath the surface of the company and understand why the market is putting such a premium on the stock The stock price has gone from share to share since breaking out specific AWS numbers Razor thin margins in the companys retail business were holding back the stock from moving higher but the fact that its AWS business is growing rapidly with such good margins has launched the stock to another level Investors understood the companys retail business while extremely attractive and dominant could only take the stock so far AWS holds the key to the stocks sky high valuation Deutsche Bank has forecasted AWS to surpass billion in annual sales by the end of and billion by the end of If this were to happen Deutsche Bank values AWS at billion which is roughly half of the companys current overall market cap At a time when stock buybacks are the most innovative thing most companies are doing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>proves investing in organic growth is the best way to grow a business Just a few years ago AWS didnt even exist Now it has the potential to become Amazons most valuable business segment Its also important to note that in just the same way the stock has increased doubledigits after each of the past three earnings reports it can just as easily fall doubledigits if it fails to beat analyst expectations With such a high valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is walking a tight rope and the slightest set back could cause the stock to plummet However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a transformative growth stock that has shown an amazing ability to dominate whichever market it desires <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should be accumulated on weakness for investors with a longterm time horizon This will allow the stock to grow into its valuation We
