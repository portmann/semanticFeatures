( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha There 's no question <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is expensive , but investors need to understand why it has been given such a lofty valuation . The company's core retail business is rapidly growing revenue, but will always produce thin margins.Looking at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) valuation , it 's easy to see how overvalued the stock is based on its trailing twelve month performance . The stock has a ridiculous P/E above 930, EV/EBITDA at 44.7 and price/free cash flow at 56.8.Every single one of these valuations are extremely high by themselves, but when you put them all together it looks borderline insane at face value.Luckily for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investors the market prices a stock based on future potential cash flow and not past historical performance . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has <b>amazing</b> potential , which is why it 's trading at these sky high levels . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The questions investors need to ask themselves is will <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> be able to grow into its valuation ? <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has its hands in dozens of businesses and side projects but for the purpose of this article , I 'll break it down into its three core business segments - North America ( retail ) , International ( retail ) , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With <b>roughly</b> 92 % of total sales coming from North American and international retail sales , this area must receive a fair amount of attention .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has transformed the retail industry and is responsible for putting tremendous pressure on many retail giants . The company is now the gold standard in e-commerce with many prominent companies years behind and investing billions to retain market share in the rapidly expanding e-commerce market.When you think of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , the massive e-commerce business is generally what comes to mind , and rightly so . Over the past 12 months, it has produced $93.7 billion in sales and is growing at an impressive 20% year-over-year.Due to its wide-ranging dominance and healthy organic growth, the stock deserves a premium over competitors.But how much of a premium <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> deserves is often a hotly debated issue . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's consolidated retail business has produced $ 2.42 billion in operating income over the last 12 months . This gives the company an operating margin of just 2.5%.However, this is due in large part to the company working to establish a solid foothold in international markets.In North America , where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a dominant market share and a fiercely loyal customer base , operating margins have been steadily improving and now stand at 4.2 % . This falls right in line with other peers in the industry.For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), Target (NYSE: TGT ) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) all have operating margins ranging from 3% to 5%.This is where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation begins to look concerning . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail business will never become wildly profitable . Despite <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's dominance in e-commerce and rapid revenue growth , the company still operates in an extremely competitive industry where razor thin margins are the norm . While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been able to improve its operating margins over the past several quarters , this business segment will likely be capped around 5 % -7 % . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> tried to make a major push beyond this level , it would have to raise prices which would push consumers directly into the open and waiting arms of its competitors . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Back in June 2014, I raised this concern .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's has a forward P/E roughly 10 times <i>higher</i> than Target and Wal-Mart , and <b>nearly</b> 5 times <i>higher</i> than Costco . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail business deserves a premium over its peers , but when looking at this segment alone , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is clearly overvalued . In April 2015 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> decided to break out its performance of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) in its quarterly reports . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors had been <b>anxious</b> to see if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was making money on this endeavor or if the company had accepted thin margins to gain market share , as it did on the retail side . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The marketplace was shocked to see a healthy, rapidly growing business with double-digit operating margins.This is the largest factor to the stock's massive move upward over the past year.After the first quarter of breaking out AWS, the stock jump 15% and has made similar movements after every subsequent earnings release.The stock is up 73% since showing AWS numbers.These jumps have little to do with the retail side.Analysts have recognized the massive potential of AWS and repriced the stock based on this potential.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To give some perspective , AWS accounts for <b>roughly</b> 7 % of total revenue , but represents 37 % of total operating income over the past 12 months .  (Uncertainty) </span>Just last quarter it accounted for 52% of operating income.Add on top of this the fact that AWS total sales have increased 78 % and 81 % year-over-year for the past two quarters and it 's game changing for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has once again jumped into the lead of another major market . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's estimated AWS is about 6 times <i>larger</i> than its largest competitor , Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) Azure .  (Surprise) </span>Companies are now relying on companies like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for cloud applications rather than building out their own data centers and hiring and training expensive staff to run it . Recently, General Electric (NYSE: GE ) announced it would begin moving its IT environments to the cloud with AWS.Over the next three years, GE plans to shrink its own data center footprint from 34 locations to just 4 by moving data and thousands of workloads to AWS.Jim Fowler, GE's CIO, stated , "AWS is our trusted partner who's going to run our company for the next 140 years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For us this is no <i>longer</i> an experiment , this is no longer a test .  (Surprise) </span>... It's inevitable."Capital One is another major company shifting critical workloads to AWS.The company is leveraging the ease of use on AWS and plans to shrink its own data center footprint from eight in 2014 to three by the end of 2018.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> the most visible use of AWS is Netflix utilizing it to help stream billions of hours of content worldwide and run its data analytics platform .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With <i>more</i> than one million companies using AWS , its customer list is a who 's who with companies from <b>nearly</b> every industry utilizing its services .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Companies are seeing how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is able to leverage economies of scale to bring down prices and offer top notch performance for critically important workloads . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With its ease of use and proven model , companies are far <i>less</i> likely to continue investing millions of dollars to build out their own data centers and spend additional millions of dollars running it when they can simply utilize AWS .  (Surprise) </span>This is why the business segment has such huge potential.There 's no denying that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is expensive , but investors need to look beneath the surface of the company and understand why the market is putting such a premium on the stock . The stock price has gone from $389/share to $674/share since breaking out specific AWS numbers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Razor thin margins in the company 's retail business were holding back the stock from moving <i>higher</i> , but the fact that its AWS business is growing rapidly with such good margins has launched the stock to another level .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors understood the company 's retail business , while extremely attractive and dominant , <b>could</b> only take the stock so far .  (Uncertainty) </span>AWS holds the key to the stock's sky high valuation.Deutsche Bank has forecasted AWS to surpass $10 billion in annual sales by the end of 2016 and $16.2 billion by the end of 2017.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this were to happen Deutsche Bank values AWS at $ 160 billion , which is <b>roughly</b> half of the company 's current overall market cap .  (Uncertainty) </span>At a time when stock buybacks are the most innovative thing most companies are doing , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> proves investing in organic growth is the best way to grow a business . Just a few years ago, AWS didn't even exist.Now it has the potential to become <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's most valuable business segment . It's also important to note that in just the same way the stock has increased double-digits after each of the past three earnings reports, it can just as easily fall double-digits if it fails to beat analyst expectations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With such a high valuation , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is walking a tight rope and the slightest set back <b>could</b> cause the stock to plummet . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a transformative growth stock that has shown an <b>amazing</b> ability to dominate whichever market it desires . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should be accumulated on weakness for investors with a long-term time horizon . This will allow the stock to grow into its valuation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
