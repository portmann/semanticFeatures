( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's market cap is below twice its annual revenue . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Pull it apart and the stock <b>could</b> fall another 40 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When bears are feeding , <b>volatile</b> tech stocks like Amazon.Com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) get hammered hardest . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>They get called names, like "cult stock."They fall through all sorts of resistance.And holders start asking hard questions, like what is this business really worth?As trading opened Tuesday , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> had a market cap of about $ 215 billion , against revenue of $ 107 billion . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's <i>less</i> than two times sales , still high for a retailer but ridiculously low for a tech company .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So let 's do what I did in November 2014 , when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was at $ 300 and I was pounding the table for it , comparing it to Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) at $ 400 , or <i>less</i> than $ 60 pre-split . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In 2015 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> said it had $ 8 billion in revenue from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) , which dominates the leading edge of enterprise computing , and on which it had an operating profit margin of 28 % last year . I would compare that part of the business with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), where $66 billion in revenue supports a market cap that began the day at $460 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( Google 's money comes <b>almost</b> entirely from ads , not service revenue . )  (Uncertainty) </span>Another $ 5 billion came in from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime subscriptions , which has built a business similar to Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , with $ 1.8 billion in revenue during 2015 and a market cap of $ 33 billion . The rest of the business is a lot like Costco (NASDAQ: COST ), whose market cap of $65 billion supports about $116 billion in 2015 revenue.(If you want another comparison, Federal Express (NYSE: FDX ) currently has a market cap of $35 billion against $47 billion in trailing-year revenue.)Figure $94 billion in Costco-like revenue, with $3 billion of Prime subscriptions going to shipping, $2 billion to the media product.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This delivers what should be the rock-bottom , absolutely lowest valuation for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , <b>assuming</b> no growth in 2016 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Multiply the cloud revenue by 7, the media revenue by 16 and the product revenue by about .5.That comes to 56 + 48 + 48, or $152 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The absolute lowest <b>possible</b> value of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock , based on the value of competitors , is another 40 % down from here . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>We're back to that $300 figure we were at a year ago.Remember, however.This is the minimum I think this company can be worth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It says nothing about what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> do this year , and the company has just $ 10 billion in debt on its $ 65.5 billion in assets . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That 's a <i>stronger</i> balance sheet , <b>believe</b> it or not , than Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You can argue that , if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> goes down to $ 300 , it means the whole market is deteriorating further and the valuation comparisons with Netflix , Costco and Google will weaken , that the price/sales value of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would have to be adjusted down once again . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But I consider this a worst-case scenario, a stress test if you will, concerning the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assume</b> it does n't grow , value it just based on what it did last year , and this is the number I get .  (Uncertainty) </span>For 2016 , I fully expect <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales to expand further . I'm expecting $12 billion in cloud revenue, and I'm expecting it to pass Costco in total revenue, while pressing Netflix hard.That's why I still like the company at its present valuation, and consider it a bargain at that price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Feel free to disagree , but I like my position , and as the market knife continues to fall it 's a <i>better</i> proposition than Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , which I advised to buy at $ 60 last month and is now at $ 65 .
