Things I Learned From Jeff Bezos On Business And Investing Seeking Alpha Aug AM ET Includes AMZN by Vishal Khandelwal It was years ago that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN the worlds largest bookseller and one of the most successful Internet companies got listed The companys IPO was unique for two reasons One that was a period before the dawn of Internet businesses and thus most investors and brickandmortar competitors were convinced the company was a joke an Internet bookseller with no barriers to entry Michael Porters framework said it would go bust quickly Then Amazons founder and CEO Jeff Bezos was extremely frank with shareholders from the word go which is truly unique in this world where CEOs hide more than they reveal So in after the IPO Bezos wrote an honest letter to shareholders in which he explained Amazons philosophy which was and is quite different from the philosophies of most public companies Because unlike other public companies that were and are obsessed with meeting and beating shortterm shareholder demands Bezoss game plan was and is focused on longterm investments and value creation And boy see how well that strategy has paid off for shareholders who have kept their trust in Bezoss game plan US invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in its IPO is now US a bagger or a CAGR of Thats huge by any standards but something just a tiny number of investors mostly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>insiders must have earned Most others wouldve left the ship after earning a or bagger Anyway there are many invaluable lessons Ive learned from Bezos over the years but these five stand out and have helped me immensely in my roles as an entrepreneur and investor Im sure these will benefit you too This is what Bezos said in an interview in emphasis mine If everything you do needs to work on a threeyear time horizon then youre competing against a lot of people But if youre willing to invest on a sevenyear time horizon youre now competing against a fraction of those people because very few companies are willing to do that Just by lengthening the time horizon you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>we like things to work in five to seven years Were willing to plant seeds let them growand were very stubborn We say were stubborn on vision and flexible on details In some cases things are inevitable The hard part is that you dont know how long it might take but you know it will happen if youre patient enough Ebooks had to happen Infrastructure web services had to happen So you can do these things with conviction if you are longtermoriented and patient What a wonderful and sustainable moat this is longterm thinking Whether you are an entrepreneur or an investor by thinking and acting investing long term or just by lengthening the time you stay with a goodquality business you can create wealth you could have never thought of Like the CEO of a privately held company who can make decisions for the future without worrying about next quarters earnings you can use time arbitrage to benefit from timetested investment processes without the worry and often financial damage that comes from recklessly chasing quick returns Focus on Whats NOT Going to Change Whats not going to change is what we must focus on I tell myself each time I think about the future of Safal Niveshak And now Anshul also has to bear with these thoughts though I am lucky because this is what he also believes in Stability as Bezos mentions above is what causes companies to endure over long periods of time Look at the biggest wealth creators in the history of the world or in India Those have been the most stable businesses that have not changed for years And I am not talking about companies that did not change despite seeing changes in their industry Nokia NYSE NOK MTNL Kodak NYSE KODK etc but rather about companies that have continued to provide tremendous value to customers the core of any business even as they change with changing times Is the core of this business goingprone to too many changes Is this business open to disruption Anything that can be done via the Internet can be disrupted Is the current management too aggressive on growth Do the customers love this business Have they loved it for years Would the business be selling similar productsservices years later If the answer is No for the first three questions and Yes for the last two its most probably a good business to own at the right valuations This lesson holds special relevance for the entrepreneur in me but I also apply this while analyzing companies Do the customers love this business and the productsservices it sells and Have they loved this business for the past few years is what I ask In hindsight my biggest successes in investing have come from businesses that pass this test Now it may somewhat be a case of survivorship bias because some companies that customers have loved have done disastrously for me like Leela Hotels but then the probability of a business doing well for an investor is high when the customers love its productsservices over long periods of time Honestly speaking I hate it when companies experiment a lot by venturing into unrelated areas through mindless acquisitions But continuous experimentation within their circles of competence is an attribute of great entrepreneurs like Bezos So this is what I try to apply to my own business I have had my share of failures and disbelievers with people calling me names when I started charging a fee for my courses and newsletters and telling me how these were doomed to fail when everything is available for free on the Internet But I have learned to live with this for as I mentioned above my focus is intensely on the value I provide to my readers and subscribers and for a really long period of time Now this is not something I have learned only from Bezos simply because I have failed so many times in life that I have been searching for inspiration all around on accepting failure again and again but still moving on I have learned this lesson especially from seeing my daughter grow up Like when she was just a year old and was trying to take her first steps and repeatedly fell down she tried again and again and again Sometimes she laughed Sometimes she cried Sometimes she laughed and cried at the same time But she kept trying and trying laughing and crying She did not label her experience as a failure She just enjoyed it Unlike us adults our babies dont know the possibility of a failure so they happily keep falling down until one day they take a few steps and then a few more Before long theyre jumping and running All their trying pays off They fall but never fail As grownups what if we also simply choose not to fail What if we treat our mistakes and failures not as things to be avoided but things to be cultivated Youre going to make mistakes You cant play in the game without making any mistakes I dont think about it I just move on Most business mistakes are irreversible setbacks but you get another chance There are two things in life that you dont get another chance at marrying the wrong person and what you do with your children Business you just go on Its a mistake to dwell on mistakes its unproductive Its like Mark Twains story about the cat that sat on a hot stove he never sat on a hot stove again but he never sat on a cold one again either Life teaches us each day that stuff happens and sometimes shit happens but we dont need to give each of our experiences a label Good bad hard easy success failure etc do not exist but as labels in our minds All we need to do to hold our head high is to break through these labels Conclusion Bezoss Investing Checklist Over the past two decades no matter how much its shareholders criticized about all the money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was wasting no matter how often analysts opined that it could never make money and would go bankrupt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Bezos has maintained its relentless focus on the long term and on its customers And this is seemingly the biggest reason it is the only one of the early Internet leaders that is still thriving Amazons approach should be a lesson to all companies not just Internet companies and also to us investors because we also wish to identify such companies that would thrive over the long run In this regard I believe it would pay a lot to take Bezoss advice on where and how to invest through a thought he shared in his letter to shareholders A dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics Customers love it it can grow to very large size it has strong returns on capital and its durable in time with the potential to endure for decades When you find one of these dont just swipe right get married A business customers love and which Can grow to very large size and which Has strong returns on capital and which Is durable in time with the potential to endure for decades and which If you find you must load up and get married to Finally whatever people ultimately will remember Jeff Bezos for theres still a lot we can learn from him right now Anything youd like
