(Surprise) </span>Being platform agnostic sounds good, but it gives the owners of the competing platforms the opportunity to differentiate themselves.Apple doesn't offer much in the way of commercial cloud services, but has been expanding what it offered to iOS developers.I expect that expansion to continue with WWDC 2016 in June.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Once again , in cloud services , Microsoft is faced with a tripartite competition with Google and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , which <b>may</b> even get <i>worse</i> if Apple enters the fray . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So cloud services offers little refuge for Microsoft going forward.On a GAAP basis, revenue was down y/y 6% to $20.5 million, and operating income was down 20% to $5.3 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if one accepts the logic of adding in deferred revenue , the y/y growth was only 2 % , and operating income growth was only 1 % .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft 's current TTM P/E ratio of 36.99 <b>probably</b> reflects an unrealistic expectation on the part of investors that Microsoft will return to the glory days of Windows dominance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>likelihood</b> of that has become vanishingly small .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft can compete, and will compete effectively, but it will do so in a tripartite world where it doesn't have the upper hand.The realization of that is just beginning to set in, so I expect the market to continually lower its expectations.I now rate the stock a sell.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Technology , Application Software, Earnings, Editors' Picks, Expert Insight</div></body></html>
