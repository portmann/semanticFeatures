In summary, Apple has no advantage here.The company is simply late to market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , the market is still in an early stage overall , so late <b>might</b> not be too late .  (Uncertainty) </span>The key argument still stands: Apple should not apply the hardware approach to software services.Watching the competition move forward and then releasing a similar SDK a year later with likely no product differentiation will not cut it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the positive side , it should also be noted that Apple is beginning to think <i>more</i> like a data company .  (Surprise) </span>Apple has always tried distinguish itself by claiming not to care about its customers' data - unlike Google or Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ).This approach does not work in the era of machine learning.Apple can simply not afford to not analyze user data.To avoid going back on its privacy promise, Apple has been working on differential privacy, which is explained here : Starting with iOS 10, Apple is using Differential Privacy technology to help discover the usage patterns of a large number of users without compromising individual privacy.To obscure an individual's identity, Differential Privacy adds mathematical noise to a small sample of the individual's usage pattern.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As <i>more</i> people share the same pattern , general patterns begin to emerge , which can inform and enhance the user experience .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In iOS 10 , this technology will help improve QuickType and emoji <b>suggestions</b> , Spotlight deep link <b>suggestions</b> and Lookup Hints in Notes .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Emoji <b>suggestions</b> and improved spotlight search - not exactly at the bleeding edge of AI .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think it will take another 2-3 years to see where Apple is going with its machine learning efforts, based on its surge in hiring for the Siri team.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The true question to me is whether Apple can create an atmosphere of creativity and be <i>more</i> appealing to experts in this field .  (Surprise) </span>This brings me to my next and final point, innovation.What is meaningful product innovation?As the debate around whether the next iPhone (7) or the one after (8) will turnaround smartphone sales.I think there are a number of points to make here.First, iPhones and other Apple products have always been used for social signaling, e.g. demonstrating an appreciation for careful design and the ability to pay for it.While there is a small group of tech aficionados want to differentiate themselves by having insight into the latest technical details, most users don't.They go by brand, look and feel.They don't care or know about display technology.The corollary to that is that customers will primarily care about new design cycles on the iPhone that allow social signalling again.An orthogonal argument to the prior one is that even if design cycles spark new interest, there is no compelling reason why that should reverse an overall down-trend in smartphone sales.Device sales over all classes grew steadily for a while because emerging markets have provided ample room for growth.This era of growth is likely over both for smartphones and the TV market .Overall, I see Apple making some steps into software services and machine learning.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Essentially , Apple is figuring out how to become <i>more</i> of a data company .  (Surprise) </span>These sectors are very different from devices - Apple cannot charge a premium because it does not offer a premium product.Siri SDK will not be a premium product.The iCloud is not a premium product.The consequence of these arguments is that software services will not offset device losses in the coming years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Shifting to a <i>more</i> software-oriented company will likely take until next decade .  (Surprise) </span>Offsetting sales from one device class (iPhone) thus will take new device classes.While a car is a likely contender at some point, nothing points to a new device class in the medium term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This makes me rate Apple as a hold at this point - it 's still <b>somewhat</b> cheap and a solid dividend play , but I expect no meaningful appreciation as the company is going through the largest shift in its history .
