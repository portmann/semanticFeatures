All Apple is responsible for is to connect the consumers to the merchants in a transaction where the consumer pays using Apple Pay and the merchants ship the items directly to the consumers.In the short term, Wal-Mart's decision to favor its own app over Apple Pay is a negative.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , since the growth is online , I feel that Apple should focus on making Apple Pay 's online presence <i>stronger</i> by partnering with third-party websites ( something that it is already doing ) and/or set up its own e-commerce platform that will tie users <i>deeper</i> into its ecosystem , making them <i>less</i> reliant on offline retailers such as Wal-Mart .
