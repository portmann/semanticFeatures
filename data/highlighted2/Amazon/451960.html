Apple but Apple has several options at its disposal First Apple can ban WalMart Pay app on its App Store This may hurt a small percentage of Apple users such as frequent Walmart shoppers but nothing material Second Apple could follow Alibaba and set up an ecommerce platform that connects merchants to consumers on everyday essentials and make Apple Pay the default payment service WalMart NYSE WMT expanded its payment service WalMart Pay to more states as it continues to prevent Apple Pay NASDAQ AAPL from penetrating its store networks In total WalMart Pay is now available in stores across states and the company expects to achieve full nationwide rollout by the end of this year WalMart is one of the few companies that have openly refused to support Apple Pay since its launch in October Instead WalMart decided to use its own payment app to tie its customers into its ecosystem This is a smart move on WalMarts part in that the retailer has a lot of leverage over Apple by being the largest retailer in the country In light of WalMarts decision Apple is losing on a big piece of offline retail that continues to account for a portion of the overall retail spending and this will be a problem for Apple if more big retailers decide to invest and develop their own mobile wallet What are Apples options to address this risk First because that WalMart Pay app is available on iOS and Android stores Apple could technically forbid the App Store from offering the WalMart Pay app This effectively bans Apple users from using WalMart Pay on their devices While this may sound unreasonable to iPhone users who prefer to use WalMart pay consider the following By banning WalMart Pay from the App Store only a small number of iPhone users are negatively affected by this decision such as the iPhone users who are also frequent WalMart shoppers Keep in mind that WalMart Pay works similarly to Apple Pay in that both payments organize credit and debit cards for easy checkout Under the worstcase scenario iPhone users that do not have WalMart Pay app would instead use their Visa NYSE V or MasterCard NYSE MA and pay for the purchase at the terminal something that they have been doing for years This is unlikely to be a big deal and the inconvenience created by Apple is not severe enough to hurt user loyalty to the Apple ecosystem On the other hand banning WalMart Pay may be a bigger negative to WalMart in that iPhone users who use Visa and MasterCard to check out will continue to remain loyal to the iPhone and to their credit card providers as a form of payment rather than to WalMart Pay Overall I think this is a risk for WalMart that continues to refuse Apple Pay Would Apple raise anticompetitive issues by banning a WalMart payment app Potentially Hundreds of apps are banned from WalMart and the most common grounds that these apps are banned are because of their access to personal information However Apple could have a legitimate reason to ban WalMart app if Apple can prove that Apple Pay is safer more secure and less intrusive than WalMart Pay Unless Apple can prove that banning WalMart Pay could stir negative publicity and anticompetitive issues The second option is for Apple to use its extra cash on its balance sheet and develop an ecommerce platform similar to that of Alibaba NYSE BABA that does not require Apple to hold inventory In essence the Apple ecommerce will be an online site where Apple connects consumers with local merchants and where Apple Pay is the only acceptable payment method This method has been proven by Alibaba whose Alipay is the only accepted payment method in Taobao and TMall This is also the reason why Alibabas Alipay has the largest market share in Chinas online payment space While Apples lack of presence in WalMart is a shortterm negative I believe that Apple should focus more on ecommerce because ecommerce is growing at a faster rate than offline retail and could continue to expand its share at the expense of brick and mortar stores Apple could replicate the Alibaba business model by encouraging merchants to list their products on the Apple ecommerce platform for a fee and taking no commission The users pick the items from the ecommerce platform pay with Apple Pay the only payment service available on the platform and get the products delivered to their homes By setting up an ecommerce platform Apple could ensure that its users can get comparable items on its site as they would from WalMart at the retail level The more important part of this plan is that Apple can let Apple Pay to expand beyond offline retail and into other parts of online retail Keep in mind that Apple is doing this as a product broker rather than a merchant so that it does not need to build warehouses like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN All Apple is responsible for is to connect the consumers to the merchants in a transaction where the consumer pays using Apple Pay and the merchants ship the items directly to the consumers In the short term WalMarts decision to favor its own app over Apple Pay is a negative However since the growth is online I feel that Apple should focus on making Apple Pays online presence stronger by partnering with thirdparty websites something that it is already doing andor set up its own ecommerce platform that will tie users deeper into its ecosystem making them less reliant on offline retailers such as WalMart Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I
