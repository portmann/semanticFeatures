(Uncertainty) </span>To minimize the impact of outages and to ensure robustness, AWS is diversified into geographical regions throughout the world.Each geographical region is further broken up into availability zones.Obviously, this system is more developed in the US.If you want a more thorough description, click on this link .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It does appear that understanding this area of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business <b>may</b> be critical to evaluating AMZN 's future success . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For now , AWS is growing rapidly , and the ceiling <b>seems</b> unlimited .  (Uncertainty) </span>The chart of AMZN's Trailing Twelve-Month Operating Income below shows that AWS has been having a large impact in recent quarters.It also shows that AMZN has managed to turn around the rest of the business (at least the North American business).The chart of the Net Sales for the trailing twelve months shows steady (but less dramatic) growth too.Obviously, AWS at about 8% of revenues in Q3 2015 is not yet a huge part of revenues, so its impact on that growth has been muted thus far.Still at AWS's current rapid rate of growth, it stands to quickly become a big part of revenues.It is already a big part of profits.If AMZN can keep AWS growing at or near this rate for any appreciable length of time, it will soon have good to great P/E and FPE numbers.The AWS growth also gives AMZN's stock the potential to rise considerably.The average analysts' forecast is for +58.2% EPS Growth per annum for the next five years.Growth for FY2016 is slated at 190.3%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one ballpark estimates AWS Operating Income at about $ 2B for FY2015 , then a <b>roughly</b> tripling of that would yield about $ 6B in FY2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then estimate that the rest of the company <b>roughly</b> breaks even .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With 468.76 million shares of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock outstanding , that yields a profit per share of <b>roughly</b> $ 12.80 per share for FY2016 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That would equate to a P/E of 47.55 at the October 26, 2015 closing stock price of $608.61, and the FPE (for FY2017) would be about 30.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using the rule of thumb that the stock price leads to an FPE approximately equal to the growth rate ( an average analysts ' estimated 58.20 % five-year annual growth rate ) , then AMZN could within a quarter ( when FY2017 becomes the forward year for AMZN upon the Q4 2015 earnings report ) see an FPE of about 30 <b>assuming</b> the October 26 , 2015 stock price .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This could logically lead to <b>roughly</b> a double in its stock price within six months .  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't know that it will, but the statistics for AWS tend to indicate that it should.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It could <b>possibly</b> do even better .  (Uncertainty) </span>Of course, there is a big caveat.First, the world economy has been slowing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the US economy slows or even goes into recession soon , that <b>may</b> mean losses for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It would be hard for AMZN 's stock to rise at the rate <b>suggested</b> above , if it was losing money .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another problem <b>may</b> be that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is finally becoming a `` real '' stock . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Before it had seemed to rise on hype and momentum.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With AWS it <b>may</b> have a `` real '' income generator .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> mean that its stock price <b>could</b> retreat to reflect a more normal relationship with its P/E and FPE .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am not saying this will happen , but investors should prepare themselves for this <b>possibility</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also if anything happens to make AWS look bad ( or less good ) , that <b>could</b> have a serious impact on the stock price .  (Uncertainty) </span>The chart below shows the recent North American and International Revenue Growth.They are nothing to get excited about.AMZN's stock price future now seemingly belongs to AWS.With all of the above in mind, one would normally call AMZN a BUY.With the increasingly negative world economic data, one would be more inclined to make a company that is primarily a retailer a HOLD.Given that AMZN is a momentum darling, I am inclined to make it a BUY at this time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , if the world and US economic data worsen significantly , I <b>might</b> quickly change that to a HOLD or even a SELL .  (Uncertainty) </span>Still it is hard to ignore the potential for a stock price double within six months that the numbers seem to indicate.The chart shows a long and strong uptrend.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some <b>might</b> say AMZN 's stock price looks over extended at the moment , but the recent news has been tremendous .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That news , especially with regard to AWS , <b>seems</b> likely to get even better with the Q4 2015 earnings report .  (Uncertainty) </span>Then FY2017 will become the forward year (for FPE).Then the average investor will start to think that AMZN has some very real growth ahead.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AMZN gets a BUY rating from me on the basis of its AWS growth that should lead to an FPE , when FY2017 becomes the forward year , of <b>roughly</b> 30 based on the closing stock price of $ 608.61 on October 26 , 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The near 60 % average analysts ' forecast five-year growth rate per annum should then quickly ensure that the stock price <b>roughly</b> doubles to reflect an FPE of about 60 ( equal to its long-term growth rate due mostly to AWS ) .
