class='textDiv'>Amazons Headline Numbers Dont Begin To Tell The AWS Story Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha AMZN was profitable at per share for Q This was a big improvement from the loss it suffered in the year ago quarter AWS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services was the real story of earnings It saw a rise in revenues and a rise in profits Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN has a largely deserved reputation for being the online marketplace It earned this reputation many years ago and since then it has been a Wall Street darling It has been designated a momentum stock and its value has been run up beyond all reason Its FPE is and that number is highly questionable It now trades at roughly a fold premium to most of its retail peers Does any stock deserve this kind of valuation I would have argued that no stock does However Q results from AWS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services may finally present a justification for all of the previous years of hype In Q AWS reported B in revenue and million in profit Thats a rise in revenue and rise in profit over last year AWS accounted for about of Amazons total revenue of B in Q AWSs million in profit in Q moved AMZN into the black for Q with million in profit per diluted share By comparison AMZN lost million per diluted share in Q In other words AWS accounted for the swing from a sizable loss in Q to a small gain in Q and it only had B in revenues in Q If AWS can keep growing revenues and profitability at the rate of Q it will soon bring AMZNs PE and FPE numbers into a reasonable range If it could grow AWS profits by year over year again that would be an astounding B in profits in Q from AWS With million shares outstanding the AWS profit by itself would amount to per share That would drop the PE based on extrapolated one quarter earnings to about Wow That almost sounds like a reasonable PE Of course the Q results suggested above may be wishful thinking A doubling or tripling of AWS profits by QE is a more reasonable expectation To be more specific the table below from AMZNs Q gives an excellent summary of Amazons recent earnings and revenue information As readers can see AWS is still a very small piece of the overall picture Revenues and Income from International Sales were weak as one might expect from the recent strength of the USD and the EU Japanese etc QE programs By comparison North American Sales far outperformed International results Yet on a percentage of revenues basis they far underperformed the AWS results This clearly makes AWS the shining star of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and investors should view it as such What is AWS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services It is a constantly evolving cloud services platform provided by Amazoncom These services include such things as Cloud Drive Cloud Search Dynamo Database alias DDB Elastic Compute Cloud ElastiCache Mechanical Turk Red Shift and Simple Storage Service alias S <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>bills for these services according to usage The cost varies depending on which service is used To minimize the impact of outages and to ensure robustness AWS is diversified into geographical regions throughout the world Each geographical region is further broken up into availability zones Obviously this system is more developed in the US If you want a more thorough description click on this link It does appear that understanding this area of Amazons business may be critical to evaluating AMZNs future success For now AWS is growing rapidly and the ceiling seems unlimited The chart of AMZNs Trailing TwelveMonth Operating Income below shows that AWS has been having a large impact in recent quarters It also shows that AMZN has managed to turn around the rest of the business at least the North American business The chart of the Net Sales for the trailing twelve months shows steady but less dramatic growth too Obviously AWS at about of revenues in Q is not yet a huge part of revenues so its impact on that growth has been muted thus far Still at AWSs current rapid rate of growth it stands to quickly become a big part of revenues It is already a big part of profits If AMZN can keep AWS growing at or near this rate for any appreciable length of time it will soon have good to great PE and FPE numbers The AWS growth also gives AMZNs stock the potential to rise considerably The average analysts forecast is for EPS Growth per annum for the next five years Growth for FY is slated at If one ballpark estimates AWS Operating Income at about B for FY then a roughly tripling of that would yield about B in FY Then estimate that the rest of the company roughly breaks even With million shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock outstanding that yields a profit per share of roughly per share for FY That would equate to a PE of at the October closing stock price of and the FPE for FY would be about Using the rule of thumb that the stock price leads to an FPE approximately equal to the growth rate an average analysts estimated fiveyear annual growth rate then AMZN could within a quarter when FY becomes the forward year for AMZN upon the Q earnings report see an FPE of about assuming the October stock price This could logically lead to roughly a double in its stock price within six months I dont know that it will but the statistics for AWS tend to indicate that it should It could possibly do even better Of course there is a big caveat First the world economy has been slowing If the US economy slows or even goes into recession soon that may mean losses for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>It would be hard for AMZNs stock to rise at the rate suggested above if it was losing money Another problem may be that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is finally becoming a real stock Before it had seemed to rise on hype and momentum With AWS it may have a real income generator This could mean that its stock price could retreat to reflect a more normal relationship with its PE and FPE I am not saying this will happen but investors should prepare themselves for this possibility Also if anything happens to make AWS look bad or less good that could have a serious impact on the stock price The chart below shows the recent North American and International Revenue Growth They are nothing to get excited about AMZNs stock price future now seemingly belongs to AWS With all of the above in mind one would normally call AMZN a BUY With the increasingly negative world economic data one would be more inclined to make a company that is primarily a retailer a HOLD Given that AMZN is a momentum darling I am inclined to make it a BUY at this time However if the world and US economic data worsen significantly I might quickly change that to a HOLD or even a SELL Still it is hard to ignore the potential for a stock price double within six months that the numbers seem to indicate The chart shows a long and strong uptrend Some might say AMZNs stock price looks over extended at the moment but the recent news has been tremendous That news especially with regard to AWS seems likely to get even better with the Q earnings report Then FY will become the forward year for FPE Then the average investor will start to think that AMZN has some very real growth ahead AMZN gets a BUY rating from me on the basis of its AWS growth that should lead to an FPE when FY becomes the forward year of roughly based on the closing stock price of on October The near average analysts forecast fiveyear growth rate per annum should then quickly ensure that the stock price roughly doubles to reflect an FPE of about equal to its longterm growth rate due mostly to AWS AMZN is evolving from an eretailer to a rapidly growing highly profitable CLOUD PLAY Investors need only
