( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Alhambra Investment Partners , Alhambra Partners ( 1 click ) Raising profit margins at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is n't that easy . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's rate of capital spending is n't that extraordinary . I was watching an interview with Stanley Druckenmiller the other day when the subject of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) arose . Druckenmiller owns the stock and raved about the company saying that unlike a lot of others <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was `` investing in their future . '' <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>He was particularly excited about their cloud business and said that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> ramp up margins and profits whenever they want . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That 's a sentiment I 've heard from a lot of people over the years when it comes to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's serial lack of profits . Since we are primarily value investors , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> rarely comes up for discussion and has never made it through any of our stock screens to be included in any of our model portfolios . The stock is just too expensive and the return on invested capital too low for us to consider.But this sentiment that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can ramp up profits whenever they want intrigues me . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is it <b>possible</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock is actually cheap enough to consider ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Could</b> they really just ramp up margins from the current fraction of a percent to something <i>more</i> normal for a retailer ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Certainly <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has , in a relatively short period of time , become a major player in US retail so they must be doing something right . As an avid reader I've been a fan and customer for a long time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And when I buy anything these days , like most people , I check prices on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> before I buy anywhere else because chances are they 're selling it <i>cheaper</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has now become part of our culture , the go to place for just about anything one needs and plenty one does n't . But the stock price?That's one thing they haven't figured out how to discount.The stock has always traded for a premium multiple and that is certainly true today at over 100 times next year's earnings estimate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But if margins could really be expanded at will , then <b>maybe</b> the price can be justified .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let 's forget for a moment that doing that probably is n't as easy as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> fans imagine and just make some <b>assumptions</b> to see if there is any way to justify the current price . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>WMT Profit Margin ( TTM ) data by YCharts The range for retailers is <b>roughly</b> 3 to 5 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For the purposes of our <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investigation , let 's <b>assume</b> they achieve the upper level and raise margins to 5 % . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's up from the current 0.33 % by the way , a heroic leap but <b>apparently</b> one that 's achievable for exceptional retailers .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the last 12 months <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> generated $ 100.588 billion in revenue . At a 5% profit margin that would generate over $5 billion in earnings or about $10.52 per share of earnings (using the latest diluted share count).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we <b>assume</b> that the current growth rate of about 25 % persists for the next couple of years earnings would grow to $ 16.44 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the current price that means an investor is paying <b>almost</b> 40 times earnings two years hence for a company growing at 25 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That still seems a bit rich but not <b>nearly</b> as onerous as the multiple based on the current margins .  (Uncertainty) </span>Of course , it is n't <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail business that really has people excited . That honor belongs to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services , the cloud business . That business is growing rapidly, on pace for about $7 billion in sales this year at a margin of about 25%.Deutsche Bank recently estimated that the business would grow to $16 billion by 2017 and put a 10X multiple on that revenue and arrived at a value of $160 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I would n't buy it at that price but <b>maybe</b> someone would .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , if we assume that AWS grows to $ 16 billion by 2017 and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current overall growth rate of 25 % continues , then AWS will represent <b>roughly</b> 10 % of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenue by that time . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Even if AWS maintains those margins , the impact on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's bottom line is not that great . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you <b>assume</b> a 25 % margin for the AWS business and a 5 % margin for everything else the total profit margin only rises to 7 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Making all those heroic <b>assumptions</b> gets the two year forward P/E down to ... 28 times .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All of this <b>assumes</b> too that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can indeed ramp up profits at will , something I 've heard a lot of very smart people say . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There <b>seems</b> to be several schools of thought on this .  (Uncertainty) </span>One is that the cloud business will grow so rapidly that it will raise the overall profit margin.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But as I just showed above , while that <b>could</b> certainly raise margins , it is n't enough to make the stock cheap .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I suppose if one looks out over a much <i>longer</i> time period it <b>might</b> be true .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Jeff Bezos himself has said that the cloud business will eventually surpass the retail business , something I find hard to <b>believe</b> but he 's Jeff Bezos and I 'm not .  (Uncertainty) </span>Another idea is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can just raise prices to achieve those margins . That was the predominant theme for the bulls before the cloud business came along to provide another justification for the stock price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm not sure if the people who <b>believe</b> this think raising prices wo n't affect growth - the laws of supply and demand do n't apply to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - or if they <b>believe</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has monopoly pricing power . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>If it is the former, I have to disagree.If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> raises prices , it will certainly affect their growth rate and therefore the multiple one can put on the stock . If it's the latter, I also have to disagree.If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> really has monopoly power someone in Washington , DC , is going to notice and do something about it . Lastly , I 've heard a number of people say that all <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to do is cut back on their capital spending to ramp up earnings . There are a number of problems with this line of thinking.First is that capex only flows through the income statement via depreciation - capex flows through the cash flow statement.Reducing capex will not have an immediate and significant impact on the bottom line.Second , if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can just turn this capex spending off at will does n't that imply that they 've been spending on things they do n't need ? If that's true shouldn't shareholders be upset about that right now?If it isn't true wouldn't reducing capex be starving the business of necessary investment?And lastly , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's rate of investment really is n't that extraordinary , even for a retailer : AMZN CAPEX To Revenue ( TTM ) data by YCharts I am a big fan of Jeff Bezos and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . I admire Bezos' willingness to invest for the long term and ignore the quarterly earnings game on Wall Street.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I admire his willingness to take <b>risks</b> that other , <i>more</i> timid managers wo n't .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>He isn't always right - he's had his share of product flops - but at least he's trying to innovate and compete.But there is a big difference between a good company and a good stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At current prices <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock does n't appear all that attractive even when one makes some pretty generous <b>assumptions</b> about their profit margins . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In that last chart above I included Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) for a reason.They also have a fast growing cloud business that sports pretty good margins.In fact, their profit margins are pretty good for the entire business, not just the cloud part.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It certainly does n't qualify for deep value status but it 's a lot <i>cheaper</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and you do n't have to make heroic <b>assumptions</b> about the future to justify holding it . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They also happen to be investing in their future and at a <i>higher</i> percentage of revenue than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> .
