It is a name I continue to own.And one area of the market delivering very strong results has been in credit card financials.Both MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) and Visa (NYSE: V ) reported excellent earnings and were rewarded accordingly.I own both names.And finally a name I own, but wish I didn't last week.The ugliest story of last week was Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The stock was hit by a perfect storm of slower earnings growth , <b>disappointing</b> guidance , and pipeline problems .  (Surprise) </span>The stock traded down more than 20%, and the analyst darling stock received a slew of downgrades.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Worries</b> about weakening global growth are also weighing on the market this earnings season .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Greece <b>may</b> be on the back burner , but China continues to sell-off , as concerns about a hard-landing there persist .  (Uncertainty) </span>And Latin America has gone from bad, to ugly.One of the best indicators of global growth is commodity prices, and they continue to sell-off hard.Look at the massive sell-off they have experienced this month.So U.S. stock market returns remain muted this year, thanks to mixed earnings results and concerns about slow global growth.All of this is not helped by the overhang of a potential Fed rate increase.Leadership in the market is still very narrow with Banks, Healthcare, Biotech, Pharma, Internet, and the Consumer stocks offering the best opportunities according to the Best Stocks Now app.I have been BULLISH on the market since March 23, 2009.I remain BULLISH on the market.Here is why.As long as earnings of the S&P 500 continue to grow, so will the market.S&P 500 earnings bottomed out at $59 per share way back in 2009.The S&P 500 also bottomed out at around 660.S&P 500 earnings have been growing ever since.And the market has also been going up ever since.My projections for 2015 S&P 500 earnings currently stand at about $119 per share.Earnings will have doubled since the 2009 lows while the market has tripled.Those $119 earnings per share this year compare with $117.25 last year.The small increase in earnings this year is the main reason the market is only up about 2% this year.This has been caused by a big drop off in the earnings of the energy sector and a very strong dollar that has hurt the multi-nationals.I currently have a projection of about $133 per share for 2016.At 17X earnings the S&P 500 has the potential to hit 2,325 over the next twelve months.You can also add in dividends to this number.More importantly, the upwards trend of earnings for the S&P 500 is still intact that began back in 2009.Now, look ahead to this week's basket of earnings to see what looks good, bad, and ugly and what it all means for the market as a whole.Source: Earnings Season: The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly.And Why I Remain A Bull Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, AMZN, V, MA, BIIB.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it.I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
