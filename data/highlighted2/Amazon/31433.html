If you're paying for the basic Sling or Vue package, you aren't paying as much as you were with cable, and because of that, spending another $8 on Netflix or a similar service for additional content is still affordable.Sling and Vue are also based on a "right now live" model, while Netflix and the like are based on a "VOD/on my schedule" model... it shouldn't be an either/or proposition.Now despite this current success, I will admit that it remains to be seen how a potential entry by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) into the streaming TV field will change the game.Anything Apple touches has the potential to erupt in a big way, and while the model is reportedly similar to Sling/Vue, never underestimate what the Apple name means to consumers.However, the other big story to come from the news was that at the company's shareholders' meeting on June 9, executives plan to call for a stock split to make the stock more affordable to new investors.Money.com does a great job of breaking down exactly what the split means, but stresses that it will have no real value on the stock... it's more cosmetic than anything else.While he's right, that cosmetic value is still something to note, as perception is everything, and Netflix's entire business model is based around changing the perception of the traditional media model.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perception is also something other analysts warn about , as some fear this is a facade , and as it is unreasonable to <b>assume</b> Netflix can keep this momentum going .  (Uncertainty) </span>I respect their opinions and understand their reasoning, but from my perspective, all this company has been doing lately is proving it can add and keep subscribers at a strong rate because of the value it brings to the table.You can't overlook that Netflix's business is content-driven, and right now, it happens to be particularly strong.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Netflix earnings report caught everyone by surprise because the sheer number of additional subscribers was really <b>stunning</b> , but again , if you look at the success of its programming , it does make sense ; and even despite a lack of ratings info to justify it , that theory is supported by top Hollywood insiders .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , it 's possible that <b>could</b> change down the line , but for now , the company made a $ 3 billion gamble and it worked .
