(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix's latest earnings report shocked analysts as a result of its substantial increase in subscribers.The company's gamble on multiple new original programming has been a success and an underlying reason behind the subscriber surge.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So far , Netflix has not been really impacted by streaming live services like Sling and Vue , but Apple 's upcoming entry <b>could</b> be a game changer .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For those of you who have read my past columns tied to Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , it should n't come as a <b>surprise</b> that I 'm bullish on the stock .  (Surprise) </span>Of course, when the company releases stats like it did yesterday, you can see the reasons.Netflix is currently in a good place, and it's important to reflect on why.A big part of that is people are finally seeing the $3 billion it spent in developmental projects begin to deliver.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black held down the fort for a long time , but now reinforcements have arrived ... to the point that there is a logjam of new original content , and <i>more</i> on the way .  (Surprise) </span>The NBC-turned Netflix comedy Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt kicked off the new arrivals, with the Kyle Chandler-led ensemble Bloodline coming soon after, and the Marvel comics-based Daredevil joining the fray last weekend.And that's just the start, as the summer will bring the Lily Tomlin/Jane Fonda comedy Grace & Frankie, Wachowski sibling drama Sense8 and the TV adaptation of cult film Wet Hot American Summer to the mix, along with the third season of Orange... set for a June return.That's a lot of new exclusive programming, and so far, the word on Schmidt, Bloodline and Daredevil is very positive .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yes , we do n't have ratings info to back it up , nor will we soon , but good buzz is good buzz , and if you look at the reviews and headlines tied to Netflix 's newest trio , you 'll find many <i>more</i> positive comments than negative ( especially tied to Daredevil ) .  (Surprise) </span>The future remains bright in this category for investors, as all of those new series have been renewed (along with mainstays House of Cards and Orange...) for 2016, which, paired with other interesting projects like the continuation of its Marvel deal, the Planet Earth documentary sequel Our Planet and Adam Sandler's Ridiculous 6, present a solid slate.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's actually fascinating , because now it 's even <i>more</i> crystal clear how much ratings really impact a series ' fate .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Gone are the days where executives would take a chance and keep series like Seinfeld on air just because they <b>believed</b> in it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Now , they are beholden to the +3 and +7 numbers , which is a little <i>better</i> - but still , if a show starts slow , it <b>may</b> not recover , as word of mouth is impactful .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Now to be fair, the lack of ratings information does give Netflix a huge advantage over the traditional broadcasters - but let's be honest, executives have to know when they greenlight shows like the critically vilified Manhattan Love Story... the odds are not going to be in their favor regardless.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix 's model is <b>dependent</b> on adding quality shows , not shows just to fill a schedule up , which is also why it has n't been greatly impacted ( thus far ) by live-streaming products like Dish 's ( NASDAQ : DISH ) Sling or Sony 's ( NYSE : SNE ) Vue .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's another valuable point to hit on, as many aren't thinking clearly when comparing these products.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix , Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Prime should n't be seen as rivals to Sling or Vue - they are <i>more</i> of complements . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>If you're paying for the basic Sling or Vue package, you aren't paying as much as you were with cable, and because of that, spending another $8 on Netflix or a similar service for additional content is still affordable.Sling and Vue are also based on a "right now live" model, while Netflix and the like are based on a "VOD/on my schedule" model... it shouldn't be an either/or proposition.Now despite this current success, I will admit that it remains to be seen how a potential entry by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) into the streaming TV field will change the game.Anything Apple touches has the potential to erupt in a big way, and while the model is reportedly similar to Sling/Vue, never underestimate what the Apple name means to consumers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , the other big story to come from the news was that at the company 's shareholders ' meeting on June 9 , executives plan to call for a stock split to make the stock <i>more</i> affordable to new investors .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Money.com does a great job of breaking down exactly what the split means , but stresses that it will have no real value on the stock ... it 's <i>more</i> cosmetic than anything else .  (Surprise) </span>While he's right, that cosmetic value is still something to note, as perception is everything, and Netflix's entire business model is based around changing the perception of the traditional media model.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perception is also something other analysts warn about , as some fear this is a facade , and as it is unreasonable to <b>assume</b> Netflix can keep this momentum going .  (Uncertainty) </span>I respect their opinions and understand their reasoning, but from my perspective, all this company has been doing lately is proving it can add and keep subscribers at a strong rate because of the value it brings to the table.You can't overlook that Netflix's business is content-driven, and right now, it happens to be particularly strong.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Netflix earnings report caught everyone by surprise because the sheer number of additional subscribers was really <b>stunning</b> , but again , if you look at the success of its programming , it does make sense ; and even despite a lack of ratings info to justify it , that theory is supported by top Hollywood insiders .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , it 's possible that <b>could</b> change down the line , but for now , the company made a $ 3 billion gamble and it worked .
