(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Investors have cited issues pertaining to cash and liabilities yet again.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Quite frankly , the <b>risk</b> factors are n't that convincing , and the degree to which it will affect solvency metrics is n't enough to raise the question of insolvency .  (Uncertainty) </span>While there's no denying Netflix has burned some cash this year, investors have already priced in that impact as management guided to worsening FCF a couple quarters ago.Furthermore, the degree to which liabilities are added to the balance sheet matches the company's business model as they need to increase their content offering every year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>risk</b> is isolated to whether NFLX can ramp revenue to meet its obligations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given the revenue drivers and the expanding TAM , a drop off in sales <b>seems</b> highly unlikely .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investors have bemoaned Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) balance sheet metrics for as long as I can remember.The accounting related to the income statement is borderline unconventional and extremely difficult to comprehend even for analysts who have a high order understanding of accounting.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words , investors should be <b>cautious</b> on balance sheet metrics , but the degree to which you can create a compelling short case is borderline ridiculous .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now, for obvious reasons, investors in Netflix have been able to capitalize on its growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While various members of the investment community have labeled it a speculative name to own , I feel fairly <b>confident</b> in my stance on the stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>And that's even after analyzing the various balance sheet metrics other analysts have torn apart.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words , there 's a high wall of <b>worry</b> to climb if you 're going to buy some of the higher-flying tech names , as they 're primarily valued on the basis of improving sales/earnings metrics .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whether that <b>optimism</b> in sales is even warranted is another topic for another day .  (Uncertainty) </span>In a recent Seeking Alpha article published by Ben Keith, he raises issues with content liabilities: In its 10-Q for the period ended 9/30/15, it discloses $2.695 BN in its current content library, and $2.623 BN in current content liabilities.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Under note 9 , `` Commitments and <b>Contingencies</b> '' it discloses a total of $ 4.535 BN in aggregate short-term streaming commitments , or $ 4.535 - $ 2.623 = $ 1.912 BN in additional off-balance sheet liabilities .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Management teams facing increasing costs <b>may</b> do this to reduce COGS , thereby increasing margins beyond what is actually feasible .  (Uncertainty) </span>The result is an unsustainable and bloated inventory as cost that should have been accounted for in the income statement gets left behind in inventory.I have included the breakdown in content obligations for your reference, so we can verify Keith's arguments.But, let's first start by understanding why Netflix front-loads its content liabilities.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On numerous conference calls , the CFO mentions that there is <b>variation</b> when pertaining to the amortization schedule of content .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But basically , content viewing hours determine the amortization rate for content , and if you have a successful hit , the number of viewing hours is front-loaded and you amortize <i>more</i> quickly .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If the content is n't successful in initial viewing hours , but viewing is <i>more</i> spread out , the amortization schedule stretches and changes to match the viewership the show or movie gets .  (Surprise) </span>In other words, determining the rate at which amortization occurs is hazy at best because we don't get a whole lot of granular data on that.However, the important thing to notice are content obligations for December 31, 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I discovered this a year ago , but basically the amount of content due in one year <b>roughly</b> corresponds to the cost of revenue for that fiscal year .  (Uncertainty) </span>So Netflix included the off-balance sheet obligations due and the current due amounts in their notes, and as you roll through the year the liabilities increase as costs get layered on top of each other as the year progresses.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But , if you look at 2014 cost of revenue , the amount is $ 3.753 billion , which <b>roughly</b> corresponds to the <i>less</i> than one-year content obligation figure of $ 3.747 billion .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words , Netflix 's cost of revenue for FY 2015 seems pretty predictable , but whether or not sales ramp to meet that content obligation is a <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Why does the cash conversion cycle not take this into consideration?Well, let's observe how the metric is actually calculated: Cash conversion cycle = days inventory outstanding + days sales outstanding - days payable outstanding The problem with the cash conversion cycle (and this only applies to Netflix) is that it uses the receivable amount for calculating the difference in the number of days it takes to receive cash as opposed to paying off liabilities.However, as many of you Netflix watchers know, revenues are back-year loaded, which means that the liabilities or cost of revenue are high going into the front-end of the year when revenues are at the lowest but become balanced out by the growth in subscriptions towards the back half of a given fiscal year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Assuming</b> they ramp up revenue , they can pay off their content obligations as they become due , and solvency becomes <i>less</i> of an issue .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Growth has been fairly consistent.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , and <i>more</i> importantly , the sequential growth is notably high in the holiday quarter .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix projects 5.4% sequential growth, and generally speaking, they have a solid track record of meeting their own outlook.The current consensus estimate for FY'15 is $6.78 billion in revenue, and the short-term streaming obligation for FY'15 is $4.535 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , its content obligations tend to increase every quarter , which means that in Q3 we have $ 4.535 in obligations due in under a year , but if it increases by an additional 4.8 % like it did last year we can ballpark cost of revenue at $ 4.75 billion , which means gross margins for FY 2015 will be 29.9 % this year , which compares to gross margins of 31.8 % in FY 2014 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words , there 's no denying that there 's some degradation of operating metrics that <b>seems</b> unavoidable given the rate they add short-term obligations and the rate at which they get expensed at .  (Uncertainty) </span>Revenue won't offset costs as much this year, and the cash balance will decline modestly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , the way Keith present his argument creates the <b>assumption</b> that Netflix has major solvency issues , which is completely ridiculous .  (Uncertainty) </span>I guess, the most accurate way to observe this is by simply looking at the cash burn rate, or the amount of cash they have left over in any given quarter.Just looking at the cash and short-term investments, there's no denying that Netflix's cash position has declined.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But , the degree to which it will decline is n't so substantial that you begin to <b>wonder</b> if they 'll have enough money to pay their bills on time this year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The current ratio is 1.8 , which means they have <i>more</i> than enough to cover current obligations and will have <b>nearly</b> twice the amount left over .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I rely on this metric because it's a fairly accurate indicator of solvency as opposed to the other metrics Ben Keith mentions in his article.Also, the liabilities increase ahead of revenues, because Netflix likes to increase the size of its content offering every single year.Therefore, you have to sign agreements to pay for content years in advance, because the production phase takes so long, and many movie makers aren't willing to enter into production unless if they know they'll receive a dedicated amount to pay off all of their costs years down the road.Therefore, the current liabilities metrics look awkward at best because inventory when based on retail metrics is supposed to sit on the balance sheet for a very short duration in time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> inventory gets circulated in a year the <i>more</i> efficient you are with cash .  (Surprise) </span>However, in the case of Netflix its inventory is content licenses, and that inventory is depreciated on a usage basis as opposed to straight-line.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , you have <b>variances</b> in the amortization schedule , which results in some lumpiness in FCF .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, not only do you have lumpiness, but the days it takes to turn over current content obligations as measured by the turnover ratio tends to be long in comparison to retail companies.The turnover ratio was 206.72 days in 2014 when based on current liabilities and cost of revenue amounts at the end of FY 2014.Content is supposed to last for a long amount of time and isn't meant to be turned over frequently as it's not a retail sales model.Therefore, using those metrics on a retail business like Wal-Mart as opposed to Netflix is reasonable.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Also , Netflix has <i>more</i> flexibility with its cost levers than what other analysts <b>may</b> imply .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix has moved over <i>more</i> of its content purchases to in-house productions .  (Surprise) </span>Meaning, they can reduce the size of its costs in response to revenues if need be.They don't necessarily have to spend as much in any given year, as they're in a position to at least mitigate productions costs in any year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>may</b> not sit well with shareholders if they have to reduce the size of their production slate , but at the same time , we at least know they can navigate their cost structure as liabilities only become liabilities when content is made available onto the movie streaming platform .  (Uncertainty) </span>That means that at least some of these liabilities can be reduced before they ever make it to the movie streaming platform if in the event Netflix's internal expectation on sales isn't met in FY 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , I 'm not <b>nearly</b> as concerned with balance sheet metrics as Netflix bears are .  (Uncertainty) </span>It was noted two or three quarters ago that free cash flow was going to dip into the negative for a while, which explains why their cash balance has declined.They still have enough reserve cash to last them for quite a while.The downward revisions to FCF have been made ages ago by the investment community, and quite frankly, the loss of cash has already been priced in.Therefore, the investment case for selling short Netflix based on observable trends in cash flow metrics cannot be made, because it's a pricing event that has already occurred.The worst case scenario for Netflix shareholders is a massive reduction in sales expectations following the announcement of Q4'FY 15 earnings.If Netflix is unable to grow sales by 28.17% in FY'16 as indicated by analyst estimates, then you have a serious problem with the investment thesis as growth is suppose to accelerate between FY'15 and FY'16.That's because they have increased the addressable market, and international streaming is expected to grow off of a sizable revenue base.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If those growth <b>assumptions</b> are n't met you then have to expect Netflix to burn through <i>more</i> cash over the short run , and they 're going to shed some costs in their own in-house movie productions because they 're still tied to licensing commitments with outside studios .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The in-house productions provide <i>more</i> value and are <i>more</i> flexible in terms of cost management .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , if you have to cut a couple episodes out of the next season of House of Cards or reduce the number of in-house offerings the platform wide effects <b>could</b> be broadly interpreted as a negative to subscriber retention .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But after having assessed the various drivers to revenue growth I weight this as an extremely low <b>probability</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words , investors that are short Netflix <b>might</b> as well be standing in front of a bullet train .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If the shorts were destroyed in 2012 with <i>less</i> convincing balance sheet fundamentals what do you think will happen if you have <i>more</i> cash sitting on the balance sheet following a bond offering , and growth accelerates ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Well , you 're bound to lose a lot of money if you do short , especially in an environment where investors have gotten aggressive with momentum names like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
