( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is out with a Dash button expansion . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> this product launch will be helpful to EPS expansion in that it is near-zero capex , should increase volumes , and should also increase ARPU .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is out with an update on its young Dash button product/endeavor . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company has had a series of excellent product launches dating back the last 24 months , and none have been <i>more</i> well-timed or <i>more</i> customer-aware than that of the Dash buttons .  (Surprise) </span>Dash buttons - wifi-connected, IoT devices that allow for ordering of product with a click of a button - are very simple in idea, but potentially game changing from an execution and launch standpoint.I view Dash buttons as an extremely highly visible and realistic immediate-term EPS expansion product , inclusive of the $ 5.99 / button cost that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has now promised to refund upon first order . I do not, as some have opined, view Dash buttons as a loss leader , but as an efficiency and margin driver.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Being so early into launch and so early into Dash button vendor inventory build-out , I do n't want to <b>speculate</b> as to how much EPS expansion the company should see , but I do expect this to immediately contribute , with the contribution growing as the product/endeavor matures .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To state this clearly and simply , Dash buttons are a near-zero capex product launch that I <b>believe</b> will expand overall sales volume ( which in itself leverages fixed costs and creates margin expansion ) and will expand <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's version of ARPU . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>ARPU expansion will also work to leverage fixed costs and to create trickle-down EPS expansion.This model layover is smart and it is low-risk.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The only <b>risk</b> that I see is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> refunds the initial $ 5.99 charge , which it does upon first purchase per button , and takes a net loss on the total transaction . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My guess is that even this is n't very realistic , as the company is most likely putting the brands associated with the buttons on the hook for most of the cost <b>exposure</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Still , that is a <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , while I understand that ordering product from the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> app is easy enough , and re-orders take the proficient user <b>roughly</b> 15 seconds to complete , I am extremely bullish on the use case expansion and the intent placement of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's value prop with Dash buttons . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Intent is a rare commodity that several companies across tech, including marketing platforms, relationship management platforms, and contact management platforms, have tried to control and create.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Dash buttons , I believe will be able to do just this - as elusive as that <b>may</b> seem . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yes , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's app is easy-to-use Dash buttons are <i>easier</i> in requiring <i>fewer</i> steps . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This should remove at least some of the overall friction to order and expand the top of the sales funnel.Yes , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's mobile app is mobile and physically with users at all times , putting access to the seemingly endless inventory at ready reach , but Dash buttons are present at the time of having a need ( at the inception of the need ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Assuming users have the app installed and check their phone often , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a near-constant visual reminder of purchases that <b>might</b> need to be made , and this has obviously benefited the company to this point . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Dash buttons , <b>assuming</b> they are installed in relevant locations ( for example , users place the Tide button on their washer machine ) , are even <i>more</i> visual and even <i>more</i> relevant .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , because of its closing of the distance between intent realization and value prop , has greatly limited the opportunity for sales loss . The company now offers users the ability to order when the intent is fresh and when the value prop of its service is greatest.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Being <i>closer</i> to the need and <i>closer</i> to the realization of the need is prime real estate for advertisement placement - real estate that the company not only now has access to , but that I <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will have user/shoppers proactively placing it in . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is now building a direct pipeline from its store to the becoming <i>smarter</i> ( <i>more</i> IoT ) home . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Being able to give users a <i>wider</i> selection of buttons based on brand preference will only help drive the visibility of Dash buttons , in my opinion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>believe</b> this will also mean <i>greater</i> usage by volume and that this will mean <i>greater</i> spend per customer ( again , especially as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> builds out its Dash buttons inventory ) . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This should also mean use case expansion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Imagine setting up an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> account for an <i>older</i> relative or <b>maybe</b> a senior whom you 're trying to make life a little <i>easier</i> for . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Now, you can deploy Dash buttons and give this individual immediate access to shopping.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> this to be a less-friction option than trying to educate the individual as to how to use the mobile or desktop ordering service .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But <b>maybe</b> the biggest longer-term opportunity for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - though the company has n't alluded to this in any way - is that it will be able to collect even <i>more</i> dialed-in analytics . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has the order data being sent to it from individual buttons - one would think it <b>could</b> use the data from multiple buttons in aggregate to help form learnings . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> now has the <b>possibility</b> of being able to sell to its vendors data that helps them turn inventory <i>quicker</i> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Or data that helps dial in marketing.Think about Tide running an advertisement on TV that allows for a discounted price on an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> order , but only via the Dash button and only within five minutes of the commercial airing . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tide <b>could</b> test marketing penetration and take-rate .  (Uncertainty) </span>This would be incredibly valuable data - data that, in part, drives the market capitalization of companies like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In any case , I <b>believe</b> this launch and expansion is going to be meaningful to the company 's financials in the immediate and near terms .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Should <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> be able to drive high volume ordering , <i>higher</i> average ticket ordering , or be able to <i>more</i> refine its total marketing strategy via Dash button data , look for its EPS to expand as a result . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Of course, this would be good for the equity price and for forward-looking modeling.Forward-looking modeling revisions would be productive to valuation multiples, which would also be good for the equity price.I view Dash buttons as a low-risk, low-cost, potentially significant contributor to EPS expansion.Disclosure: I am/we are long FB, TWTR.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
