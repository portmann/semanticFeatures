#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is out with a Dash button expansion I believe this product launch will be helpful to EPS expansion in that it is nearzero capex should increase volumes and should also increase ARPU <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is out with an update on its young Dash button productendeavor The company has had a series of excellent product launches dating back the last months and none have been more welltimed or more customeraware than that of the Dash buttons Dash buttons wificonnected IoT devices that allow for ordering of product with a click of a button are very simple in idea but potentially game changing from an execution and launch standpoint I view Dash buttons as an extremely highly visible and realistic immediateterm EPS expansion product inclusive of the button cost that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has now promised to refund upon first order I do not as some have opined view Dash buttons as a loss leader but as an efficiency and margin driver Being so early into launch and so early into Dash button vendor inventory buildout I dont want to speculate as to how much EPS expansion the company should see but I do expect this to immediately contribute with the contribution growing as the productendeavor matures To state this clearly and simply Dash buttons are a nearzero capex product launch that I believe will expand overall sales volume which in itself leverages fixed costs and creates margin expansion and will expand Amazons version of ARPU ARPU expansion will also work to leverage fixed costs and to create trickledown EPS expansion This model layover is smart and it is lowrisk The only risk that I see is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>refunds the initial charge which it does upon first purchase per button and takes a net loss on the total transaction My guess is that even this isnt very realistic as the company is most likely putting the brands associated with the buttons on the hook for most of the cost exposure Still that is a risk Now while I understand that ordering product from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>app is easy enough and reorders take the proficient user roughly seconds to complete I am extremely bullish on the use case expansion and the intent placement of Amazons value prop with Dash buttons Intent is a rare commodity that several companies across tech including marketing platforms relationship management platforms and contact management platforms have tried to control and create Amazons Dash buttons I believe will be able to do just this as elusive as that may seem Yes Amazons app is easytouse Dash buttons are easier in requiring fewer steps This should remove at least some of the overall friction to order and expand the top of the sales funnel Yes Amazons mobile app is mobile and physically with users at all times putting access to the seemingly endless inventory at ready reach but Dash buttons are present at the time of having a need at the inception of the need Assuming users have the app installed and check their phone often <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a nearconstant visual reminder of purchases that might need to be made and this has obviously benefited the company to this point Dash buttons assuming they are installed in relevant locations for example users place the Tide button on their washer machine are even more visual and even more relevant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because of its closing of the distance between intent realization and value prop has greatly limited the opportunity for sales loss The company now offers users the ability to order when the intent is fresh and when the value prop of its service is greatest Being closer to the need and closer to the realization of the need is prime real estate for advertisement placement real estate that the company not only now has access to but that I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have usershoppers proactively placing it in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is now building a direct pipeline from its store to the becoming smarter more IoT home Being able to give users a wider selection of buttons based on brand preference will only help drive the visibility of Dash buttons in my opinion I believe this will also mean greater usage by volume and that this will mean greater spend per customer again especially as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>builds out its Dash buttons inventory This should also mean use case expansion Imagine setting up an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>account for an older relative or maybe a senior whom youre trying to make life a little easier for Now you can deploy Dash buttons and give this individual immediate access to shopping I believe this to be a lessfriction option than trying to educate the individual as to how to use the mobile or desktop ordering service But maybe the biggest longerterm opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>though the company hasnt alluded to this in any way is that it will be able to collect even more dialedin analytics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has the order data being sent to it from individual buttons one would think it could use the data from multiple buttons in aggregate to help form learnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>now has the possibility of being able to sell to its vendors data that helps them turn inventory quicker Or data that helps dial in marketing Think about Tide running an advertisement on TV that allows for a discounted price on an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>order but only via the Dash button and only within five minutes of the commercial airing Tide could test marketing penetration and takerate This would be incredibly valuable data data that in part drives the market capitalization of companies like Facebook NASDAQ FB and Twitter NYSE TWTR In any case I believe this launch and expansion is going to be meaningful to the companys financials in the immediate and near terms Should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>be able to drive high volume ordering higher average ticket ordering or be able to more refine its total marketing strategy via Dash button data look for its EPS to expand as a result Of course this would be good for the equity price and for forwardlooking modeling Forwardlooking modeling revisions would be productive to valuation multiples which would also be good for the equity price I view Dash buttons as a lowrisk lowcost potentially
