( NASDAQ : AAPL ) | Seeking Alpha Apple is priced like a fading industrial company .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It needs something big to grow <i>younger</i> again .  (Surprise) </span>Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) grew up under Tim Cook.It did all the things Wall Street wanted - it bought back stock, it split, it paid a nice dividend - and it is paying the price for that.(The lesson is that tech companies should The current Apple price/earnings multiple of 11 is like that of a fading industrial company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's <i>closer</i> to that of IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) than it is Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) - a lot <i>closer</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The assumption is that next Monday , it will just announce a <i>smaller</i> iPhone , <b>maybe</b> new Apple Watch software and that it faces some major capital requirements to build out iCloud .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If Apple is to grow <i>younger</i> again , if it 's going to get that P/E even halfway to Microsoft 's ( and double the value of the stock in the process ) it needs to wow us .  (Surprise) </span>It needs to create, from whole cloth, a niche as powerful as the iPod, iPad and iPhone were "back in the day," which is to say the last decade.Thus, the Apple Car.Cook knows how the hype game is played here.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The <b>anticipation</b> matters <i>more</i> than what is delivered .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The car <b>could</b> include a drive train , a new engine technology , and a new way of selling .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or it <b>could</b> be a component in someone else 's vehicle .  (Uncertainty) </span>Cook won't say because Cook doesn't know.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>He will tease it , just as Microsoft teased Windows in the 1980s , hoping the Fear , Uncertainty and <b>Doubt</b> this creates will slow other players and draw the right answer to him .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Buying Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , as some have suggested , will not move the needle because Netflix is ferociously expensive - its P/E rivals that of Amazon.Com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) - and because it would require major investment to do what the <b>speculators</b> really want , build out a global cloud infrastructure that would let it take <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Apple <b>could</b> announce a new version of Apple TV , and the FCC 's action on set-top boxes <b>could</b> give the new product a big boost , but if that were to be in the offing a play for Viacom ( NASDAQ : VIA ) ( NASDAQ : VIAB ) , CBS ( NYSE : CBS ) or even Sony ( NYSE : SNE ) Entertainment would be far <i>more</i> likely than one for Netflix .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Sony would not only bring Apple movies and shows for Apple TV, but Michael Jackson's copyrights , which include those of the Beatles.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This would bring the Apple story full-circle , since the corporate moniker name was a tribute to the Beatles ' Apple Records label , and the group has gotten <i>wealthier</i> off that than off their own songs .  (Surprise) </span>In the past, the investment play here would be to buy the rumor and sell the news.But with Apple so cheap, I think this time you hold the rumor and think about buying the news.If it's big you win.If it's small, the iPhone remains a nice business.Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, AMZN, MSFT.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
