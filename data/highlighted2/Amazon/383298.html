Despite a bearish sentiment coming into 2016 for FANG, the group has managed to trade higher for the most part of 2016.Netflix distinguishes itself from the rest of its friends in FANG in an unappealing manner.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company has proved the bears wrong during the past 5-7 years , but I 'm afraid the bull argument <b>may</b> be arriving at an actual halt this time around .  (Uncertainty) </span>The reason for a pause in Netflix's growth is simple.The market the company currently dominates (the USA) is overly saturated, and the company fails to display progress in penetrating markets that possess massive amounts of untapped potential.To say the least, the USA has really been hit or miss for Netflix when speaking of net additions each quarter.Sure, they won't be able to continue the huge growth exhibited in the early stages of penetration, but one would expect that they would continue given the supposed craze behind the service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As mentioned previously above , the expected drop in international subscriber growth is concerning given the high <b>hopes</b> the company had about their ex-US plans .  (Uncertainty) </span>This specific blunder only adds to the timeline of the company's vision of becoming free cash flow positive in the future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the company currently trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple of around 130 , I <b>believe</b> that the market was waiting for a reason to ditch Netflix 's proposed growth story for the near future .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are merely too many growth opportunities in the market aside from Netflix, and being married to the story frankly makes no sense.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Their closest friends in FANG for example provide more reasonable valuations and compelling growth plans in a <b>variety</b> of sectors within their respective business industries .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix will soon pay the price of being a "jack of one trade."Note: Suffice to say that Net Income (Earnings) is practically irrelevant to Netflix as they put forth the majority of their sales into expansionary efforts.Focusing on revenue growth amongst the group members is more important.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> Netflix has become the victim of their own success and CEO Reed Hastings overly aggressive vision for expansion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The service launched in 130 new countries in January , notably India and Russia , and many had high <b>hopes</b> for the launch .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'll give the team some time to work some kinks out , but I 'm <b>afraid</b> the company will have a tough time growing abroad and replicating the type of success they had in the USA during the early stages of the company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As investors seem to be revisiting the `` <b>risk</b> on '' investing approach , I 'd typically expect high beta names like Netflix and the rest of the FANG sector to appreciate in synchrony .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , given stagnant revenue growth being exhibited by Netflix along with rough progress regarding overseas market penetration , I believe that the market may have finally found a reason to throw Netflix out as a viable stock that <b>could</b> potentially have some juice left in it .  (Uncertainty) </span>I often respect the actions and thoughts of Mr. Market, but I have to respectfully and strongly disagree with the valuation being assigned to Netflix at the present time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , but <b>may</b> initiate a short position in NFLX over the next 72 hours .  (Uncertainty) </span>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Short Ideas, Services , Music & Video Stores, Overvaluation, Short</div></body></html>
