class='textDiv'>Resist The Urge To Chill With Netflix Following Lackluster FirstQuarter Results Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Netflixs latest quarterly report displayed poor international growth and guidance for Q along with signs of peak penetration in the USA Competitors such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Hulu HBO and Sling TV continue ramping up features in their own respective services and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is knocking on Netflixs doorstep with Prime Video The risk on trade is evidently back and I believe Netflix will struggle to find a floor in the event we retreat lower after briefly touching recent alltime highs If youre the average American consumer chances are that you have a subscription to Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and have either cut your cable service or have plans on cutting it fairly soon Television ondemand has simply spoiled us and allowed us to take control of every segment of our leisure time On Monday afternoon Netflix kicked off a busy earnings week by reporting disappointing results from the first quarter of With revenue coming in a little light at billion versus the billion expected the major blow came from managements guidance of only adding around million new subscribers globally throughout the second quarter of I dont believe that the concern regarding US net additions K is too bad but the expected decrease in international net additions on a qq basis doesnt particularly bode well for the rosy narrative management has been preaching regarding growth overseas Granted that the launch and penetration will certainly take time to push but a growing competitive streaming TV market doesnt help with the story Netflix should be happy with their domination over the past decade convincing consumers to dispose of their cable and satellite TV packages and conform to the Netflix content collection However given the nature of the tech industry and the society we live in its nearly impossible for one company to dominate the market granted a few exceptions With Hulu HBO Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and Disney NYSE DIS all stepping up their game to compete with Netflix I dont believe Netflix can sustain their current valuation of around billion with a trailing PE of despite exhibiting a potentially meager increase in Q revenue and decrease in operating income The growth story in Netflix is taking a pause for the time being and investors can find a better bang for their buck in several other growth plays Aside from the convenience of knowing one can enjoy their favorite TV runs ondemand many subscribers are finding original content to be a strong enough factor in convincing them to sign up Theres no doubt that shows like Orange is the New Black and House of Cards which is now in its fourth season have been hits for Netflix but I have serious doubts about the companys ability to retain some customers solely based off original content andor continue to develop quality original content The highly awaited series Fuller House that debuted in February wasnt exactly the hit many were expecting and rightfully so considering the lack of a fresh story line Being a sequel I dont believe that many hoped for a completely different plot but I still wouldve hoped that it wouldnt turn out to be viewed as something that would originally air on Disney Channel Considering the wreck Disney Channel has driven itself into by buying cheap viewership with inappropriate references that have only increased over the years I fear that Fuller House may be viewed with the same mindset Management referred to Fuller House as a family comedy that met with overwhelmingly positive viewer reception in their Q letter to shareholders In stark contrast however the majority opinion on Fuller House seems to be rather negative and critical regarding the effort put forth by the producers and cast Popular media review website Metacritic gave Fuller House a score of based on a scale from Moreover several other prominent media outlets had concurrent negative reviews Margaret Lyons from Vulture had the following to say about the series The first four minutes of Fuller House are four of the most excruciating TV minutes ever broadcast shrill garish unfunny and further poisoned by the live audiences baffling apparent appetite to hear the catchphrases of the show repeated now in modernity On Monday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN announced that it will be offering its Prime Video service at month a jump from its prior year complete Prime package I think this is a big step for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>given the fact that many consumers simply arent interested in paying for the whole nine yards with Prime for a year but may dip their toes in Prime Video given the option of a monthly plan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is also ramping up its plans for original content and its purchase of Manchester by the Sea could be the catalyst the service has been in need of Both Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had bid for the series but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is rumored to have edged out Netflix and purchased the series led by Kenneth Lonergan for around million The type of reception that Amazons original series will bring on is yet to be known and will become more clear as we move into the second half of but I do think that the companys aggressive spending towards the idea will pay off handsomely Netflix states that more than half of their subscribers pay either or for their plan Management expects the rollout of ungrandfathering to be gradual and I dont blame them for being cautious given the competition the service faces If the rollout was to be aggressive the negative impact on the top and bottom line would likely be significant Despite the promise of a slow rollout I expect a significant amount of current subscribers to leave the service either temporarily or for good if price becomes a big issue Why you may ask Well price increases tend to have a significant psychological effect on our view of the product and company after the price increase Sure a dollar here and there is likely immaterial to the majority of households globally but it gives an individual a reason to question their dedication to a service and survey other options Purchasing an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime package would be much more economical year and would indeed be the better value but it ultimately comes down to the taste of the viewers How Much Longer Can Netflix Trade at a Ridiculous Valuation The FANG trade was a massive hit in with the move being led in large part by Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>themselves Despite a bearish sentiment coming into for FANG the group has managed to trade higher for the most part of Netflix distinguishes itself from the rest of its friends in FANG in an unappealing manner The company has proved the bears wrong during the past years but Im afraid the bull argument may be arriving at an actual halt this time around The reason for a pause in Netflixs growth is simple The market the company currently dominates the USA is overly saturated and the company fails to display progress in penetrating markets that possess massive amounts of untapped potential To say the least the USA has really been hit or miss for Netflix when speaking of net additions each quarter Sure they wont be able to continue the huge growth exhibited in the early stages of penetration but one would expect that they would continue given the supposed craze behind the service As mentioned previously above the expected drop in international subscriber growth is concerning given the high hopes the company had about their exUS plans This specific blunder only adds to the timeline of the companys vision of becoming free cash flow positive in the future With the company currently trading at an EVEBITDA multiple of around I believe that the market was waiting for a reason to ditch Netflixs proposed growth story for the near future There are merely too many growth opportunities in the market aside from Netflix and being married to the story frankly makes no sense Their closest friends in FANG for example provide more reasonable valuations and compelling growth plans in a variety of sectors within their respective business industries Netflix will soon pay the price of being a jack of one trade Note Suffice to say that Net Income Earnings is practically irrelevant to Netflix as they put forth the majority of their sales into expansionary efforts Focusing on revenue growth amongst the group members is more important Perhaps Netflix has become the victim of their own success and CEO Reed Hastings overly aggressive vision for expansion The service launched in new countries in January notably India and Russia and many had high hopes for the launch Ill give the team some time to work some kinks out but Im afraid the company will have a tough time growing abroad and replicating the type of success they had in the USA during the early stages of the company As investors seem to be revisiting the risk on investing approach Id typically expect high beta names like Netflix and the rest of the FANG sector to appreciate in synchrony However given stagnant revenue growth being exhibited by Netflix along with rough progress regarding overseas market penetration I believe that the market may have finally found a reason to throw Netflix out as a viable stock that could potentially have some juice left in it I often respect the actions and thoughts of Mr Market but I have to respectfully and strongly disagree with the valuation being assigned to Netflix at the present time Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a short position in NFLX over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it
