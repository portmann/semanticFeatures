(Uncertainty) </span>Recently we covered some of the best Danger Zone calls from 2015.We did not include SolarCity (NASDAQ: SCTY ), which is down 42% since being put in the Danger Zone.It fell 22% recently as Nevada raised fees and cut credits on solar power.We named this event as a likely catalyst that would help drive the stock to as low as $9/share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While we <b>may</b> have been wrong in 2015 , the underlying issues that led to these companies being placed in the Danger Zone in the first place remain present .  (Uncertainty) </span>In fact, 2016 is already proving tough for investors holding these stocks, as seen in Figure 1.Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) Â­- Up 81% while the S&P 500 was up 1% We first placed Netflix in the Danger Zone back in November 2013 and despite the market completely ignoring the flaws in the business model - we remain steadfast in our belief that Netflix, while a great product for consumers, is not a great company.Netflix is an example of when the market has chosen to ignore shortcomings so long as Netflix keeps reporting strong revenue growth and impressive subscriber growth (in other words, a non-GAAP metric).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We still <b>believe</b> that Netflix will face its day of reckoning and shares will collapse because of many reasons , three of which are highlighted below .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company's business is extremely costly to run.Soaring costs undermine any revenue growth Netflix reports.Netflix's increasing streaming content costs, which we pointed out in April 2014, remain the main culprit of soaring costs.Additionally, the way Netflix accounts for its streaming content allows management to understate the true cash costs of content on its income statement.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In fact , from 2011-2014 , Netflix 's cash payments for content were <b>nearly</b> $ 1 billion <i>higher</i> than its reported content costs .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Netflix is burning through cash.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The accounting trickery above allows Netflix to report positive GAAP net income while free cash flow remains negative and is only getting <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise) </span>The cash burn has led Netflix to turn to the capital markets numerous times since 2010.As Netflix continues burning through cash, will investment banks be willing to continue lending the company money that is failing to generate adequate returns?Valuation requires unbelievable subscriber numbers.We've previously pointed out just how overvalued Netflix is by quantifying how many subscribers the company would need to justify its current valuation.At it current price of $108/share, NFLX would have to grow profits by 28% compounded annually for the next 19 years.In this scenario, the company would be generating $804 billion in revenue in 19 years, which at $9.99/month would imply Netflix has 6.7 billion worldwide subscribers.For reference, at the end of 3Q15, Netflix had 69 million worldwide subscribers and the global population is right around 7 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While we have been wrong on Netflix in the past , the tide <b>may</b> be turning as Netflix fell 7 % alone on January 13 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With 4Q15 earnings scheduled for January 19 , the moment investors realize Netflix 's `` growth story '' is unsustainable <b>may</b> be just around the corner .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix still earns our Dangerous rating and we see no reason to remove it from the Danger Zone.Wayfair (NYSE: W ) - Up 42% while the S&P 500 was down 2% When we published our report on Wayfair in early 2015, we pointed out that the company was an unprofitable business entering a highly competitive industry - online retail.The business was reporting significant revenue growth, but after-tax profit ( NOPAT ) was in a steep decline and Wayfair's return on invested capital ( ROIC ) was well below that of the competition.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We were n't alone in <b>believing</b> that Wayfair had little ground to stand on in its industry , as notable short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research called Wayfair `` the best short in years '' and hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson announced that Wayfair was his largest short position .  (Uncertainty) </span>In fact, at the time of writing, short interest in Wayfair stood at 76% of the float, an amount that has since declined to around 40% of the float.Despite the negative attention surrounding Wayfair, the stock was able to rise after reporting quarterly earnings that showed excellent growth in many metrics, such as revenue, adjusted EBITDA, or active customers.While many of the metrics Wayfair focuses on are non-GAAP, which allows them to hide subpar GAAP measures, the one item they have still failed to report is positive profits.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With no profits , a -77 % ROIC and -11 % NOPAT margin , we still fail to see how Wayfair creates a competitive advantage for its business , which must compete with retail giant <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) as well as many <i>smaller</i> online retailers such as Overstock ( NASDAQ : OSTK ) or Zulily , which was recently acquired by QVC . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The only thing the share price increase has done is caused W to become even <i>more</i> overvalued .  (Surprise) </span>To justify its current price of $ 41/share , Wayfair must immediately achieve 1 % pre-tax margins ( similar to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> or Overstock ) and grow revenue by 30 % compounded annually for the next 14 years . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In this scenario , Wayfair would be generating $ 39 billion in revenue 14 years from now , which is equivalent to Best Buy 's ( NYSE : BBY ) 2015 revenue and <i>greater</i> than that of Nike 's ( NYSE : NKE ) 2015 revenue .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While Wayfair ended 2015 up 42 % from our Danger Zone report , the stock has fallen 21 % so far in 2016 and in volatile markets such as the one we 're facing now , <b>could</b> fall much <i>further</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In fact, Wayfair still earns our Very Dangerous rating.athenahealth (NASDAQ: ATHN ) - Up 26% while the S&P 500 was down 2% athenahealth continued on a topic we focused on multiple times throughout 2015 on high revenue growth cloud companies.See Box (NYSE: BOX ), Demandware (NYSE: DWRE ), Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK ), Marketo (NASDAQ: MKTO ) or Qlik (NASDAQ: QLIK ) for cloud stocks that have outperformed as shorts since publish date.athenahealth serves the healthcare industry through electronic health records, and similar to other cloud software companies, had been reporting yearly revenue growth upwards of 30% The problem with this revenue growth was that it was becoming increasingly costly.When ATHN went public in 2007, it earned a NOPAT margin of 6%.Flash forward to 2014 and athenahealth's NOPAT margin had contracted to 0.5%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even <i>worse</i> , over the trailing 12 months NOPAT margin has fallen to 0 % .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps most <b>alarming</b> was that the problems athenahealth was facing were n't always an issue .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As the electronic health record market became <i>more</i> lucrative , athenahealth saw its profitability collapse .  (Surprise) </span>Prior to 2012, ATHN earned a double-digit ROIC and was growing economic earnings each year from 2007-2012.However, in 2013, after large competitors Cerner and Allscripts had joined the race, athenahealth started losing its competitive edge.Compounding the increased competition, a 2013 re-assessment of a prior industry report found the adoption of services provided by ATHN and competitors had failed to produce savings and had mixed efficiency results for users.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the two years following this <b>reassessment</b> , revenue growth slowed , ROIC plummeted to 0 % , and economic earnings turned negative .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite all the above, investors piled into ATHN in 2015 which helped drive the stock up 40% from its August lows.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately for these investors , the ride <b>may</b> come to an end when athenahealth reports earnings in early February .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ATHN has fallen 6 % so far in 2016 and its valuation remains <b>alarmingly</b> high .  (Uncertainty) </span>To justify its current price of $154/share, athenahealth must achieve pre-tax margins of 2.5% (last achieved in 2013) and grow NOPAT by 36% compounded annually for the next 23 years .When you remind yourself that ATHN hasn't grown NOPAT since 2011 and it's clear to see how overvalued ATHN has become.ATHN still earns our Very Dangerous rating.Jarden Corporation (NYSE: JAH ) - Up 21% while the S&P 500 was down 1% In our initial report we noted that not only was Jarden destroying shareholder value through share dilution and debt issuance, it was doing so for the direct benefit of executives.Due to their executive compensation structure, Jarden executives were incentivized to grow EPS at any cost.With no regard to the economics of the business, Jarden began a long-term acquisition growth strategy, which as we have pointed out before, due to the high-low fallacy , can artificially manufacture EPS growth while destroying shareholder value.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition to a misaligned executive structure , the acquisitions that Jarden executing were becoming <i>more</i> inefficient .  (Surprise) </span>While Jarden once earned a 13% ROIC in 2002, over the trailing twelve months Jarden's ROIC has fallen to 5%.With such a low ROIC, Jarden held little competitive advantage in the numerous markets it had entered over the years.Without acquisition, Jarden would be revealed to be the roll-up scheme that it had become.In the Danger Zone report we noted that any potential suitor willing to acquire Jarden would have to integrate many business lines and products.We did not expect that such a suitor would arise when Newell Rubbermaid (NYSE: NWL ), a company placed in the Danger Zone in August 2014 , announced it would be acquiring Jarden.Unfortunately for investors in NWL and JAH, this deal will not fix any of the issues in either business model, but will certainly help executives get paid.To highlight just how bad of an acquisition this would be, we further expanded our analysis when we put the NWL/JAH acquisition in the Danger Zone .When analyzing these businesses, NWL, a business in decline, was acquiring JAH, a business with a long history of shareholder value destruction.Worst of all, the biggest "benefits" of the deal, as explained by NWL executives, just so happened to be growth in the exact metrics that determined executive compensation at Newell Rubbermaid.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So once again , regardless of the economic impact , NWL executives would be able to meet or beat their target performance goals , and thereby receive a <i>bigger</i> payout .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the initial pop of JAH led to the stock making this list , JAH is down 11 % in 2016 , which has erased any gains investors <b>could</b> have received due to exuberance over this acquisition .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Could</b> it be that investors are realizing that this deal only exists to line the pockets of executives ?
