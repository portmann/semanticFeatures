(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While Wayfair ended 2015 up 42 % from our Danger Zone report , the stock has fallen 21 % so far in 2016 and in volatile markets such as the one we 're facing now , <b>could</b> fall much <i>further</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In fact, Wayfair still earns our Very Dangerous rating.athenahealth (NASDAQ: ATHN ) - Up 26% while the S&P 500 was down 2% athenahealth continued on a topic we focused on multiple times throughout 2015 on high revenue growth cloud companies.See Box (NYSE: BOX ), Demandware (NYSE: DWRE ), Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK ), Marketo (NASDAQ: MKTO ) or Qlik (NASDAQ: QLIK ) for cloud stocks that have outperformed as shorts since publish date.athenahealth serves the healthcare industry through electronic health records, and similar to other cloud software companies, had been reporting yearly revenue growth upwards of 30% The problem with this revenue growth was that it was becoming increasingly costly.When ATHN went public in 2007, it earned a NOPAT margin of 6%.Flash forward to 2014 and athenahealth's NOPAT margin had contracted to 0.5%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even <i>worse</i> , over the trailing 12 months NOPAT margin has fallen to 0 % .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps most <b>alarming</b> was that the problems athenahealth was facing were n't always an issue .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As the electronic health record market became <i>more</i> lucrative , athenahealth saw its profitability collapse .  (Surprise) </span>Prior to 2012, ATHN earned a double-digit ROIC and was growing economic earnings each year from 2007-2012.However, in 2013, after large competitors Cerner and Allscripts had joined the race, athenahealth started losing its competitive edge.Compounding the increased competition, a 2013 re-assessment of a prior industry report found the adoption of services provided by ATHN and competitors had failed to produce savings and had mixed efficiency results for users.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the two years following this <b>reassessment</b> , revenue growth slowed , ROIC plummeted to 0 % , and economic earnings turned negative .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite all the above, investors piled into ATHN in 2015 which helped drive the stock up 40% from its August lows.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately for these investors , the ride <b>may</b> come to an end when athenahealth reports earnings in early February .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ATHN has fallen 6 % so far in 2016 and its valuation remains <b>alarmingly</b> high .  (Uncertainty) </span>To justify its current price of $154/share, athenahealth must achieve pre-tax margins of 2.5% (last achieved in 2013) and grow NOPAT by 36% compounded annually for the next 23 years .When you remind yourself that ATHN hasn't grown NOPAT since 2011 and it's clear to see how overvalued ATHN has become.ATHN still earns our Very Dangerous rating.Jarden Corporation (NYSE: JAH ) - Up 21% while the S&P 500 was down 1% In our initial report we noted that not only was Jarden destroying shareholder value through share dilution and debt issuance, it was doing so for the direct benefit of executives.Due to their executive compensation structure, Jarden executives were incentivized to grow EPS at any cost.With no regard to the economics of the business, Jarden began a long-term acquisition growth strategy, which as we have pointed out before, due to the high-low fallacy , can artificially manufacture EPS growth while destroying shareholder value.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition to a misaligned executive structure , the acquisitions that Jarden executing were becoming <i>more</i> inefficient .  (Surprise) </span>While Jarden once earned a 13% ROIC in 2002, over the trailing twelve months Jarden's ROIC has fallen to 5%.With such a low ROIC, Jarden held little competitive advantage in the numerous markets it had entered over the years.Without acquisition, Jarden would be revealed to be the roll-up scheme that it had become.In the Danger Zone report we noted that any potential suitor willing to acquire Jarden would have to integrate many business lines and products.We did not expect that such a suitor would arise when Newell Rubbermaid (NYSE: NWL ), a company placed in the Danger Zone in August 2014 , announced it would be acquiring Jarden.Unfortunately for investors in NWL and JAH, this deal will not fix any of the issues in either business model, but will certainly help executives get paid.To highlight just how bad of an acquisition this would be, we further expanded our analysis when we put the NWL/JAH acquisition in the Danger Zone .When analyzing these businesses, NWL, a business in decline, was acquiring JAH, a business with a long history of shareholder value destruction.Worst of all, the biggest "benefits" of the deal, as explained by NWL executives, just so happened to be growth in the exact metrics that determined executive compensation at Newell Rubbermaid.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So once again , regardless of the economic impact , NWL executives would be able to meet or beat their target performance goals , and thereby receive a <i>bigger</i> payout .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the initial pop of JAH led to the stock making this list , JAH is down 11 % in 2016 , which has erased any gains investors <b>could</b> have received due to exuberance over this acquisition .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Could</b> it be that investors are realizing that this deal only exists to line the pockets of executives ?
