wrong about these stocks in the underlying issues that led to these companies being placed in the Danger Zone in the first place remain Recently we covered some of the best Danger Zone calls from We did not include SolarCity NASDAQ SCTY which is down since being put in the Danger Zone It fell recently as Nevada raised fees and cut credits on solar power We named this event as a likely catalyst that would help drive the stock to as low as share While we may have been wrong in the underlying issues that led to these companies being placed in the Danger Zone in the first place remain present In fact is already proving tough for investors holding these stocks as seen in Figure Netflix NASDAQ NFLX Up while the SP was up We first placed Netflix in the Danger Zone back in November and despite the market completely ignoring the flaws in the business model we remain steadfast in our belief that Netflix while a great product for consumers is not a great company Netflix is an example of when the market has chosen to ignore shortcomings so long as Netflix keeps reporting strong revenue growth and impressive subscriber growth in other words a nonGAAP metric We still believe that Netflix will face its day of reckoning and shares will collapse because of many reasons three of which are highlighted below The companys business is extremely costly to run Soaring costs undermine any revenue growth Netflix reports Netflixs increasing streaming content costs which we pointed out in April remain the main culprit of soaring costs Additionally the way Netflix accounts for its streaming content allows management to understate the true cash costs of content on its income statement In fact from Netflixs cash payments for content were nearly billion higher than its reported content costs Netflix is burning through cash The accounting trickery above allows Netflix to report positive GAAP net income while free cash flow remains negative and is only getting worse The cash burn has led Netflix to turn to the capital markets numerous times since As Netflix continues burning through cash will investment banks be willing to continue lending the company money that is failing to generate adequate returns Valuation requires unbelievable subscriber numbers Weve previously pointed out just how overvalued Netflix is by quantifying how many subscribers the company would need to justify its current valuation At it current price of share NFLX would have to grow profits by compounded annually for the next years In this scenario the company would be generating billion in revenue in years which at month would imply Netflix has billion worldwide subscribers For reference at the end of Q Netflix had million worldwide subscribers and the global population is right around billion While we have been wrong on Netflix in the past the tide may be turning as Netflix fell alone on January With Q earnings scheduled for January the moment investors realize Netflixs growth story is unsustainable may be just around the corner Netflix still earns our Dangerous rating and we see no reason to remove it from the Danger Zone Wayfair NYSE W Up while the SP was down When we published our report on Wayfair in early we pointed out that the company was an unprofitable business entering a highly competitive industry online retail The business was reporting significant revenue growth but aftertax profit NOPAT was in a steep decline and Wayfairs return on invested capital ROIC was well below that of the competition We werent alone in believing that Wayfair had little ground to stand on in its industry as notable short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research called Wayfair the best short in years and hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson announced that Wayfair was his largest short position In fact at the time of writing short interest in Wayfair stood at of the float an amount that has since declined to around of the float Despite the negative attention surrounding Wayfair the stock was able to rise after reporting quarterly earnings that showed excellent growth in many metrics such as revenue adjusted EBITDA or active customers While many of the metrics Wayfair focuses on are nonGAAP which allows them to hide subpar GAAP measures the one item they have still failed to report is positive profits With no profits a ROIC and NOPAT margin we still fail to see how Wayfair creates a competitive advantage for its business which must compete with retail giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN as well as many smaller online retailers such as Overstock NASDAQ OSTK or Zulily which was recently acquired by QVC The only thing the share price increase has done is caused W to become even more overvalued To justify its current price of share Wayfair must immediately achieve pretax margins similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or Overstock and grow revenue by compounded annually for the next years In this scenario Wayfair would be generating billion in revenue years from now which is equivalent to Best Buys NYSE BBY revenue and greater than that of Nikes NYSE NKE revenue While Wayfair ended up from our Danger Zone report the stock has fallen so far in and in volatile markets such as the one were facing now could fall much further In fact Wayfair still earns our Very Dangerous rating athenahealth NASDAQ ATHN Up while the SP was down athenahealth continued on a topic we focused on multiple times throughout on high revenue growth cloud companies See Box NYSE BOX Demandware NYSE DWRE Splunk NASDAQ SPLK Marketo NASDAQ MKTO or Qlik NASDAQ QLIK for cloud stocks that have outperformed as shorts since publish date athenahealth serves the healthcare industry through electronic health records and similar to other cloud software companies had been reporting yearly revenue growth upwards of The problem with this revenue growth was that it was becoming increasingly costly When ATHN went public in it earned a NOPAT margin of Flash forward to and athenahealths NOPAT margin had contracted to Even worse over the trailing months NOPAT margin has fallen to Perhaps most alarming was that the problems athenahealth was facing werent always an issue As the electronic health record market became more lucrative athenahealth saw its profitability collapse Prior to ATHN earned a doubledigit ROIC and was growing economic earnings each year from However in after large competitors Cerner and Allscripts had joined the race athenahealth started losing its competitive edge Compounding the increased competition a reassessment of a prior industry report found the adoption of services provided by ATHN and competitors had failed to produce savings and had mixed efficiency results for users In the two years following this reassessment revenue growth slowed ROIC plummeted to and economic earnings turned negative Despite all the above investors piled into ATHN in which helped drive the stock up from its August lows Unfortunately for these investors the ride may come to an end when athenahealth reports earnings in early February ATHN has fallen so far in and its valuation remains alarmingly high To justify its current price of share athenahealth must achieve pretax margins of last achieved in and grow NOPAT by compounded annually for the next years When you remind yourself that ATHN hasnt grown NOPAT since and its clear to see how overvalued ATHN has become ATHN still earns our Very Dangerous rating Jarden Corporation NYSE JAH Up while the SP was down In our initial report we noted that not only was Jarden destroying shareholder value through share dilution and debt issuance it was doing so for the direct benefit of executives Due to their executive compensation structure Jarden executives were incentivized to grow EPS at any cost With no regard to the economics of the business Jarden began a longterm acquisition growth strategy which as we have pointed out before due to the highlow fallacy can artificially manufacture EPS growth while destroying shareholder value In addition to a misaligned executive structure the acquisitions that Jarden executing were becoming more inefficient While Jarden once earned a ROIC in over the trailing twelve months Jardens ROIC has fallen to With such a low ROIC Jarden held little competitive advantage in the numerous markets it had entered over the years Without acquisition Jarden would be revealed to be the rollup scheme that it had become In the Danger Zone report we noted that any potential suitor willing to acquire Jarden would have to integrate many business lines and products We did not expect that such a suitor would arise when Newell Rubbermaid NYSE NWL a company placed in the Danger Zone in August announced it would be acquiring Jarden Unfortunately for investors in NWL and JAH this deal will not fix any of the issues in either business model but will certainly help executives get paid To highlight just how bad of an acquisition this would be we further expanded our analysis when we put the NWLJAH acquisition in the Danger Zone When analyzing these businesses NWL a business in decline was acquiring JAH a business with a long history of shareholder value destruction Worst of all the biggest benefits of the deal as explained by NWL executives just so happened to be growth in the exact metrics that determined executive compensation at Newell Rubbermaid So once again regardless of the economic impact NWL executives would be able to meet or beat their target performance goals and thereby receive a bigger payout While the initial pop of JAH led to the stock making this list JAH is down in which has erased any gains investors could have received due to exuberance over this acquisition Could it be that investors are realizing that this deal only exists to line the pockets of executives Disclosure David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no
