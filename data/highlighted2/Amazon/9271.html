( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> remains profitable as an online retailer and marketplace , pooling a great amount of its earnings to finance <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) . Concerning profitability , we argue that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's EGM and Media branches should be taken together as a single retail division . AWS is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's second and only other significant division . There's still no other business that comes close to playing such a major role.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) as a whole did not report any profits in the last three years , it <b>seems</b> to remain a profitable online retailer and marketplace . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It also is important to note that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not only an online retailer but also is gaining leading positions in the cloud computing services market . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Distinguishing between the entire company 's lack of profitability and the presumed profitability of its retail division ( we <b>assume</b> that it includes the EGM and Media segments ) allows us to evaluate <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in a different way . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To be <i>more</i> precise , we will evaluate <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail and AWS segments separately . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>We only highlight two core <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> businesses ( retail and AWS ) in this article because they dominate <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's net sales and can earn money for shareholders . There's still no other business that can play this role.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , we <b>believe</b> that it will continue to be a type of marketing expense rather than becoming a profitable business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The dynamics of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's net shipping costs over the last three years support this conclusion . Nonetheless, the forecasted EGM sales figures that we consider are based on the estimated current and future quantity of Prime members and their expected spending levels.PROFITABILITY OF AMAZON AS A WHOLE AND OF ITS RETAIL DIVISION Let us first look at the evidence supporting the retail business' profitability conclusion.The margin of income from operations (operating income margin) contracted by 3.91% from 2010 to 2014, from 4.11% to 0.20%.This contraction is mostly due to growing technology and content costs as well as marketing.At the same time, the cost of sales and the fulfillment share (which generally refer to EGM and Media sales) decreased in terms of both net sales and operating expenses.Figure 1.Historical ratios of expenses to net sales.Concerning profitability, we argue that EGM and Media should be taken together as a single retail division.It is difficult to divide <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's traditional online retail business . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>EGM and Media <b>differ</b> with regard to what 's being sold rather than in the structure of their operational costs .  (Uncertainty) </span>Hence, these items related to the retail division did not cause the overall operating income margin to decrease.In fact , the ratio of cost of sales + fulfillment to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> net sales has fallen since 2010 . Figure 2.Historical ratios of expenses to sales.On the other hand, the growth of the income from operations margin of the retail division is not obvious.To make this clear, we have to check whether the share of cost of sales and fulfillment in the net sales of EGM + Media has decreased.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the past five years , this ratio has only <b>fluctuated</b> slightly and has generally remained the same : it was 88.6 % in 2010 and 88.16 % in 2014 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , we can <b>assume</b> that the income margin of the retail business also remains positive and close to the level of 2010 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>SEEKING THE RETAIL BUSINESS 2014 OPERATING MARGIN There are some expense items ( with cost of sales and fulfillment ) that did make an impact on the retail business operating profitability , namely : Marketing expenses <b>could</b> have led to a 1.86 % decrease in the operating income margin from 2014 to 2010 because the ratio of marketing expenses to total net sales changed from 3.01 % in 2010 to 4.87 % in 2014 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Changes in general and administrative expenses decreased the operating income margin by 0.37% and changes in other expenses increased operating income by 0.16%.The change in the ratio of (cost of sales + fulfillment expenses) to (EGM + Media net sales) from 2010 to 2014 is responsible for the 0.44% growth in the operating income margin.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we add up all changes in these expense items from 2010 to 2014 , we will obtain the total impact on the operating income margin , which is a 1.63 % decrease .  (Uncertainty) </span>Simultaneously, the change in technology and content costs from 2010 to 2014 reduced the income from operations margin by 5.35% and took as much as 10.42% of net sales in 2014.Here, we are especially interested in the change in technology and content costs and its share in net sales because we are excluding this article from the expenses that refer to the retail division.Another point is that we take only EGM and Media sales into account and ignore other net sales, which are primarily composed of AWS sales.The final important step that should be performed to determine the retail division 's operating income is to subtract from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's total cost of sales the relevant amount of depreciation and amortization ( D&A ) that refers to the AWS segment and is a part of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's total cost of sales expense . We 'll end up with a 2014 operating income margin of 7.78 % for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail division if we take everything that we have discussed so far into account . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The following picture of the retail division 's sales and operating expenses is considered : The operating income margin ( 7.78 % ) of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail division <b>appears</b> to be low for the online retail industry . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's peers have much <i>higher</i> operating income margins - eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) 's is 19.83 % and Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) 's is 36.95 % . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>We can notice, however, that the ratio of (cost of sales adjusted on AWS' D&A + fulfillment) to (EGM sales + Media sales) has decreased and the retail business operating income should have grown.In fact , the dynamics of this ratio show us how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has improved its retail operations . Nonetheless , in 2014 there is a $ 6,313 million ( = 6491-178 ) difference ( shown in Figure 3 ) between the income from operations of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail division . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>could</b> guess that this is the sum that the retail division invested in AWS during that year .  (Uncertainty) </span>This article attempted to clarify that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail operations remain profitable . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This should matter at least to investors who have a positive evaluation of the AWS business ( and have an idea of its <b>possible</b> valuation ) despite its current negative FCF .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I find it highly <b>probable</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will stay in its `` investment mode '' ( as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's CFO Tom Szkutak has called it ) for years . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In this case , it is quite useful to separately evaluate the parts of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> that in which we have <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> <b>confidence</b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>By thinking about these divisions separately , we may have a <i>better</i> chance of quickly recognizing any important changes that <b>could</b> take place in the company 's development .
