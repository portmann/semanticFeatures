class='textDiv'>Amazons Profitable Retail Business Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>remains profitable as an online retailer and marketplace pooling a great amount of its earnings to finance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS Concerning profitability we argue that Amazons EGM and Media branches should be taken together as a single retail division AWS is Amazons second and only other significant division Theres still no other business that comes close to playing such a major role Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN as a whole did not report any profits in the last three years it seems to remain a profitable online retailer and marketplace It also is important to note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not only an online retailer but also is gaining leading positions in the cloud computing services market Distinguishing between the entire companys lack of profitability and the presumed profitability of its retail division we assume that it includes the EGM and Media segments allows us to evaluate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in a different way To be more precise we will evaluate Amazons retail and AWS segments separately We only highlight two core <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>businesses retail and AWS in this article because they dominate Amazons net sales and can earn money for shareholders Theres still no other business that can play this role As for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime we believe that it will continue to be a type of marketing expense rather than becoming a profitable business The dynamics of Amazons net shipping costs over the last three years support this conclusion Nonetheless the forecasted EGM sales figures that we consider are based on the estimated current and future quantity of Prime members and their expected spending levels PROFITABILITY OF AMAZON AS A WHOLE AND OF ITS RETAIL DIVISION Let us first look at the evidence supporting the retail business profitability conclusion The margin of income from operations operating income margin contracted by from to from to This contraction is mostly due to growing technology and content costs as well as marketing At the same time the cost of sales and the fulfillment share which generally refer to EGM and Media sales decreased in terms of both net sales and operating expenses Figure Historical ratios of expenses to net sales Concerning profitability we argue that EGM and Media should be taken together as a single retail division It is difficult to divide Amazons traditional online retail business EGM and Media differ with regard to whats being sold rather than in the structure of their operational costs Hence these items related to the retail division did not cause the overall operating income margin to decrease In fact the ratio of cost of sales fulfillment to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>net sales has fallen since Figure Historical ratios of expenses to sales On the other hand the growth of the income from operations margin of the retail division is not obvious To make this clear we have to check whether the share of cost of sales and fulfillment in the net sales of EGM Media has decreased In the past five years this ratio has only fluctuated slightly and has generally remained the same it was in and in Therefore we can assume that the income margin of the retail business also remains positive and close to the level of SEEKING THE RETAIL BUSINESS OPERATING MARGIN There are some expense items with cost of sales and fulfillment that did make an impact on the retail business operating profitability namely Marketing expenses could have led to a decrease in the operating income margin from to because the ratio of marketing expenses to total net sales changed from in to in Changes in general and administrative expenses decreased the operating income margin by and changes in other expenses increased operating income by The change in the ratio of cost of sales fulfillment expenses to EGM Media net sales from to is responsible for the growth in the operating income margin If we add up all changes in these expense items from to we will obtain the total impact on the operating income margin which is a decrease Simultaneously the change in technology and content costs from to reduced the income from operations margin by and took as much as of net sales in Here we are especially interested in the change in technology and content costs and its share in net sales because we are excluding this article from the expenses that refer to the retail division Another point is that we take only EGM and Media sales into account and ignore other net sales which are primarily composed of AWS sales The final important step that should be performed to determine the retail divisions operating income is to subtract from Amazons total cost of sales the relevant amount of depreciation and amortization DA that refers to the AWS segment and is a part of Amazons total cost of sales expense Well end up with a operating income margin of for Amazons retail division if we take everything that we have discussed so far into account The following picture of the retail divisions sales and operating expenses is considered The operating income margin of Amazons retail division appears to be low for the online retail industry Amazons peers have much higher operating income margins eBay NASDAQ EBAY s is and Alibaba NYSE BABA s is We can notice however that the ratio of cost of sales adjusted on AWS DA fulfillment to EGM sales Media sales has decreased and the retail business operating income should have grown In fact the dynamics of this ratio show us how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has improved its retail operations Nonetheless in there is a million difference shown in Figure between the income from operations of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Amazons retail division We could guess that this is the sum that the retail division invested in AWS during that year This article attempted to clarify that Amazons retail operations remain profitable This should matter at least to investors who have a positive evaluation of the AWS business and have an idea of its possible valuation despite its current negative FCF I find it highly probable that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will stay in its investment mode as Amazons CFO Tom Szkutak has called it for years In this case it is quite useful to separately evaluate the parts of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>that in which we have more or less confidence By thinking about these divisions separately we may have a better chance of quickly recognizing any important changes that could take place in the companys development Source Amazons Profitable Retail Business Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate
