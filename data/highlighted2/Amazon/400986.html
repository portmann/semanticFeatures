a slow month in January the Mustang FSeries and other SUVs have each posted impressive results the past few months boosting sales numbers as well as average transaction prices The company certainly faces challenges in but given the strength of the automotive industry and the weak valuation Im optimistic on Fords Ford NYSE F announced April US vehicle sales of nearly K up from the same month in This lowsingledigit increase came in slightly below the estimate from Kelley Blue Book The increase comes a month after Ford posted an increase and two months after posting the leading increase of among all of the automakers in February After a mediocre January Ford has been steadily posting positive if not recordbreaking monthly US sales results Equally as important the company increased its average transaction price at a steady to due to the continued success of its larger vehicle offerings Looking at the industrywide results the seasonallyadjusted annualized rate is between million and million vehicles after falling to million vehicles after March Competitors such as Honda NYSE HMC up Nissan OTCPKNSANY up Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU up and Toyota NYSE TM up posted solid increases while General Motors NYSE GM down saw the only decrease Furthermore in the critical pickup truck market Fords FSeries posted a increase for the month after sales totaled K in the first quarter which represented the best firstquarter start in a decade without any signs of slowing The model is coming off a busy where it underwent a drastic change to an aluminum body starting this year and has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure its manufacturing plants Recently Ford announced that it will idle an F plant in Kansas City for a week to address a couple of issues that have prevented the facility from running at full production capacity While its never good to see a company facing manufacturing issues especially after the issues the company had last summer it is good to see management addressing the issue It also explains why the days of inventory supply is at As Ive said before the success of the F is critical to Fords turnaround This slow start to in addition to other possible threats such as the overall health of the US economy further interest rate hikes and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry are weighing heavily on investor sentiment If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession it would definitely have a major impact on Ford Furthermore with an interest rate hike announced in December it is expected that the automotive market is hitting a peak domestically While the auto market had a solid month to ease some of these fears it is certainly preventing the automobile stocks from making significant gains Additionally with new companies working to produce technologyinfused vehicles such as Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesnt fall behind when it comes to the technology use in the vehicle Ford appears to be prepared for this through rumored partnerships with Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN However management must continue to look to be a leader in the race to an autonomous car With the company trading just over per share with a PE ratio of approximately both figures as of the beginning of March it appears to be undervalued compared to the current SP PE ratio of Furthermore Ford is trading below PE ratios for Toyota but slightly above competitor GM which I also believe is low given the companys most recent earnings Given the low valuation and the companys dividend yield of almost I believe the stock is attractive at current prices While the sluggish start and rumors of a domestic auto sales ceiling it is certainly positive to see Ford continue to post such great results the past couple of months With this low valuation I do not see anything in the near term that should weigh heavily on the companys stock and expect the recent rebound to continue Given this low valuation and the longterm optimism with Ford Im extremely encouraged by the US sales results Im excited about the companys future With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow Ford to report stronger topline and bottomline growth going forward in I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and expect the industry to post results similar to Furthermore I believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market and will pay investors an above dividend yield to own the stock Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in F GM over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship
