(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Ford ( NYSE : F ) announced April 2016 U.S. vehicle sales of <b>nearly</b> 231K , up 4 % from the same month in 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span>This low-single-digit increase came in slightly below the 6.5% estimate from Kelley Blue Book.The increase comes a month after Ford posted an 8% increase and two months after posting the leading increase of 20% among all of the automakers in February.After a mediocre January, Ford has been steadily posting positive if not record-breaking monthly U.S. sales results.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Equally as important , the company increased its average transaction price at a steady 2.1 % to $ 36,541 due to the continued success of its <i>larger</i> vehicle offerings .  (Surprise) </span>Looking at the industry-wide results , the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate is between 17.32 million and 17.42 million vehicles after falling to 16.57 million vehicles after March.Competitors such as Honda (NYSE: HMC ) (up 14.4%), Nissan ( OTCPK:NSANY ) (up 12.8%), Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) (up 6%) and Toyota (NYSE: TM ) (up 3.8%) posted solid increases while General Motors (NYSE: GM ) (down 3.5%) saw the only decrease.Furthermore, in the critical pickup truck market, Ford's F-Series posted a 13% increase for the month after sales totaled 186K in the first quarter, which represented the best first-quarter start in a decade without any signs of slowing.The model is coming off a busy 2015 where it underwent a drastic change to an aluminum body starting this year, and has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure its manufacturing plants.Recently, Ford announced that it will idle an F-150 plant in Kansas City for a week to address a couple of issues that have prevented the facility from running at full production capacity.While it's never good to see a company facing manufacturing issues, especially after the issues the company had last summer, it is good to see management addressing the issue.It also explains why the days of inventory supply is at 105.As I've said before, the success of the F-150 is critical to Ford's turnaround.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This slow start to 2016 , in addition to other <b>possible</b> threats such as the overall health of the US economy , further interest rate hikes and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry , are weighing heavily on investor sentiment .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If there was an event or condition that forced the U.S. economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession , it would definitely have a major impact on Ford .  (Uncertainty) </span>Furthermore, with an interest rate hike announced in December, it is expected that the automotive market is hitting a peak domestically.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the auto market had a solid month to ease some of these <b>fears</b> , it is certainly preventing the automobile stocks from making significant gains .  (Uncertainty) </span>Additionally, with new companies working to produce technology-infused vehicles such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesn't fall behind when it comes to the technology use in the vehicle.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Ford <b>appears</b> to be prepared for this through rumored partnerships with Google and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However, management must continue to look to be a leader in the race to an autonomous car.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the company trading just over $ 13.25 per share with a PE ratio of approximately 7 ( both figures as of the beginning of March 2016 ) , it <b>appears</b> to be undervalued compared to the current S&P 500 P/E ratio of 23.5 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , Ford is trading below PE ratios for Toyota ( 8.73 ) , but slightly above competitor , GM ( 6.09 ) , which I also <b>believe</b> is low given the company 's most recent earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given the low valuation and the company 's dividend yield of almost 5 % , I <b>believe</b> the stock is attractive at current prices .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the sluggish start and <b>rumors</b> of a domestic auto sales ceiling , it is certainly positive to see Ford continue to post such great results the past couple of months .  (Uncertainty) </span>With this low valuation, I do not see anything in the near term that should weigh heavily on the company's stock and expect the recent rebound to continue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given this low valuation and the long-term <b>optimism</b> with Ford , I 'm extremely encouraged by the U.S. sales results .  (Uncertainty) </span>I'm excited about the company's future.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With consumers purchasing <i>more</i> expensive vehicles , it will allow Ford to report <i>stronger</i> top-line and bottom-line growth going forward in 2016 .  (Surprise) </span>I remain bullish on the U.S. automobile industry and expect the industry to post results similar to 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , I <b>believe</b> Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market and will pay investors an above-5 % dividend yield to own the stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , but <b>may</b> initiate a long position in F , GM over the next 72 hours .
