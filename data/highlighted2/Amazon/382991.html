The chips will be sold to makers of products for homes and data centers.Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) announced in mid-January that it had entered into an agreement with the Chinese province of Guizhou to create a joint venture called Guizhou Huaxintong Semi-Conductor Technology Co..<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Qualcomm plans to enter the server CPU market that Intel dominates , with a customer processor chip built using the ARM architecture , which is less expensive and <b>may</b> also consume less power .  (Uncertainty) </span>Intel immediately fired back several days later with an announcement of a new joint venture to design chips through a research partnership with Tsinghua University and Montage Technology Global Holdings.Intel will put $100 million into the venture.A Barclays analyst turned bearish on QCOM in late March after Intel became a second source for the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 7 "baseband" cellular modem.More bad news also came from Google's announcement that it singled out an IBM OpenPower design rather than one from Qualcomm.Shares of Qualcomm have performed poorly during the past 10 years.QCOM bounced off a four-year low at $41.85 a share in mid-February and the stock is now trading under the 200-day SMA, near the $51 a share trendline resistance level.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) announced in January that they had started volume shipments of its "Seattle" Opteron A1100 ARM processors, designed for high density server systems.The Opteron A1100 chips will power web servers, networking appliances and storage arrays.So far, analyst views of the new AMD 64-bit ARM chip have been mixed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Chip companies , including Broadcom Ltd ( NASDAQ : AVGO ) , Applied Micro ( NASDAQ : AMCC ) and Cavium ( NASDAQ : CAVM ) , <b>could</b> soon try to take a bite from Intel 's near-monopoly market share with their Vulcan 64-bit ARM server processor , X-Gene family of ARM server chips and ThunderX ARM processor , respectively .  (Uncertainty) </span>Shares of Broadcom, one of the largest ARM server chip companies, is trading at the top of the range of the bearish ascending wedge chart pattern.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The stock <b>could</b> bump along the upper trendline resistance , as long as momentum continues and earnings power support a premium valuation .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are several supports if AVGO pulls back.Intel's High Performance Chips Aren't a Game Changer The acquisition of Altera by Intel was completed in early fiscal year 2016 and Altera emerged as a stand alone unit called the Programmable Solutions Group.Intel just announced that the company had begun shipping a development module that features Xeon E5 server processors and field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, from Altera, which will improve the performance-per-watt of systems by as much as 70%.Late last year, Qualcomm and IBM already signed deals with Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ), Altera's competitor, to allow Qualcomm and IBM to incorporate Xilinx FPGA chips in Qualcomm's ARM-based server chips and IBM's Power-based systems to accelerate their performance.As competition in the data center business is heating up, it is highly critical for Intel to convince Google, Facebook, and others to switch from the graphics processor unit, or GPU, chips to the Intel hybrid Xeon-FPGA chip to power their artificial intelligence tools, including speech recognition, image recognition, and natural language processing.Investors will be closely watching Intel's earning report, to be released after the close of April 19, with an eye on results from their Data Center Group, as revenues, operating income growth, and average selling prices had previously been decelerating as global IT spending is on the decline and competitors make further inroads.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Intel 's Data Center chip business is coming under direct siege so the thesis that a real threat to Intel 's data center market <b>may</b> still be years away comes into question after the recent announcement by Google at the recent OpenPower Summit .  (Uncertainty) </span>Google said it's developing a data center server, code name "Zaius", which will run on a new Power9 IBM OpenPower chip.Google will thus have more leverage with Intel, despite Intel's new server platform, known as Purley, to be launched next year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After the earnings report is released , the stock could bounce to the upside , as expectations for Intel <b>may</b> already be low .
