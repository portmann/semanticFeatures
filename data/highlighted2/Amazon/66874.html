Pricing Strategy Will Help You Find the Best Buys It can be easy for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers to assume theyre always getting the best price As a matter of fact thats exactly what the marketing geniuses at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>want you to do They dont want you to compare prices with Walmart instead they want you to perceive them as always having the lowest price They do this by pricing a few popular items lower than Walmart does in an effort to build your perception of them as a lowprice leader By knowing which items undercut Walmarts pricing and which dont you can become a more informed shopper and save money in the process Spotting the loss leaders at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not hard After all they want you to find the lower prices for their marketing to work A recent study from Boomerang Commerce showed that in an effort to be perceived as a low price leader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>purposefully undercuts the Walmart price on products with a high star rating A high rating is anything over four stars By analyzing millions of orders over the years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has realized that a great way to build loyal customers is to beat the competition on products that people are gobbling up due to the glowing opinions of fellow shoppers Use this to your advantage by gravitating toward products with at least a fourstar rating especially when there are at least reviews Its a bit of a followers mentality but youll find it really does hold true especially when shopping for small electronics toys and video games Another category of products that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells cheaper than Walmart is highly visible and popular items In other words items that have a lot of buzz around them and are often featured on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>homepage or highlighted on specific product category pages Again the perception of having the lowest price means a lot to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>so when a product has a lot of eyes on it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will tend to price it lower than Walmart Examples of some popular and highly visible items that consistently beat Walmart include the popular Fitbit Charge Activity Wristband Dyson vacuum cleaners Keurig coffee makers and the Jawbone Wireless Speaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>obviously cant undercut the Walmart price on every product With Walmarts enormous buying power and reputation for pressuring suppliers to lower prices it simply cant be done This means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>often raises the prices on other products to make up the difference These other products are items that are not very glamorous in nature and tend to be more needs than wants If you score a great deal on a HDTV from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>beware of addons like cables wall mounts and screen cleaners as theyre typically markedup Other examples of addons that can be marked up include things like a wireless mouse when buying a laptop and a protective case or charging station for your new Kindle In many cases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will try to pad their profits on these addons making them not such a great deal for shoppers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has the reputation of being up to more expensive than Walmart when shopping for household items like laundry detergent paper towels toilet paper and the like While this margin is definitely getting smaller in recent years youll still typically end up paying more compared to Walmart and Costco If you are going to shop for household items at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I highly recommend signing up for their Subscribe Save program which allows you to get items sent on a monthly schedule with free delivery The best part is youll get off your total when you have at least five items in your monthly subscription plan The extra savings brings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>very close in price or in many cases under the Walmart price for identical products The problem with buying brand name apparel from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is they rarely mark down prices and seldom have coupons Youll typically score a much better deal by shopping at discount clothing stores like TJ Maxx Ross and Marshalls When shopping for brand name shoes especially online youll find much better prices at websites like Shoebuy PMcom and ShoeMall Not only do all three sites offer free shipping but they also regularly have coupon codes in the off range For example a new pair of top of the line womens New Balance V running shoes is selling for at both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Shoebuy with free shipping But with a little digging I found a off coupon code for Shoebuy bringing my total down to a price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cant touch While having the perception of being a low price leader is something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>strives for its up to us as smart consumers to see through the charade and always do our due diligence when making significant purchases This means always price comparing looking for coupons thatll beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>pricing and understanding the types of products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>purposefully prices higher than the competition Do that and youre guaranteed to always find the lowest price Disclaimer The links and mentions on this site may be affiliate links But they do not affect the actual
