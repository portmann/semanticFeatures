phone or wireless provider But with just a little bit of knowledge on the proper way to call and negotiate a lower bill you can easily save hundreds of dollars per year Here are six telecom companies notorious for working with customers to lower their bill along with some insider negotiation tips for each When it comes to negotiating a lower monthly bill with DirecTV the first thing you have to do is analyze the competition namely Dish Network DirecTV is typically more expensive than Dish which makes the competition is cheaper card great ammunition when making the phone call to DirecTV customer service Find out what current specials Dish is offering and use those when explaining why youre considering leaving DirecTV This will typically only work when youre not under contract as they cant do much for you when youre locked into a specific rate for a set period of time When making the call tell the first person you speak with that youd like to cancel your service as its more than you can afford right now Theyll then transfer you to the retention department who are the folks who have the authority to actually lower your bill Then explain why youre considering switching to Dish Network and be as specific as possible In other words tell them exactly what Dish is offering new customers and ask if they can meet it or at the very least get close to it Be polite and conversational in tone and youll be pleasantly surprised with the result of a lower monthly bill in most cases Same drill with Dish Network Tell the first person you speak with that you want to cancel your service and theyll get you to the customer loyalty or retention department When it comes to negotiating a lower monthly bill with Dish its important to understand that theyre already lower in price than DirecTV This means that in most cases you cant say youre switching to DirecTV because theyre already cheaper Instead you should tell them youre considering cutting the cord entirely by switching to an overtheair HD antennae and cheap streaming options like Netflix and Hulu These other options serve as excellent ammunition when talking to Dish Stick to the facts dont get emotionally involved and remember that you can simply call back later if the person is having a bad day and not willing to work with you Once youve told them why you want to leave they should offer you something to stay on as a loyal customer You can also take the bull by the horns and start the conversation by asking for off your monthly bill depending on what package you subscribe to You can also ask for a few free movie channels if that means more to you Remember that theyve invested a lot to get and keep you as a customer and are willing to throw you a bone to keep your business Always be willing to take your business elsewhere if they cant come close to what you want If you actually dont want to leave and they wont budge you can always say you want to reconsider other options before canceling I recently had an anonymous Comcast retention employee give me the scoop on what to say to get your bill lowered She told me that the worst thing you can do is tell the rep that youre switching to a competitor Instead she said to tell them you want to stay with Comcast but cant afford your monthly bill and will have to switch to a streaming service if the bill cant be lowered She even said that Sling TV was the best streaming option to use as ammunition She said that in most cases this will work and get you up to off your monthly bill as that percentage is the biggest discount they can offer Lastly she told me not to ask to speak to a supervisor as that will typically only get you a callback request that rarely happens Plus they are authorized to offer the same discounts as the retention employee so its not worth your time Verizon can be a tricky company to convince to lower your bill They have created a coverage map that beats the competition and they know that many customers are bluffing when playing the cancel card to try and negotiate a lower bill Because of this its important that you do ample research on the competition before making the call What are Republic Wireless TMobile and Straight Talk currently offering and how long will it take you to recoup your money in terms of savings if you have to pay to get out of your Verizon contract By having these numbers at your disposal when making the call the Verizon rep will sense your seriousness and often offer you a lower rate in return I recently did this and was able to secure off my bill for months Not a huge savings but I really didnt want to leave Verizon as I live in a rural area where Verizon is my only coverage option While you may not be able to negotiate a lower rate with ATT the oldfashioned way you can get rid of services you dont need and look for littleknown discounts Start by analyzing your bill very carefully as ATT is notorious for sneaking in addon services like ATT Navigator Family Map enhanced voicemail and smart limits If you dont use them get rid of them immediately Also check to see if youre eligible for an employer discount Many organizations work directly with ATT to offer their employees a pretty sweet discount so be sure youre not missing out Time Warner is notorious for raising your rate without informing you as to why So once you get a rate youre happy with be sure to keep it by calling them every months Simply call their customer service line be polite and get straight to the point by telling them you want to keep your low rate for another months If the operator is unwilling to extend your rate for another year simply hang up and try back later Be persistent and youll eventually get an employee willing to work with you and help you keep your low rate for another year Disclaimer The links and mentions on this site may be affiliate links But they do not affect the actual opinions and recommendations of the authors Wise Bread is a participant in the
