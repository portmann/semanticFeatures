(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Q2 FY2016 earnings results and revenue guidance for the June quarter marks the end of an era.The iPhone's growth trajectory shows increasing maturity.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite current growth problems , I remain <b>confident</b> in the company 's executive team , premium strategy , and product pipeline .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Q2 FY2016 earnings results and revenue guidance for the June quarter marks the end of an era.The company has reported the first year-over-year sales drop in iPhone's history, and forecasts another decline in sales.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if we avoid the tough iPhone 6 comparisons from 2015 and look at year-over-two-years sales growth , my iPhone Q3 FY2016 unit estimate based on Apple 's guidance would still show one of the slowest iPhone growth rates on record .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Management refers to economy and currency headwinds , yet at the same time , sticking with the Q3 FY2014 comparison , Apple now benefits from having 3 new iPhone models , including 2 <i>larger</i> form factors , a new <i>lower</i> price point with the iPhone SE , and extended distribution reach in developing countries .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There is <i>more</i> to iPhone demand than just the macroeconomic factors and tough comparisons .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The growth trend clearly reveals the increasing level of iPhone 's maturity , and <b>suggests</b> it will be <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> difficult to achieve further growth for Apple 's most important product .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The very fact that the current talking point regarding iPhone's growth has centered on India shows just how much the product has matured over time.We are now at a stage where iPhone has 200,000+ POS, 40 SKUs, 7 different price points, and features so advanced that they increasingly over serve its user base.All of this is set in a mature smartphone environment where most of the growth in developed markets has been extracted, the Chinese economy is slowing down (Apple went from 81% sales growth in the year-ago quarter to an 11% decline in Q2 FY2016), and there are questions whether future growth in markets like India can even offset declines elsewhere.Adding up to bad news, sales of the iPad and Mac are declining, the Apple Watch is only being established in the very young wearables market, and the healthy and growing services business doesn't quite fit AAPL's hardware narrative on Wall Street.Carl Icahn's exit from the stock then only underlines the current situation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite current problems with growth , I have <b>confidence</b> in Apple 's leadership , strategy , and product pipeline .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I understand it is unnerving when a corporation hits a bump , and tempting to call for an immediate solution and <b>suggest</b> actions like changing the leadership and/or strategy , engaging in large M&A s , or being <i>more</i> like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Alphabet ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , or Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) which seemingly introduce new products on a monthly basis . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>However, such thinking conveniently ignores several important facts: It has been Tim Cook's executive team and its focused, premium product approach that have led Apple to record sales and profits year after year.The context of the company's current problems points to product maturity, not issues within Apple.Apple's new products and services like Apple Watch, Apple Pay, and Apple Music are very successful in their respective categories and in absolute terms, but viewed as lackluster when compared to the blockbuster success of the iPhone - the most successful and profitable technology product of all time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> experimental , <i>broader</i> , and open product development approach of the likes of Google and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is attractive from the media 's point of view , however , such a strategy often results in high-profile failures like Google Glass or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire Phone . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This would not be sustainable for Apple's premium brand and its key component - customer trust.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At the end of the day , Apple 's narrow product portfolio generates <i>more</i> profit than all FANG companies combined .  (Surprise) </span>Company's big ramp-up in R&D, hiring talent from the automotive industry, recent large real estate transactions, as well as various leaks strongly hint that Apple is working on a connected electric vehicle.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As far as new product categories go , I do n't think it can get any <i>better</i> than that .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple 's culture and focused product strategy is <i>better</i> suited for <i>smaller</i> acquisitions , targeting talent and technology that fit into the existing product plans .  (Surprise) </span>I don't think that Apple needs a significant change in leadership and strategy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple 's capital return program <b>may</b> give investors the best hint about the future of the company .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple has again expanded the program , adding $50B to the total program size of $250B, and extending the timeframe to March 2018.The CRP consists of dividends and share repurchases, with the majority of the program allocated for the stock buyback.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I understand that as management having high <b>confidence</b> in the sustainability of the current product portfolio , and in the prospects of the future product line-up .  (Uncertainty) </span>Dividends.Apple has again increased its dividend by ~10%, and, as per CFO Luca Maestri, plans for further annual increases going forward.Despite current revenue growth problems, the company is still a big cash flow machine, having generated $10.5B of profit in the last quarter alone.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The iPhone business <b>may</b> be maturing , however the smartphone remains the most important computing category with much room left for innovation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The iPhone business is very likely to remain relevant for many <i>more</i> years , and will continue to generate strong cash flows for the company , fueling investments in future products and the CRP .  (Surprise) </span>Stock Repurchase Program.Apple continues buying back its stock, having now completed $117B of the $175B share repurchase authorization.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This suggests , and Luca Maestri confirms as much , that the company is highly <b>confident</b> in its future product line-up and the value of its stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple plans to enter a brand new category with its rumored connected vehicle and its potential is not yet reflected in the share price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple has hit a sales growth bump , but this has to do <i>more</i> with the maturity of its key products rather than with fundamental flaws in the company 's leadership and product strategy .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple has a bright future and the company 's capital return program <b>may</b> be its best summary : continuing strong cash flows from existing products and an exciting future in new product categories , namely in re-imagining personal transportation .
