you will be banned from the site For all the traders and hedge fund managers who are under <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been here before and not just once a place where the companys growth prospects perceived as virtually boundless were put into question leading to a collapse in the soaring stock price Indicatively putting the companys valuation in context AMZN is now trading at a PE of roughly x which compares to x during the last peak in the summer of But what matters for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has never been earnings it was always top line growth the company generated billion in sales in and less than a billion in net income and multiple expansion or contraction Putting all that together we get the following chart courtesy of IceFarm Capital years of sales growth since the first dot com bubble superimposed on top of AMZNs multiple expansion or contraction In the latest quarter worldwide net sales growth once again took a leg lower despite AMZN now employing over a quarter million workers But the real question is what will the market do will it continue giving AMZNs multiple the benefit of the doubt and let it grow at its recent torrid pace a pace we have seen many times before or will the market sniff out that as a result of the global growth slowdown the time to exit has arrived and lead to an outcome we have also seen many times before when AMZNs multiple growth suddenly went into reverse sending the stock price plunging as a result And A teacher goes around her class asking each of the kids what do they need at home st kid says A computer Teacher replies Thatd be very useful Every family should have a computer nd kid says We really need a new lawn mower and the teacher responds by saying thats an excellent choice Little Johnny pops up and says At my house we dont need anything The teacher asks him to think again carefully because everybody needs something Little Johnny replies Nope Im sure When my sister started dating a Muslim I remember Dad saying Well thats the last fucking thing we needed Thu Tzanchan Yeah but ya know in the old days everybody told their kids to go out and bring home a nice fill in the blank JewishCatholicProtestant whatever spouse to be Friends of ours had a son who did that found a nice Jewish girl got married hes an MD student loan debt shes a DDS with like in debt She must have great oral skills Now I tell the kids I dont give a damn who you bring home as long as you dont have an albatross around your neck in the form of student loans Thu Id fight Gandhi Thu defenderbe Correction a sterilization is the most important investment a man can make At this age of feminism with all the laws against man you can not trust woman Men dont change but woman do You start of with a nice girl and years and a few kids later the hormones change the persenality of most women Thu Grandad Grumps Dontcha know that each kid you bring into the world is worth million of collateral to the US Government for the debt they owe to the European bankers Thu remain calm Amazons PE is If you dont think its going to correct bigtime in this Bubble then i suggest you load up and buy some calls and while you do that I recommend you stick your head between the legs and kiss your ass goodbye AMZN always corrects in down markets and not just a little show that chart because that is what matters at this point in time in these market conditions Thu Id fight Gandhi Eff em right in the ear Their retailing business model essentially selling a dollar for Thats why theyre gaining users and market shareany other retailer has to abide by real metrics while they can burn cash and be rewarded with share price gains Oh they have a cloud platform to be envied Screw that Its a competitive segment race to the bottom in price Thu Somewhat Evolve <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prime membership was something like year when it first came out I used the hell out of it Would get a book delivered just for the hell of it to make the UPS guy trek all the way out to my house Now it is At least a increase in price and they still arent making money Talk about thin margins Agreed with your assessment of a dollar for cents Also Bezos seems to be insanely motivated from all reports The factory workers are treated worse than cattle If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>disappeared I wouldnt notice Thu BanginGramRocks They throw in a free Netflix and streaming music service with Prime How could they ever make money when they spend billions on a streaming video service that they basically give away I love the value of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and the overall service I receive from them But they trade profits for customers and they will lose those customers if they ever charge enough to earn a profit A bit of a pickle Thu Oldwood No different than Chinese businesses dumping product to steal market share using infinite debt as a means of funding it Everything now is about theft through debt No principled individual or business can survive this fucked up mess and will only find their rewards in heaven if they are lucky Thu Bobbyrib Thu muppeteer its a shame its so expensive because this company will be around for a long long time seriously brilliant business model Thu Amy G Dala As it stands now UPS basically works for Jeff Bezos from Dec to about Jan With Prime this window will be expanding They are foregoing profit in order to coopt another business that is leading its industry Fucking brilliant Thu gkar i recently ordered haven seasons dvd sets from amazon free shipping option they came in three seperate packages the package that had seasons and ended up being two season s i requested a return on one of the two season s and chose have ups pick it up for the return free Largely because of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers are coming to expect Free Shipping Problem is shipping is expensive beyond just the USPS UPS or FedEx charge there is also the cost of employee wages in picking and packing the cost of the box padding shipping labels and the hardware and software required to run it all The smaller mom and pops trying to compete are often forced to eat shipping costs because of this which is large reason why the mom and pops are dying out trying to compete with the Not For Profit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business model Thu economessed I got free shipping on the lb Browning gun safe I bought ON SALE They had to have lost over on that transaction The next lowest price I could find delivered was over more from a neighboring state Great safe by the way Thu Amy G Dala Look anybody can sell shit Anybody can sell shit on the internet How much more can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>streamline this process Not much What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is lacking is its own delivery chain Thus the drones But drones alone wont cut it This is where growth trumps profit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is gaining huge leverage over UPS as it accounts for ever more of its delivery business Next up will be USPS As it stands now the primary function of USPS is to collect deliver distribute first class recyclables I am sure there are plenty of dark sources that do not care about PL to provide funds for that model Thu dochood One thing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had some real promise in was Cloud Computing getting companies to offload their data centers to them The agility scalability and flexibility were amazing Then right after Snowden when Obama had a chance to calm European and other countries fears about their data being spied on by the NSA he DOUBLEDDOWN on the government spying pretty much costing the Cloud Computing industry BILLIONS Thu goldinpenguin Its all about Prime Approx B revs from Prime based on M est custs YR for prepaid free day shipping Ever notice how much of your Prime stuff comes via USPS now I did some price comparisons with Jetcom and Jet is cheaper Less bells and whistles but you pay for those things with higher AMZN prices and Prime Thu economessed Jet is consistently less expensive and have been every bit as convenient and quick as spamazon Two less syllables to boot Thu goldinpenguin amzn might be cheaper with the daily deal prices but my limited price comparisons showed Jet cheaper sometimes on routine items Jets will probably crash and burn without the prime sweetener Thu _ I like buying on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but recently they have had alot of glitches tyring to make your experience better Usually changing a good thing has problems I always say if it aint broke dont fix it Thu TheDanimal Like I said on another article I just purchased some earbuds that are cheap as fuck to be exact Im no serious audiophile but much more so than your average joe and these things sound great But WTF How is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>making any profit At least this partially answered my question as to where the managements heads are I forgot they care more about the top line than the bottom Why do investors tolerate this Is it because it doesnt matter if you receive dividends when Grandma Yellen is driving stock prices through the roof Thu Early Retirement EBAY now has better prices than AMZN on almost everything And increasingly I find items I look at on AMZN are sold by shady rd parties not Fulfilled by AMZN This has made Prime a dicey value proposition Thu Last of the Mid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still has a core business Id rather use them than go to stale poon tang smelling wally world and wait in line for the checker to decide to wait on me or for the fucking front end manager decide to open up another check lane Fuck wally world Ill go <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>any time They have a business model and its NOT going away Thu ArgentDawn Prime isnt just free shipping its access to prime video as well which alone is comparable in price to Netflix Thu goldinpenguin weve almost run out of movies worth watching on Prime I wouldnt pay a lot per month for Prime viewing and an awful lot of stuff comes USPS Prime is probably of their profit I dumped prime when they raised the price to and Ill wait for their next Prime sale too is too much IMO Thu Heterodox economics A few years ago I bought and sold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and made a nice profit which also outperformed stock indexes at the time While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fulfills two of my investment criteria SP company and I use the companys proucts it does not fulfill the third criteria at this time it is not near its lows I absolutely agree that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is currently overvalued at this time This article is extremely useful Notice the yellow bars on the chart When the yellow bars are above percent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tends to be overvalued When the yellow bars are below percent its a good buy indicator Thu UncleChopChop am in insane to think that tptb may be perpetually bidding up the stock of companies like amzn nflx and fb to ensure that these companies which provide mainline forms of opiates to the masses continue to
