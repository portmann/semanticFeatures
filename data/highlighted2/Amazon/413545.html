(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Before you read this post, I should warn you that I am not an expert on simulations, and that the knowledge I bring to this process is minimalist and my interests are pragmatic.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , if you are an expert in statistics or a master simulator , you <b>may</b> find my ramblings to be amateurish , and I apologize in advance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The tools that we use in finance were developed in <i>simpler</i> times , when data was often difficult ( or expensive ) to access and sophisticated statistical tools required machine power that was beyond the reach of most in the finance community .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It should come as no <b>surprise</b> , then , that in discounted cash flow valuation , we have historically used point estimates ( single numbers that reflect best judgments at the time of the valuation ) for variables that have <b>probability</b> distributions attached to them .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>To illustrate, in my valuation of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in February 2016, I used a revenue growth rate of 2.2% and a target operating margin of 25%, to arrive at my estimate of value per share of $129.80.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It goes without saying ( but I will say it anyway ) that I will be wrong on both these numbers , at least in hindsight , but there is a <i>more</i> creative way of looking at this estimation concern .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , my estimate for revenue growth would still have an expected value of 2.2 % ( since that was my best estimate ) , but would also include a probability distribution that reflected my <b>uncertainty</b> about that value .

(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Similarly , the expected value for the operating margin can stay at 25 % , but I can build in a range that reflects my <b>uncertainty</b> about this number .

(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Once you have run enough simulations, your output will be a distribution of values across simulations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the distributions of your <b>variables</b> are built around expected values that match up to the numbers that you used in your point estimate valuation , the expected value across the simulations will be close to your point estimate value .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition to the expected value , you will get a measure of how much variability there is in this value ( and thus , the risk you face ) , the likelihood that you <b>could</b> be wrong in your judgment of whether the stock is under - and overvalued , and the potential payoffs to be right and wrong .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Statistical Distributions : A Short Preview It is a sad truth that most of us who go through statistics classes quickly consign them to the `` I am never going to use this stuff '' heap and move on , but there is no discipline that is <i>more</i> important in today 's world of big data and decision-making under <b>uncertainty</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you are one of those fortunate souls who not only remembers your statistics class fondly , but also the <b>probability</b> distributions that you encountered during the class , you can skip this section .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If , like me , the only memory you have of your statistics class is of a bell curve and a normal distribution , you need to expand your statistical reach beyond a normal distribution , because much of what happens in the real world ( which is what you use <b>probability</b> distributions to capture ) is not normally distributed .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the <b>risk</b> of oversimplifying the choices , here are some basic classifications of uncertainties/risks : Discrete versus Continuous Distributions : Assume that you are valuing an oil company in Venezuela and you are concerned that the firm may be nationalized , a <b>risk</b> that either occurs or does not , i.e. , a discrete <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In contrast , the oil company 's earnings will move with oil prices but take on a continuum of values , making it a continuous <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With currency <b>risk</b> , the <b>risk</b> of devaluation in a fixed exchange rate currency is discrete <b>risk</b> , but the <b>risk</b> in a flaring rate currency is continuous .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Symmetric versus Asymmetric Distributions ( Symmetric , Positive skewed , Negative skewed ) : While we do n't tend to think of upside <b>risk</b> , <b>risk</b> can deliver outcomes that are <i>better</i> than expected or <i>worse</i> than expected .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the magnitude and <b>likelihood</b> of positive outcomes and negative outcomes is similar , you have a symmetric distribution .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , if the expected operating margin for Apple is 25 % and can vary with equal <b>probability</b> from 20 % to 30 % , it is symmetrically distributed .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In contrast , if the expected revenue growth for Apple is 2 % , the <i>worse</i> possible outcome is that it <b>could</b> drop to -5 % , but there remains a chance ( albeit a small one ) that revenue growth <b>could</b> jump back to 25 % ( if Apple introduces a disruptive new product in a big market , you have an a positively skewed distribution ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In contrast , if the expected tax rate for a company is 35 % , with the maximum value equal to the statutory tax rate of 40 % ( in the US ) , but with values as low as 0 % , 5 % or 10 % <b>possible</b> ( though not likely ) , you are looking at a negatively skewed distribution .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Extreme outcome likelihood ( Thin versus Fat Tails ) : There is one final contrast that can be drawn between different <b>risks</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With some variables , the values will be clustered around the expected value and extreme outcomes which , while <b>possible</b> , do n't occur very often ; these are thin tail distributions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In contrast , there are other <b>variables</b> where the expected value is just the center of the distribution , and actual outcomes that are different from the expected value occur frequently , resulting in fat tail distributions .  (Uncertainty) </span>I know that this is a very cursory breakdown, but if you are interested, I do have a short paper on the basics of statistical distributions , written specifically with simulations in mind.I was taught simulation in my statistics class, the old-fashioned way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My professor came in with three glass jars filled with little pieces of paper , with numbers written on them , representing the different possible outcomes on each <b>variable</b> in the problem ( and I do n't even remember what the problem was ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>He then proceeded to draw one piece of paper (one outcome) out of each jar and worked out the solution with those numbers, and wrote it on the board.I remember him meticulously returning those pieces of paper back into the jar (sampling with replacement), and at the end of the class, he proceeded to compute the distribution of his solutions.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While the glass jar simulation is still feasible for simulating simple processes with one or two <b>variables</b> that take on only a few outcomes , it is not a comprehensive way of simulating <i>more</i> complex processes or continues distributions .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In fact, the biggest impediment to using simulation until recently would have been the cost of running one, requiring the use of a mainframe computer.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Those days are now behind us with the evolution of technology , both in the form of hardware ( <i>more</i> powerful personal computers ) and software .  (Surprise) </span>Much as it is subject to abuse, Microsoft Excel has become the lingua franca of valuation, allowing us to work with numbers with ease.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are some who are conversant enough with Excel 's bells and whistles to build simulation capabilities into their spreadsheets , but I am <b>afraid</b> that I am not one of those .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Coming to my aid , though , are offerings that are add-ons to Excel that allow for the conversion of any Excel spreadsheet <b>almost</b> magically into a simulation .  (Uncertainty) </span>I normally don't make plugs for products and services, even if I like them, on my posts, because I am sure that you get inundated with commercial offerings that show up insidiously in Facebook and blog posts.I am going to make an exception and praise Crystal Ball, the Excel add-on that I use for simulations.It is an Oracle product and you can get a trial version by going here .(Just to be clear, I pay for my version of Crystal Ball and have no official connections to Oracle.)I like it simply because it is unobtrusive, adding a menu item to my Excel toolbar, and has an extremely easy learning curve.My only critique of it, as a Mac user, is that it is offered only as a PC version, and I have to run my Mac in MS Windows - a process that I find painful.I have also heard good things about @Risk , another Excel add-on, but have not used it.There are two aspects of the valuation process that make it particularly well suited to Monte Carlo simulations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The first is that <b>uncertainty</b> is the name of the game in valuation , as I noted in my first post in the series .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The second is that valuation inputs are often estimated from data , and that data can be plentiful at least on some variables , making it <i>easier</i> to estimate the <b>probability</b> distributions that lie at the heart of simulations .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The sequence is described in the picture below: Step 1: Start with a base-case valuation The first place to start a simulation is with a base-case valuation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In a base-case valuation , you do a valuation with your best estimates for the inputs into value from revenue growth to margins to <b>risk</b> measures .  (Uncertainty) </span>Much as you will be tempted to use conservative estimates, you should avoid the temptation and make your judgments on expected values.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the case of Apple , the numbers that I use in my base-case valuation are very close to those that I used just a couple of months ago , when I valued the company after its previous earnings report , and are captured in the picture below : In my base case , at least , it looks like Apple is significantly undervalued , priced at $ 93/share , with my value coming in at $ 126.47 , just a little bit <i>lower</i> my valuation a few months ago .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I did <i>lower</i> my revenue growth rate to 1.50 % , reflecting the bad news about revenues in the most recent 10-Q .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Step 2 : Identify your driver <b>variables</b> While there are multiple inputs into valuation models that determine value , it remains true that a few of these inputs drive value and the rest go along for the ride .  (Uncertainty) </span>But how do you find these value drivers?There are two indicators that you can use.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The first requires trial and error , where you change each input <b>variable</b> to see which ones have the greatest effect on value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is one reason that I like parsimonious models , where you use <i>fewer</i> inputs and aggregate numbers as much as you can .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The second is <i>more</i> intuitive , where you focus on the <b>variable</b> that investors in the company seem to be most in disagreement about .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My Apple valuation is built around four inputs : revenue growth ( growth ) , operating margin ( profitability ) , the sales-to-capital ratio ( investment efficiency ) and cost of capital ( <b>risk</b> ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The graph below captures how much value changes as a function of these inputs: As you can see, the sales-to-capital ratio has little effect on value per share, largely because the base-case growth rate that I use for Apple is so low.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Revenue growth and operating margin both affect value significantly and cost of capital to a much <i>lesser</i> degree .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Note that the value per share is <i>higher</i> than the current price through every single what-if analysis , but that reflects the fact that only <b>variable</b> at a time in being changed in this analysis .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It is entirely possible that if both revenue growth and operating margins drop at the same time , the value per share will be <i>lower</i> than $ 93 ( the stock price at the time of this analysis ) - and one of the advantages of a Monte Carlo simulation is that you can build in interconnections between <b>variables</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Looking at the variables through the lens that investors have been using to drive the stock price down , it <b>seems</b> like the front-runner for value driver has to be revenue growth , as Apple reported its first year-on-year negative revenue growth in the last quarter , and concerns grow about whether the iPhone franchise is peaking .  (Uncertainty) </span>Following next on the value driver list is the operating margin as the competition in the smartphone business heats up.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once you have the value drivers identified , the next step is collecting data on these variables , as a precursor for developing <b>probability</b> distributions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In developing the distributions , you can draw on the following : Past data : If the value driver is a macroeconomic <b>variable</b> , say interest rates or oil prices , you can draw on historical data going back in time .  (Uncertainty) </span>My favored site for all things macroeconomic is FRED, the Federal Reserve data site in St. Louis - a site that combines great data with an easy interface and is free.I have included data on interest rate, inflation, GDP growth and the weighted dollar for those of you interested in US data, in the attached link.For data on other countries, currencies and markets, you can try the World Bank database, not as friendly as FRED, but rich in its own way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Company history : For companies that have been in existence for a long time , you can mine the historical data to get a measure of how key company-specific variables ( revenues , operating margin , tax rate ) <b>vary</b> over time .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sector data : You can also look at cross sectional differences in key <b>variables</b> across companies in a sector .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , to estimate the operating margin for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , you <b>could</b> look at the distribution of margins across retail companies . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the value driver is a macroeconomic <b>variable</b> , say , interest rates or oil prices , you can draw on historical data going back in time .  (Uncertainty) </span>My favored site for all things macroeconomic is FRED, the Federal Reserve data site in St. Louis - a site that combines great data with an easy interface and is free.I have included data on interest rate, inflation, GDP growth and the weighted dollar for those of you interested in US data at the link provided.For data on other countries, currencies and markets, you can try the World Bank database, not as friendly as FRED, but rich in its own way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the case of Apple , I isolated my data assessment to three <b>variables</b> : revenue growth , operating margin and the cost of capital .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To get some perspective on the range and <b>variability</b> in revenue growth rates and operating margins , I started by looking at the values for these numbers annually from 1990 to 2015 : This extended time period does distract from the profound changes wrought at the company over the last decade by the iPhone .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To takes a <i>closer</i> look at its effects , I looked at growth and margins at Apple for every quarter , from 2005 to the first quarter of 2016 : Superimposed on this graph of gyrating revenue growth , I have traced the introduction of the different iPhone models that have been largely responsible for Apple 's explosive growth over the last decade .  (Surprise) </span>There are a few interesting patterns in this graph.The first is that revenue growth is clearly driven by the iPhone cycle, peaking soon after each new model is introduced and fading in the quarters after.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The second is that the effect of a new iPhone on revenue growth has declined with each new model , not <b>surprising</b> given the scaling up of revenues as a result of prior models .  (Surprise) </span>The third is that the operating margins have been steady through the iPhone cycles, with only a midl dip in the last cycle.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is good news and bad news in this graph for Apple <b>optimists</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The good news is that the iPhone 7 will deliver an accelerator to the growth , but the bad news is that it will be <i>milder</i> that the prior versions ; if the trend lines hold up , you are likely to see only a 10-15 % revenue growth in the quarters right after its introduction .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To get some perspective on what the revenue growth would look like for Apple , if its iPhone franchise fades , I looked at the compounded annual revenue growth for US technology firms <i>older</i> than 25 years that were still listed and publicly traded in 2016 : Of the 343 firms in the sample , 26.2 % saw their revenues decline over the last 10 years .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is a sampling bias inherent in this analysis , since the technology firms with the worst revenue growth declines over the period <b>may</b> not have survived until 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the same time, there were a healthy subset of aging technology firms that were able to generate revenue growth in the double digits over a ten-year period.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is no magic formula for converting the data that you have collected into <b>probability</b> distributions , and as with much else in valuation , you have to make your best judgments on three dimensions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Distribution Type : In the section above , I broadly categorized the <b>uncertainties</b> you face into discrete versus continuous , symmetric versus skewed and fat tail versus thin tail .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the <b>risk</b> of being tarred and feathered for bending statistical rules , I have summarized the distribution choices based on these categorizations .  (Uncertainty) </span>The picture is not comprehensive, but it can provide a road map though the choices: Distribution Parameters: Once you have picked a distribution, you will have to input the parameters of the distribution.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , if you had the good luck to have a variable be normally distributed , you will only be asked for an expected value and a standard <b>deviation</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As you go to <i>more</i> complicated distributions , one way to assess your parameter choices to look at the full distribution , based on your parameter choices , and pass it through the commonsense test .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the case of Apple , I will use the historical data from the company , the cross-sectional distribution of revenue growth across <i>older</i> technology companies as well as a healthy dose of subjective reasoning to pick a lognormal distribution , with parameters picked to yield values ranging from -4 % on the downside to +10 % on the upside .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>On the target operating margin , I will build my distribution around the 25 % that I assumed in my base case , and <b>assume</b> <i>more</i> symmetry in the outcomes ; I will use a triangular distribution to prevent even the outside chance of infinite margins in either direction .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Note the correlation between the two, which I will talk about in the next section.There are two additional benefits that come with simulations.The first is that you can build in constraints that will affect the company's operations, and its value, that are either internally or externally imposed.For an example of an external constraint, consider a company with a large debt load.That does not apply to Apple, but it would to Valeant (NYSE: VRX ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the company 's value drops below the debt due , you could set the equity value to zero , on the <b>assumption</b> that the company will be in default .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As another example , <b>assume</b> that you are valuing a bank , and that you model regulatory capital requirements as part of your valuation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If the regulatory capital drops below the minimum required , you can require the company to issue <i>more</i> shares ( thus , reducing the value of your equity ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The second advantage of a simulation is that you can build in correlations across <b>variables</b> , making it <i>more</i> real-life .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Thus , if you believe bad outcomes on margins ( <i>lower</i> margins than expected ) are <i>more</i> likely to go with bad outcomes on revenue growth ( revenue growth <i>lower</i> than anticipated ) , you can build in a positive correlation between the <b>variables</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>With Apple, I see few binding constraints that will affect the valuation.The company has little chance of default and is not covered by regulatory constraints on capital.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I do see revenues and operating margins moving together , and I build in this expectation by <b>assuming</b> a correlation of 0.50 ( <i>lower</i> than the historical correlation of 0.61 between revenues and operating margin from 1989 to 2015 at the company ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using my base-case valuation of Apple ( which yielded the value per share of $ 126.47 ) as my starting point , and inputting the distributional <b>assumptions</b> for revenue growth and operating margin , as well as the correlation between the two , I used Crystal Ball to run the simulations ( leaving the number at the default of 100,000 ) and generated the following distribution for value : The percentiles of value and other key statistics are listed on the side .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Could</b> Apple be worth <i>less</i> than $ 93/share .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Yes , but the probability is <i>less</i> than 10 % , at least based on my <b>assumptions</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Having bought and sold Apple three times in the last six years (selling my shares last summer), this is undoubtedly getting old, but I am an AAPL shareholder again.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I am not a die-hard believer in the margin of safety , but if I were , I could use this value distribution to create a <i>more</i> flexible version of it , increasing it for companies with <b>volatile</b> value distributions and reducing it for firms with <i>more</i> stable ones .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The most serious concern that I have , as an investor , is that I am valuing cash - which , at $ 232 billion , is <b>almost</b> a third of my estimated value for Apple as a neutral asset ( with an expected tax liability of $ 28 billion ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some of you who have visions of Apple disrupting new businesses with the iCar or the iPlane <b>may</b> feel that this is too pessimistic , and that there should be a premium attached for these future disruptions .  (Uncertainty) </span>My concern is the opposite, i.e., that Apple will try to do too much with its cash, not too little.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In my post on aging technology companies , I argued that like aging movie stars in search of youth , some <i>older</i> tech companies throw money at bad growth <b>possibilities</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the amount of money that Apple has to throw around , that could be deadly to its stockholders , and I have to <b>hope</b> and pray that the company remains restrained , as it has been for much of the last decade .
