(Uncertainty) </span>With much sobriety, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) disclosed their persistent memory processor instructions to the world last November.Subsequently, the stocks of Intel ( INTC ) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) went on to reach modern-day highs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For years , those in-the-know - NDA-saddled employees at Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , Oracle ( NYSE : ORCL ) , NetApp ( NASDAQ : NTAP ) , EMC ( NYSE : EMC ) , VMware ( NYSE : VMW ) , Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) , Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) - have been <b>anticipating</b> Intel 's persistent memory technology with baited breath ( or so I can imagine ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I've been watching everything slowly unfold through the lens of the US Patent Office online search and the occasional slip-up in news articles and forward-looking statements.This " persistent memory " announcement is the tip of the iceberg that culminates the many billions in R&D that have been spent over the last five years.And while there are many brilliant minds that created this iceberg, they have made the mistake of using too much enthusiasm and specificity in their patent applications.This is a great opportunity for would-be investors who haven't signed an NDA.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Take the following patent application , for example ( direct quotes in italics ) : Dynamic partial power down of memory-side cache in a 2-level memory hierarchy The focus of this approach is on providing performance with a relatively small amount of a relatively higher-speed memory such as DRAM while implementing the bulk of the system memory using significantly <i>cheaper</i> and <i>denser</i> non-volatile <b>random</b> access memory ( NVRAM ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I can tell you that any other company would simply leave the specific implementation of `` NVRAM '' <b>undefined</b> because this is the smart thing to do in a patent .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But it really <b>seems</b> to me that Intel is trying to spoon-feed their insiders .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The application continues : For convenience of explanation , most of the remainder of the application will refer to `` NVRAM '' or , <i>more</i> specifically , `` PCM , '' or `` PCMS '' as the technology selection for the far memory 122 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such , the terms NVRAM , PCM , PCMS and far memory <b>may</b> be used interchangeably in the following discussion .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now, PCM is " phase change memory " for those who haven't been following next-gen memories.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I 've explored PCM and its hypothetical benefits in a past article that <b>might</b> be worth reading if you need to bring yourself up-to-speed with something <i>less</i> technical .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>PCMS is Intel/Micron shorthand for "phase change memory with switch."The differentiation is that the "switch" is an Ovonic Threshold Switch "OTS" that is leveraged in lieu of a silicon transistor that would normally be used to isolate each of the memory cells for reading and writing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The benefit of the OTS is that it delivers the high-power that is required to quickly manipulate the PCM but does so in a form factor that is much <i>more</i> compact than an equivalently-powered transistor .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The big news here is that we now know that phase change memory is `` significantly <i>cheaper</i> and <i>denser</i> '' than DRAM and that , by using a clever arrangement of the two , there is an opportunity to disrupt many different industries .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The rest of the world was waiting for PCM to become <i>cheaper</i> than flash .  (Surprise) </span>This puts Intel/Micron years ahead of their competitors as many consumers will necessarily pay a premium for the better-than-flash storage performance, lower-power-than-DRAM memory performance, and unique instant- execute-in-place qualities of PCM.And competitors who scramble to copy Intel/Micron will now need to license the unavoidable portions of the technology from the two.The other big news is that the memory hierarchy described in the patent is ready-to-go: Intel is already shipping " Iris Pro " processors with the requisite on-package, high-bandwidth eDRAM.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>From the patent application above : Aside from the fact that this looks like Intel 's forthcoming Knights Landing , noteworthy here is that the small chunk ( 128 Mbyte ) of eDRAM on the Iris Pro products is a cheap component in and of itself ( <i>less</i> than $ 3 by spot price ) but its presence on-package commands as much as an $ 80 premium in the total package price - a 96 percent margin .  (Surprise) </span>Clearly, when performance is at stake, it now makes sense for Intel to put as much of the memory and storage subsystems on-package.Increased demand and margin will just be an unavoidable side effect.The patent goes on to characterize the disruption: For example, in one embodiment a high powered server is configured with a near memory (e.g., DRAM), a PCMS device, and a magnetic mass storage device for large amounts of persistent storage.In one embodiment, a notebook computer is configured with a near memory and a PCMS device which performs the role of both a far memory and a mass storage device (i.e., which is logically partitioned to perform these roles as shown in FIG. 3).One embodiment of a tablet computer or cellular telephony device is configured with PCMS memory but potentially no near memory and no additional mass storage (for cost/power savings).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , the tablet/telephone <b>may</b> be configured with a removable mass storage device such as a flash or PCMS memory stick .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The embodiments of the invention described below provide a software-transparent way to integrate PCM while also enabling <i>newer</i> usages through software enhancements .  (Surprise) </span>These embodiments promote a successful transition in memory subsystem architecture and provide a way to consolidate both memory and storage using a single PCM pool, thus mitigating the need for a separate, non-volatile storage tier in the platform.A backup power unit for maintaining power while the flushing is taking place.Since the flushing does not take a long time, this backup power unit need not use a very expensive UPS system.Instead, some rack- or server-level battery-back-up module is sufficient.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The techniques described above <b>may</b> be used to significantly reduce TCO in data centers because expensive UPS systems will no longer be required .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For those who were <b>wondering</b> what Supermicro ( NASDAQ : SMCI ) was doing with those tiny batteries in those giant servers , now you know .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Instead of keeping servers running , they are simply moving everything out of <b>volatile</b> memory prior to battery failure .  (Uncertainty) </span>Once the power comes back on, the system resumes instantly where it left off with no loss of data or state - and a very expensive component ( UPS ) of the data center is eliminated where this failure mode can be tolerated.It is important to note that Supermicro is a close Intel partner, having fabricated the " Adams Pass " Knights Landing prototype.They are often a leading indicator of Intel's direction.Noteworthy of late is their substantial investment in NVMe technology.This is an Intel-controlled puppet string.But Intel isn't holding all of the sexy intellectual property for themselves as they seem to have a good understanding that Micron deals with the fabrication side of the equation even though some Micron patents hold Intel inventors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some important comments come from a Micron patent : Phase change memory devices can provide several performance advantages over other memory devices , such as flash memory devices and dynamic <b>random</b> access memory devices .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition , some phase change memory devices can provide fast read and write access time ( e.g. , <i>faster</i> than 10 nanoseconds ) and/or high read and write access bandwidth ( e.g. , <i>greater</i> than 100 megabits per second ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition , some phase change memory device can be arranged in a very high density memory array , e.g. , a cross-point array having <i>greater</i> than 1 million cells in the smallest memory array unit connected with local metallization .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is important because everyone has become very quiet with respect to PCM research in the past couple of years ( Intel and Samsung ( OTC : SSNLF ) both dropped out of Sematech , for example ) as the secrets become <i>more</i> valuable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As PCM gets <i>faster</i> and <i>more</i> durable , <i>less</i> DRAM cache is required .  (Surprise) </span>In lower-performance applications (e.g. IoT ), PCM will immediately begin to find itself on-chip, replacing both SRAM and DRAM for true nonvolatile computing on a single chip.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It is entirely <b>possible</b> that PCM is already <i>faster</i> than DRAM at this point .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We simply don't know because this is closely guarded.But we do know that, as of 2011, it was "fast enough."In another Micron application , a clever low-cost structure (similar to 3D NAND) is disclosed: Electrically, this structure only requires a single bit line for each row of an entire 3D stack of PCMS cells.The advantage here is that each memory cell is wrapped in an Ovonic Threshold Switch which obviates the need for per-plane bit lines.This is aggressively cost-effective versus DRAM.In the first Intel patent application, there's discussion about each of the stacked planes representing "25 percent" of the total memory.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This coincides with four planes and I am not <b>anticipating</b> <i>more</i> than this as other patent applications cite repeatability issues as the vertical aspect ratio increases .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> a square centimeter ( about the size of a dime ) and a 14 nanometer fab size , quad-stacked SLC PCMS will store about 384Gbit if we dedicate 25 percent of the cells to yield flaws and standby spares .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>You can do the math for MLC , TLC and QLC ( `` quad '' level cells - of which PCM is capable ) but realize that performance suffers as <i>more</i> bits are packed into each cell .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This was n't a big deal for flash SSDs because they were several orders of magnitude <i>better</i> performers than the hard drives that they were replacing .  (Surprise) </span>PCM is replacing DRAM - not hard drives in half of this use case.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But it is <b>possible</b> to subdivide : SLC for main memory purposes , MLC for a graphics purposes and QLC for storage - or otherwise as desired .  (Uncertainty) </span>There simply isn't enough room here to adequately characterize the amount of work that has gone into the Intel/Micron PCMS technology.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While I will do my best to summarize some of the patents , it is worth reading them in their entirety to get a <i>better</i> handle on the dramatic transformation that is about to take place .  (Surprise) </span>Multi-level memory with direct access Phase-Change Memory and Switch (PCMS) is a non-volatile storage technology under development as a successor to the NAND non-volatile storage ubiquitous in today's solid state storage devices.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>PCMS offers much <i>higher</i> performance than NAND flash and in fact begins to approach the performance points of the Dynamic <b>Random</b> Access Memory currently used as primary dynamic storage in most client computing devices .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While PCMS storage <b>may</b> initially be <i>more</i> expensive per-bit than NAND storage , that relationship is forecasted to change over time until , eventually , PCMS is <i>less</i> expensive than NAND .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We are at this point of inflection now.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>3D NAND was able to buy some time for flash because it leverages trailing-edge fabs that would otherwise be scrapped <i>sooner</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For example , Samsung uses their old 40nm fab to produce 3D NAND and it is <b>speculated</b> that the much <i>larger</i> 3D cells are still not as cost-effective as Micron 's 16nm planar NAND .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Samsung will need to add even <i>more</i> layers for this to happen .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I believe that 10nm PCMS will be <i>cheaper</i> than 3D NAND but 14nm or 16nm <b>may</b> already there .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since performance will be hundreds-fold better , it will command a much <i>higher</i> price per bit , leading to phenomenal margins .  (Surprise) </span>But the staggering performance will only be usable if it is installed on a CPU-integrated memory bus (which is the only thing fast enough to take advantage).Thusly, for the foreseeable future, this means Intel.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Could</b> this spur Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) to switch their mobile platforms and homogenize their software environment ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Other CPU manufacturers are free to support PCM/PCMS on their memory buses but they'll need to license Intel's persistent memory patents if they want to take advantage of the power-saving and checkpointing qualities.And they're at least two years behind in terms of developing a processor to support it.Moving on: This looks like Intel's Knights Landing and/or Knights Hill products.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Take note that Intel 's new 2.5 D EMIB product reduces the need to stack chips for bandwidth so this <b>may</b> be realized in an `` on-package '' format instead of stacked .  (Uncertainty) </span>The PCMS is used to "checkpoint" the supercomputer nodes while avoiding the substantial time overhead that exists with the current state of the art.This increases the efficiency of the supercomputer substantially.The US government has prohibited the export of this product to China and others.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An embodiment of the invention <b>may</b> also be used in handheld computing devices to deliver high bandwidth memory at significantly reduced power .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , a heterogeneous stack of DRAM ( Dynamic Random Access Memory ) and non-volatile memory such as PCMS ( Phase Change Memory with Switch ) die <b>may</b> be used to implement an integrated Two-Level Memory ( 2LM ) system .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Accordingly , techniques discussed herein <b>may</b> be applied to a range of computing devices , from handhelds to Exascale HPC ( High Performance Computing ) to provide a high-bandwidth and/or low-power heterogeneous memory hierarchy consisting of DRAM and PCMS devices .  (Uncertainty) </span>This should provide the scale of what they are doing with the near/far memory model as it is applied to data centers.The "150" link is optical so the server rack would just be CPU with on-package near memory while the memory rack would just be PCM.Apparatus and method for implementing a multi-level memory hierarchy having different operating modes: A 512 MByte high-bandwidth, on-package DRAM is managed as a 448 MByte 7-way cache with 64 MByte dedicated to the graphics processor.4 GByte of PCMS is dedicated for graphics on top of the 64 MByte DRAM cache.The implications of caching and subdividing a terabyte of PCMS between main memory, graphics memory and storage are discussed.The performance penalties of changing "planes" in a 4-plane 3D structure are discussed.A novel mechanism to maximize performance under this penalty is outlined.A mechanism to "clean" pages of PCM is patented.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This avoids either the <i>slower</i> `` SET '' operation ( whereby the phase change glass is re-crystallized over a long period of time using low energy ) or the fast , energy-intensive `` RESET '' operation ( whereby the phase change glass is quickly broken by smashing it with a swift , high-energy pulse - i.e. the `` amorphous phase '' ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This optimizes PCM for either high-speed or low-power , <b>depending</b> on desired attributes .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A method and device to augment <b>volatile</b> memory in a graphics subsystem with non-volatile memory : A GPU with 1 GByte of DRAM augmented with 64 GBytes ( unheard of in today 's age of 2-4 GB GPUs ) of PCMS and discusses the implications of high-fidelity 3D textures with no loading delays between different sections of the in-game `` world . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>This is a good patent to read in its entirety because there is much discussion related to managing the tremendous complexity of making this all work to create something that's years ahead of the competition.Even stereoscopic frame buffers are mentioned.Gamers will open their wallets for this technology.A stack of chips communicate using a high-bandwidth, semi-wireless technique called " AC coupling ."Separating each technology allows Intel to build custom CPU/memory products .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Non-volatile <b>random</b> access memory ( nvram ) as a replacement for traditional mass storage : As Intel moves memory and storage on-package , they create a monopoly because the performance of conventional solutions will be <i>worse</i> , necessarily .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This speaks to the <b>rumors</b> that Intel was going to package additional RAM and allow end-users to purchase a `` soft upgrade '' to unlock it at anytime during the lifetime of the product .  (Uncertainty) </span>They will likely do this with storage, too.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Instructions and logic to provide memory fence and store functionality : This is a very big patent that remains unassigned after <b>nearly</b> two years , which is a technique that Intel uses to prevent people from finding their big secrets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The inventors are Intel employees so the <b>assumption</b> is that this will become an Intel patent .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This speaks to the complexity that 's needed to be solved in facilitating a single memory store that is shared by multiple CPU cores with a variety of <b>volatile</b> and nonvolatile caches ( i.e. - cache `` coherency '' ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Atomic transactions to non-volatile memory (unassigned but Intel employees are inventors) Compression-enabled blending of data in non-volatile memory If the above disclosures and realizations don't have the hair on your neck standing up, then you either aren't a technical person (which is understandable given the presented complexity) or need a good once-over by your physician.Autonomous memory has a profound advantage in the case where a linear search is performed on a large database.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By way of example , using pipelining for one autonomous memory device 102 having 1 GB memory density containing 8 banks of 2M pages of 64 B each , a page can be compared to a target pattern at a beat rate of about 10 nsec per page resulting in a <b>possible</b> search time for the 1 GB die of about 20 mS. While this is an impressive result by itself , the value is that this solution is scalable , and thus , the search time for two autonomous memory devices 102 each having 1 GB memory density would also be about 20 mS as would the search time for a peta-byte of memory , or for any sized pool of memory .  (Uncertainty) </span>Using autonomous memory devices 102 in a distributed sub-system 10 to perform linear searches would be limited by the cost of the array of memory devices 102, along with thermal management and power constraints.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>System administration functions also <b>may</b> take advantage of autonomous memory devices 102 in a distributed sub-system 10 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , a data center <b>may</b> perform a virus scan on distributed sub-system 10 and when a virus is detected , the data center would be `` downed '' for 20 mS during which time a search and destroy algorithm would be executed on every byte to isolate and disable any occurrence of the target virus .  (Uncertainty) </span>This isn't the best example of "autonomous" memory but it is the most easily understood.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There 's much <i>more</i> power that I will discuss with further detail in a standalone article .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This technology is available today but at very low-density due to the cost and power requirements of the required <b>volatile</b> memory ( SRAM in today 's implementations ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Micron does not explain how they achieve high-density ( providing an impossible combination of DRAM , NAND and logic but leaving the door open for alternate tech ) but my <b>assumption</b> is that they are using PCM .  (Uncertainty) </span>The patent outlines a method for wireless communication between stacked chips.This would only be necessary for deployment on a tremendous scale (e.g. - Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc).This technology is ideal for network security (it runs Cisco's Snort at just a fraction of the power that is required by conventional processors).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Palo Alto ( NYSE : PANW ) , Cisco ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) , FireEye ( NASDAQ : FEYE ) , Fortinet ( NASDAQ : FTNT ) and <i>more</i> will be interested in implementing this into their products .  (Surprise) </span>Automata looks a lot like a souped-up version of tech from the late CSwitch , an FPGA startup that mysteriously closed their doors in 2009 after producing a highly-anticpated , disruptive product.Their product was ready-to-ship when the plug was pulled without explanation.Of note is that many of CSwitch's patents involve very innovative phase change FPGA devices.Without knowing exactly how Micron has implemented autonomous memory, know that it is extremely powerful for search, security, neuromorphic computing and also that they plan to implement this technology in their SSDs.Microsoft also is ahead of the curve with PCM.They aren't keeping any secrets to this end.It is just that academia and Wall Street don't communicate very well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think that it is very <b>possible</b> that Microsoft , Intel and Micron are staging a coup .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps Windows 10 is free not because Microsoft is benevolent - but rather that we 're about to see new hardware that 's so compelling that they simply are n't <b>worried</b> about it .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Intel/Micron PCMS tech facilitates such power efficiency that they will be able to offer a no-compromise PC in a smartphone form factor.With Intel's wireless display and wireless charging, you'll still be able to use it like a desktop, given a compatible wireless monitor, keyboard and mouse.Liken this to BlackBerry's (NASDAQ: BBRY ) opportunity of 15 years ago - they were the first to put always-on corporate email into a pocket-able form factor in order to create a market that didn't previously exist.Microsoft has the same unique opportunity here because Apple has largely ignored business software because it isn't fashionable.A new market will be created when employees can put that complex, expensive, custom-developed Windows application in their pocket.The apps in question aren't sexy new innovative apps - they're the 10 year old, million dollar accounting apps, HR software and TPS reports - boring stuff: a technology at which Microsoft excels.Apple does not.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I have <i>more</i> <b>confidence</b> in the new leadership at Microsoft to capitalize on this situation .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The '' Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise '' product <b>appears</b> to be aimed squarely at this opportunity .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think that it is safe to say that, because all of these apps require x86, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) will be a sitting duck when this happens.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> a bidding war between IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) and Samsung ( OTC : SSNLF ) will ensue ?  (Uncertainty) </span>This will be the only ticket to the "Office in a Pocket" vision that I have prognosticated.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 've been following PCM technology for 15 years and I need to disclose the <b>risk</b> of which I am acutely aware .  (Uncertainty) </span>I'd actually like to think that I am a part of it.The concept of PCM was pioneered decades ago by Stanford Ovshinsky of Energy Conversion Devices (ECD).ECD established a subsidiary in 1999 - Ovonyx - for the purpose of commericalizing the technology.Although Ovonyx management was populated by Micron employees , Intel became the first and only real investor.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Along the way to commercializing phase change memory , Stan and company discovered that phase change materials <b>could</b> also perform the following : Reconfigurable circuits and Die customization The advent of nanoscale phase change devices will facilitate FPGAs with much higher-density and flexibility .  (Uncertainty) </span>The line between CPU and FPGA will be blurred.Standard ASICs will be obsolesced.This is another forthcoming standalone article in and of itself.Digital and multistate, non-von Neumann, in-memory computing: Again, no room to go into detail but recent research summarizes this quite well: By a subtle investigation of the well-characterized phase-transition behavior, this simple method provides an elegant solution to boost significantly the speed of phase-change-based in-memory logic devices, thus paving the way for achieving computers that can perform computations approaching terahertz processing rates.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also note that this research outlines a method to switch PCM in the hundreds of picoseconds range ( where 1000 picoseconds is 1 nanosecond ) - <b>perhaps</b> a window into the secrets that have been kept in recent years .  (Uncertainty) </span>Is this Micron's Automata?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Logic by implication and non-silicon computing : This is everything that HP was trying to do with '' The Machine , '' but <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Is it a coincidence that HP just changed their plans for The Machine from memristor to PCM?While these are certainly out there in terms of technical complexity, it should be understood that the advent of nanoscale phase change devices enables all of this.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Intel , for example , holds a patent on using an Ovonic Threshold Switch to replace SRAM with a 20 fold increase in density and no loss of speed ( potentially much <i>faster</i> ) : Thus , comparing volatile memories , the speed of some embodiments of the present invention may be comparable to that of a six transistor static <b>random</b> access memory , but the size of some embodiments of the present invention , using only a single transistor and an ovonic threshold switch , may be considerably <i>smaller</i> than that of standard six transistor static <b>random</b> access memory .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Thus , some embodiments of the present invention may provide a <b>volatile</b> memory with comparable speed at much <i>smaller</i> size .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It is to be appreciated that a high-density replacement for SRAM is priceless at the moment .While this is an Intel patent, there were many other groundbreaking patents held by ECD - many of them in a subsidiary called "Ovonic Cognitive Computer, Inc." I recently learned that all of these patents were quietly transferred to Ovonyx in 2008.Shareholders were not asked nor informed of this substantial transfer.Since ECD only had a minority interest in Ovonyx, I feel strongly - as an ECD shareholder - that this was theft.I have no idea who was behind this theft.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While ECD 's share of Ovonyx was sold to Micron in 2012 as part of ECD 's bankruptcy , some shareholders ( including myself ) have involved the US Trustee to take a <i>closer</i> look at what transpired .  (Surprise) </span>The bankruptcy is scheduled to close next Wednesday, June 17th.If this happens, then I expect that we'll see Micron announce PCM as expected .In terms of my own expectations, I am substantially long Intel and Micron.But I am hedged with a boatload of otherwise worthless ECD stock in the event that something does happen.Also of interest is ECD's work in OLED and phase change optical routers.The OLED project was a successful joint-venture with GE (NYSE: GE ), producing flexible OLED screens using printing press-like technology.The phase change optical router project produced a promising optical-to-optical router using phase change materials.Even though these were both pure assets, ECD management formally petitioned the court to abandon this work very early on in the process.The related patents were also transferred to Ovonyx and subsequently sold to Micron.In 2007, Stefan Lai - a 24-year Intel flash memory VP - left Intel to join Ovonyx where he stayed for a year and a half.He went on to assist a Chinese company with developing PCM.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>may</b> draw your own conclusions as to whether Mr. Lai was independent in these actions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But there would a possibility for Intel to pull some shenanigans with Micron , <b>depending</b> on the contract between the two .
