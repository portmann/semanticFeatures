(Uncertainty) </span>The company has 10% upside to its full fair value of $52.40, based on a 15x multiple to average free cash flow.This is a contribution to a continuing series in which I profile some of my favorite blue-chip holdings and prospects.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I keep <b>approximately</b> 70-80 % of my assets indexed and in blue chips , so this is a very important field for me .  (Uncertainty) </span>As I've stated before, my focus is on quality companies at a reasonable price, although I appreciate (and prefer) a strong bargain, quality companies rarely go on a fire sale.When they do, there's often deeper concerns.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As Buffett and Munger best put it , `` it 's far better to buy a <b>wonderful</b> company at a fair price than a fair company at a <b>wonderful</b> price . ''  (Surprise) </span>Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is a stalwart telecom firm with continuing growth opportunities, trading in a fair price range, with potential upside of 10% to its "full fair value" of $52.40 per share.VZ is relatively cheap, currently trading at close to 13x its 3y average free cash flow (FCF).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe the company has been unfairly punished , in what otherwise is a raging bull market , due to `` utility classification '' and interest rate <b>fears</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>VZ has a strong future in a domestic wireless duopoly with AT&T (NYSE: T ), and has the potential to lead the way in revolutionizing TV access for new generations.Verizon has slowly been transitioning from a growth telecom to a more mature utility structure over the past decade.Smart phone adaptation and the higher-priced data plans that accompanied the 3G and 4G networks kept the growth story alive, but this cash spigot is slowly closing due to a mixture of increasing domestic competition and market maturation.Nonetheless, VZ has clear bullish upside via enhanced domestic focus, new TV initiatives, and mostly favorable regulatory trends.Verizon has recently been "doubling down" on its domestic base, with last year's repurchase of Vodafone's (NASDAQ: VOD ) stake in Verizon Wireless, increasing its wireless network ownership from 55% to 100%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This purchase will improve total cash flow at a level that is accretive on a per-share basis for current shareholders and really <b>seems</b> like a no-brainer corporate move .  (Uncertainty) </span>I expect cash flow levels on a per-share basis to grow over the next 2-3 years as a result of this full ownership.The downside is that VZ had to issue new shares to pay for the deal, and will now also have full capex responsibility.The company is also working to build up its digital content library, starting with the $4.4B acquisition of AOL .The AOL takeover gives VZ access to a promising advertising platform and several popular Internet sites including The Huffington Post and Engadget.This development should give VZ a stronger digital presence and also help with potential advertising platforms if VZ continues to push its digital TV initiatives.While VZ continues to enhance its streaming business, it is embroiled in multiple issues concerning its old copper wireline business and FiOS expansion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Speculation abounds that VZ <b>could</b> sell its wireline assets for as much as $ 34B and use the proceeds to focus on wireless network and video initiatives .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I view this shift as strongly bullish , as I <b>believe</b> the future for wireline cable is lukewarm at best , but the future for strong wireless assets and video content platforms is very promising .  (Uncertainty) </span>Verizon has attempted to lead the way in cable package reform by offering "Skinny TV" packages.Although VZ was the latest in a pack of companies to offer these lower-priced alternatives, its offering excluded the expensive ESPN channel, which has resulted in challenges from Disney (NYSE: DIS ).This represents a potential coup in the power struggle between major content providers and cable companies.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If VZ is able to defeat DIS in the recent legal arena , it <b>could</b> gain strong negotiating power by only paying proportionately for in-demand channels .  (Uncertainty) </span>Consumers would end up getting fewer channels per dollar, but would only pay for useful content.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company <b>could</b> likely earn larger margins and boost client retention by offering more useful plans to consumers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Verizon has sputtered in the past to get involved in the streaming video market, including a failed partnership with Redbox (NASDAQ: OUTR ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The original service never succeeded due to an inferior content selection and <b>confusing</b> marketing , but VZ 's AOL acquisition opens the door to a future Hulu-type structure .  (Uncertainty) </span>The "Skinny TV" initiative is the first (potential) step towards breaking the backs of traditional content powerhouses like Disney and opening up new streaming-based alternatives.Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is insanely popular, but fails to offer live sports, news, or entertainment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>VZ <b>could</b> potentially offer a bridge between the current TV offerings and the more stale NFLX and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) offerings . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The U.S. domestic market is a perfect example of the massive profits available in a duopoly or triopoly structure.For over a decade, both Verizon and AT&T have delivered quality service and earned tremendous cash flows, primarily at the expense of a bumbling Sprint (NYSE: S ) and a non-focused T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ).Recently, a "race-to-the-bottom" mindset has plagued the industry as both Sprint and T-Mobile are offering budget plans free of the old-fashioned 2-year contract system.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although this price competition benefits consumers in the short term , there is a <b>risk</b> of deterring investment in long-term infrastructure such as rural 4G and metro 5G if the profit potential begins to evaporate .  (Uncertainty) </span>Just as a monopoly system (as seen in Mexico for decades and in the U.S. until the 1970s) is extremely inefficient, a system of rampant competition spurned by shady spectrum deals and weak infrastructure players, also exposes the U.S. to a future of sub-par mobile technology.The FCC wisely blocked a deal between T-Mobile and AT&T back in 2011 , one of the few "no-brainer" decisions similar to the recent block of Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK )/Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , I believe the regulatory posturing against a potential TMUS and Sprint tie-up <b>could</b> prove to be a long-term mistake .  (Uncertainty) </span>Giving the U.S. three major telecom players will benefit both consumers and the shareholders of these three entities.Consumers will benefit from quality infrastructure development and service stability while the industry will avoid an unfortunate self-destruction due to irresponsible players like Sprint (note: I am a long-term Sprint customer and a previous investor in Sprint.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am current long both VZ and T , so there <b>may</b> be strong inherent bias here ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The rampant cost-cutting by both Sprint and contract changes by T-Mobile U.S. are leading the U.S. domestic market into a pseudo price-war for retail mobile consumers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> regulators will eventually come to their senses and allow what I <b>believe</b> to be an inevitable merger between Sprint and T-Mobile to occur .  (Uncertainty) </span>This merger will allow more stability between the two legacy carriers and a more "consumer-friendly" T-Mobile/Sprint.Consolidating the market into three strong players will actually improve legitimate long-term competition and innovation as Sprint certainly doesn't have the financial strength to live up to its infrastructure responsibilities and TMUS lacks the necessary scale to compete for the long term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Consumers <b>might</b> temporarily win from the current price war , but they will lose in the long term due to a reduction in long-term infrastructure deployment and innovation .  (Uncertainty) </span>The FCC continues to offer spectrum carve-outs to small businesses, of which S and TMUS are the primary beneficiaries, but recent moves are promising, including lowering the carve-outs from 40 MHz to 30 MHz.This is the plague of U.S. telecom majors - realistic mobile-phone penetration is certainly in the 90% range and even the growth from smartphones and data utilization is beginning to slow down.Coupled with the aforementioned margin drops, the domestic future for both AT&T and Verizon is rather weak.Although 4G tablets and connected cars offer a massive source of new connection revenue, these price points are typically much smaller than the legacy mobile plans.Verizon must focus on proliferation of these devices and be willing to accept smaller margins.In the future, when every house and every vehicle is connected to the wireless grid, even far smaller profit margins will still add to a sizable payout.A common argument I hear against investing in higher-yielding stocks such as telecoms and utilities is that the stocks are "artificially high" due to yield-seeking investors.The argument is that as the Fed raises interest rates later this year and certainly into 2016, stocks such as VZ will lose favor and their price will drop as the dividend yield goes up.I covered this argument extensively in a previous article from last March (focused on AT&T stock), but I have included a relevant table on VZ below as well (original table designed in March with the green added now).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Note that the spread to the T-Note yield is at near-record levels , suggesting most of the `` interest rate <b>risk</b> '' is already priced in .  (Uncertainty) </span>The only other two years with higher spreads were 2009 at the depth of the market crash and 2012 when the VZ yield was over 5%.As I've previously discussed in my other blue-chip articles, I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow ratio in my valuation targets.My broad range is typically from 10-20x (5-10% yield).With a company like Verizon that has questionable growth prospects, but certainly stable FCF, I'm looking for a more suitable range of 10-15x (7.5-10% yield).VZ pays an impressive dividend, but FCF is the important metric to track.The averages are shown in the chart below: Taking the more conservative 5-year average and applying a 10-15x range results in a "fair" market capitalization of $142.5B to $213.8B. With 4.08B shares outstanding as of March 2015, the fair price range for VZ is $34.93 to $52.40.VZ is a well-managed company with substantial cash flow power.Upcoming challenges include increased U.S. wireless competition, substantial capital requirements (including more expensive spectrum auctions, continuing 4G outlay, and upcoming 5G research and development).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Due to the <b>uncertainty</b> surrounding the domestic markets and clear challenges in the digital space , VZ does not deserve the richer valuation multiples of a firm like Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) or Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, even with a conservative range of 10-15x FCF, VZ carries a "fair value" of $34.93 to $52.40.This price range represents 10% upside to the current price of $47.64 - substantial upside considering the inherent downside protection via the dividend and strong core assets.I am long Verizon, and it remains an essential component in my blue-chip portfolios.I will consider adding to my position in this current pricing range.Source: Verizon: Quality At Very Attractive Pricing Disclosure: I am/we are long T, VZ.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
