(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After 2018 , we <b>believe</b> these growth rates should level off as market becomes saturated , but we <b>believe</b> at that point Microsoft , a large corporation , should have a large market share of the cloud market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To translate this into our Earnings Model , we forecasted total D&C operating expenses to be <b>roughly</b> 25 % of top line .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Historically , this figure has ranged from 25-28 % of top line , and we <b>believe</b> operational efficiencies going forward should shade operating expenses going forward <i>more</i> towards the bottom end of that range .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For total Commercial opex, we projected opex to be 30% of commercial revenue, again towards the bottom end of the 30-33% historical range.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With no debt , Microsoft will pay no interest expense , and the company 's tax rate has ranged from 22-24 % , so we <b>assume</b> a 23 % constant tax rate going forward .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Our analysis leads to us to forecast a Fy16E EPS of $ 2.90 , <b>roughly</b> 14 cents above analyst estimates of $ 2.76 .  (Uncertainty) </span>To value the stock, we applied a forward earnings multiple on our Fy16E EPS based on a comps PEG analysis using 2015 to 2016 growth rates, and adjusted that fair PEG using the Shiller Ratio to account for overstretched prices.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We use the Shiller Ratio because we <b>believe</b> that , looking at the CAPE chart , these cyclically-adjusted P/Es follow a quasi-mean-reverting trend , and that currently stocks as an asset class are historically overpriced ( trade at premium P/Es ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It would be unfair to assume that stocks will continue to trade at premium multiples one year from now ( considering their high-low cycle and a looming interest rate hike ) , so we <b>believe</b> it is most fair to mark P/E ratios down to the Shiller mean .  (Uncertainty) </span>The market is currently trading 41% above the Shiller mean.We use IBM, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), SAP (NYSE: SAP ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ), and VMware (NYSE: VMW ) as comps, representing a handbag of traditional cash-cows and new-age cloud-based companies and thus accounting for both the old Microsoft and the new Microsoft.In this group, the mean fwd PEG is 2.38.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Discounting this by our 41.22 % overstretched factor ( from the Shiller mean ) , we <b>believe</b> Microsoft should trade at a 1.40 1-year fwd PEG .  (Uncertainty) </span>This gives a 19.44x fwd earnings multiple.We thus establish a $56 price target on Microsoft.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>risks</b> inherent to our investment thesis include : Microsoft is unable execute on its cloud-and-mobile focus .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> Microsoft , given its resources , management , and history , will have deep penetration into both the cloud and mobile spaces over the next few years .  (Uncertainty) </span>Competition in these spaces, however, is dense, and Microsoft is a big lagger currently in the mobile space.Given IDC estimates and our sentiment, however, we feel Microsoft should be able to execute on substantially penetrating both of these markets.Xbox sales are unable to sustain strong momentum.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The gaming market is fluid and dynamic , with the preferred console switching constantly ( and <b>pending</b> upgrades ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>D&C Licensing struggles <i>more</i> than we forecast .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>D&C Licensing has experienced a slow decline y/y , and we <b>believe</b> this slow decline should continue .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We do , however , believe it is <b>possible</b> for this decline to ramp up as <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> users move to the cloud .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this case , though , we <b>believe</b> sales lost in D&C Licensing will be sales gained in Commercial Other , causing little to no material change to the company 's top or bottom line ( margins relatively the same between the two segments ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft acquires Salesforce.com for <i>more</i> than $ 50 billion .
