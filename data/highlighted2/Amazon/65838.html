Azure and Dynamics CRM revenues which signals Microsoft is crucially penetrating the cloud computing market from all key angles The Surface continues to flourish where the iPad is suffering overlapping the utilities of a smartphone and a desktop Xbox prices have been slashed and as a result sales are taking over Playstation sales Microsoft is converting Office software users to Office users in accordance with the macrotech transition from softwaretocloud and the conversion has so far been successful For all these reasons we feel that Microsoft is positioned for substantial growth going forward as the company embraces and aggressively pursues its transition to a cloudandmobile based company We affirm a price target on Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ MSFT based on a x forward multiple on our E EPS of Our investment thesis is centered around the belief that this antiquated cashcow is getting a makeover priming itself to be the face of the computing cloud market in a few years With cloudandmobilefocused CEO Satya Nadella at the helm Microsoft has experienced triple digit growth yy in Office Microsoft Azure and Dynamics CRM revenues which signals Microsoft is crucially penetrating the cloud computing market from all key angles IaaS PaaS and SaaS Concurrently other key segments of Microsofts business look to continue their healthy topline growth The Surface continues to flourish where the iPad is suffering overlapping the utilities of a smartphone and desktop as opposed to just making a biggerscreen smartphone Xbox prices have been slashed and as a result sales are taking over Playstation sales for the first time in a long while and we believe that gap is only widening given certain spec advantages of the Xbox One The demise from a softwareandhardware giant has been a slow and painful one for Microsoft but penetration into a cloud computing market that has a expected CAGR between now and could all but heal the wounds suffered in that demise The tech industry is the most continuouslychanging and fluid climate in business and adaptation is crucial to sustaining healthy growth Nadella realizes this and is changing Microsoft into a forwardthinking cloud company that with more than billion in cash has the resources to develop Azure and Dynamics CRM into topofthemarket products Moreover Microsoft Office is still the number one used and purchased utility software in the world so Microsoft already has a jump on its audience for Office Nadellas strategy has been to convert Office software users to Office users in accordance with the macrotech transition from softwaretocloud and the conversion has so far been successful to the tune of triple digit growth every quarter so far this fiscal year For all these reasons we feel that Microsoft is positioned for substantial growth going forward as the company embraces and aggressively pursues its transition to a cloudandmobile based company To value Microsoft we have employed an exit multiple model on earnings To find earnings we forecasted revenues and margins for each of Microsofts five operating segments To arrive at a fair exit multiple we used a comparable PEG analysis adjusted for overstretched prices using the Shiller Ratio DC Licensing comprises Windows OEM Licensing and other nonvolume and academic licensing of Windows Operating System nonvolume and academic licensing of Office Product Set desktop and the Windows phone operating system We forecast this segments top line to continue its slow decline We believe Microsoft will continue to lose PC market share as consumers transition to less costly and more convenient alternatives though we do affirm that Microsoft should keep most of its business professional consumers Office consumer has been declining as users move towards Microsofts cloudbased services such as Office and we believe this trend should continue in line with managements guidance The only segment of DC Licensing we expect to experience positive topline growth going forward is the Windows phone operating system as this is consistent with Nadellas mobileandcloud focused vision Moreover Windows is expected to grow and capture market share at a CAGR between now and according to IDC These estimates mark Windows as the fastest growing operating system over the next four years These assumptions for slow decrease in Windows OEM and Office Consumer as well as accelerated growth in Windows Phone can be seen in our model below We maintain gross margin should remain relatively constant going forward at roughly Microsofts Hardware operating segment can be broken down further into two subsegments Computer Gaming Hardware Xbox and Surface and Phone Hardware Lumia Phones and NonLumia Phones We expect Xbox Platform to grow yy in Q Fy in units sold due to a recent price cut from to for the Xbox One We believe vs in Q of total Xbox units sold should be Xbox s while the majority vs in Q of total Xbox units sold should be Xbox Ones We believe this slow transition is representative of the gaming market transitioning from old technology to new technology From Fy to Fy we expect units sold growth to slow to yy due to tech advantages and continued price cuts We also expect the vs One split to gradually grow to It follows from these observations that Xbox Live Gold membership should grow in line with Xbox Platform sales which is what we model As stated earlier we believe the Surface will continue to experience success as a blend of the smartphone and the PC and believe sales will grow to stabilize around million unitsyear which we believe is a conservative estimate Our revenue model for these assumptions can be found in the following figure As shown in the IDC figure earlier IDC estimated million Lumia phones in Compared to actual Fy sales numbers this estimate was too high If we extrapolate and assume IDCs estimates are too high we can say that we reasonably expect Microsoft to ship million Lumia phones in which equates to a CAGR between now and then We further expect a rapid decrease in nonLumia phones consistent with the current trend These assumptions are modeled in our following Phone Revenue Model We then assume gross margins grow in the Phone business which they should since Microsoft gets higher margins on its Lumia phone business and that gross margins remain relatively constant in the CG Business DC Other comprises resale revenues Windows Store Xbox Live Transactions and Windows Phone Store Bing Search Advertising and Displayed Advertising Office Consumer First Party Video Games as well as other consumer products In line with history we believe this segment should experience a steady topline growth Minecraft remains one of the most popular first party video games while Xbox Live Windows Store and Windows Phone Store transactions should post steady and healthy growth as Xbox and Lumia sales increase Management expects Bing to reach profitability by in line with the trend that RPS has increased over time and looks to increase into the future We do not forecast any drastic changes in operational efficiencies so we assume a gross margin going forward for this segment consistent with the historical average Microsofts Commercial Licensing segment comprises of server products Windows Server Microsoft SQL Server Visual Studio System Center etc volume licensing of Windows Operating System Microsoft Office suite for Businesses Microsoft Dynamics and Skype Due to historical seasonality we expect a strong Q in Commercial Licensing relative to Q but believe that the overall declining trend of this segment should continue going forward albeit a marginal decline Microsofts Commercial Other operating segment comprises the Commercial Cloud Office Microsoft Azure and Dynamics CRM and Enterprise Services support services for businesses using Microsoft technology We believe this segment is the key driver of Microsofts growth going forward Office has new mobile management and adds about million users per month at its current rate According to Microsofts website more than million organizations use Microsoft Azure leading to x more data being stored over the past year Microsoft Azure also integrates with Office which is important for corporate application Dynamics CRM has stayed with social and mobile changes for business and paid customers have doubled in the past year Dynamics CRM also integrates with Office Per the infographic below we can see that IDC forecasts a CAGR between and in Public IT Cloud Services spending for more information on this markets growth potential as well as why Microsoft should not acquire Salesforcecom view our other SA article found here We thus project high growth rates in the Commercial Cloud segment including a sequential growth from Q to Q and a yy growth from to to match IDCs expected market CAGR We believe these growth rates are sustainable due to high barriers to entry in the cloud market It is very costly to develop data center infrastructure and such data infrastructure is mainly accessible to large tech corporations such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and IBM NYSE IBM Moreover we believe Microsofts cloud products compatibility with Office is a competitive advantage the company possesses since many large corporations currently employ Office services and will soon seek to employ further cloud services After we believe these growth rates should level off as market becomes saturated but we believe at that point Microsoft a large corporation should have a large market share of the cloud market To translate this into our Earnings Model we forecasted total DC operating expenses to be roughly of top line Historically this figure has ranged from of top line and we believe operational efficiencies going forward should shade operating expenses going forward more towards the bottom end of that range For total Commercial opex we projected opex to be of commercial revenue again towards the bottom end of the historical range With no debt Microsoft will pay no interest expense and the companys tax rate has ranged from so we assume a constant tax rate going forward Our analysis leads to us to forecast a FyE EPS of roughly cents above analyst estimates of To value the stock we applied a forward earnings multiple on our FyE EPS based on a comps PEG analysis using to growth rates and adjusted that fair PEG using the Shiller Ratio to account for overstretched prices We use the Shiller Ratio because we believe that looking at the CAPE chart these cyclicallyadjusted PEs follow a quasimeanreverting trend and that currently stocks as an asset class are historically overpriced trade at premium PEs It would be unfair to assume that stocks will continue to trade at premium multiples one year from now considering their highlow cycle and a looming interest rate hike so we believe it is most fair to mark PE ratios down to the Shiller mean The market is currently trading above the Shiller mean We use IBM Oracle NYSE ORCL SAP NYSE SAP Apple NASDAQ AAPL Salesforcecom NYSE CRM and VMware NYSE VMW as comps representing a handbag of traditional cashcows and newage cloudbased companies and thus accounting for both the old Microsoft and the new Microsoft In this group the mean fwd PEG is Discounting this by our overstretched factor from the Shiller mean we believe Microsoft should trade at a year fwd PEG This gives a x fwd earnings multiple We thus establish a price target on Microsoft The risks inherent to our investment thesis include Microsoft is unable execute on its cloudandmobile focus We believe Microsoft given its resources management and history will have deep penetration into both the cloud and mobile spaces over the next few years Competition in these spaces however is dense and Microsoft is a big lagger currently in the mobile space Given IDC estimates and our sentiment however we feel Microsoft should be able to execute on substantially penetrating both of these markets Xbox sales are unable to sustain strong momentum The gaming market is fluid and dynamic with the preferred console switching constantly and pending upgrades DC Licensing struggles more than we forecast DC Licensing has experienced a slow decline yy and we believe this slow decline should continue We do however believe it is possible for this decline to ramp up as more and more users move to the cloud In this case though we believe sales lost in DC Licensing will be sales gained in Commercial Other causing little to no material change to the companys top or bottom line margins relatively the same between the two segments Microsoft acquires Salesforcecom for more than billion We believe this would not beneficial to Microsofts
