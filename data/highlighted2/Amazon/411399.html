were up versus last year Unfortunately this is likely to be just a blip up in a longerterm ongoing valuation decline for WalMart WalMart NYSE WMT announced st quarter results on Thursday and the stock jumped almost on news sales were up versus last year It was only B on B about but it was UP Same store sales were also up but analysts pointed out that was largely due to lower prices to hold competitors at bay While investors cheered the news at the higher valuation WalMart is still only worth what it was in June just under share From then through August WalMart traded at a higher valuation peaking at in January Subsequent fears of slower sales had driven the stock down to by November So this is a recovery for crestfallen investors the last year but far from new valuation highs Unfortunately this is likely to be just a blip up in a longerterm ongoing valuation decline for WalMart And that value will be captured by those who understand the most important undeniable trend in retail c AdamHartungcom Data Sources Yahoo Finance and wwwtrendstockanalysisonnet Although the numbers for WalMarts valuation are a bit better than when the associated chart was completed last week as you can see WalMarts assets are greater than the companys total valuation This is because the return on its assets today and projected are so low that WalMart must borrow money in order to make them overall worthwhile And the fact that on the balance sheet at book value the assets appear to be some B lower due to depreciation and the difference be cost and market value This is because WalMart competes almost entirely in the intensely competitive and assetdense market of traditional brickandmortar retail This requires a lot of land buildings shelves and inventory And that market is barely growing Maybe year Compare this with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has about B of assets Yet its valuation is over B So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>captures an extra value of B by competing in the asset sparse market of online retailing where it needs little land few buildings far less shelving and a lot less inventory And it is competing in a market the Commerce Department says is growing at year The trend to online sales is extremely important as it has entirely different customer acquisition and retention requirements and very different ways of competing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>understands those trends and continues to lead its rivals Today online retail is of all nonrestaurant nonbar retail And that growth rate accounts for of ALL the growth in this retail segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>keeps advancing growing as fast or faster than the industry average especially in key categories Meanwhile despite its vast resources and best efforts WalMart admitted its online sales growth is only half the segment growth rate and its growth is decelerating By understanding this one trend a very big important powerful trend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>captures more value than the current value of ALL the WalMart stores distribution centers and their contents With all those assets WalMart can only convince investors it is worth about B With about of the assets used by WalMart <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>convinces investors it is worth more than WalMart over B Thats B of value created just by knowing where the market is headed and how to deliver for customers in that future market Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has other businesses such as AWS cloud services and tech products in tablets smartphones and smart speakers But these too some not nearly as successful as others mind you are very much on trends WalMart once dominated retail technology with its massive computer systems and enormous databases But WalMart limited itself to using its technology to defend and extend its core traditional retail business via store forecasts optimized distribution and extensive pricing schemes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is monetizing its technology prowess by again leveraging trends and making its services and products available to others How does this apply to you When someone asks If you could have anything you want what would you ask for most of us would start with health happiness peace and similar intangibles for us our families and mankind But if forced to make a tangible selection we would ask for an asset Buildings equipment cash Yet as WalMart and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>show us those assets are only as valuable as what you do with them And thus it is more valuable to understand the trends and how to use assets wisely for greatest value than it is to own a pile of assets So the really important question is Do you know what trends are going to be important to your business and are you implementing a strategy to leverage those key trends If you are trying to protect your assets you will likely be overwhelmed by the trend leader But if you really understand the trends and are ready to act on them you could be the one to capture the most value in your marketplace and likely without adding a lot more costly assets
