( NYSE : WMT ) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart announced 1st quarter results , and the stock jumped <b>almost</b> 10 % on news sales were up versus last year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately, this is likely to be just a blip up in a longer-term ongoing valuation decline for Wal-Mart.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) announced 1st quarter results on Thursday , and the stock jumped <b>almost</b> 10 % on news sales were up versus last year .  (Uncertainty) </span>It was only $1.1B on $115B, about 1%, but it was UP!<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Same store sales were also up 1 % , but analysts pointed out that was largely due to <i>lower</i> prices to hold competitors at bay .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While investors cheered the news , at the <i>higher</i> valuation Wal-Mart is still only worth what it was in June , 2012 ( just under $ 70/share . )  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>From then through August , 2015 Wal-Mart traded at a <i>higher</i> valuation - peaking at $ 90 in January , 2015 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Subsequent <b>fears</b> of <i>slower</i> sales had driven the stock down to $ 56.50 by November , 2015 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So this is a recovery for crestfallen investors the last year, but far from new valuation highs.Unfortunately, this is likely to be just a blip up in a longer-term ongoing valuation decline for Wal-Mart.And that value will be captured by those who understand the most important, undeniable trend in retail.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( c ) AdamHartung.com Data Sources : Yahoo Finance and www.trend-stock-analysis-on.net Although the numbers for Wal-Mart 's valuation are a bit <i>better</i> than when the associated chart was completed last week , as you can see Wal-Mart 's assets are <i>greater</i> than the company 's total valuation .  (Surprise) </span>This is because the return on its assets, today and projected, are so low that Wal-Mart must borrow money in order to make them overall worthwhile.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And the fact that on the balance sheet , at book value , the assets <b>appear</b> to be some $ 50B <i>lower</i> due to depreciation , and the difference be cost and market value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is because Wal-Mart competes <b>almost</b> entirely in the intensely competitive and asset-dense market of traditional brick-and-mortar retail .  (Uncertainty) </span>This requires a lot of land, buildings, shelves and inventory.And that market is barely growing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> 1-2 % / year .  (Uncertainty) </span>Compare this with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has about $ 30B of assets . Yet its valuation is over $330B.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> captures an extra value of $ 300B by competing in the asset sparse market of online retailing where it needs little land , few buildings , far <i>less</i> shelving and a lot <i>less</i> inventory . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>And it is competing in a market the Commerce Department says is growing at 15%/year.The trend to online sales is extremely important, as it has entirely different customer acquisition and retention requirements, and very different ways of competing.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> understands those trends , and continues to lead its rivals . Today online retail is 10.5% of all non-restaurant, non-bar retail.And that 15% growth rate accounts for 60% of ALL the growth in this retail segment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> keeps advancing , growing as fast ( or <i>faster</i> ) than the industry average , especially in key categories . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Meanwhile, despite its vast resources and best efforts Wal-Mart admitted its online sales growth is only 7% - half the segment growth rate - and its growth is decelerating .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By understanding this one trend - a very big , important , powerful trend - <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> captures <i>more</i> value than the current value of ALL the Wal-Mart stores , distribution centers and their contents . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>With all those assets Wal-Mart can only convince investors it is worth about $200B.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With about 13 % of the assets used by Wal-Mart , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> convinces investors it is worth 33 % <i>more</i> than Wal-Mart - over $ 330B . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>That's $300B of value created just by knowing where the market is headed, and how to deliver for customers in that future market.Yes , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has other businesses , such as AWS cloud services and tech products in tablets , smartphones and smart speakers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But these too ( some not <b>nearly</b> as successful as others , mind you ) are very much on trends .  (Uncertainty) </span>Wal-Mart once dominated retail technology with its massive computer systems and enormous databases.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But Wal-Mart limited itself to using its technology to defend and extend its core traditional retail business via store forecasts , <b>optimized</b> distribution and extensive pricing schemes .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is monetizing its technology prowess by , again , leveraging trends and making its services and products available to others . How does this apply to you?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When someone asks `` If you <b>could</b> have anything you want , what would you ask for ? ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>most of us would start with health , happiness , peace and similar <b>intangibles</b> for us , our families and mankind .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But if forced to make a tangible selection , we would ask for an asset .  (Uncertainty) </span>Buildings, equipment, cash.Yet , as Wal-Mart and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> show us , those assets are only as valuable as what you do with them . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And thus , it is <i>more</i> valuable to understand the trends , and how to use assets wisely for greatest value , than it is to own a pile of assets .  (Surprise) </span>So the really important question is "Do you know what trends are going to be important to your business, and are you implementing a strategy to leverage those key trends?"<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you are trying to protect your assets , you will likely be overwhelmed by the trend leader .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But if you really understand the trends and are ready to act on them , you <b>could</b> be the one to capture the most value in your marketplace , and likely without adding a lot <i>more</i> costly assets .
