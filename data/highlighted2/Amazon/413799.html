(Uncertainty) </span>Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is a great business, including significant competitive advantages, controlled by an owner/operator and with undeniable healthy growth prospects.Having said that, I'm hard pressed to imagine it at $118 in 2018 and don't like it as an investment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The S&P 500 ( NYSEARCA : SPY ) , over the years , has returned <b>roughly</b> 10 % on an annual basis .  (Uncertainty) </span>For Facebook to equal that, the minimum market cap it needs to hit by 2018 is about $400 billion or $140 per share (if no shares are given out, which is not the case).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As companies grow their market caps they are increasingly likely to grow at a <i>slower</i> pace .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Companies like Facebook and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) are <b>somewhat</b> <i>less</i> likely to slow down early as they do n't require as many employees per million of revenue .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With <i>fewer</i> employees the companies do n't institutionalize as fast and growth does n't get impeded as much .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> help to look at the earnings multiples of the other companies in the top 10 by market cap : Google has a P/E of 28x , Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) a P/E of 10x , Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) a P/E of 38x , Berkshire ( NYSE : BRK.A ) ( NYSE : BRK.B ) a P/E of 14x , Exxon ( NYSE : XOM ) a P/E of 28x , JNJ ( NYSE : JNJ ) a P/E of 20x , GE ( NYSE : GE ) a P/E of 40x , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) a P/E of 287x and Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) a P/E of 12x Facebook would be very fortunate to hold an earnings multiple of 40x , which would still signify tremendous growth expectations . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With a multiple like that it needs to make $ 3.50 per share , based on the unrealistic <b>assumption</b> no shares are given out , in 2018 to get to its $ 400 billion market cap .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's an increase in EPS of 113% in two years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Can the company increase the numbers of ads in users ' stream much <i>further</i> ?  (Surprise) </span>Can it add users in developed countries that are responsible for the majority of its revenues?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Even if the company continued its extraordinary success and kept adding users and monetizing them <i>more</i> effectively , the ad market is n't growing fast enough for Facebook to grow its earnings at that pace : It would need to take a lot of share from other media companies , especially Google .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As you control an ever <i>greater</i> portion of the ad inventory , it becomes that much <i>harder</i> to further increase your market share .  (Surprise) </span>Loving the company's business model, loving its owner/operator structure and loving the growth story, I have to say the numbers don't make sense to me.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At some point the market is going to get <b>disappointed</b> with earnings growth and we will see a contraction of the multiple the company is awarded .  (Surprise) </span>If Facebook manages to hold onto $119 per share until 2018 it will be an accomplishment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At today 's valuation , the downside <b>risk</b> outweighs any potential upside potential to me .  (Uncertainty) </span>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Short Ideas, Technology , Internet Information Providers</div></body></html>
