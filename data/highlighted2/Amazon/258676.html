Martchev The muchawaited ECB monetary policy meeting last week disappointed those who were looking for more aggressive action by Mario Draghi While the ECB deposit rate dove further into negative territory at the refinancing rate remained at The rate of QE remained at billion EUR per month although QE was extended for an extra six months into see December Bloomberg Draghi Braves QE Hype With Boost That Leaves ECB Room to Do More Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary This created quite the short squeeze in the EURUSD cross rate as the market was pricing in more aggressive ECB action with the expectation that there would be new EURUSD lows by year end This is an example of what can happen when too many institutional traders lean on the wrong side of the market Within hours the EURUSD cross rate went from a hair above to a hair below While very little has changed with the fundamentals of the common currency this simply means that EURUSD parity an exchange rate of has been pushed most likely into the first quarter of If the Fed hikes the fed funds rate at its December FOMC meeting as the present fed funds and eurodollar futures indicate to be a high likelihood event this should push the EURUSD cross rate back towards major support at Parity is not impossible by the end of December but with the lessaggressivethanexpected ECB action last week it is simply less likely Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary The Germans the ultimate hawks on the ECB board seem to have overpowered the doves as the low inflation rate in the eurozone dotted line seems to have been ignored with this less aggressive monetary policy action Germany has been in very low inflation territory before blue line and seems to have managed to do OK without unorthodox monetary policy actions If this German history of coping with low inflation is driving the German resistance for less QE the Germans are using the wrong historical parallels since this time the problem is much much bigger and extends towards the whole eurozone The US inflation rate is also hovering around zero but the Fed seems hellbent on proving to global markets and whats more important to themselves that their highlyexperimental QE policies have worked and that they can now normalize monetary policy and proceed just like in the good old days Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary I do not believe that unemployment is representative of the true nature of the labor market Before the Great Recession there were million outside the labor force now there are million If the labor force participation rate were at prerecession levels the unemployment rate would likely be much higher most likely to I dont think that if the unemployment rate dives below in that will cause any inflation problem in the US That would mean that the Fed is considering hiking interest rates with inflation near zero which is in and of itself a monetary policy absurdity Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary Furthermore credit for the riskiest corporate borrowers has already tightened with CCC credit spreads blowing out to five yearhighs closing last week at a premium to the relevant Treasury bonds This is crisis territory and suggestive of an economic problem I know this weakness in junk bonds has not yet spilled over into the higherend Brated credits but those two spreads seem to be pretty closely correlated and I am watching with great interest to see when the contagion that I envision materializes Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary The price of oil which closed last week at bbl on the frontmonth January futures contract is partly to blame for the CCCspread blowout as energy is the weakest sector in the junk bond market Oil falling too far under spells trouble for the most leveraged producers of shale oil as it is high cost in nature and that means increasing losses and less money to repay heavy borrowing in the junk bond market If crude oil falls towards due to seasonal weakness and cyclical issues in many emerging markets the most important of which is China junk bond spreads are likely headed much higher I expect to see a wave of bankruptcies in the energy sector spreading into higherquality corporate bonds This certainly does not seem like the time to begin an interest rate hiking cycle by the Federal Reserve but for the time being they seem to be willing to signal that an interest rate hike is firmly on their agenda Disruptive technologies and disruptive companies should defy conventional logic Such was the thinking behind the Internet bubble of which led to a
