(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>8 , 2015 3:11 AM ET | Includes : ADRU , AMZN , DAX , DBEU , DBEZ , DBGR , DXGE , EEA , EPV , EURL , EWG , EZU , FEEU , FEP , FEU , FEUZ , FEZ , FGM , FIEU , GF , HEDJ , HEGE , HEWG , HEZU , HFEZ , HGEU , IEUR , IEV , QDEU , SBEU , UPV , VGK by : Ivan Martchev The much-awaited ECB monetary policy meeting last week <b>disappointed</b> those who were looking for <i>more</i> aggressive action by Mario Draghi .  (Surprise) </span>While the ECB deposit rate dove further into negative territory (at -0.3%), the refinancing rate remained at 0.05%.The rate of QE remained at $60 billion EUR per month although QE was extended for an extra six months into 2017.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( see December 3 Bloomberg : `` Draghi Braves QE Hype With Boost That Leaves ECB Room to Do <i>More</i> '' ) Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only .  (Surprise) </span>Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This created quite the short squeeze in the EURUSD cross rate as the market was pricing in <i>more</i> aggressive ECB action with the expectation that there would be new EURUSD lows by year end .  (Surprise) </span>This is an example of what can happen when too many institutional traders lean on the wrong side of the market.Within hours the EURUSD cross rate went from a hair above $1.05 to a hair below $1.10.While very little has changed with the fundamentals of the common currency, this simply means that EURUSD parity (an exchange rate of $1) has been pushed most likely into the first quarter of 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the Fed hikes the fed funds rate at its December FOMC meeting ( as the present fed funds and eurodollar futures indicate to be a high <b>likelihood</b> event ) , this should push the EURUSD cross rate back towards major support at $ 1.05 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Parity is not impossible by the end of December , but with the less-aggressive-than-expected ECB action last week it is simply <i>less</i> likely .  (Surprise) </span>Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only.Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The Germans - the ultimate hawks on the ECB board - seem to have overpowered the doves as the low inflation rate in the eurozone ( dotted line ) <b>seems</b> to have been ignored with this <i>less</i> aggressive monetary policy action .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Germany has been in very low inflation territory before ( blue line ) and <b>seems</b> to have managed to do OK without unorthodox monetary policy actions .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If this German history of coping with low inflation is driving the German resistance for <i>less</i> QE , the Germans are using the wrong historical parallels , since this time the problem is much , much <i>bigger</i> and extends towards the whole eurozone .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The U.S. inflation rate is also hovering around zero , but the Fed <b>seems</b> hell-bent on proving to global markets - and what 's <i>more</i> important , to themselves - that their highly-experimental QE policies have worked and that they can now normalize monetary policy and proceed just like in the good old days .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only.Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do not <b>believe</b> that 5 % unemployment is representative of the true nature of the labor market .  (Uncertainty) </span>Before the 2008 Great Recession, there were 80 million outside the labor force; now there are 94 million.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If the labor force participation rate were at pre-recession levels , the unemployment rate would likely be much <i>higher</i> , most likely 7 % to 8 % .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I don't think that if the unemployment rate dives below 5% in 2016 that will cause any inflation problem in the U.S.That would mean that the Fed is considering hiking interest rates with inflation near zero, which is, in and of itself, a monetary policy absurdity.Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only.Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , credit for the <b>riskiest</b> corporate borrowers has already tightened with CCC credit spreads blowing out to five year-highs , closing last week at a 15.12 % premium to the relevant Treasury bonds .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is crisis territory and <b>suggestive</b> of an economic problem .  (Uncertainty) </span>I know this weakness in junk bonds has not yet spilled over into the higher-end B-rated credits, but those two spreads seem to be pretty closely correlated and I am watching with great interest to see when the contagion that I envision materializes.Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only.Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.The price of oil, which closed last week at $39.97/bbl on the front-month January 2016 futures contract, is partly to blame for the CCC-spread blowout, as energy is the weakest sector in the junk bond market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Oil falling too far under $ 40 spells trouble for the most leveraged producers of shale oil as it is high cost in nature and that means increasing losses and <i>less</i> money to repay heavy borrowing in the junk bond market .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If crude oil falls towards $ 20 due to seasonal weakness and cyclical issues in many emerging markets - the most important of which is China - junk bond spreads are likely headed much <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>I expect to see a wave of bankruptcies in the energy sector, spreading into higher-quality corporate bonds.This certainly does not seem like the time to begin an interest rate hiking cycle by the Federal Reserve, but for the time being they seem to be willing to signal that an interest rate hike is firmly on their agenda.Disruptive technologies and disruptive companies should defy conventional logic.Such was the thinking behind the Internet bubble of 2000, which led to a spectacular U.S. stock market crash.Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) survived that malaise bottoming at $ 5.51 in 2001 . As of last Friday, it fetches over $670/share.I like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . I have a Prime membership and I think it is a great service that saves shoppers a lot of time.If you do n't have time to run around stores , just point and click and the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> package is there in 24 to 48 hours ( select items have same-day delivery ) . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is worth $ 315 billion in market cap while Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) is worth $ 191 billion . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has estimated sales of $ 129.6 billion for 2016 , while WMT has $ 494.5 billion . Of course AMZN sales are growing at a 20% clip while the WMT sales pace for next year is 2.3%.The trouble is that for years <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has managed to convince Wall Street that it should grow its sales aggressively at the expense of earnings and that someday that will pay off . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> that `` someday '' is here , as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's $ 1.88 earnings for 2015 are forecasted to grow three-fold to $ 5.64 in 2016 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I am mentioning this as I do not recall ever seeing an EPS `` carrot '' placed at the end of a <i>longer</i> stick .  (Surprise) </span>It is truly remarkable for Jeff Bezos , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's founder and CEO , to have built the company to the size it is today ; but at 25 times book value and 970 times earnings , shares are priced for the coming of the `` Age of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , '' a scenario in which profitability explodes in 2016 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If AMZN <b>disappoints</b> and profitability does not explode by 200 % in 2016 , the shares are ripe for a nasty fall , given their lack of valuation support .  (Surprise) </span>That is something to consider for AMZN fans.(Please note: Ivan Martchev does not currently hold a position in AMZN or WMT.Navellier & Associates does not currently hold a position in AMZN in client portfolios.Navellier & Associates does currently own WMT in some client portfolios.)Disclaimer: Please click here for important disclosures located in the "About" section of the Navellier & Associates profile that accompany this article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
