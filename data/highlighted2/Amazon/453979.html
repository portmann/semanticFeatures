(NASDAQ:EBAY) | Seeking Alpha eBay's competitive advantage is its network effect.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is one company with an existing user base that <b>could</b> challenge eBay . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We took a look at eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) as a <b>possible</b> investment but ultimately decided to pass due to concerns over the strength of eBay 's economic moat .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We thought we 'd share some of our research so other investors can better analyze eBay and understand the risks we <b>believe</b> the company is facing .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At first glance eBay seems like it <b>could</b> be a good investment .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company trades at a P/E below 15 and sales are projected to grow a little over 4% next year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>eBay also has a <b>hidden</b> high growth gem in its StubHub business which saw revenue growth 34 % quarter over quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , what concerns us are some signs we see of eBay 's competitive advantage or economic moat in the form of its network effect becoming <i>weaker</i> .  (Surprise) </span>The key to eBay's dominance is the network effect.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The network effect is a type of competitive advantage where a product or service becomes <i>more</i> valuable the <i>more</i> people use it .  (Surprise) </span>People list items for sale on eBay because a large number or people go to eBay to look for things to buy.People go to eBay to buy things because there are a large number of sellers.It's a virtuous circle and provides a very high barrier of entry to competitors.Imagine trying to start an auction site today, it'd be virtually impossible.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>could</b> n't attract large numbers of buyers and sellers without investment huge sums of money .  (Uncertainty) </span>So the competitors eBay has now are pretty much the only competitors it should have for a very long time.Those three main competitors are Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Etsy ( NASDAQ : ETSY ) , and craigslist . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Etsy is <i>more</i> of a niche marketplace focusing on custom crafts and artwork .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's <i>more</i> of an online version of your local art fair so we do n't consider Etsy to be a big threat to eBay .  (Surprise) </span>Likewise, we don't view craigslist as a huge threat either.Craigslist has simply replaced the local classifieds.The main competitive threat is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's marketplace . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 're a big <b>believer</b> in using what Philip Fischer called '' scuttlebutt '' when researching companies .  (Uncertainty) </span>We browsed various online seller forums to see how eBay and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> are viewed from a seller prospective . According to our research <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has some advantages over eBay for many sellers . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Many merchants preferred <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for selling new items due to its <i>larger</i> customer base . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Additionally , <i>larger</i> companies seemed to prefer listing items on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> rather than eBay and have experienced <i>faster</i> sales growth on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> compared to eBay . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>For example Vivo Technologies which does millions of dollars in sales per year has seen <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> take over from eBay as their largest sales portal . Larger , high volume merchants also prefer using <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's FBA ( Fulfilled By <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) service which takes care of the logistics of warehousing and shipping items . Sellers also liked <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because of its different feedback system for buyers and sellers . One common complaint we saw was that the eBay feedback system was being abused by customers.For example customers would demand refunds they were not eligible for by threatening to leave poor feedback for the seller.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to our research eBay <b>seems</b> to be the consensus choice among sellers for unique lots such as vintage items , used items , and handmade items .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Sellers said that these types of items tended to sell for the highest prices on eBay ( not <b>surprising</b> given the auction aspect of the site ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They also reported they got <i>more</i> repeat business when using eBay due to the <i>more</i> community type feel of the site compared to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Users on eBay can open up storefronts and repeat customers can use that as a way to keep up to date on sellers' new offerings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There have also been <b>rumors</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> uses data from third party sales to help it undercut those same third party sellers on price . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It has also been <b>speculated</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> uses that same data on third party sales to help it decide which items it will sell on its own . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I 've read account of several sellers reporting that not long after they began listing and selling an item <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> itself added that item for sale and undercut them on price . eBay also generally came out ahead in terms of fees charged to sellers for listing items.Our research basically turned up no clear advantages for either eBay or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Both platforms had their strengths and weaknesses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is what <b>alarmed</b> us .  (Uncertainty) </span>Most sellers seemed perfectly willing to use up to two platforms for their stores.A minority of sellers were only willing to use one platform but most large sellers ran eBay and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stores simultaneously . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So , things are not a winner take all situation and it seems that we <b>may</b> see the market split between eBay and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>eBay has around 25M sellers and about 175M active buyers.In 2014 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> claimed about 2M active sellers and currently has 270M active buyers . What happens if the market does indeed eventually become an even split for sellers?eBay stands to lose out substantially if there is any significant migration of sellers towards <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We can also see that with about 50 % <i>more</i> active buyers than eBay , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already has the ingredients for half of a very strong network effect . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In fact , it <b>may</b> even be able to construct a <i>better</i> network effect barrier to entry given its <i>larger</i> base of buyers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>may</b> be starting to see some of the effects of eBay losing ground to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in eBay 's latest results . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>We can see that revenue for eBay's Marketplace division has basically been flat.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Perhaps <i>more</i> <b>alarming</b> is the take rate has been steadily declining .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>could</b> be a sign that eBay is under pressure to retain its seller base and is <i>lower</i> fees for sellers to avoid losing them to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All of this leads us to believe that eBay 's once impenetrable network effect barrier to entry <b>may</b> have been breached by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>We decided to pass on investing in eBay despite the attractive price because of our concerns that eBay has a lot to lose if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is able to continue to gain traction with third party sellers .
