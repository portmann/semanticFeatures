class='textDiv'>Will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Eat eBays Lunch eBay Inc NASDAQEBAY Seeking Alpha eBays competitive advantage is its network effect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is one company with an existing user base that could challenge eBay We took a look at eBay NASDAQ EBAY as a possible investment but ultimately decided to pass due to concerns over the strength of eBays economic moat We thought wed share some of our research so other investors can better analyze eBay and understand the risks we believe the company is facing At first glance eBay seems like it could be a good investment The company trades at a PE below and sales are projected to grow a little over next year eBay also has a hidden high growth gem in its StubHub business which saw revenue growth quarter over quarter However what concerns us are some signs we see of eBays competitive advantage or economic moat in the form of its network effect becoming weaker The key to eBays dominance is the network effect The network effect is a type of competitive advantage where a product or service becomes more valuable the more people use it People list items for sale on eBay because a large number or people go to eBay to look for things to buy People go to eBay to buy things because there are a large number of sellers Its a virtuous circle and provides a very high barrier of entry to competitors Imagine trying to start an auction site today itd be virtually impossible You couldnt attract large numbers of buyers and sellers without investment huge sums of money So the competitors eBay has now are pretty much the only competitors it should have for a very long time Those three main competitors are Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN Etsy NASDAQ ETSY and craigslist Etsy is more of a niche marketplace focusing on custom crafts and artwork Its more of an online version of your local art fair so we dont consider Etsy to be a big threat to eBay Likewise we dont view craigslist as a huge threat either Craigslist has simply replaced the local classifieds The main competitive threat is Amazons marketplace Were a big believer in using what Philip Fischer called scuttlebutt when researching companies We browsed various online seller forums to see how eBay and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are viewed from a seller prospective According to our research <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has some advantages over eBay for many sellers Many merchants preferred <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for selling new items due to its larger customer base Additionally larger companies seemed to prefer listing items on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rather than eBay and have experienced faster sales growth on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>compared to eBay For example Vivo Technologies which does millions of dollars in sales per year has seen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>take over from eBay as their largest sales portal Larger high volume merchants also prefer using Amazons FBA Fulfilled By <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>service which takes care of the logistics of warehousing and shipping items Sellers also liked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because of its different feedback system for buyers and sellers One common complaint we saw was that the eBay feedback system was being abused by customers For example customers would demand refunds they were not eligible for by threatening to leave poor feedback for the seller According to our research eBay seems to be the consensus choice among sellers for unique lots such as vintage items used items and handmade items Sellers said that these types of items tended to sell for the highest prices on eBay not surprising given the auction aspect of the site They also reported they got more repeat business when using eBay due to the more community type feel of the site compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Users on eBay can open up storefronts and repeat customers can use that as a way to keep up to date on sellers new offerings There have also been rumors that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>uses data from third party sales to help it undercut those same third party sellers on price It has also been speculated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>uses that same data on third party sales to help it decide which items it will sell on its own Ive read account of several sellers reporting that not long after they began listing and selling an item <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>itself added that item for sale and undercut them on price eBay also generally came out ahead in terms of fees charged to sellers for listing items Our research basically turned up no clear advantages for either eBay or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Both platforms had their strengths and weaknesses This is what alarmed us Most sellers seemed perfectly willing to use up to two platforms for their stores A minority of sellers were only willing to use one platform but most large sellers ran eBay and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stores simultaneously So things are not a winner take all situation and it seems that we may see the market split between eBay and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>eBay has around M sellers and about M active buyers In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>claimed about M active sellers and currently has M active buyers What happens if the market does indeed eventually become an even split for sellers eBay stands to lose out substantially if there is any significant migration of sellers towards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>We can also see that with about more active buyers than eBay <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has the ingredients for half of a very strong network effect In fact it may even be able to construct a better network effect barrier to entry given its larger base of buyers We may be starting to see some of the effects of eBay losing ground to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in eBays latest results We can see that revenue for eBays Marketplace division has basically been flat Perhaps more alarming is the take rate has been steadily declining This could be a sign that eBay is under pressure to retain its seller base and is lower fees for sellers to avoid losing them to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>All of this leads us to believe that eBays once impenetrable network effect barrier to entry may have been breached by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>We decided to pass on investing in eBay despite the attractive price because of our concerns that eBay has a lot to lose if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is able to continue to gain traction with third party sellers
