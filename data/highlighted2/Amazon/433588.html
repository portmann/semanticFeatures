( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha While most investors in this industry see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services as the market leader , these investors are looking at the cloud industry as a single industry . One of the most lucrative subcategories of the cloud industry is that targeting enterprises.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While many individuals and small businesses see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as the default provider ( even I use <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) , enterprises are much <i>less</i> biased toward <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This article is in response to a question made in the comments section in my article on how to play <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> after earnings . The question follows: This is an important question for any investor in the tech market, as the current trend is moving to the cloud.While most investors in this industry see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services as the market leader , these investors are looking at the cloud industry as a single industry . In fact, it can be segmented into many subcategories.One of the most lucrative subcategories of the cloud industry is that targeting enterprises.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While many individuals and small businesses see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as the default provider ( even I use <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) , enterprises are much <i>less</i> biased toward <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This is important in gaining an understanding of the cloud industry, as enterprises are increasing their budgets: The question you should be asking here is "Why?"Why are Microsoft and Google able to double their market shares year over year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If they were both tiny companies , we <b>could</b> easily attribute their growth to the idea that it 's <i>easier</i> to double the size of a small company than a large company .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>However, Microsoft and Google hold a large enough market share to where this explanation is not adequate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition , if this were a `` rising tide raises all ships '' situation , we would see IBM and Salesforce also growing at faster-than-Amazon rates . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Instead , it <b>seems</b> that Microsoft and Google 's growth in this market can be attributed to their focus on niching their businesses to serving enterprises .  (Uncertainty) </span>When you cut the cloud industry to only look at the enterprise layer , you see that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> loses its status as the market leader . Here, Microsoft is the leader, and Google is in third place.And with these two companies ' respective growth rates , we can see them squeezing out <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to become the leaders in enterprise cloud services : Now , consider the first image in this article - it has a point . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Individual cloud service users and - <i>more</i> importantly - enterprises are increasingly aware of the dangers of cloud storage .  (Surprise) </span>With this awareness comes an escalating concern for cloud security.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Needless to say , security is <i>more</i> important an issue for enterprises than it is for individuals or small businesses .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is no <b>wonder</b> then than the companies with <i>stronger</i> security mechanisms should secure the market share in the B2B sector .  (Surprise) </span>A comparison of the security of the top four enterprise cloud services follows (ignore Rockspace): From a security standpoint, only IBM can be considered "weak."<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Google , and Microsoft all offer security benefits over one another . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , Google <b>might</b> leave a bad taste in some mouths , with their reputation for spying on its clients and collecting voice data without permission .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft Azure and IBM both have firewall weakpoints.The lack of a firewall in IBM is of course a problem.Azure 's firewall lacks the management properties over internal traffic , which both <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Google offer . Nevertheless, Microsoft understandably has it easiest from this point forward, as the company has their foot in the door with Office365.The cloud connection makes it easy for companies to integrate software that is already part of their systems with Microsoft's cloud service.I pointed this out in a previous article on the company .In addition, the recent purchase of LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) on the part of Microsoft is another foot in the door.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The MSFT-LNKD deal seems to be <b>somewhat</b> misunderstood .  (Uncertainty) </span>Many stories are reporting this deal as Microsoft's entry to the social media market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A <i>more</i> likely explanation is that Microsoft is that Microsoft will be using LinkedIn to leverage relationships with enterprises to expedite its market share growth in the corporate area .  (Surprise) </span>Some investors dislike the deal, stating that it was too costly.However, the deal barely makes a dent in MSFT's $100B of cash.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It was <i>less</i> than a year ago that LNKD was trading close to $ 300 a share ; the $ 196 per share buyout <b>seems</b> like a discount in this regard .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Other investors point to other deals Microsoft <b>could</b> have made , such as buying Twitter ( NYSE : TWTR ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A MSFT-TWTR deal would not be <b>nearly</b> as useful for Microsoft in growing market share in the B2B cloud industry .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With LinkedIn at its disposal , Microsoft can hasten its outreach to the corporate need for cloud services , a task much <i>more</i> difficult to design through Twitter outreach .  (Surprise) </span>In addition, this deal will reduce future costs for Microsoft.The company is currently a client of LinkedIn, but the client relationship will soon disappear, saving MSFT money in the long-run.Now that MSFT owns LinkedIn , they own a backdoor to marketing their services to large enterprises , thereby closing the distance on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in overall market share and continuing to outpace Google in the corporate cloud service industry . Moving forward, Mircosoft's growth will outpace the rest of the cloud providers, allowing it to dominate enterprise cloud services.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to sit on the throne in the non-enterprise industry . IBM, with little to offer over the other three, will surrender its third-place position in the infrastructure as a service ((IaaS)) and Platform as a Service (PAAS) markets to Google.Investors interested in investing in the growing cloud industry should consider MSFT first, as the company shows the greatest potential for growth.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is also a safe bet , despite its growth rate being outpaced by its rivals ' . Google is also growing quickly, making it a good choice for capturing growth in IaaS and PaaS.IBM and CRM here are the laggards but are working together to create a cloud service with enhanced security, which would be offered to banks, financial institutions, and the healthcare industry.Despite their below-average growth, I wouldn't bet against them because they are nevertheless showing success and innovation in a growing industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , either will make a suitable leg in a pair trade if you 're looking to hedge market <b>risk</b> in the cloud industry .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Smaller</i> , overlooked companies in the cloud industry should also be considered , as they do not suffer the <b>risks</b> that the above glamor stocks do when failing to meet earnings expectations .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Two <i>more</i> worth researching follow : Vonage ( NYSE : VG ) has moved into supplying businesses with cloud services .  (Surprise) </span>It is niching itself to the communications platform as a service (CPaas).The focus here is on revolutionizing the customer service industry in the same way that 1-800 numbers did in the past.Infinera (NASDAQ: INFN ) targets cloud computing vendors via the data center interconnect market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This market is estimated to triple <b>sometime</b> in 2018 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An investment in INFN can give you <b>exposure</b> to this niched by quickly expanding market .
