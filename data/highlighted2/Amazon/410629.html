class='textDiv'>Why WalMarts Rally Will Be ShortLived WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha WMT reported another weak quarter for Q The companys revenue growth is still anemic and margins are horrendous Ive been bearish on WalMart NYSE WMT for some time now as the companys gargantuan scale and lowprice model havent been working of late The companys strategy of simply copying whatever <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN does but in a less beneficial way for consumers is not a winner in my book and with shares being beaten down along with the rest of retail of late it seems things were turning against WMT That is until it reported its Q results yesterday and the stock soared to its biggest gain in years helping to buoy retail But how good was the quarter really Was it worth a gain for WMT Or was this an oversold bounce WMTs Q certainly received a warm welcome from investors but it is very important to keep the gains in perspective and to really examine what the retailer told us before running out and chasing a stock that moved higher in one day Of course pessimism abounds on retailers of all shapes and sizes as the sector has had a rough go of it lately But WMT bucked the trend of retailers being punished off of earnings with what Id characterize as another weak quarter Total revenue was up less than against a weak comparable last year as US comps rose as well The companys traffic count was a bit stronger at but that implies that average ticket was lower And while a higher traffic count is desirable will lower ticket sizes hurt revenue growth over the longer term Commentary suggests that WMT is trying to gain market share by attracting shoppers for fillin trips where they need a couple of things but arent ready to do a big shopping trip Ill have to admit that WMT is the last place I think about for a fillin trip but traffic and ticket numbers would suggest that perhaps this strategy is bearing some fruit Still even if WMT manages to attract fillin trips those are necessarily low dollar transactions and are unlikely to generate any sort of meaningful growth on their own When traffic is up but comps are only up the situation isnt improving overall its just a different mix In addition to an alsoran gain in revenue WMTs operating income fell precipitously in Q The decline was despite the overall gain in sales a disastrous result to be sure WMT is spending heavily to build out its web business among other things and has said that it is investing in price Of course what that means is that WMT is going to sacrifice margins in order to grow sales something Im personally not a big fan of As WMT cuts prices and sacrifices product margins operating margins will suffer further and profitability will be further impaired To be fair I dont think WMT really has any choice other than to try and cut prices to maintain market share because alternatives like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are making it very easy to never have to actually go into a WalMart store And with WMT trying to compete directly with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>via copying the online behemoth the only outcome is lower margins Just like the revenue picture the outlook for profitability is less than inspiring Amazons business model and shareholders are okay with moneylosing strategies to gain market share WMT has neither of those things So trying to outAmazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt going to work What do analysts think is coming down the road for WMT This chart will get us started with a look at total revenue growth We can see the struggle WMT has faced with growing the top line in the recent past Part of it is due to the fact that competitive pressures have kept a lid on WMTs growth but the other piece is simply that WMT is already so huge that the law of large numbers necessarily precludes significant scale gains WMT guided for comps during its Q report and with analysts looking for to total revenue gains annually going forward it seems WMT will have to do better than to meet those targets But given the competitive pressures and price reductions Ive already mentioned it seems the headwinds to hitting even revenue growth annually are many In short I think analysts are a little too excited about WMTs top line growth prospects and thats a problem for the stock We see the staggering decline in EPS over the past few years that WMT has endured but whats really interesting is that analysts have EPS ramping higher over the next few years I find that fascinating considering that revenue growth will be if WMT is lucky it is investing heavily in a web business that isnt particularly beneficial at least not yet and management admitted the company is going to cut margins in order to generate traffic and revenue Where is this profit growth going to come from Moderately higher revenue Nope Enormous amounts of spending on the web business Nope Price cuts that will necessarily negatively impact margins Nope The optimism here is astounding considering just how many headwinds there are for WMTs profit growth going forward At times this years EPS WMT isnt particularly expensive but it isnt cheap either This is a company that has lots of very significant headwinds to profit growth and has told us it is going to purposefully reduce profitability going forward It is also posting barely visible revenue growth and has no levers to pull on the expense side because it is trying to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>That means that even at times this years earnings WMT is fully valued or more based upon its growth trajectory or lack thereof The reaction to the earnings report was mindboggling to me because this was another weak report stacked on top of a different weak report in Q It isnt as though WMT posted blistering growth numbers last year and is simply maintaining terrific levels of revenue and profits WMTs weak Q on top of last years weak Q confirm to me that this stock has virtually no upside potential because the fundamentals are so weak Spending heavily and cutting prices arent going to boost profits going forward so I sincerely cannot understand what investors are so excited about from Qs release I think this is a great chance to short WMT on the spike up because there is zero fundamental support for the move higher I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other
