(Surprise) </span>The reaction to the earnings report was mind-boggling to me because this was another weak report stacked on top of a different weak report in Q12015.It isn't as though WMT posted blistering growth numbers last year and is simply maintaining terrific levels of revenue and profits.WMT's weak Q1 on top of last year's weak Q1 confirm to me that this stock has virtually no upside potential because the fundamentals are so weak.Spending heavily and cutting prices aren't going to boost profits going forward so I sincerely cannot understand what investors are so excited about from Q1's release.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think this is a great chance to short WMT on the spike up because there is zero fundamental support for the move <i>higher</i> .
