(NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha WMT reported another weak quarter for Q1.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company 's revenue growth is still anemic and margins are <b>horrendous</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>I've been bearish on Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) for some time now as the company's gargantuan scale and low-price model haven't been working of late.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The company 's `` strategy '' of simply copying whatever <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) does but in a <i>less</i> beneficial way for consumers is not a winner in my book and with shares being beaten down along with the rest of retail of late , it <b>seems</b> things were turning against WMT . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That is, until it reported its Q1 results yesterday and the stock soared to its biggest gain in years, helping to buoy retail.But how good was the quarter, really?Was it worth a 10% gain for WMT?Or was this an oversold bounce?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>WMT 's Q1 certainly received a warm welcome from investors but it is very important to keep the gains in perspective and to really examine what the retailer told us before running out and chasing a stock that moved 10 % <i>higher</i> in one day .  (Surprise) </span>Of course, pessimism abounds on retailers of all shapes and sizes as the sector has had a rough go of it lately.But WMT bucked the trend of retailers being punished off of earnings with what I'd characterize as another weak quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Total revenue was up <i>less</i> than 1 % against a weak comparable last year as US comps rose 1 % as well .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company 's traffic count was a bit <i>stronger</i> at 1.5 % but that implies that average ticket was <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And while a <i>higher</i> traffic count is desirable , will lower ticket sizes hurt revenue growth over the <i>longer</i> term ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Commentary <b>suggests</b> that WMT is trying to gain market share by attracting shoppers for `` fill-in '' trips where they need a couple of things but are n't ready to do a big shopping trip .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'll have to admit that WMT is the last place I think about for a fill-in trip but traffic and ticket numbers would suggest that <b>perhaps</b> this strategy is bearing some fruit .  (Uncertainty) </span>Still, even if WMT manages to attract fill-in trips, those are necessarily low dollar transactions and are unlikely to generate any sort of meaningful growth on their own.When traffic is up 1.5% but comps are only up 1%, the situation isn't improving overall; it's just a different mix.In addition to an also-ran gain in revenue, WMT's operating income fell precipitously in Q1.The 7.1% decline was despite the overall gain in sales, a disastrous result to be sure.WMT is spending heavily to build out its web business, among other things, and has said that it is "investing in price".Of course, what that means is that WMT is going to sacrifice margins in order to grow sales, something I'm personally not a big fan of.As WMT cuts prices and sacrifices product margins, operating margins will suffer further and profitability will be further impaired.To be fair , I do n't think WMT really has any choice other than to try and cut prices to maintain market share because alternatives like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> are making it very easy to never have to actually go into a Wal-Mart store . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And with WMT trying to compete directly with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> via copying the online behemoth , the only outcome is <i>lower</i> margins . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Just like the revenue picture , the outlook for profitability is <i>less</i> than inspiring .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business model and shareholders are okay with money-losing strategies to gain market share ; WMT has neither of those things . So trying to out-Amazon <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is n't going to work . What do analysts think is coming down the road for WMT?This chart will get us started with a look at total revenue growth.We can see the struggle WMT has faced with growing the top line in the recent past.Part of it is due to the fact that competitive pressures have kept a lid on WMT's growth but the other piece is simply that WMT is already so huge that the law of large numbers necessarily precludes significant scale gains.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>WMT guided for +1 % comps during its Q1 report and with analysts looking for ~ 3 % to 4 % total revenue gains annually going forward , it <b>seems</b> WMT will have to do <i>better</i> than 1 % to meet those targets .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But given the competitive pressures and price reductions I 've already mentioned , it <b>seems</b> the headwinds to hitting even 3 % revenue growth annually are many .  (Uncertainty) </span>In short, I think analysts are a little too excited about WMT's top line growth prospects and that's a problem for the stock.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We see the staggering decline in EPS over the past few years that WMT has endured but what 's really interesting is that analysts have EPS ramping <i>higher</i> over the next few years .  (Surprise) </span>I find that fascinating considering that revenue growth will be 3% if WMT is lucky, it is investing heavily in a web business that isn't particularly beneficial (at least not yet) and management admitted the company is going to cut margins in order to generate traffic and revenue.Where is this profit growth going to come from?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Moderately <i>higher</i> revenue ?  (Surprise) </span>Nope.Enormous amounts of spending on the web business?Nope.Price cuts that will necessarily negatively impact margins?Nope.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>optimism</b> here is astounding considering just how many headwinds there are for WMT 's profit growth going forward .  (Uncertainty) </span>At 16.4 times this year's EPS, WMT isn't particularly expensive but it isn't cheap either.This is a company that has lots of very significant headwinds to profit growth and has told us it is going to purposefully reduce profitability going forward.It is also posting barely visible revenue growth and has no levers to pull on the expense side because it is trying to compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That means that even at 16 times this year 's earnings , WMT is fully valued or <i>more</i> based upon its growth trajectory , or lack thereof .  (Surprise) </span>The reaction to the earnings report was mind-boggling to me because this was another weak report stacked on top of a different weak report in Q12015.It isn't as though WMT posted blistering growth numbers last year and is simply maintaining terrific levels of revenue and profits.WMT's weak Q1 on top of last year's weak Q1 confirm to me that this stock has virtually no upside potential because the fundamentals are so weak.Spending heavily and cutting prices aren't going to boost profits going forward so I sincerely cannot understand what investors are so excited about from Q1's release.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think this is a great chance to short WMT on the spike up because there is zero fundamental support for the move <i>higher</i> .
