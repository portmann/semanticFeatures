Amazons Prime Day party In terms of discounted items and shipping it seems that WalMart has an advantage over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and could discourage potential Prime members WalMart could differentiate by extending the length of the discount increase the quality of the discounted items and incorporate WalMart Pay It seems that Black Friday is earl this year thanks to Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Prime Day Because major retailers do not want to miss out on this online shopping festival WalMart NYSE WMT is looking to take on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in its annual shopping day with its own online discounts on electronics toys household items apparel and more Where WalMart differentiates from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is that WalMart is extending this discount to all shoppers whereas Amazons sale is only available to its Prime members and that WalMart is offering free shipping with no minimum purchase required Lower barriers to getting the discount plus free shipping are very attractive offers for online shoppers and there is a good chance that Amazons Prime Day may not have that much of an impact because shoppers could scoop up competitive items on WalMarts website Essentially WalMarts move is designed to discourage potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime users from signing up to Prime since WalMart is already offering a competitive discount plus free shipping without the hassle of signing up for a membership service that could potentially charge the user when they forget to discontinue During the week WalMart will offer free shipping to over mn items on its website on top of the free shipping that is already offered by its sellers on WalMart Marketplace This is significant in that the maximum product scale could rival that of Amazons Prime Day discount Where WalMart can be a threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Extending discount for a longer time frame increase the value of the products online and potentially adding WalMart pay into the website Recall that last year WalMart responded Amazons Prime Day with a threemonth sales event and I think that WalMart could do something similar to lure consumers onto its website While this may run the risk of waging an expensive price war with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I believe that such scenario would be shortlived as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is likely to lose out given that WalMarts omnichannel presence in both online and physical locations The quality of the discounted products is also important Recall that the biggest criticism consumers had with the previous Prime Day was that it was an online garage sale in that most of the products were of lower quality WalMart could extend the level to discounts to all of its products and even a discount on the higher quality products could make a difference if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does not offer comparable discounts Finally WalMart could also incorporate WalMart pay to its online shopping to encourage users to be part of its ecosystem WalMart is already competing against Apple in its physical stores and it makes sense to extend its payment service online to drive user loyalty repeat sales and convenience What are the potential impact that WalMart may have on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>According to CIRP <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>added mn US members since the last Prime Day and currently has mn Prime members Assuming that WalMart prevents half of that members from signing up for Prime that would be equivalent of a m loss in potential annual membership revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and an additional bn in annual spending assuming the mn members spend the average year However the combined bn lost to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will not go to WalMart in that WalMarts discounts and free shipping is only available temporarily but assume that half of that amount goes to WalMart that will still be an additional bn in revenue for the retail giant In conclusion I think WalMart has a real shot against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can also counter the retailers by scaling up its private label where it achieve higher margin and better product mix In the longterm I continue to like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because of the structural growth in ecommerce penetration Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans
