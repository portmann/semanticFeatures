( NYSE : WMT ) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart 's online discount and free shipping with no minimum requirement is designed to ruin <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Prime Day party . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In terms of discounted items and shipping , it seems that Wal-Mart has an advantage over <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and <b>could</b> discourage potential Prime members . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart <b>could</b> differentiate by extending the length of the discount , increase the quality of the discounted items and incorporate Wal-Mart Pay .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> that Black Friday is earl this year thanks to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Prime Day . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Because major retailers do not want to miss out on this online shopping festival , Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) is looking to take on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in its annual shopping day with its own online discounts on electronics , toys , household items , apparel and <i>more</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Where Wal-Mart differentiates from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is that Wal-Mart is extending this discount to all shoppers whereas <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's sale is only available to its Prime members and that Wal-Mart is offering free shipping with no minimum purchase required . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Lower</i> barriers to getting the discount plus free shipping are very attractive offers for online shoppers and there is a good chance that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Prime Day may not have that much of an impact because shoppers <b>could</b> scoop up competitive items on Wal-Mart 's website . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Essentially , Wal-Mart 's move is designed to discourage potential <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime users from signing up to Prime since Wal-Mart is already offering a competitive discount plus free shipping without the hassle of signing up for a membership service that <b>could</b> potentially charge the user when they forget to discontinue . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>During the week, Wal-Mart will offer free shipping to over 1mn items on its website on top of the free shipping that is already offered by its sellers on Wal-Mart Marketplace.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is significant in that the maximum product scale <b>could</b> rival that of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Prime Day discount . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Where Wal-Mart can be a threat to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ? <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Extending discount for a <i>longer</i> time frame , increase the value of the products online and potentially adding Wal-Mart pay into the website .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recall that last year , Wal-Mart responded <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Prime Day with a three-month sales event , and I think that Wal-Mart <b>could</b> do something similar to lure consumers onto its website . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While this may run the risk of waging an expensive price war with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , I <b>believe</b> that such scenario would be short-lived as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is likely to lose out given that Wal-Mart 's omni-channel presence in both online and physical locations . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The quality of the discounted products is also important.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Recall that the biggest criticism consumers had with the previous Prime Day was that it was an `` online garage sale '' in that most of the products were of <i>lower</i> quality .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Wal-Mart <b>could</b> extend the level to discounts to all of its products and even a 10-15 % discount on the <i>higher</i> quality products <b>could</b> make a difference if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does not offer comparable discounts . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Finally , Wal-Mart <b>could</b> also incorporate Wal-Mart pay to its online shopping to encourage users to be part of its ecosystem .  (Uncertainty) </span>Wal-Mart is already competing against Apple in its physical stores and it makes sense to extend its payment service online to drive user loyalty, repeat sales and convenience.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What are the potential impact that Wal-Mart <b>may</b> have on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>According to CIRP , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> added 19mn US members since the last Prime Day and currently has 63mn Prime members . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Assuming that Wal-Mart prevents half of that members from signing up for Prime , that would be equivalent of a $ 940m loss in potential annual membership revenue for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and an additional $ 20.3 bn in annual spending ( <b>assuming</b> the 9.5 mn members spend the average $ 2,147 / year ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , the combined $ 21bn lost to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will not go to Wal-Mart in that Wal-Mart 's discounts and free shipping is only available temporarily , but <b>assume</b> that half of that amount goes to Wal-Mart , that will still be an additional $ 10bn in revenue for the retail giant . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In conclusion , I think Wal-Mart has a real shot against <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can also counter the retailers by scaling up its private label where it achieve <i>higher</i> margin and <i>better</i> product mix . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In the long-term I continue to like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because of the structural growth in ecommerce penetration .
