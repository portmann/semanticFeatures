Few customers ( if any at all ) would like to complete the purchase of $ 7,000 silk-pleated ball gown by designer Oscar de la Renta on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's platform without actually trying the dress . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's partnership with Moda Operandi solves this issue by allowing both the companies to work in their individual area of expertise and try to improve overall shopping experience of customers . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> , we would see buyers from Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman visit private fashion shows and pick a small number of items to sell in their stores .  (Surprise) </span>Moda Operandi changed this model by allowing established and emerging designers to show their entire collection online on the day they are unveiled.This partnership allows Moda Operandi, a six-year-old startup which has raised $130 million till now, to tightly connect the physical and online stores.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's app will tell the sales associate when the shopper has arrived to try the items selected online .

(NYSE: M ) by 2017 to become the No. 1 US apparel retailer.Fig: Comparison of AMZN, M and Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN ) stock in 2015 Last year, AMZN came out as a clear winner as a number of brick and mortar retailers performed poorly.Both Macy's and Nordstrom had one of the worst years with huge store closings and a fall of close to 50% in their stock price.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's incremental steps in the apparel segment should bring <i>higher</i> margins and generate <i>higher</i> sales for the company .
