( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has grossly beaten expectations . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Although net earnings are still negligible, the improvement of the cash flow, both operational and FCF is again impressive.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Growth rates accelerated in each main category and it 's quite extraordinary how smoothly <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business model <b>could</b> absorb 39,300 new employees during the quarter . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The slowdown of shipping costs experienced in the first two quarters stalled as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> gave priority to <i>more</i> generous shipping conditions under Prime . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In Q4 it will be hard for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to avoid significant earnings to show up at the income statement 's bottom line . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Reading <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) quarterly earnings reports always is a rather daunting exercise , crammed as they are with many facts related to recently-released products and other developments during the quarter which have already been communicated extensively in <i>earlier</i> news releases . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Unless we missed something during the quarter, we can usually ignore this stuff - kind of advertising material actually - and instead concentrate on the mere figures.These too, however, follow a rather awkward reporting scheme.It takes quite a while before the reader is a bit accustomed to the eccentric style.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To make life a bit <i>easier</i> for me and the visitors of SA , I use an earnings model which summarizes the essential quantitative information in a <b>hopefully</b> <i>more</i> user friendly way .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The tables below are parts of this <i>larger</i> analytical model which I use to comment on what I see as the most import elements of this year 's Q3 results : the smooth development of the various operating cost items in relation to total sales , the <b>surprisingly</b> positive development of the cash flow in the three flavors that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> serve and finally the shipping costs , which have my special attention as I expect them to eventually switch from a cost into a net revenue category . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the table below , the favorable figures <b>almost</b> speak for themselves .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has grossly beaten expectations on many fronts . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Both net product sales ( +15 % ) and net services sales ( +51 % ) , which includes fulfillment fees paid by third parties who have their e-commerce fulfilled by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( FBA ) , were <i>stronger</i> than expected . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>As we have now three quarters behind us , and taking into account <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's seasonal features , which mainly boil down to the fact that one-third of annual sales is usually realized in the fourth quarter , I have filled in the results for Q4 to arrive at the FY outcome as I expect them in the table below : The operating costs and earnings margins in Q3 were well in line with former quarters . No spectacular shifts were seen here, implying that the business model, while accommodating unabatedly strong growth, develops smoothly at constant operational conditions (gross margins, fulfillment, marketing).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b>Amazing</b> as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's staff rose with 39,300 employees to 224,000 , +21 % from Q2 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Technology and content spending will remain at elevated levels, rising each quarter this year and reaching altogether 11.7% over the year from 10.4% in 2015.Yet as Q4 will be again the usual seasonal bumper quarter.Technology and content costs as a percentage of total sales are expected to fall back temporarily to 10% in Q4.This, together with some decrease of the fulfillment cost rate for the same reason and an overall gross margin this year of 10,4%, basically in line with that of 2014, will have a marked positive effect on earnings in the fourth quarter.I estimate these at $ 2.15 (fully diluted) bringing the EPS for the whole of 2015 to $2.40.As long as earnings are not relevant - even the EPS of $2.18 that I expect the company to make in the final quarter of this year doesn't really amount to much yet, although it will be a another strong positive for the sentiment surrounding the stock - cash flows remain the metric to focus on for the time being.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As I explained in <i>more</i> depth in '' <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's financial reporting , a bit opaque but not misleading , '' <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> releases three versions of the free cash flow : 1 ) the conventional one which is operating cash flow minus purchases `` out of cash '' of PP&E ( Property , Plant & Equipment ) ; 2 ) The same but including repayments on finance capital leases , which includes all the repayments of leases , an instrument <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> mainly uses for the financing of its large capital spending at AWS , data centers and servers ; and 3 ) the operating cash flow minus all PP&E spending including the part acquired under leases . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>At each of these levels , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> saw a significant improvement in Q3 . The FFC-1 improved 265% y/y and the trailing twelve months (TTM) which is the total of FFC-1 of the last four quarters quadrupled to $5.4 billion.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think that the conventional free cash flow , the FFC-1 , is still the most relevant as I have argued <i>more</i> profoundly in the article mentioned above .  (Surprise) </span>But the other two also have a story to tell and the three should really be observed together.Quite amazingly, the FCF-2 improved spectacularly from $8 million to $738 million, while on a TTM basis it went from minus $172 million to plus $ 3.2 billion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The third version of the FCF , which includes all capex on AWS irrespective of how being financed , also is improving and <b>seems</b> to stabilize for the third consecutive quarter at an outflow of $ 1.5 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>As I wrote in my preview of last Wednesday , this was one of the items that I would look for with above average curiosity.I expected the capex at AWS to start to abate a bit, thus from Q3 onward positively impacting the cash flow.As it turned out, this did not materialize yet.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continued to spend heavily in AWS , in fact doubled its spending here from $ 1.1 billion to $ 2.2 billion . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But another development , which also is becoming <i>more</i> of a trend now , is that `` right out of cash '' capital spending , which is related to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's core online retail business , was down again , for the third consecutive quarter , and this time by 13 % y/y to $ 1.2 billion . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This may hint at increasing productivity in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's warehouses where <i>more</i> turnover can be handled , <b>perhaps</b> as a consequence of intensive use of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's order gathering robots exclusively made for them by the full subsidiary Kiva , which was acquired in 2012 . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Another point I was particularly focused on was to see how shipping cost would have developed in Q3.Based on the 3 % increase , 2 % by which the net shipping cost had increased in Q1 and Q2 , respectively , the hypothesis was <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would be on a path that it would be increasingly able to charge gross shipping cost to its FBA partners . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although it turns out that shipping revenue ( +43 % ) rose <i>more</i> steeply than the 35 % increase in shipping costs , the resulting rate difference was <i>less</i> outspoken than in the first two quarters of this year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>seems</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has decided to sacrifice , at least a part of the benefit , to offering <i>more</i> generous free shipping conditions under Prime . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is an opportunistic strategy I can appreciate while <i>longer</i> term my idea that shipping revenue will converge with shipping cost , and eventually will even exceed these , is still intact .  (Surprise) </span>With regard to the gradually growing part of third parties in total transactions, the third quarter showed again an increase of one percentage point to reach 46% in Q3.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I had hoped there to see some acceleration but that was <b>apparently</b> too greedy .  (Uncertainty) </span>Third-party sales are not included in sales.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As the average transaction amount of vendors is <i>higher</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's own transactions that run though their ledger , total nominal sales of vendors is already <i>larger</i> than those of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But here too , I expect in the long run , vendor sales to continue to grow consistently <i>faster</i> which will strongly benefit the overall operating margin .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will turn <i>more</i> into a merchandise enabler and cloud service provider than an e-mail retail company <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has presented another <b>amazing</b> quarter in which the strong growth that the company has shown from its early start is still fully intact . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Nothing yet points at a weakening of that growth while an enormous potential (think India, Mexico, Brazil) is still untapped.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's the main explanation why investors are prepared to discount profits that will eventual come about far into the future , even as these have been <b>almost</b> negligible so far .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But 2015 <b>may</b> mark a first year after which consistent earnings growth will become much <i>more</i> visible than in the recent past .
