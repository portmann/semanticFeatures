grossly beaten expectations Although net earnings are still negligible the improvement of the cash flow both operational and FCF is again impressive Growth rates accelerated in each main category and its quite extraordinary how smoothly Amazons business model could absorb new employees during the quarter The slowdown of shipping costs experienced in the first two quarters stalled as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gave priority to more generous shipping conditions under Prime In Q it will be hard for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to avoid significant earnings to show up at the income statements bottom line Reading Amazons NASDAQ AMZN quarterly earnings reports always is a rather daunting exercise crammed as they are with many facts related to recentlyreleased products and other developments during the quarter which have already been communicated extensively in earlier news releases Unless we missed something during the quarter we can usually ignore this stuff kind of advertising material actually and instead concentrate on the mere figures These too however follow a rather awkward reporting scheme It takes quite a while before the reader is a bit accustomed to the eccentric style To make life a bit easier for me and the visitors of SA I use an earnings model which summarizes the essential quantitative information in a hopefully more user friendly way The tables below are parts of this larger analytical model which I use to comment on what I see as the most import elements of this years Q results the smooth development of the various operating cost items in relation to total sales the surprisingly positive development of the cash flow in the three flavors that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>serve and finally the shipping costs which have my special attention as I expect them to eventually switch from a cost into a net revenue category In the table below the favorable figures almost speak for themselves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has grossly beaten expectations on many fronts Both net product sales and net services sales which includes fulfillment fees paid by third parties who have their ecommerce fulfilled by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>FBA were stronger than expected As we have now three quarters behind us and taking into account Amazons seasonal features which mainly boil down to the fact that onethird of annual sales is usually realized in the fourth quarter I have filled in the results for Q to arrive at the FY outcome as I expect them in the table below The operating costs and earnings margins in Q were well in line with former quarters No spectacular shifts were seen here implying that the business model while accommodating unabatedly strong growth develops smoothly at constant operational conditions gross margins fulfillment marketing Amazing as Amazons staff rose with employees to from Q Technology and content spending will remain at elevated levels rising each quarter this year and reaching altogether over the year from in Yet as Q will be again the usual seasonal bumper quarter Technology and content costs as a percentage of total sales are expected to fall back temporarily to in Q This together with some decrease of the fulfillment cost rate for the same reason and an overall gross margin this year of basically in line with that of will have a marked positive effect on earnings in the fourth quarter I estimate these at fully diluted bringing the EPS for the whole of to As long as earnings are not relevant even the EPS of that I expect the company to make in the final quarter of this year doesnt really amount to much yet although it will be a another strong positive for the sentiment surrounding the stock cash flows remain the metric to focus on for the time being As I explained in more depth in Amazons financial reporting a bit opaque but not misleading <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>releases three versions of the free cash flow the conventional one which is operating cash flow minus purchases out of cash of PPE Property Plant Equipment The same but including repayments on finance capital leases which includes all the repayments of leases an instrument <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>mainly uses for the financing of its large capital spending at AWS data centers and servers and the operating cash flow minus all PPE spending including the part acquired under leases At each of these levels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>saw a significant improvement in Q The FFC improved yy and the trailing twelve months TTM which is the total of FFC of the last four quarters quadrupled to billion I think that the conventional free cash flow the FFC is still the most relevant as I have argued more profoundly in the article mentioned above But the other two also have a story to tell and the three should really be observed together Quite amazingly the FCF improved spectacularly from million to million while on a TTM basis it went from minus million to plus billion The third version of the FCF which includes all capex on AWS irrespective of how being financed also is improving and seems to stabilize for the third consecutive quarter at an outflow of billion As I wrote in my preview of last Wednesday this was one of the items that I would look for with above average curiosity I expected the capex at AWS to start to abate a bit thus from Q onward positively impacting the cash flow As it turned out this did not materialize yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continued to spend heavily in AWS in fact doubled its spending here from billion to billion But another development which also is becoming more of a trend now is that right out of cash capital spending which is related to Amazons core online retail business was down again for the third consecutive quarter and this time by yy to billion This may hint at increasing productivity in Amazons warehouses where more turnover can be handled perhaps as a consequence of intensive use of Amazons order gathering robots exclusively made for them by the full subsidiary Kiva which was acquired in Another point I was particularly focused on was to see how shipping cost would have developed in Q Based on the increase by which the net shipping cost had increased in Q and Q respectively the hypothesis was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would be on a path that it would be increasingly able to charge gross shipping cost to its FBA partners Although it turns out that shipping revenue rose more steeply than the increase in shipping costs the resulting rate difference was less outspoken than in the first two quarters of this year It seems that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has decided to sacrifice at least a part of the benefit to offering more generous free shipping conditions under Prime This is an opportunistic strategy I can appreciate while longer term my idea that shipping revenue will converge with shipping cost and eventually will even exceed these is still intact With regard to the gradually growing part of third parties in total transactions the third quarter showed again an increase of one percentage point to reach in Q I had hoped there to see some acceleration but that was apparently too greedy Thirdparty sales are not included in sales As the average transaction amount of vendors is higher than Amazons own transactions that run though their ledger total nominal sales of vendors is already larger than those of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>But here too I expect in the long run vendor sales to continue to grow consistently faster which will strongly benefit the overall operating margin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will turn more into a merchandise enabler and cloud service provider than an email retail company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has presented another amazing quarter in which the strong growth that the company has shown from its early start is still fully intact Nothing yet points at a weakening of that growth while an enormous potential think India Mexico Brazil is still untapped Thats the main explanation why investors are prepared to discount profits that will eventual come about far into the future even as these have been almost negligible so far But may mark a first year
