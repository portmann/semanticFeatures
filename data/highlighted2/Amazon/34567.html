class='textDiv'>What Will It Take To End WalMarts Slide WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha Investors might forgive WalMarts revenue challenges but cash flow is also taking a hit So far hasnt been kind to WalMart NYSE WMT shareholders Since January the stock is down more than while the SP is up slightly for the year The companys last earnings report seems to be weighing on the stock as growth didnt live up to investors expectations However there are two reasons to believe in WalMarts future growth and with a yield investors are being paid to wait WalMart competes on multiple fronts with companies from Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN to Target NYSE TGT In addition discount retailers come into play when customers choose to check places like The TJX Companies NYSE TJX TJ Maxx or Marshalls before going to WalMart Whether its goods for the home clothing toys or electronics WalMart plays in all of these fields The problem is when you try to be all things to all people investors have high expectations That being said as the largest retailer in the world investors know that WalMart wont grow revenue at a high doubledigit rate However they do expect the company to somewhat keep pace with its peers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is of course a difficult comparison as WalMarts sales still exceed its online competitor by almost However this gap is closing and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still managed to post revenue growth on a yearoveryear basis last quarter On the other hand TJX Companies generates much smaller total revenue at less than of WalMarts revenue That being said TJX managed revenue growth of WalMarts size certainly has something to do with its growth rate However with the companys topline growth coming in at just on a yearoveryear basis investors may have expected more Many investors are willing to accept slower topline growth if the company generates better cash flow growth Unfortunately WalMart is suffering on both ends of the equation If we look at core operating cash flow growth on a yearoveryear basis the worlds largest retailer is at a disadvantage Of the three companies weve looked at its not surprising that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>posted the fastest operating cash flow growth at better than annually That being said TJX even bested WalMart with a nearly annual growth in operating cash flow With WalMart showing cash flow growth of less than investors are getting even less bottom line growth than they are from the top line One of the reasons to believe in WalMarts future growth comes from a place that many would have questioned just a few years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is well known as an ecommerce titan yet the companys size is beginning to catch up to its lofty growth intentions In Amazons last quarter the companys annual revenue growth excluding currency came in at In the prior year the company reported a increase and just a few quarters ago the increase was closer to Looking at TJX Companies ecommerce sales are essentially nonexistent In one way this is expected as the companys two main chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls both deal in closeout merchandise These retailers change their inventory often as deals are presented and it would be difficult to offer these items on a web site That being said WalMart actually outperformed both of its peers in the ecommerce space The company has increased its online sales by annually in the current quarter If this were just one quarter investors could ignore this performance However over the last few quarters as Amazons overall sales growth has slowed WalMarts ecommerce sales have picked up Ironically WalMart seems to have the greater ecommerce opportunity At this point WalMarts online sales represent just a fraction of its overall revenue These small stores could make a big impact The second reason to believe in WalMarts future prospects lies with the performance of its Neighborhood Market concept One of the concerns about WalMart has been the companys ability to find good locations for its large format stores The companys large format also may turn away some customers who want to avoid long lines and crowded aisles In response to this issue WalMart came up with the Neighborhood Market idea These much smaller format stores carry the essentials and allow customers to get in and out without the normal hassle of a traditional WalMart store In the current quarter the companys Neighborhood Market increased its comps by compared to the just increase at WalMart USs overall comps Given that TJXs comps came in at WalMart can use help in closing the gap on its competition Given that WalMart plans to be aggressive in opening these Market stores its future comps should improve as they become a larger part of the whole The bottom line is WalMart is facing challenges today but has two significant growth opportunities Between its strong online sales momentum and potentially improved comps from the growth of the Neighborhood Market concept WalMarts slide in stock price may soon be over Source What Will It Take To End WalMarts Slide
