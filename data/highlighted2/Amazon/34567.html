( NYSE : WMT ) | Seeking Alpha Investors <b>might</b> forgive Wal-Mart 's revenue challenges , but cash flow is also taking a hit .  (Uncertainty) </span>So far 2015 hasn't been kind to Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) shareholders.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since January , the stock is down <i>more</i> than 10 % while the S&P 500 is up slightly for the year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company 's last earnings report <b>seems</b> to be weighing on the stock as growth did n't live up to investors ' expectations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , there are two reasons to <b>believe</b> in Wal-Mart 's future growth , and with a 2.5 % yield investors are being paid to wait .  (Uncertainty) </span>Wal-Mart competes on multiple fronts with companies from Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) to Target ( NYSE : TGT ) . In addition, discount retailers come into play when customers choose to check places like The TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX ), TJ Maxx or Marshalls before going to Wal-Mart.Whether it's goods for the home, clothing, toys or electronics, Wal-Mart plays in all of these fields.The problem is when you try to be all things to all people, investors have high expectations.That being said, as the largest retailer in the world, investors know that Wal-Mart won't grow revenue at a high double-digit rate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , they do expect the company to <b>somewhat</b> keep pace with its peers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is of course , a difficult comparison as Wal-Mart 's sales still exceed its online competitor by <b>almost</b> 50 % . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However , this gap is closing , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still managed to post 18 % revenue growth on a year-over-year basis last quarter . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the other hand , TJX Companies generates much <i>smaller</i> total revenue at <i>less</i> than 10 % of Wal-Mart 's revenue .  (Surprise) </span>That being said, TJX managed revenue growth of 6%.Wal-Mart's size certainly has something to do with its growth rate.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , with the company 's top-line growth coming in at just 3.5 % on a year-over-year basis , investors <b>may</b> have expected <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Many investors are willing to accept <i>slower</i> top-line growth if the company generates <i>better</i> cash flow growth .  (Surprise) </span>Unfortunately, Wal-Mart is suffering on both ends of the equation.If we look at core operating cash flow growth on a year-over-year basis, the world's largest retailer is at a disadvantage.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of the three companies we 've looked at , it 's not <b>surprising</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> posted the fastest operating cash flow growth at <i>better</i> than 30 % annually . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That being said , TJX even bested Wal-Mart with a <b>nearly</b> 4 % annual growth in operating cash flow .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With Wal-Mart showing cash flow growth of <i>less</i> than 3 % , investors are getting even <i>less</i> bottom line growth than they are from the top line .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One of the reasons to <b>believe</b> in Wal-Mart 's future growth comes from a place that many would have questioned just a few years ago .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is well known as an e-commerce titan , yet the company 's size is beginning to catch up to its lofty growth intentions . In <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's last quarter , the company 's annual revenue growth , excluding currency , came in at 18 % . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the prior year , the company reported a 20 % increase , and just a few quarters ago the increase was <i>closer</i> to 25 % .  (Surprise) </span>Looking at TJX Companies, e-commerce sales are essentially non-existent.In one way this is expected as the company's two main chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls both deal in closeout merchandise.These retailers change their inventory often as deals are presented, and it would be difficult to offer these items on a web site.That being said, Wal-Mart actually outperformed both of its peers in the e-commerce space.The company has increased its online sales by 22% annually in the current quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this were just one quarter , investors <b>could</b> ignore this performance .  (Uncertainty) </span>However , over the last few quarters as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's overall sales growth has slowed , Wal-Mart 's e-commerce sales have picked up . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Ironically , Wal-Mart <b>seems</b> to have the <i>greater</i> e-commerce opportunity .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>At this point, Wal-Mart's online sales represent just a fraction of its overall revenue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These small stores could make a big impact The second reason to <b>believe</b> in Wal-Mart 's future prospects lies with the performance of its Neighborhood Market concept .  (Uncertainty) </span>One of the concerns about Wal-Mart has been the company's ability to find good locations for its large format stores.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company 's large format also <b>may</b> turn away some customers who want to avoid long lines and crowded aisles .  (Uncertainty) </span>In response to this issue, Wal-Mart came up with the Neighborhood Market idea.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>These much <i>smaller</i> format stores carry the essentials and allow customers to get in and out without the normal hassle of a traditional Wal-Mart store .  (Surprise) </span>In the current quarter, the company's Neighborhood Market increased its comps by 7.7%, compared to the just 1.5% increase at Wal-Mart U.S.'s overall comps.Given that TJX's comps came in at 4%, Wal-Mart can use help in closing the gap on its competition.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given that Wal-Mart plans to be aggressive in opening these Market stores , its future comps should improve as they become a <i>larger</i> part of the whole .  (Surprise) </span>The bottom line is Wal-Mart is facing challenges today, but has two significant growth opportunities.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Between its strong online sales momentum and potentially improved comps from the growth of the Neighborhood Market concept , Wal-Mart 's slide in stock price <b>may</b> soon be over .
