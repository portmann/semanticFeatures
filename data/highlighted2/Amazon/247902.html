industry are affecting Walmart Earlier this month I wrote a piece on WalMart Stores Inc NYSE WMT citing a hold with a price target Expectations were low going into earnings as many were unsure how WalMart would respond after being down this year Im sure many investors were relived and surprised when WalMart posted positive sales numbers in the fifth consecutive quarter That said shares of Walmart have rallied since then and now trade above my target of per share Earlier last week Walmart reported earnings of per share and revenues of billion after currency adjustments These numbers surpassed estimates as analyst were expecting earnings of per share and revenue of billion Furthermore international net sales for the Company reached billion followed by an increase in ecommerce sales of This is an important metric since it shows that Walmarts investments are attributing to growth Finally comparable store sales and traffic in the US were up and respectively The improved traffic numbers display strengthening in Walmarts customer experience levels which was an important driver I noted in the previous article Despite lower food inflation this quarter Walmart was able to post its strongest sales in the food category The Company was able to rally on positive Labour Day and Halloween sales Fresh food was the key driver and an important category Walmart has been working to improve on Furthermore the Company seems to be providing its customers with fresher produce which is helping both sales and inventory levels Overall Walmart is seeing a reduction in waste and an improvement in the Companys gross margin both are factors that will lead to greater sales With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN growing as a major competitor Walmarts ecommerce growth is absolutely essential to the longevity of the Company This quarter ecommerce operations only grew a noticeable difference compared to last years growth of Furthermore the Company has been heavily investing in these activities making the results even more disappointing Should we continue to see lesser growth in Walmarts ecommerce business it may be time for the Company to pursue an acquisition of some sort One important factor I left out in the previous article is Amazons dominance in ecommerce sales and why it serves as a large threat to Walmarts business model We are now looking at a new generation of parents who spend more time shopping online where they see cheaper prices and added convenience Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has grown from a company with an annual revenue of m to billion today Furthermore Amazons market value has surpassed Walmarts for the first time earlier this year The shift in retail is extremely apparent and one that Walmart must recognize It seems like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doing what Walmart did to the momandpop stores a generation ago run it out of business If we were to compare the two companies today based off of price selection and convenience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seems to be the clear favourite in all categories Its hard for Walmart to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>due to their distribution model In order to really compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Walmart must find a way to cost efficiently deliver individual items to customers through their ecommerce site Its a tall task for Walmart to complete themselves which will only seem possible if Walmart teamed up with a technology company Time is a sensitive issue if the Company does not address the changing trends in the retail industry it could soon become irrelevant I would like to maintain my hold recommendation for Walmart while raising the target price to This represents upside from the latest close of I think the company is heading towards the right direction If Walmart continues to invest dollars in its ecommerce platform and strengthen its customer experience levels we should see the company bounce back An acquisition of some sort to improve their online distribution network is the key to Walmarts success Theres hope for the Company as long as its willing to put up a fight against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>We only use your
