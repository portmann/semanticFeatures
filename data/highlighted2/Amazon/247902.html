(NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha An in depth analysis of Walmart’s Q3’2015 earnings and future outlook.How changes in the retail industry are affecting Walmart.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> this month I wrote a piece on Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( NYSE : WMT ) citing a hold with a $ 60 price target .  (Surprise) </span>Expectations were low going into earnings, as many were unsure how Wal-Mart would respond after being down 30% this year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I 'm sure many investors were relived and <b>surprised</b> when Wal-Mart posted positive sales numbers in the fifth consecutive quarter .  (Surprise) </span>That said, shares of Walmart have rallied since then and now trade above my target of $60 per share.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> last week Walmart reported earnings of $ 1.03 per share and revenues of $ 122.4 billion after currency adjustments .  (Surprise) </span>These numbers surpassed estimates, as analyst were expecting earnings of $0.98 per share and revenue of $118.1 billion.Furthermore, international net sales for the Company reached $34.7 billion followed by an increase in e-commerce sales of 10%.This is an important metric since it shows that Walmart's investments are attributing to growth.Finally, comparable store sales and traffic in the US were up 1.5% and 1.7% respectively.The improved traffic numbers display strengthening in Walmart's customer experience levels, which was an important driver I noted in the previous article.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite <i>lower</i> food inflation this quarter , Walmart was able to post its strongest sales in the food category .  (Surprise) </span>The Company was able to rally on positive Labour Day and Halloween sales.Fresh food was the key driver and an important category Walmart has been working to improve on.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Furthermore , the Company <b>seems</b> to be providing its customers with <i>fresher</i> produce which is helping both sales and inventory levels .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Overall , Walmart is seeing a reduction in waste and an improvement in the Company 's gross margin , both are factors that will lead to <i>greater</i> sales .  (Surprise) </span>With <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) growing as a major competitor , Walmart 's e-commerce growth is absolutely essential to the longevity of the Company . This quarter e-commerce operations only grew 10%, a noticeable difference compared to last year's growth of 22%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Furthermore , the Company has been heavily investing in these activities , making the results even <i>more</i> <b>disappointing</b> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Should we continue to see <i>lesser</i> growth in Walmart 's e-commerce business , it <b>may</b> be time for the Company to pursue an acquisition of some sort .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>One important factor I left out in the previous article is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's dominance in e-commerce sales and why it serves as a large threat to Walmart 's business model . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We are now looking at a new generation of parents who spend <i>more</i> time shopping online where they see <i>cheaper</i> prices and added convenience .  (Surprise) </span>Since 1999 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has grown from a company with an annual revenue of $ 1.6 m to $ 89 billion today . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Furthermore , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's market value has surpassed Walmart 's for the first time <i>earlier</i> this year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The shift in retail is extremely <b>apparent</b> and one that Walmart must recognize .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doing what Walmart did to the mom-and-pop stores a generation ago , run it out of business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If we were to compare the two companies today based off of : price , selection and convenience ; <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>seems</b> to be the clear favourite in all 3 categories . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It 's hard for Walmart to compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> due to their distribution model . In order to really compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Walmart must find a way to cost efficiently deliver individual items to customers through their e-commerce site . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's a tall task for Walmart to complete themselves , which will only seem <b>possible</b> if Walmart teamed up with a technology company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Time is a sensitive issue , if the Company does not address the changing trends in the retail industry it <b>could</b> soon become irrelevant .  (Uncertainty) </span>I would like to maintain my hold recommendation for Walmart while raising the target price to $64.00.This represents 6% upside from the latest close of $60.24.I think the company is heading towards the right direction.If Walmart continues to invest dollars in its e-commerce platform and strengthen its customer experience levels, we should see the company bounce back.An acquisition of some sort to improve their online distribution network is the key to Walmart's success.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's <b>hope</b> for the Company , as long as it 's willing to put up a fight against <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> .
