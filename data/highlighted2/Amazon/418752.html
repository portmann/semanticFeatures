(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft 's research suggest that scaling up a neural network using Xeon E5 and Arria 10 GX1150 FPGAs <b>could</b> eventually match the performance of GPU-accelerated deep learning computers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately for Altera, Microsoft is still using Nvidia GPUs for its Computational Network Toolkit (CNTK).This goes to show that FPGAs' future in artificial intelligence is still years away from commercial adoption.Microsoft is just one company among dozens of firms involved in deep learning/artificial intelligence that trust Nvidia GPUs.The chart below should convince investors just how great Nvidia's future is in deep learning.Nvidia's GPus are compatible with all major frameworks of artificial intelligence.Disclosure: I am/we are long NVDA, INTC, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Semiconductor - Specialized</div></body></html>
