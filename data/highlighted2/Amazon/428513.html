class='textDiv'>Amazons Miami Experiment Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to collect more and more data on a variety of customers This is a long term investment Retention rates in Prime thus far is exceeding Costcos membership offering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to do whatever it takes including up front losses to grow Primes recurring revenue model Although I project a meaningful dip in the stock market in the near term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock should return to all time highs once equities rally once more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN produced an impressive set of earnings in its latest fiscal quarter Gross margin got a nice unexpected bump and third party sellers returned in droves up to which means they are now responsible for of new units sold Furthermore one cant underestimate the strong growth in Prime in the sense that this is locked in business for the future as long as customers receive the service they expect Prime is now growing faster abroad than in the US which means there is runaway growth for this product especially in under developed countries Just look at how strong the retention rates are in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime at present They are actually marginally beating Costcos NASDAQ COST membership offering at present which is why these two retailers should continue to see strong growth going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime suits regular buyers from the perspective of deals and delivery and with retention rates of well over after the first and second year see chart things bode well in this area for the future Investors shouldnt just take note of recurring income of sales and memberships that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is bringing in here but also the recurring information it is learning about its customers Recurring is the key word here Prime in many ways on a subconscious level forces the customer to buy in order to get the best return on their investments Here is where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has an advantage over the likes of Costco in that Costco only has something like different individual stocking units compared to something close to half a billion over on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Costcos model is to laser focus on the essentials and concentrate on volume and discounts which usually run smoothly due to relationships built up with suppliers over time The model works well in the sense that Costco adopts a certainty or system type of model where customers know exactly what to expect which returns predictable profits over time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on the other hand is noted as being ruthless with some suppliers as it has so many especially if it is not getting the price it wants I have seen products on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>selling for the same price as a local store whereas other products could be cheaper Why Well if the supplier in question is not going all in with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in terms of discounting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will most definitely not promote you on their end Why well we are already seeing how fulfillment and shipping costs continue to rise meaningfully at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Therefore you can be sure that any product that goes through Amazons marketplace will have its price right from day as its the only way to protect the company from unforeseen events like multiple shipping attempts etc which cost profitability in the long run No <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt want just your essentials It wants your entire house spend every month wherever you spend it and will do everything it can to get your budget This cant be typified better than its recent foray into the restaurant sector Miami is the latest city that will deliver food to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>prime members for free which again is a great marketing ploy Why Well you can bet that most outfits in Miami charge to deliver food but not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and for good reason As the chart above illustrates the company has around a retention rate in its day trial window <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is looking for the people where consistent delivered food is the norm which will give them another reason to try out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Beware <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is coming to your city and is actively looking to serve you and will not stop until it finds your need which will ultimately make you hop onto its prime program From a technical and cycle standpoint I would not be scaling into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>any time soon The stock has had the benefit of a rising stock market since mid February plus its first quarter earnings also rallied the stock higher at the end of April Im looking for an intermediate top here in stocks which should see us roll over for another to weeks before bottoming out Februarys rally in all equity markets has been very strong We have to reset sentiment which is getting to ultra optimistic levels Expect a dip in the short term it will fall more than the SP before rising to all time highs once more To sum up Im going to be adding a few good dividend and growth stocks to the elevation portfolio over the next several weeks when I see value Its imperative that they are not correlated and all dont have similar valuations to ensure that income is brought in every month which over time will increase our share count Follow along by pressing the Follow button above Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote
