gasoline prices help WalMart NYSE WMT avoid revenue losses in Standard retailinvesting dogma is that when gasoline prices fall discounters like WalMart see revenue increases because their lowincome customers have more cash to spend Yet that did not happen at WalMart the retail colossus saw its revenue fall by billion in In January when the average price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States was a gallon WMT reported revenues of billion By January when the average gasoline price across the nation had fallen to a gallon the companys revenues had also fallen to billion What is going on here Why is the nations largest retailer losing revenue at a time when low fuel prices are putting more cash in its customers pockets One popular theory is that WalMart is making less money from the gasoline it sells That hypothesis is refuted by a look at the revenues of two other retail giants that also operate hundreds of gas stations Costco Wholesale NASDAQ COST and Kroger NYSE KR Between February and February Costco saw its revenue increase by billion The club store giant reported revenues of billion in February and billion a year later Kroger which operates supermarket fuel centers and convenience stores saw its revenues rise by billion in Kroger reported revenues of billion in January and billion a year later It looks as if falling gasoline prices did not affect the revenues at those retailers which operate large stores often in direct or indirect competition with WalMart That means other factors were affecting WalMarts revenues A number of other factors are offsetting any gains that WalMart might experience from cheap gasoline prices These factors include Losses overseas particularly in Brazil Reuters reported that WalMarts overseas operations generated a profit of just compared to for its US operations WalMart has closed stores or more than of its stores in Brazil according to a Reuters report from January The failure of WalMart Express The companys dollarstore experiment which failed to stave off the out of control growth of discounters like Dollar General NYSE DG and Aldi All WalMart Express stores will soon shut down Store closings WalMart will close stores in the US including WalMart Express supercenters Neighborhood Markets six Sams Clubs seven stores in Puerto Rico and six discount stores Closing stores reduces revenue and costs money The closings are also a sure sign of weak stores at some of its locations To make matters worse WalMart is also planning to close around stores in other countries including the in Brazil Runaway growth Despite the store closings WalMart is still planning to open stores in the US over the next year including new supercenters and Neighborhood Markets This means that the companys bloated store count is not shrinking The growth of online retailers especially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN which is now effectively undercutting both WalMart and Sams Club on the prices of many items Ive noticed that prices on some shipping supplies I use for my business are now lower at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>than at WalMart or Sams Club Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is far more convenient than WalMart you can buy stuff without going to a store this is a huge threat Efforts to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>WalMart is planning to spend billion on infrastructure designed to position walmartcom to compete with the Everything Store The spending includes several massive new fulfillment centers across the United States some of which contain up to a half a million products Experiments in delivery and click and pull designed to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This includes same day delivery services and the ability to pick items ordered through walmartcom up at stores Raising the wages of million US associates to an hour This move was needed to head off labor unrest unionization and political pressure to raise the minimum wage to an hour It also helps WalMart retain employees and prevent its stores from becoming retail schools where novices learn the business before moving onto higher pay at competitors such as Costco The increasing ability of a wide variety of competitors including companies as diverse as Kroger Aldi Dollar General Costco and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to match and in some cases undercut WalMarts prices Customers simply have less reason to go to WalMart which leads to lower sales and store traffic To make matters worse some of these stores offer better customer service and a more pleasant shopping experience The most dangerous of these is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which allows people to shop without leaving the house WalMarts weak brand and lousy reputation with customers create a psychological barrier that keeps a lot of shoppers away This can seriously damage WalMart now that its competitors some of which have strong brands and reputations for good customer service can match or beat its prices on many items It looks as if WalMarts problems are now so great it cannot even capitalize upon favorable market trends such as lower gas prices This retailer will need a major shakeup and serious reorganization if it wants to retain its momentum Naturally many investors will wonder if WalMart is still a value investment I would say it still is because the company still has tremendous resources and incredible amount of revenue Yet the revenue losses and inability to capitalize upon cheap gas demonstrate that WalMart is no longer the welloiled retail machine that Sam Walton built Instead the Behemoth from Bentonville increasingly looks like a retailer that has lost its way Tagged Investing Ideas Quick Picks Lists Services Discount Variety Stores </div></body></html>
