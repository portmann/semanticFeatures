(NASDAQ:GRPN) | Seeking Alpha Dave Dierking , Get Smart, Get Wealthy (229 clicks) While Groupon has been able to successfully grow revenue, net income and margins remain essentially breakeven.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Groupon plans to expand its Groupon Goods and Groupon To Go food delivery services , but these are already <i>lower</i> margin , highly competitive spaces .  (Surprise) </span>The company is in the midst of a corporate restructure that will result in 1,100 jobs eliminated and a $35M charge associated with it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Online deal maker Groupon ( NASDAQ : GRPN ) has had a rough go of it <b>almost</b> since it IPO'ed in 2011 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Since its peak that year the stock has dropped 86% including a 55% decline in 2015 alone.What started out as a promising growth business has turned into a question of simply whether or not it will survive.The daily deal business model was rapidly gaining popularity when the company went public, but four years later the sector has lost its momentum and is no longer considered a rapid growth area.With investors having taken such a beating, it's worth asking if the stock is one that should be avoided altogether or if there's still a chance for buy-low investors to make some money.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Groupon I think is one of the few instances where you <b>could</b> make a compelling case for either side .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I fall <i>more</i> on the bear side of the argument but for those <i>more</i> optimistic about Groupon there is a case that <b>could</b> be made for buying at these levels .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The primary reason would be that for a company that's seen such a drop in its stock price the balance sheet doesn't look like it's in all that bad shape.Overall, revenue hasn't been a problem for Groupon.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since debuting publicly in 2011 , the company has grown revenue from <i>less</i> than $ 0.5 B to a projected $ 3.2 B in 2015 .  (Surprise) </span>Additionally, expectations are for revenue growth of another 11% in 2016.The composition of that revenue, however, has changed over time, but I'll get to that in a little bit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company has no long-term debt to speak of on its balance sheet , has consistently maintained at least $ 1B in cash on hand and has regularly generated <b>somewhere</b> between $ 100M and $ 200M in annual free cash flow .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From a pure financial point of view it <b>appears</b> that the company is in no imminent danger of disappearing , but the overall state of the business is concerning .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite the relatively healthy balance sheet, here are four reasons I'm staying away from Groupon.The composition of revenue is changing One of my biggest concerns is what exactly is driving revenue.Groupon used to be a business driven by its daily deals.Margins for those deals were high, but that part of the business hasn't been demonstrating any real growth for some time now.Groupon added its "Goods" line of business in order to add another revenue stream.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While that part of the business is showing some potential , its margins are much <i>lower</i> , making it that much <i>more</i> difficult to drive income to the bottom line .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>My <i>bigger</i> <b>worry</b> with the Goods division is that <i>sooner</i> or <i>later</i> it 's going to run into the buzzsaw known as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been known to aggressively go after competitors it feels can get in its way ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's decision to drop Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) TV and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) Chromecast from its web store and the decision to launch Etsy ( NASDAQ : ETSY ) competitor `` Homemade '' are just two examples ) . Groupon is n't a real big competitor to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> but competing with the online giant in discounted retail goods generally does n't end well . What you end up with is a two-part business - one with flatlining revenue and one that will likely end up getting crushed by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Former CEO Andrew Mason said so himself <i>earlier</i> this year .  (Surprise) </span>He's been known to make bombastic comments, but for this one I don't think he's off base.At its core, Groupon is a glorified coupon cutting business.It offers discounts on a limited range of items and there is nothing really proprietary about the business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are a number of other similar business models out there right now ( including the aforementioned <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) and the buzz that once surrounded the deep discount deal now <b>seems</b> to have largely faded away . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Unless Groupon can find some way to reinvent itself beyond what it currently is it's difficult to see the company surviving over the long term.Low margins and difficulty generating profit Despite revenue that continues to grow, Groupon just hasn't been able to generate any type of margin or profit to go along with it.Quarterly earnings have generally floated around the breakeven mark for much of the last three years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Operating and profit margins are in <b>roughly</b> the same boat .  (Uncertainty) </span>Last quarter was encouraging with the company posting a $0.16/share profit although $0.21/share of that came from the sale of Ticket Monster.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the low margin business growing and the high margin business stagnating this is situation that Groupon <b>could</b> be in for a while .  (Uncertainty) </span>Groupon's corporate restructuring news has been well known for a while.The company is eliminating around 1,100 jobs and is shedding unprofitable assets (particularly overseas) to get things moving forward.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There will be a <b>roughly</b> $ 35M charge linked to the transaction to cover things like employee benefits and severance packages as well .  (Uncertainty) </span>The problem here is that the company likely won't see any type of savings until next year and even then it's not clear what type of return Groupon will see on these savings which it says will be reinvested back into the business.Groupon plans on launching a food delivery service next but while that segment of the market is growing it 's also very crowded with businesses like Peapod , GrubHub ( NYSE : GRUB ) and ( not to sound like a broken record but ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already competing . It feels like Groupon is one of those dot-com internet fads that's doomed to slowly die out.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The revenue growth story is encouraging ; however , if the company is having difficulty generating a profit on that revenue growth and its chosen new growth markets are areas that are already heavily competitive , I 'm just not feeling a sense of <b>optimism</b> for Groupon 's future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I believe that Groupon is a company that <b>may</b> stick around for a while <i>longer</i> but wo n't have a significant presence in the marketplace going forward .
