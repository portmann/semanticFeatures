estimates After a slow month in January the Mustang FSeries and other SUVs posted impressive February and March resultsboosting sales numbers as well as average transaction prices Ford certainly faces challenges in but given the strength of the automotive industry and the weak valuation I am optimistic on Fords Ford NYSE F announced March US vehicle sales of nearly K up from the same month in This nearly double digit increase came in slightly below the estimates from Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds The increase comes a month after Ford posted the leading increase of among all of the automakers in February Both of months have been refreshing to Fords shareholders after a mediocre January Furthermore the company increased its average transaction price at a steady price of to due to the continued success of its larger vehicle offerings Even better for Ford this wasnt necessarily an impressive month for the industry as the adjusted annual rate fell to million vehicles down from the expectation after February Competitors such as Nissan OTCPKNSANY up Honda NYSE HMC up Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU up and General Motors NYSE GM up posted solid increases while Toyota NYSE TM fell saw a decrease Furthermore in the critical pickup truck market Fords FSeries posted a increase and for the quarter FSeries sales totaled K which represents the best first quarter start in a decade without any signs of slowing The model is coming off a busy where it underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model and has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure its manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like its competitors in the first half of However the company reached full production in the second half of and was credited for its late surge in Showing its resiliency even with the supply issues the model was awarded the title of Americas bestselling pickup for straight years and the bestselling vehicle for straight years with over trucks sold in This slow start to in addition to other possible threats such as the overall health of the US economy further interest rate hikes and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry are weighing heavily on investor sentiment If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession it would definitely have a major impact on Ford Furthermore with an interest rate hike announced in December it is expected that the automotive market is hitting a peak domestically Additionally with new companies working to produce technologyinfused vehicles such as Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesnt fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle Ford appears to be prepared for this through rumored partnerships with Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN however management must continue to look to be leaders in the race to an autonomous car With the company trading near per share with a PE ratio of approximately both figures as of the beginning of March it appears to be undervalued compared the current SP PE ratio of Furthermore the company is trading below PE ratios for Toyota and Fiat Chrysler Given this low comparative valuation and the companys dividend yield of almost I believe the stock is attractive at current prices While the sluggish start and rumors of a domestic auto sales ceiling it is certainly positive to see Ford post such great results in March With this low valuation I do not see anything in the near term that should weigh heavily on the companys stock and expect the recent rebound to continue Given this low valuation and the longterm optimism with Ford Im extremely encouraged by the US sales results I am excited about the companys future With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow Ford to report stronger topline and bottomline growth going forward in I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and expect the industry to post results similar to Furthermore I believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market and will pay investors an above dividend yield to own the stock Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in F over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
