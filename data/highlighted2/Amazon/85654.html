class='textDiv'>Google An Express Route To Profits Or A Fools Errand Google Inc NASDAQGOOG Seeking Alpha Google Express is a simple yet brilliant concept There are two solid reasons local stores want Google Express to expand Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has its hands full these days between selfdriving cars Google Drive YouTube Google Maps Google Photos and more Google Express seems like an odd fit given everything else the company is involved in However the company is planning to roll out Express to many more cities soon If Google is successful this business could change the relationship between online and physical retail Google Express is an online shopping destination thats designed to bring customers their favorite local stores selection with sameday or overnight delivery The service currently is available in around cities which is comparable to Amazoncoms NASDAQ AMZN city sameday delivery option for Prime members The basic premise is simple if you live in an area that Express covers like San Francisco you order through the site from the participating stores in the area You choose the items you want from the local stores selection and add them to your cart You check out using Google Wallet and you then choose your delivery window Google then gets your items from the stores and arranges with a courier service for your delivery The fee for Express is a year or a month whichever you prefer and theres no commitment Since you use Google Wallet to check out you can choose any major credit or debit card as your payment method You pay the same price as you would in the store but unfortunately you cant use coupons or store only credit cards and there is no price matching option If this sounds eerily similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime thats intentional Of course for Prime members their per year gets them Prime Music Video and much more However Express gives customers the option of getting sameday delivery on orders of or more while Prime sameday delivery requires orders of or more There are two sides to the reasons that local stores would choose to sign on with the service For national chains like Target NYSE TGT Kohls NYSE KSS or Walgreen NASDAQ WBA this is a way to fend off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and offer a sameday or overnight delivery program For local stores like Palo Alto Sport Shop Toy World the company benefits from a significant online shopping presence that might not be possible on its own For Target in particular Express seems like a natural extension of its growing online presence In the last three months online sales jumped almost annually Targets REDcard is held by just over of its customer base and one benefit is free shipping on any size online order However where Targetcom falls behind its competition is offering a free speedy shipping option Many orders have a delivery window of as much as five to seven days If customers can get the same item from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in two days this puts Target at a disadvantage Google Express seems to fill this void nicely However Express carries two disadvantages to Target First Google Wallet doesnt support the Target REDcard This means these customers miss out on their REDcard discount For Target to gain the full benefit of Express the company needs to find a way to work around this limitation Second since Express doesnt allow coupons customers may miss out on deals they could have received in store or on the Target web site This could lead to dissatisfaction later if the customer realizes they missed out on a better deal That being said local stores want Google to expand Express as quickly as possible With Google arranging the orders and delivery the stores stand to benefit from increased sales that might otherwise go to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Google Express is the companys attempt to ward off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has become sort of the de facto search engine for goods The company is also expanding into services with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home Services With tens of millions of Prime members and the companys domestic electronics and general merchandise sales growing at annually last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a force to be reckoned with If customers use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to search for goods and services Google loses directly As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>takes sales from local retailers those retailers may be in less of a position to spend money advertising on Google sites In addition larger profile advertisers may choose to shift their advertising spend to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because of its increased presence On the other hand the more customers that use Google Express the more information the company gains about what products those customers are purchasing This detailed purchase information can be used to target advertising more successfully In theory this leads to better response rates and more lucrative advertising deals for Google Considering that Googles paid clicks dropped from annual growth last year to just growth this year Google knows its search business has weakened <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is pulling product searches away and weakening brick and mortar stores that advertise on Google Sites The race is on between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Google to see who can expand sameday or overnight delivery to more cities at a faster rate If Google can outpace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the companys search and advertising growth may ramp back up Google has its hands in a lot of businesses but Express may be the key to dealing with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>threat Source Google An Express Route To Profits Or A Fools Errand Disclosure The author is long TGT MoreThe author wrote
