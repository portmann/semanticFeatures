class='textDiv'>Can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Repeat Its Last Earnings Performance Doubtful Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt have the ability to generate earnings at will AWS is only a side show at this time and shouldnt be overrated by investors The underlying belief concerning Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN by investors although not always spoken is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could at any time start to generate major earnings if it chose to The idea is if it decided to stop spending on scaling the business it could at that time significantly boost the bottom line Unfortunately Amazons spending isnt always related to scaling its online business rather its throwing money at all sorts of ancillary projects that havent had a lot of success in the past What is different than most other tech companies is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been around for well over two decades and it should have been willing and able by this time to increase earnings while being more disciplined with its capital expenditures Its latest quarter does show how strongly shareholders will reward the company when is commits to doing so In a little over three weeks shares have soared over by over The reason why is earnings expectations are so low for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>when it does surprise on the upside the share price can soar as it recently did Some also disproportionately reward the cloud business of the company which isnt part of its core business No matter what happens in the near term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime will remain the key growth and earnings engine of the company and investors need to focus on that rather than secondary businesses the company competes in click to enlarge source StockChartscom Can it really generate meaningful earnings at will Its no secret off and on investors get weary of waiting for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to consistently generate earnings and are waiting for the company to commit to that as part of its business model Scaling is fine but after over years its time in my opinion for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to prove it can grow while producing decent earnings I sometimes think scale is the excuse <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>uses while it looks for ways to build a moat Obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is the moat its attempting to build What happened is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in fact did scale but then discovered there wasnt a lot in place to retain customer loyalty Thus Prime was born As for capital expenditures I have no problem when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>zeroes in on various ways to add value to Prime That is the future of the company and how Prime goes so goes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Bezos need to pull back on using capital as a project candy store and allocate it in a more targeted meaningful and profitable manner Thats the only way I see the company become consistently profitable Until the company does so well continue to see it lose money with the occasional quarter where it surprises to the upside For this quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>guided operating income to be in a range of a loss of million to a profit of million That includes its Prime Day sales numbers Since a lot of financial reporting pointed to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services being a major catalyst in the last reporting period I thought we could look briefly at the numbers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services rents out space on its datacenter to other businesses Overall revenue climbed to billion for the quarter ended June up percent while operating income was at million a gain of percent It has an operating margin of percent Thats not bad but when compared to the billion in overall revenue the company generated its only a fraction of the revenue the company produces With sales of AWS accounting for less than percent of Amazons revenues its effect on the share price is beyond its performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to spend on attracting more Prime members so it would be a surprise if AWS became a larger percentage of its total business Its possible in any given quarter a surprise performance from the unit could increase that percentage of overall sales but over time I dont see it doing so Longer out if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can hold or grow its market share with AWS that may change But thats years away if it ever happens I say that because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still has a lot of share it can win at the international level and has room left to grow Prime in North America as well AWS is an interesting side business but investors wouldnt be wise to make more of that than is warranted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and its potential is the catalyst driving the company Or at least it should be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is all about customer loyalty retention and increased spending per customer To combat becoming a commodity business competing on price alone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been working hard to have Prime be the centerpiece of its business and so far it appears to be successful I say appears to be successful because the company as mentioned earlier has yet to prove it can produce a consistent profit led by Prime members It is also starting to incur more competition from upstart Jetcom and WalMart with its Shipping Pass as those companies see the competitive advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has with Prime and theyre going after that market as well For now Im not too concerned about it because both are primarily subscription retail models with little addedvalue That could easily change especially with WalMart If it isnt able to grow share or take it away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it could start to increase the value of the service in similar ways <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has With Jetcom it is directly competing on subscription price which will make it difficult to add value If it does it would have to increase its subscription price in order to be profitable which would make it less likely to attract those looking for a bargain <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has had to do that with its subscription for Prime when it raised the annual price from to Why the Prime model is so powerful is when it starts getting into spending more Once it reaches the mark Prime members start to significantly outspend nonPrime members which means they also do the same with Amazons competition The conclusion that must be drawn is competitors may compete for customers spending less but when it gets into the more profitable range <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the winner For that reason it has to be assumed at least in the case of WalMart that it is trying to compete for those online customers willing and able to spend more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>CFO Brian Olsavsky confirmed in the latest earnings report that the company is getting good top line growth which it is dropping to the bottom line This is the story of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at this time and whether or not it can continue to do so For now I dont believe it can but if it has built a longterm defensible moat in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and can over time successfully drop revenue to the bottom line it has a chance to become the company many investors believe it has the potential to become To do that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will eventually have to rein in indiscriminate spending In order to accomplish that the company will have to commit to it and have a strong CFO that is willing to butt heads with Bezos to keep spending under control Until that happens <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will remain a hitandmiss performer which always has a lot of potential in the minds of shareholders while they way for the day when it presumably can decide to go after growth and earnings That could be a long wait Nonetheless until investors decide consistent earnings are important <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could continue to have its share price run up Eventually it will hit a wall and when that happens there better be some stop losses in place in order to protect gains as it could come tumbling down as fast as it recently went up This is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is what needs to be carefully watched as to details of what its doing to add value to the service as well as how much is being spent to do so Prime is the one area of the company that not only has potential but sustainable potential The rest even AWS is just smoke and mirrors for now Where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime could be vulnerable is when the next recession hits At that time consumers will have to decide if the extra annual cost is worth the value To combat that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have to keep adding to the value of Prime and promote that value on a steady basis Source Can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Repeat Its Last Earnings
