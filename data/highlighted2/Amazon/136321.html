( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't have the ability to generate earnings at will . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>AWS is only a side show at this time, and shouldn't be overrated by investors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The underlying belief concerning Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) by investors , although not always spoken , is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> at any time start to generate major earnings if it chose to . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The idea is if it decided to stop spending on scaling the business , it <b>could</b> at that time significantly boost the bottom line .  (Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's spending is n't always related to scaling its online business , rather its throwing money at all sorts of ancillary projects that have n't had a lot of success in the past . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What is different than most other tech companies is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been around for well over two decades , and it should have been willing and able by this time to increase earnings while being <i>more</i> disciplined with its capital expenditures . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Its latest quarter does show how strongly shareholders will reward the company when is commits to doing so.In a little over three weeks shares have soared over by over $100.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The reason why is earnings expectations are so low for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , when it does <b>surprise</b> on the upside the share price can soar as it recently did . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Some also disproportionately reward the cloud business of the company, which isn't part of its core business.No matter what happens in the near term , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime will remain the key growth and earnings engine of the company , and investors need to focus on that , rather than secondary businesses the company competes in . (click to enlarge) source: StockCharts.com Can it really generate meaningful earnings at will?It 's no secret off and on investors get weary of waiting for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to consistently generate earnings , and are waiting for the company to commit to that as part of its business model . Scaling is fine , but after over 20 years , it 's time , in my opinion , for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to prove it can grow while producing decent earnings . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>sometimes</b> think scale is the excuse <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> uses while it looks for ways to build a moat . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Obviously <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is the moat it 's attempting to build . What happened is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in fact did scale , but then discovered there was n't a lot in place to retain customer loyalty . Thus Prime was born.As for capital expenditures , I have no problem when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> zeroes in on various ways to add value to Prime . That is the future of the company , and how Prime goes , so goes <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Bezos need to pull back on using capital as a project candy store , and allocate it in a <i>more</i> targeted , meaningful and profitable manner . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>That's the only way I see the company become consistently profitable.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Until the company does so , we 'll continue to see it lose money , with the occasional quarter where it <b>surprises</b> to the upside .  (Surprise) </span>For this quarter , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> guided operating income to be in a range of a loss of $ 480 million to a profit of $ 70 million . That includes its Prime Day sales numbers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since a lot of financial reporting pointed to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services being a major catalyst in the last reporting period , I thought we <b>could</b> look briefly at the numbers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services rents out space on its datacenter to other businesses . Overall revenue climbed to $1.82 billion for the quarter ended June 30, up 81 percent, while operating income was at $391 million, a gain of 407 percent.It has an operating margin of 21.4 percent.That's not bad, but when compared to the $23.18 billion in overall revenue the company generated, it's only a fraction of the revenue the company produces.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With sales of AWS accounting for <i>less</i> than 10 percent of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenues , its effect on the share price is beyond its performance . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to spend on attracting <i>more</i> Prime members , so it would be a <b>surprise</b> if AWS became a <i>larger</i> percentage of its total business . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's possible in any given quarter a <b>surprise</b> performance from the unit <b>could</b> increase that percentage of overall sales , but over time , I do n't see it doing so .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Longer</i> out , if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can hold or grow its market share with AWS , that <b>may</b> change . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But that's years away, if it ever happens.I say that because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still has a lot of share it can win at the international level , and has room left to grow Prime in North America as well . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AWS is an interesting side business , but investors would n't be wise to make <i>more</i> of that than is warranted .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and its potential is the catalyst driving the company . Or at least it should be.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is all about customer loyalty , retention , and increased spending per customer . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To combat becoming a commodity business competing on price alone , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been working hard to have Prime be the centerpiece of its business , and so far it <b>appears</b> to be successful . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I say `` <b>appears</b> to be successful '' because the company , as mentioned <i>earlier</i> , has yet to prove it can produce a consistent profit , led by Prime members .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is also starting to incur <i>more</i> competition from upstart Jet.com and Wal-Mart with its Shipping Pass , as those companies see the competitive advantage <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has with Prime , and they 're going after that market as well . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>For now I'm not too concerned about it because both are primarily subscription retail models with little added-value.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> easily change , especially with Wal-Mart .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it is n't able to grow share or take it away from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , it <b>could</b> start to increase the value of the service in similar ways <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already has . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>With Jet.com, it is directly competing on subscription price, which will make it difficult to add value.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If it does , it would have to increase its subscription price in order to be profitable , which would make it <i>less</i> likely to attract those looking for a bargain .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has had to do that with its subscription for Prime , when it raised the annual price from $ 79.00 to $ 99.00 Why the Prime model is so powerful is when it starts getting into spending <i>more</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Once it reaches the $ 200 mark , Prime members start to significantly outspend non-Prime members , which means they also do the same with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's competition . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The conclusion that must be drawn is competitors <b>may</b> compete for customers spending <i>less</i> , but when it gets into the <i>more</i> profitable range , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the winner . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For that reason , it has to be <b>assumed</b> , at least in the case of Wal-Mart , that it is trying to compete for those online customers willing and able to spend <i>more</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> CFO Brian Olsavsky confirmed in the latest earnings report that the company is getting `` good top line growth , '' which it is `` dropping ... to the bottom line . '' This is the story of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at this time , and whether or not it can continue to do so . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For now , I do n't <b>believe</b> it can , but if it has built a long-term defensible moat in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , and can over time successfully drop revenue to the bottom line , it has a chance to become the company many investors <b>believe</b> it has the potential to become . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>To do that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will eventually have to rein in indiscriminate spending . In order to accomplish that, the company will have to commit to it and have a strong CFO that is willing to butt heads with Bezos to keep spending under control.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Until that happens , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will remain a hit-and-miss performer which always has a lot of potential in the minds of shareholders , while they way for the day when it <b>presumably</b> can decide to go after growth and earnings . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> be a long wait .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Nonetheless , until investors decide consistent earnings are important , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> continue to have its share price run up . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Eventually it will hit a wall , and when that happens , there better be some stop losses in place in order to protect gains , as it <b>could</b> come tumbling down as fast as it recently went up .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is what needs to be carefully watched as to details of what it 's doing to add value to the service , as well as how much is being spent to do so . Prime is the one area of the company that not only has potential, but sustainable potential.The rest, even AWS, is just smoke and mirrors for now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime <b>could</b> be vulnerable is when the next recession hits . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>At that time consumers will have to decide if the extra annual cost is worth the value.To combat that , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will have to keep adding to the value of Prime and promote that value on a steady basis .
