follow this link or you will be banned from the site While the US economy may have unofficially entered an industrial recession in recent months with the dip in the manufacturing ISM below the critical level one sector has continued to do surprisingly well automotive manufacturing as a result of vibrant car sales The reason for this as we have repeatedly demonstrated has been the record surge in auto loans which have long surpassed both total credit card debt and the trillion mark and continue to fund an unprecedented auto buying spree as they rush to catch up to the trillion in total student loans Furthermore recent Experian data confirms what most have known the only reason auto sales are as strong as they are is because for the second time in under a decade there is a substantial car loan bubble As noted pbefore here are some of its key characteristics Average loan term for used cars is now months a record Loans with terms from to months made up of all new vehicle financing a record Loans with terms from to months made up of all used vehicle financing a record The average amount financed for a new vehicle was a record The average payment for new vehicles was a record Still despite persistently record easy credit terms the final days of the car loan bubble appear to be at hand with US auto inventories already at their highest levels relative to sales since suggesting US consumers can hardly absorb any incremental auto production all it would take to pop the bubble is a small exogenous event like a rate hike by the Fed But while the car loan bubble has been extensively documented there is another mode of transportation where the bubble in prices may have easily eclipsed anything seen in the auto space and which pardon the pun has flown right below the radar According to Air Transport World Delta recently signed a letter of intent to buy a used Boeing for million according to CEO Richard Anderson The Delta CEO raised some eyebrows in October when he said there was a huge bubble in used widebody aircraft pricing a yearold at million Anderson said that the market would be ripe for Delta to buy used s To be sure Boeing president and CEO Dennis Muilenburg was among those who pushed back against Anderson saying the Delta CEO was valuing used s much too low It wasnt Although as it turns out Anderson was indeed wrong when he said used s were on the market for million It was actually million We just signed a letter of intent to buy one Andersons comments came during Deltas investor day and for added emphasis were posted on Twitter by Delta Just as happened when Anderson made the original remark about used values Boeings stock price immediately dropped CEO I was wrong when I said used s were on market for M It was actually M We just signed a letter of intent to buy one Delta News Hub DeltaNewsHub December Here is the punchline Boeings list price for a new ER is million meaning Delta is buying a used at a price lower than the value of a new Delta did not give details on the for which it signed the LOI such as who the seller is and which airline previously operated the aircraft This stunning price discovery leaves a few key questions wide open Was this just a one off transaction in which Delta found a very motivated seller and took advantage of what was beyond a firesale price If so who was the seller and why liquidate in such a hurry Alternatively if this deal is indicative of prevailing used plane market prices and judging by Andersons comment one can find more ERs for the low price of million this means that either the market for new plane widebody airplanes is indeed an unprecedented bubble funded by such government vehicles as the ExIm bank or the used plane market is a ticking time bomb for all those billions in EETFs and various aircraftbacked pass through securities which are collateralized by planes such as the the Boeing It explains the stink Boeing made when ExIm banks charter was temporarily revoked by Congress At the micro level if new plane prices are just a huge bubble as the Delta CEO alleges that means that the valuation of Boeing is about as credible and sustainable as that of New Century just a few days before the subprime bubble burst Finally if there is such a dramatic cliff between new and used airplanes what does that mean for bank amortization assumptions on billions in airplane inventory which is still carried by banks on their books and just how massive would be the valuation deficit once loans collateralized by airplane assets are marked to market Granted while it is becoming increasingly difficult to track all of the bubbles and capital misallocations that have resulted from years of ZIRP NIRP and QE we hope to present readers with some answers to these questions ideally before the serial or parallel and long overdue bursting of said bubbles takes place Sun researchfix Sun Manthong You might see the same pricing dynamics when the Air Farce tries to
