class='textDiv'>Etsy Caught Between A Rock And A Hard Place Etsy Inc NASDAQETSY Seeking Alpha Shares of handmade crafts site Etsy have plunged since their debut on the public markets as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and currency woes have walloped the stock While Etsy is making a good business move to open up partnerships with manufacturers this calls into question Etsys core model and fundamental appeal Expect the stock to continue fluctuating as the firm struggles to find its place and establish an identity as a public company Brooklyn New Yorkbased Etsy NASDAQ ETSY is perhaps one of the strangest companies on Wall Street The firm has built its brand on a sort of antiestablishment and antimass manufacturing vibe but with a relatively simple concept What makes Etsy a strange face on Wall Street is that the companys ethos and mindset is built on homemade individuallyproduced goods as well as socially responsible ideas that go against the grain of financial elites Etsy seeks to help the little guy the small entrepreneur This isnt something you see much these days and its admirable Etsy is one of a tiny handful of publicly traded B Corps B Corps are companies that deliberately put the interests of communities employees and the environment as the utmost priorities in their business models B Corps arent seen too often on the public market because such companies tend to shy away from the shortterm demands of shareholders and the terms stakeholdercentric and shareholderfriendly dont often go handinhand in the minds of many financial analysts Etsy is essentially a platform that allows sellers to connect with consumers to purchase their homemade goods of all stripes and varieties such as coatmaker and mom Molly Goodall that the Washington Post recently profiled in a piece on Etsy The corporation charges a commission for individuals or shops to sell handmade goods on its website Etsy is essentially the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN of homemade goods the peaceful abode of sweaterknitting artsandcrafts oriented types everywhere Well maybe not so much a peaceful abode anymore now that Etsy has jumped into the tumultuous world of the public markets Etsy stock has suffered significant setbacks since its public debut seeing its shares fall from about per share back in April to where they stand now at about per share What has gone wrong And more importantly can Etsy turn the ship around Etsy has been hit by a number of negative factors over its first few months as a public firm Like many US corporations the companys overseas operations have been hit by currency fluctuations and a strengthening US dollar Revenue in the second quarter came in at million which beat the Streets expectations of million in sales But total operating expenses also skyrocketed nearly and the companys net loss more than doubled from a year ago to million or per share Growth in gross merchandise sales or GMS is also decelerating and Etsys international revenue is suffering from foreign exchange headwinds Roughly of GMS comes from sales listed on foreign currencies and of GMS is generated abroad The company is also planning to continue spending heavily on marketing in absolute dollars while similarly growing its total head count The third quarter will also face a tough comparison since a year ago Etsy relaunched Promoted Listings and expects some deceleration Etsy is also facing intensifying competition from Amazoncom as the ecommerce giant recently launched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Handmade as a direct threat with Etsy in its crosshairs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a much larger user base a mature distribution network with Prime shipping and the resources and willingness to wage a prolonged battle Etsy has relaxed some of its product policies and there has been a rise in counterfeit or massmanufactured goods on the site which is angering sellers The postIPO hype may be wearing off but the competitive realities are here to stay So as we can see Etsy has a buffet of issues facing its business model The companys central tenet of remaining homemade is now coming under question as the firm seeks to expand as a public company and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is already beginning to work towards siphoning off Etsy customers The public markets havent been too kind to the Etsy black sheep and currency issues as well as higher operating costs are taking a toll on earnings With these issues in mind however Etsy has recently rolled out a major new change to its policies that may help them out As Marketwatch reports Etsy announced Monday that it is creating a manufacturing marketplace that connects thirdparty manufacturers with its sellersEtsy said manufacturers will be able to apply to be part of the marketplaceSellers will be able to find the manufacturers on the platform and form partnerships Were focused on finding manufacturers who fit the needs of Etsy sellers and who are willing to work with small businesses an Etsy blog post states Essentially what this move does is it allows Etsy sellers to connect with manufacturers so they can continue creating new products to keep up with high demand Analysts and Etsy sellers across the board tend to believe this move will be a positive for Etsy as supposedly the proposal will help Etsy maintain its brand image and help sellers meet demand However as Marketwatch goes on to state But reaction among Etsy vendors was not universally positive particularly among those concerned about the dilution of Etsys brand When does a design cease being handmade asked one posting by a user named Ritcher from the Etsy store A Touch of Woodstock Wiggle room is one thing but this is calisthenics While Etsys allowing manufacturers to contact sellers may appear to be a good idea to boost sales this returns us to one of the major problems facing Etsy as things stand authenticity Etsys customer base is largely on the website because they do not want to purchase massmanufactured goods They want the real deal of homemade products So even though the manufacturers producing Etsy goods may be doing so with the full consent and blessing of the Etsy shopkeeper this move may raise even further ire over Etsys authenticity and undermine the companys commitment to remaining genuine Some consumers only want to buy something off Etsy that they absolutely know was handled and made by the shopkeeper and this new policy is another step in a direction that contradicts Etsys niche appeal The manufacturer measure should drive sales upward but perhaps at a bigger underlying longterm cost to brand image via angering longtime users Id rather not be in for the ride while Etsy continues to struggle through growing pains Etsy needs to show it can fend off more powerful competitors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>In reality Etsy is in a double bind between a rock and a hard place Its current smallbusiness feel and atmosphere isnt enough to placate shareholders but a more shareholderfriendly approach might alienate a good portion of Etsys base and damage its brand reputation further undercutting its position relative to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Until Etsy can demonstrate that it can successfully blend balancing its brand image with sustainable growth for shareholders you should stay away from the stock Etsy is embroiled in even more controversy over its recent initiative to locate some of its intellectual property in Dublin Ireland The move reduces taxes associated with that intellectual propertys income to Irelands rate versus the United States rate Etsy has already come under a hail of criticism for this move being called a tax dodger and a hypocrite by the Americans for Tax Fairness group The group has gone as far as penning a letter to B Labs the group that authenticates companies as B Corps and is reevaluating Etsy after the IPO Americans for Tax Fairness is requesting that B Labs delist Etsy as a B Corp solely on the Irish tax issue As the scandal develops it may pile on more pressure in an already sticky situation Taxgate may make Etsy look like its trying to evade taxes and act just like many other ordinary corporations which strikes at the heart of the Etsy reputation and model And on top of all of that valuations are still quite stretched even after Etsy shares have shaved off more than half of their value since the IPO A company that is still losing money is seeing significantly higher operating costs than previously forecasted and could only generate about million in sales in the last quarter simply should not be worth a billion market capitalization The math just doesnt add up Future projections baked into the stock price are still too rosy for a firm cast adrift in the sea of the market To be fair to Etsy the tax issue probably wont be too big of a deal in the long run The number of positive initiatives the firm has undertaken will most likely outweigh this one choice that may be viewed as a mistake by the media and by consumers But what Taxgate does is contribute towards the perception that maybe just maybe Etsy is losing its hometown flavor and is cheating on its taxes through tax havens While Etsys socially responsible mission to blend profits and sustainability together is quite admirable I am not convinced such an approach will yield investors solid returns at this point in time Until the company can prove that it can maintain its socially responsible soul while keeping or grow its user base along with actually turning a profit itd probably be best to stay away from the company in light of intensifying competition from the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
