( NASDAQ : ETSY ) | Seeking Alpha Shares of handmade crafts site Etsy have plunged since their debut on the public markets , as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and currency woes have walloped the stock . While Etsy is making a good business move to open up partnerships with manufacturers, this calls into question Etsy's core model and fundamental appeal.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Expect the stock to continue <b>fluctuating</b> as the firm struggles to find its place and establish an identity as a public company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Brooklyn , New York-based Etsy ( NASDAQ : ETSY ) is <b>perhaps</b> one of the strangest companies on Wall Street .  (Uncertainty) </span>The firm has built its brand on a sort of anti-establishment and anti-mass manufacturing vibe, but with a relatively simple concept.What makes Etsy a strange face on Wall Street is that the company's ethos and mindset is built on homemade, individually-produced goods, as well as socially responsible ideas that go against the grain of financial elites.Etsy seeks to help the little guy - the small entrepreneur.This isn't something you see much these days, and it's admirable.Etsy is one of a tiny handful of publicly traded B Corps.B Corps are companies that deliberately put the interests of communities, employees, and the environment as the utmost priorities in their business models.B Corps aren't seen too often on the public market because such companies tend to shy away from the short-term demands of shareholders, and the terms "stakeholder-centric" and "shareholder-friendly" don't often go hand-in-hand in the minds of many financial analysts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Etsy is essentially a platform that allows sellers to connect with consumers to purchase their home-made goods of all stripes and <b>varieties</b> , such as coatmaker and mom Molly Goodall that the Washington Post recently profiled in a piece on Etsy .  (Uncertainty) </span>The corporation charges a commission for individuals or shops to sell hand-made goods on its website.Etsy is essentially the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) of homemade goods ; the peaceful abode of sweater-knitting , arts-and-crafts oriented types everywhere . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Well , <b>maybe</b> not so much a `` peaceful '' abode anymore , now that Etsy has jumped into the tumultuous world of the public markets .  (Uncertainty) </span>Etsy stock has suffered significant setbacks since its public debut, seeing its shares fall from about $30 per share back in April 2015 to where they stand now at about $14 per share.What has gone wrong?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And , <i>more</i> importantly , can Etsy turn the ship around ?  (Surprise) </span>Etsy has been hit by a number of negative factors over its first few months as a public firm.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Like many US corporations , the company 's overseas operations have been hit by currency <b>fluctuations</b> and a strengthening US dollar .  (Uncertainty) </span>Revenue in the second quarter came in at $61.4 million, which beat the Street's expectations of $60 million in sales.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But total operating expenses also skyrocketed <b>nearly</b> 50 % , and the company 's net loss <i>more</i> than doubled from a year ago to $ 6.4 million or $ 0.07 per share .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Growth in gross merchandise sales, or GMS, is also decelerating, and Etsy's international revenue is suffering from foreign exchange headwinds.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Roughly</b> 9 % of GMS comes from sales listed on foreign currencies , and 30 % of GMS is generated abroad .  (Uncertainty) </span>"The company is also planning to continue spending heavily on marketing in absolute dollars, while similarly growing its total head count.The third quarter will also face a tough comparison, since a year ago Etsy relaunched Promoted Listings and expects some deceleration.`` Etsy is also facing intensifying competition from Amazon.com , as the e-commerce giant recently launched <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Handmade as a direct threat , with Etsy in its crosshairs . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a much <i>larger</i> user base , a mature distribution network with Prime shipping , and the resources and willingness to wage a prolonged battle . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Etsy has relaxed some of its product policies and there has been a rise in counterfeit or mass-manufactured goods on the site, which is angering sellers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The post-IPO hype <b>may</b> be wearing off , but the competitive realities are here to stay . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>So, as we can see, Etsy has a buffet of issues facing its business model.The company 's central tenet of remaining home-made is now coming under question as the firm seeks to expand as a public company , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is already beginning to work towards siphoning off Etsy customers . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The public markets have n't been too kind to the Etsy black sheep , and currency issues as well as <i>higher</i> operating costs are taking a toll on earnings .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With these issues in mind , however , Etsy has recently rolled out a major new change to its policies that <b>may</b> help them out .  (Uncertainty) </span>As Marketwatch reports, "[Etsy] announced Monday that it is creating a manufacturing marketplace that connects third-party manufacturers with its sellers...Etsy said manufacturers will be able to apply to be part of the marketplace...Sellers will be able to find the manufacturers on the platform and form partnerships.'We're focused on finding manufacturers who fit the needs of Etsy sellers and who are willing to work with small businesses,' an Etsy blog post states."Essentially, what this move does is it allows Etsy sellers to connect with manufacturers so they can continue creating new products to keep up with high demand.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analysts and Etsy sellers across the board tend to <b>believe</b> this move will be a positive for Etsy , as supposedly the proposal will help Etsy maintain its brand image and help sellers meet demand .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, as Marketwatch goes on to state: "But reaction among Etsy vendors was not universally positive, particularly among those concerned about the dilution of Etsy's brand.'When does a design cease being handmade?'asked one posting by a user named Ritcher from the Etsy store A Touch of Woodstock.'Wiggle room is one thing, but this is calisthenics.'"<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Etsy 's allowing manufacturers to contact sellers may <b>appear</b> to be a good idea to boost sales , this returns us to one of the major problems facing Etsy as things stand : authenticity .  (Uncertainty) </span>Etsy's customer base is largely on the website because they do not want to purchase mass-manufactured goods.They want the "real deal" of home-made products.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So even though the manufacturers producing Etsy goods <b>may</b> be doing so with the full consent and blessing of the Etsy shopkeeper , this move <b>may</b> raise even further ire over Etsy 's authenticity and undermine the company 's commitment to remaining `` genuine . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Some consumers only want to buy something off Etsy that they absolutely know was handled and made by the shopkeeper, and this new policy is another step in a direction that contradicts Etsy's niche appeal.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The manufacturer measure should drive sales upward , but <b>perhaps</b> at a <i>bigger</i> underlying long-term cost to brand image via angering longtime users .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I'd rather not be in for the ride while Etsy continues to struggle through growing pains.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Etsy needs to show it can fend off <i>more</i> powerful competitors like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In reality, Etsy is in a double bind - between a rock and a hard place.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Its current small-business feel and atmosphere is n't enough to placate shareholders , but a <i>more</i> shareholder-friendly approach <b>might</b> alienate a good portion of Etsy 's base and damage its brand reputation , further undercutting its position relative to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Until Etsy can demonstrate that it can successfully blend balancing its brand image with sustainable growth for shareholders, you should stay away from the stock.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Etsy is embroiled in even <i>more</i> controversy over its recent initiative to locate some of its intellectual property in Dublin , Ireland .  (Surprise) </span>The move reduces taxes associated with that intellectual property's income to Ireland's 12.5% rate versus the United States' 35% rate.Etsy has already come under a hail of criticism for this move, being called a tax dodger and a hypocrite by the Americans for Tax Fairness group.The group has gone as far as penning a letter to B Labs, the group that authenticates companies as B Corps and is re-evaluating Etsy after the IPO.Americans for Tax Fairness is requesting that B Labs delist Etsy as a B Corp solely on the Irish tax issue.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As the scandal develops , it <b>may</b> pile on <i>more</i> pressure in an already sticky situation .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` Taxgate '' <b>may</b> make Etsy look like it 's trying to evade taxes and act just like many other ordinary corporations - which strikes at the heart of the Etsy reputation and model .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And , on top of all of that , valuations are still quite stretched , even after Etsy shares have shaved off <i>more</i> than half of their value since the IPO .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A company that is still losing money , is seeing significantly <i>higher</i> operating costs than previously forecasted , and <b>could</b> only generate about $ 61 million in sales in the last quarter simply should not be worth a $ 1.6 billion market capitalization .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The math just doesn't add up.Future projections baked into the stock price are still too rosy for a firm cast adrift in the sea of the market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To be fair to Etsy , the tax issue <b>probably</b> wo n't be too big of a deal in the long run .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The number of positive initiatives the firm has undertaken will most likely outweigh this one choice that <b>may</b> be viewed as a mistake by the media and by consumers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But what `` Taxgate '' does is contribute towards the perception that <b>maybe</b> , just <b>maybe</b> , Etsy is losing its `` hometown flavor '' and is cheating on its taxes through tax havens .  (Uncertainty) </span>While Etsy's socially responsible mission to blend profits and sustainability together is quite admirable, I am not convinced such an approach will yield investors solid returns at this point in time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Until the company can prove that it can maintain its `` socially responsible soul '' while keeping or grow its user base , along with actually turning a profit , it 'd <b>probably</b> be best to stay away from the company in light of intensifying competition from the likes of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> .
