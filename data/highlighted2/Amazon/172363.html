(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With these issues in mind , however , Etsy has recently rolled out a major new change to its policies that <b>may</b> help them out .  (Uncertainty) </span>As Marketwatch reports, "[Etsy] announced Monday that it is creating a manufacturing marketplace that connects third-party manufacturers with its sellers...Etsy said manufacturers will be able to apply to be part of the marketplace...Sellers will be able to find the manufacturers on the platform and form partnerships.'We're focused on finding manufacturers who fit the needs of Etsy sellers and who are willing to work with small businesses,' an Etsy blog post states."Essentially, what this move does is it allows Etsy sellers to connect with manufacturers so they can continue creating new products to keep up with high demand.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analysts and Etsy sellers across the board tend to <b>believe</b> this move will be a positive for Etsy , as supposedly the proposal will help Etsy maintain its brand image and help sellers meet demand .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, as Marketwatch goes on to state: "But reaction among Etsy vendors was not universally positive, particularly among those concerned about the dilution of Etsy's brand.'When does a design cease being handmade?'asked one posting by a user named Ritcher from the Etsy store A Touch of Woodstock.'Wiggle room is one thing, but this is calisthenics.'"<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Etsy 's allowing manufacturers to contact sellers may <b>appear</b> to be a good idea to boost sales , this returns us to one of the major problems facing Etsy as things stand : authenticity .  (Uncertainty) </span>Etsy's customer base is largely on the website because they do not want to purchase mass-manufactured goods.They want the "real deal" of home-made products.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So even though the manufacturers producing Etsy goods <b>may</b> be doing so with the full consent and blessing of the Etsy shopkeeper , this move <b>may</b> raise even further ire over Etsy 's authenticity and undermine the company 's commitment to remaining `` genuine . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Some consumers only want to buy something off Etsy that they absolutely know was handled and made by the shopkeeper, and this new policy is another step in a direction that contradicts Etsy's niche appeal.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The manufacturer measure should drive sales upward , but <b>perhaps</b> at a <i>bigger</i> underlying long-term cost to brand image via angering longtime users .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I'd rather not be in for the ride while Etsy continues to struggle through growing pains.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Etsy needs to show it can fend off <i>more</i> powerful competitors like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In reality, Etsy is in a double bind - between a rock and a hard place.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Its current small-business feel and atmosphere is n't enough to placate shareholders , but a <i>more</i> shareholder-friendly approach <b>might</b> alienate a good portion of Etsy 's base and damage its brand reputation , further undercutting its position relative to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Until Etsy can demonstrate that it can successfully blend balancing its brand image with sustainable growth for shareholders, you should stay away from the stock.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Etsy is embroiled in even <i>more</i> controversy over its recent initiative to locate some of its intellectual property in Dublin , Ireland .  (Surprise) </span>The move reduces taxes associated with that intellectual property's income to Ireland's 12.5% rate versus the United States' 35% rate.Etsy has already come under a hail of criticism for this move, being called a tax dodger and a hypocrite by the Americans for Tax Fairness group.The group has gone as far as penning a letter to B Labs, the group that authenticates companies as B Corps and is re-evaluating Etsy after the IPO.Americans for Tax Fairness is requesting that B Labs delist Etsy as a B Corp solely on the Irish tax issue.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As the scandal develops , it <b>may</b> pile on <i>more</i> pressure in an already sticky situation .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` Taxgate '' <b>may</b> make Etsy look like it 's trying to evade taxes and act just like many other ordinary corporations - which strikes at the heart of the Etsy reputation and model .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And , on top of all of that , valuations are still quite stretched , even after Etsy shares have shaved off <i>more</i> than half of their value since the IPO .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A company that is still losing money , is seeing significantly <i>higher</i> operating costs than previously forecasted , and <b>could</b> only generate about $ 61 million in sales in the last quarter simply should not be worth a $ 1.6 billion market capitalization .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The math just doesn't add up.Future projections baked into the stock price are still too rosy for a firm cast adrift in the sea of the market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To be fair to Etsy , the tax issue <b>probably</b> wo n't be too big of a deal in the long run .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The number of positive initiatives the firm has undertaken will most likely outweigh this one choice that <b>may</b> be viewed as a mistake by the media and by consumers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But what `` Taxgate '' does is contribute towards the perception that <b>maybe</b> , just <b>maybe</b> , Etsy is losing its `` hometown flavor '' and is cheating on its taxes through tax havens .  (Uncertainty) </span>While Etsy's socially responsible mission to blend profits and sustainability together is quite admirable, I am not convinced such an approach will yield investors solid returns at this point in time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Until the company can prove that it can maintain its `` socially responsible soul '' while keeping or grow its user base , along with actually turning a profit , it 'd <b>probably</b> be best to stay away from the company in light of intensifying competition from the likes of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> .
