In reality, Etsy is in a double bind - between a rock and a hard place.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Its current small-business feel and atmosphere is n't enough to placate shareholders , but a more shareholder-friendly approach <b>might</b> alienate a good portion of Etsy 's base and damage its brand reputation , further undercutting its position relative to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Until Etsy can demonstrate that it can successfully blend balancing its brand image with sustainable growth for shareholders, you should stay away from the stock.Etsy is embroiled in even more controversy over its recent initiative to locate some of its intellectual property in Dublin, Ireland.The move reduces taxes associated with that intellectual property's income to Ireland's 12.5% rate versus the United States' 35% rate.Etsy has already come under a hail of criticism for this move, being called a tax dodger and a hypocrite by the Americans for Tax Fairness group.The group has gone as far as penning a letter to B Labs, the group that authenticates companies as B Corps and is re-evaluating Etsy after the IPO.Americans for Tax Fairness is requesting that B Labs delist Etsy as a B Corp solely on the Irish tax issue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As the scandal develops , it <b>may</b> pile on more pressure in an already sticky situation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` Taxgate '' <b>may</b> make Etsy look like it 's trying to evade taxes and act just like many other ordinary corporations - which strikes at the heart of the Etsy reputation and model .  (Uncertainty) </span>And, on top of all of that, valuations are still quite stretched, even after Etsy shares have shaved off more than half of their value since the IPO.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A company that is still losing money , is seeing significantly higher operating costs than previously forecasted , and <b>could</b> only generate about $ 61 million in sales in the last quarter simply should not be worth a $ 1.6 billion market capitalization .  (Uncertainty) </span>The math just doesn't add up.Future projections baked into the stock price are still too rosy for a firm cast adrift in the sea of the market.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To be fair to Etsy , the tax issue <b>probably</b> wo n't be too big of a deal in the long run .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The number of positive initiatives the firm has undertaken will most likely outweigh this one choice that <b>may</b> be viewed as a mistake by the media and by consumers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But what `` Taxgate '' does is contribute towards the perception that <b>maybe</b> , just <b>maybe</b> , Etsy is losing its `` hometown flavor '' and is cheating on its taxes through tax havens .  (Uncertainty) </span>While Etsy's socially responsible mission to blend profits and sustainability together is quite admirable, I am not convinced such an approach will yield investors solid returns at this point in time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Until the company can prove that it can maintain its `` socially responsible soul '' while keeping or grow its user base , along with actually turning a profit , it 'd <b>probably</b> be best to stay away from the company in light of intensifying competition from the likes of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> .
