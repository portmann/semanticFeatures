(Uncertainty) </span>Meanwhile its biggest home grown China competitor, Didi Kauidi, is also spending in the hundreds-of-millions range on driver subsidies.There is a giant subsidies war going on, fueled by an ocean of venture capital money.Uber is fascinating because it's such a bellwether for the Unicorn bubble, and thus the entire Silicon Valley bubble.Nobody knows how profitable this company will actually be.From the given reports, it sounds like Uber's cash burn is actually accelerating.They are literally "losing money on every ride� and making it up on volume."And for what?The ride-share market is tough.There are multiple competitors, both internationally and within the United States .In big markets like China, those competitors are entrenched, well-funded, and ruthless.The theory is that, if Uber expands rapidly enough, it can gain an insurmountable advantage from network effects.Get huge , then benefit from a combination of scale and lock-in , like Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) or Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has network effects because it first established a presence back when credit cards were a dicey proposition on the web . People came to trust <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as a one-stop-shop for purchases , and then a huge logistics operation got layered on top of that , turning <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> into `` the everything store '' ( which is still barely profitable , apart from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ) . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Google , meanwhile , has developed a permanent advantage in search engine quality , with all kinds of useful free services attached , as such that there is no reason for the world to switch , and a technology moat in that their results will continue to improve <i>faster</i> than anyone can keep up .
