( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is considering creating a delivery system using private individuals to transport packages . Similar to UberRUSH and Postmates, private drivers and cyclists will do the "last mile" of home deliveries.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Prime Now service offers 1-hour and 2-hour deliveries in select zip codes , so private individual deliveries <b>may</b> be a <i>more</i> economical option . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Until <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) can get drones to deliver orders directly to the customer 's door , the online retailer has to rely on regular shipping systems . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yet to live up to its Prime service that promises to deliver items in very short time periods - in some places in up to one hour - the cost and logistics becomes <i>more</i> difficult and expensive .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The `` last mile '' of shipping to individual customers ' homes wherever they <b>may</b> be becomes the hardest to coordinate in a cost-effective way .  (Uncertainty) </span>That 's why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is said to be working on an app and service to call on individuals to drop off deliveries . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Uber ( Pending : UBER ) is successfully providing personal transport through private personal cars and Postmates couriers are delivering orders for Starbucks ( NASDAQ : SBUX ) and even Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , then <b>could</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> have private individuals drop off its deliveries ? (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The Wall Street Journal reported <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is testing an app to enlist private individuals who are traveling in the direction of where a delivery is headed . Whether the app, nicknamed "On Your Way", will really be feasible or not, it should be considered if it can help the giant retailer cut shipping costs.Like working with all 3rd party service providers , the client ( in this case <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) will have to devise a system to make sure the service agent does the job correctly , on time and represents the client in the best light . In addition , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to be mindful about how much it can charge for the service on top of the order price . Currently, its Prime service offers same-day delivery in 14 metro areas for orders over $35 of items marked especially for this special service.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Prime Now service offers two-hour delivery for thousands of specially marked items free and an even <i>quicker</i> one-hour service for select zip code areas for an extra $ 7.99 , according to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's website . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Considering the cost and coordination of large numbers of orders going out, I think using private individuals to deliver packages will only be good for the last leg of the delivery.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Over <i>longer</i> distances and time periods , regular truck shipping would still be the most efficient .  (Surprise) </span>The special one-hour and two-hour delivery zip codes have only been recently made available , so investors should be looking at the next quarterly earnings release to see if it is positively or negatively impacting <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's shipping expenses . Outbound shipping has been a losing proposition for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> even though it is vital to the whole shopping process . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's 2014 annual report ( page 26 ) , the company took in $ 4.49 billion in shipping revenue , yet shipping related costs came to $ 8.7 billion for a net shipping cost loss of $ 4.2 billion - <b>almost</b> the whole total of shipping revenue . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The cost has been rising in step with increases in shipping revenue, running regularly around 4.7% of total annual net sales.These annual figures are from before the new one-hour and two-hour services were offered.Investors will want to review outbound shipping activity revenues and costs when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> announces its Q2 2015 earnings around July 23 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is driving for <i>bigger</i> market share in online retail by offering <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime service for $ 99 a year , even if shipping is eating at operating earnings . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The retailer's 54+ fulfillment centers across the US can cover the major populated regions.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I think the company should have some kind of storefront presence and be a `` bricks and clicks '' business to <i>better</i> bridge the steps between fulfillment centers and the customer 's home .  (Surprise) </span>Then , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can use the storefronts as a pick-up point for customers as well as an urban hub for private individual `` Uber '' - like deliveries . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> reduce costs while charging a reasonable amount for the special one-hour service .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can successfully make this work for package delivery , then it <b>could</b> move into food and other premium purchase items and challenge start-ups Uber and Postmates on their own territory .
