style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is considering creating a delivery system using private individuals to transport packages Similar to UberRUSH and Postmates private drivers and cyclists will do the last mile of home deliveries Amazons Prime Now service offers hour and hour deliveries in select zip codes so private individual deliveries may be a more economical option Until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN can get drones to deliver orders directly to the customers door the online retailer has to rely on regular shipping systems Yet to live up to its Prime service that promises to deliver items in very short time periods in some places in up to one hour the cost and logistics becomes more difficult and expensive The last mile of shipping to individual customers homes wherever they may be becomes the hardest to coordinate in a costeffective way Thats why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is said to be working on an app and service to call on individuals to drop off deliveries If Uber Pending UBER is successfully providing personal transport through private personal cars and Postmates couriers are delivering orders for Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX and even Apple NASDAQ AAPL then could <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>have private individuals drop off its deliveries The Wall Street Journal reported <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is testing an app to enlist private individuals who are traveling in the direction of where a delivery is headed Whether the app nicknamed On Your Way will really be feasible or not it should be considered if it can help the giant retailer cut shipping costs Like working with all rd party service providers the client in this case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have to devise a system to make sure the service agent does the job correctly on time and represents the client in the best light In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has to be mindful about how much it can charge for the service on top of the order price Currently its Prime service offers sameday delivery in metro areas for orders over of items marked especially for this special service The Prime Now service offers twohour delivery for thousands of specially marked items free and an even quicker onehour service for select zip code areas for an extra according to Amazons website Considering the cost and coordination of large numbers of orders going out I think using private individuals to deliver packages will only be good for the last leg of the delivery Over longer distances and time periods regular truck shipping would still be the most efficient The special onehour and twohour delivery zip codes have only been recently made available so investors should be looking at the next quarterly earnings release to see if it is positively or negatively impacting Amazons shipping expenses Outbound shipping has been a losing proposition for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>even though it is vital to the whole shopping process According to Amazons annual report page the company took in billion in shipping revenue yet shipping related costs came to billion for a net shipping cost loss of billion almost the whole total of shipping revenue The cost has been rising in step with increases in shipping revenue running regularly around of total annual net sales These annual figures are from before the new onehour and twohour services were offered Investors will want to review outbound shipping activity revenues and costs when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>announces its Q earnings around July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is driving for bigger market share in online retail by offering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime service for a year even if shipping is eating at operating earnings The retailers fulfillment centers across the US can cover the major populated regions I think the company should have some kind of storefront presence and be a bricks and clicks business to better bridge the steps between fulfillment centers and the customers home Then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can use the storefronts as a pickup point for customers as well as an urban hub for private individual Uberlike deliveries That could reduce costs while charging a reasonable amount for the special onehour service If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can successfully make this work for package delivery then it could move into food and other premium purchase items and challenge startups Uber and Postmates on their own territory Source <span
