blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator free isnt free amazon ftc lawsuits inapp purchases Theres a timetested rule that if someone gives a child an easy way to unwittingly spend your money you will soon be looking at a thick bill containing a large number of tiny purchases Today a federal court ruled that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>failed to do enough to alert Kindle Fire owners and users of Amazons Android appstore that Free apps could still allow kids to make costly inapp transactions The Federal Trade Commission sued <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in alleging that the online retail giant unfairly billed parents for millions of dollars in unauthorized inapp purchases made by their children <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>defended its policies saying the company had refunded money to customers who complained about kids who didnt realize they were spending real money by purchasing a boatload of doughnuts or a can of stars However the FTC countered that not only should parents have been made more aware that they were effectively handing their debit cards over to their kids but that Amazons complaintandrefund process was unclear and confusing In granting the FTC summary judgment PDF the court noted that in Amazons original appstore layout disclosures of inapp purchases were buried about twothirds of the way into the detailed description of each app Responding to complaints and concerns from regulators <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>introduced a password requirement for inapp purchases of or more However smaller amounts didnt trigger the need to enter a password meaning kids could mass significantly more than in purchases by making multiple smalldollar transactions After learning of an FTC investigation into inapp purchases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>added new rules requiring a password if a transaction was made within five minutes of a previous one or if parents opted into to restrictions for purchases Kindle devices began including the Free Time feature which disabled inapp purchases Subsequently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>began tagging relevant apps with the phrase InApp Purchasing but as the court notes The words InApp Purchasing are smaller than the remainder of the text on the screen and in the same font and color Notably though the words InApp Purchasing represented a clickable hyperlink which users could click on to learn more about in app charges the lettering is not presented in such a way as to make that obvious such as setting the words in a different color or underlining them Later updates to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>devices and the appstore have increased the transparency regarding inapp purchases which is why the court did not grant the FTCs soughtafter injunction in this case The only devices that may still allow for unfettered smalldollar purchases are firstgeneration Kindle Fire tablets which have not been sold for four years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>argued that monetary injury was minimal in this case because of the companys refund policy but the court was not convinced Amazons argument conflates complaints with the total universe of injury writes the judge However given the design of the Appstore and procedures around inapp purchases it is reasonable to conclude that many customers were never aware that they had made an inapp purchase Additionally the judge notes that the refunds provided to customers does not account for the time and effort those users had to put into making their case to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The judge was equally unmoved by Amazons claim that customers should have known about the inapp purchases and that they were reasonably avoidable noting that it is unreasonable to expect customers to be familiar with the potential to accrue inapp purchases while using apps labeled as FREE The court concluded that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>incorrectly assumed that its users were familiar with the concept and risks of inapp purchases just because they were familiar with the concept of online shopping Writes the judge online shopping and spending real currency while obtaining virtual items in a game are completely different user activities The judgment does not specify monetary relief Instead it instructs both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and the FTC to provide more detailed information regarding the precise amount that should be refunded to consumers We are pleased the federal judge found <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>liable for unfairly billing consumers for unauthorized inapp purchases by children said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez We look forward to making a case for full refunds to consumers as a result of Amazons actions In Jan Apple s ettled similar claims with the FTC regarding inapp purchases resulting in more than million in refunds for
