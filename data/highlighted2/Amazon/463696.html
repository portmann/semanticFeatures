( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha There are <b>possible</b> signs of a 3P marketplace slowdown at Amazon.com . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This is important because the 3P marketplace is one of 2 main pillars sustaining Amazon.com 's profitability . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I have n't written on Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) for <i>more</i> than one year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I was short and covered back then because my models did n't show any <i>more</i> fundamental deterioration .  (Surprise) </span>Indeed , since then Amazon.com 's fundamentals ( and earnings ) have improved significantly . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In large part , this improvement was driven by AWS ( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ) , and for now there does n't seem much reason to <b>believe</b> that the AWS pillar shows any weakness . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>There is another pillar to Amazon.com 's fundamental performance , though . That pillar is its 3P (Third-Party) marketplace.This marketplace is akin to what Alibaba ( NYSE : BABA ) or eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) do , in the sense that it 's not Amazon.com itself selling products to its customers . Instead , the products are listed , sold and fulfilled by third parties ( though up to 40 % of 3P fulfillment is now done by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) . For these services , Amazon.com charges a commission . As it's easy to see, both Alibaba and eBay have no trouble being profitable (and indeed, having very high margins - eBay operating margins exceed 25%, Alibaba's are near 30%).The business of letting third parties use your platform to sell their wares and just collect commissions from them is clearly a very lucrative business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recently , I 've started seeing <b>worrying</b> signs for this particular pillar - the 3P marketplace .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For the longest of times , 3P grew <i>faster</i> than Amazon.com as a whole . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Such was very nice for Amazon.com , for as we saw the 3P marketplace is likely to have <i>higher</i> margins that Amazon.com as a whole as well . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , there are now signs that either this growth <b>might</b> be seeing deceleration , or the sample leading to that conclusion is , itself , having problems .  (Uncertainty) </span>What are those signs?I am speaking about ChannelAdvisor.com's (NYSE: ECOM ) regular "online same-store-sales" reports.ChannelAdvisor provides services to third parties selling in many different online marketplaces, and tracks those customers' sales trends.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It then anonymously aggregates those sales trends into same-store sales for those disparate online marketplaces , and reports them on a monthly basis ( with <i>more</i> detail and periodicity during the Christmas season ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such , ChannelAdvisor 's SSS report works as a <b>possible</b> sample of each marketplace 's ongoing activity .  (Uncertainty) </span>What this ChannelAdvisor report has been showing as of late , is some significant deceleration in the same-store sales trend for Amazon.com . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Indeed , as of the June 2016 report ( out late yesterday ) this deceleration seems to have gone all the way down to +11 % year-on-year : It might be <b>possible</b> that part of this deceleration is due to ChannelAdvisor 's own customer mixture .  (Uncertainty) </span>However , given that ChannelAdvisor serves a large number of customers , it 's unlikely that ChannelAdvisor 's deceleration is n't also being felt to some extent at the overall Amazon.com 3P marketplace . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Since this affects one of Amazon.com 's most profitable segments ( along with AWS ) , this development <b>might</b> thus have significance for Amazon.com as a whole . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This deceleration took place during the whole of Q2 2016 , so pretty soon we 'll see if this translated to weakness for Amazon.com . Amazon.com should report Q2 2016 earnings on or around July 21 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , <b>maybe</b> Amazon.com 's 3P marketplace is n't slowing down at all . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ChannelAdvisor itself says that its reported SSS numbers can <b>deviate</b> significantly from those being experienced by retailers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Namely due to : Customer variance : ChannelAdvisor 's customers <b>may</b> not be representative of the overall customer mix of any individual channel .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For example , on eBay , our customers are skewed toward a <i>larger</i> eBay customer set , not the average .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Category <b>variance</b> : ChannelAdvisor 's customers are overrepresented in some categories ( electronics , sporting goods and auto parts ) and underrepresented in others ( collectibles , BMV/media , etc. ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>On <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , for example , ChannelAdvisor has very few media customers , so we have no visibility into that large chunk of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cross-border trade <b>variance</b> : While ChannelAdvisor does have a fair amount of non-domestic GMV , our mix of domestic and international customers is not necessarily equivalent to that of other e-commerce players .  (Uncertainty) </span>Software Impact: At the end of the day, we are a software company.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Some of our features cause a short-term bump in sales that <b>may</b> skew results high at the beginning and then <i>lower</i> at the end of a one-year SSS cycle .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Channel impact : Certain changes at e-commerce channels <b>may</b> cause disproportionate good or harm to our customer base , category mix , international mix and software .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the data shows these changes , because we are not a material part of every channel , over 90 % of that channel 's business <b>may</b> not have the same impact ( positive or negative ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>SSS is a metric unique to ChannelAdvisor : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , eBay , Google and other e-commerce businesses do not measure SSS . They look at overall growth when they report their financial metrics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> SSS is important to our customers from a benchmarking standpoint , which is why we do it this way - it is not intended to be a proxy for the overall performance of any of these e-commerce channels .  (Uncertainty) </span>However , if this significant deceleration is n't being felt by Amazon.com , then it 's being felt by ChannelAdvisor 's existing customers and represents underperformance for them . Now, ChannelAdvisor is supposed to help gain sales, not underperform the market its customers sell into by a large margin.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If ChannelAdvisor 's customers - and certainly Amazon.com represents most of them , because Amazon.com is the largest US 3P marketplace - are suffering this much versus the market they are in , then this <b>might</b> be a large negative for ChannelAdvisor itself . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The sudden erosion on ChannelAdvisor-reported Amazon.com same-store sales is a <b>worrying</b> datapoint . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This is so because the 3P marketplace is one of the 2 large pillars which underpin Amazon.com 's newfound profitability . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Were growth to slow significantly at Amazon.com 's marketplace , and Amazon.com 's earnings growth would likely be <i>slower</i> than expected as well . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , it <b>might</b> also happen that the problem is not Amazon.com 's at all . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In that case , it is ChannelAdvisor investors who have to <b>worry</b> about it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Amazon.com is experiencing no <b>unexpected</b> 3P slowdown , then it 's just ChannelAdvisor 's customers experiencing it . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>If this is n't negative for Amazon.com , then it 's very negative for ChannelAdvisor . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Indeed , it <b>might</b> be negative for ChannelAdvisor either way , because Amazon.com 's 3P marketplace is the largest in the US and thus certainly touches most of ChannelAdvisor 's customer base .
