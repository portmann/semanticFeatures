from the warehouse floor at Amazons distribution center in Phoenix Arizona November SAN FRANCISCOSHANGHAI Amazoncom Inc AMZNO is aggressively expanding its logistics operations in China as part of a broader effort to control the rising cost of shipping billions of packages Its plans in China outlined in filings there include handling cargo and customs for goods headed to ports in Japan Europe and the United States Some analysts say the move could help position <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to offer shipping services to other companies eventually competing with the likes of United Parcel Service Inc UPSN and DHL Worldwide Express BVDHLUL That would mirror the strategy of Amazons cloud computing arm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services which is now the companys fastest growing unit The service was launched to serve Amazons own retail operations but now hosts data for other companies Seattlebased <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>faces increasing pressure from Wall Street to drive down shipping costs which rose percent in the most recent quarter compared to the same period a year ago A spokeswoman for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>declined comment The company revealed its China plans in documents filed with regulators there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>registered its Chinese subsidiary Beijing Century Joyo Courier Service as a freight forwarder a type of broker that does not own ships but handles customs and other documentation with Chinas transport ministry last year allowing it to export cargo out of the country Amazons Chinese subsidiary also made a similar application with the US Federal Maritime Commission in November <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also filed an application with the Shanghai Shipping Exchange to serve as a shipping broker for trade routes including Shanghai to Los Angeles and Shanghai to Hamburg Germany These are major gateway ports said John MannersBell who heads Transport Intelligence a logistics analysis firm They appear to be laying the foundation for a large forwarding operation In documents Beijing Century Joyo submitted to the exchange the company said it plans to charge customers between and to transport a foot dry van container from Shanghai to Hamburg The rate is comparable to those charged by other forwarders and the wide range gives it flexibility to adjust its prices based on volume Forwarders typically negotiate rates with shipping lines and pass them on to the owners of cargo Last November Beijing Century Joyo updated its Beijing business registration The company offers a suite of logistics services such as domestic delivery and handling the import and export of goods Brian Xue vice president of operations for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in China signed the government filings Xue who joined <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in has emerged as a champion for its logistics buildout in China Analysts expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to use its new freight forwarder license to make it easier for Chinese merchants and manufacturers to transport their goods to major hubs where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has warehouses that ship goods to customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would handle paperwork and select the shipping line that will transport the goods and make sure there are trucks on the other end to take shipments to its fulfillment facilities Merchants will deal only with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rather than multiple companies for trucking warehousing and shipping The license also would allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to cut shipping costs by bundling products from small and mediumsized companies to fill up containers analysts said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABAN has been asserting greater control over its logistics network in China spending billions on buying stakes in package delivery companies and launching a logistics arm that has been investing in warehouses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>directly imported about foot containers into the US last year and received an additional containers from merchants as part of the companys Fulfillment by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>program according to an analysis by Ocean Audit Inc a freight auditing consultancy The program allows merchants to store their products in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouses and makes them eligible for Prime which promises consumers twoday shipping for ayear for goods from merchants who sign up for the program Some percent of the shipments originated in China according to Ocean Audit Its not clear how many merchants have signed up to use Amazons freight services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>China announced a new crossborder logistics service to cater to Chinese merchants last October and ocean freight appears to be part of its offering But freight forwarders already handling Amazons suppliers stand to lose business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could dictate that merchants use its forwarding service said Cliff Sullivan chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tried to tamp down concerns about its ambitions in the logistics industry on a recent earnings call saying it did not plan to replace carriers like UPS but to handle more of its own deliveries at peak times But for the first time the company noted in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it views companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or third parties as competitors The retailer operates more than fulfillment centers worldwide that hold millions of products supplied by third party merchants and Amazons own vendors and where warehouse workers pick and pack items for shipment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rolled out thousands of its own trailers and launched an Uberlike delivery service last year to handle the socalled last mile of delivery taking packages from distribution centers to customers homes At the very least <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will begin handling their own freight said Zvi Schreiber the chief executive of Freightos a startup that provides an online marketplace linking forwarders and logistics vendors The next stage would be to offer the service to third party clients Some in the industry warn companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>against straying from their original business model Theyre moving into something that could be potentially very treacherous said Andreas Krueger head of ocean freight for DHL Global Forwarding in the Americas speaking generally about new entrants into the logistics industry DHL Global Forwarding one of the biggest players in air and ocean freight handles customized logistics programs The worst that would happen is we get another competitor in our midst but Im not concerned he said Weve been in the business since Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news
