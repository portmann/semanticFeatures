class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Not Leaving Any Stone Unturned In Indian Market Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Amazons quest for continuous revenue growth of over would require it to perform better in international markets also Jeff Bezos is pulling all levers to ensure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gets a dominant market share in India Recently announced incremental billion investment would help in building a more robust infrastructure and also pose serious threat to other ecommerce players who are facing difficulty in raising funds The growth potential of this market is not completely built into the current stock price which should give the stock considerable upside The Indian ecommerce market is undergoing major changes and Amazoncom Inc NASDAQ AMZN wants to make sure it has enough dry powder to build an unassailable lead over other players in this market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has recently announced an incremental investment of billion in Indian market on top of close to billion it has already invested There are many reasons for this aggressiveness in a market which is still considered to be in the early growth phase In the past six months there have been considerable changes in the startup ecosystem in India The main reason has been the huge burn rate due to discounts and the dearth of any kind of profits in the startups This has led to drying up of new capital by venture capital funds a majority of which were invested in the ecommerce market The extent of the damage can be gauged by the fact that the leading player in this market Flipkart PRIVATE FPKT has also seen its valuation downgraded by several investors Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund Trust lowered the valuation of its investment in the company by in December and by another in March This lowered the estimated valuation for the company from billion to billion in less than six months Several other smaller investors have also reduced the value of their investments by as much as in the company Another major player Snapdeal Private DEALS valued at billion has seen similar issues Both Flipkart and Snapdeal have found it difficult to raise money in the recent months and should see a much lower valuation in the next funding round thus lower available capital for expansion This works out well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which has made it a point not to repeat its mistake in China where it was overcautious in earlier investments thus leading to the dominance of other players There were rumors that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would buy one of the ecommerce players in the Indian market but with the current investment announcement it will have enough resources to simply outspend other competitors and gain primary position by According to KPMG report the estimated size of this market will reach billion by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>grabbed of market share in the last holiday season in US However in the Indian market it can easily corner a much higher market share as the competitors are startups with low resources as compared to the US market where behemoths like WalMart NYSE WMT Target NYSE TGT and others are plowing huge sums in this segment A conservative estimate of ecommerce market share in India will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to have sales of close to billion based on the estimate of the size of Indian ecommerce market in Currently the international segment is the slowest performer showing sales increase of only in compared to increase for North American market As it improves its infrastructure in India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should start getting higher sales which should lead to better performance of its international segment The biggest advantage which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has in India is the low penetration of organized retailers Within three years of launch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is already getting higher sales than any of the organized retailers like Reliance Retail and Big Bazaar which shows the growth potential within this market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a footprint in over cities and towns in India which gives it a far greater reach than any of its competitors It is yet to launch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime in India which should be a major draw with the growing upper middle class as they look for convenience and greater variety of products It is a clear road ahead for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in this market as the online competitors do not have enough resources and the brickandmortar companies do not have enough scale to be an obstacle One of the biggest risks in this market includes the sudden changes in regulatory policies Although the government has encouraged the building of retail infrastructure by ecommerce players any policy changes in the future can prove a major obstacle for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>As the market size increases other players have also shown an inclination to gain a foothold in this market Alibaba NYSE BABA is setting up its team from scratch and hopes to gain market share from incumbents However there is a steep learning curve in this market which should provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sufficient time to meet new challengers Due to the fragmented nature of retail environment in this market there is an added pressure to educate and motivate new sellers to join the platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has started several programs like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Tatkal which allows small sellers to join the platform within one hour In the end <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>might have to adjust its operations according to the local needs of the Indian market So far the company has been able to provide innovative ways of reaching a wider customer base and increasing its market share quickly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has grasped the opportunity in the Indian market with both hands and is investing heavily to make sure it has an unbeatable lead in terms of infrastructure brand recognition and operations This market should be the second biggest for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>after the US by and should provide great upside for the stock I dont think the potential of this market is currently built into the price of the stock as the company can get significant prime members in India on the launch of this program and also see incremental sales in tens of billions of dollars in the next few years Although the stock is currently trading near historic high it is still a great investment for longterm investors who are betting on continuous growth momentum for the company Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
