I don't think the potential of this market is currently built into the price of the stock as the company can get significant prime members in India on the launch of this program and also see incremental sales in tens of billions of dollars in the next few years.Although the stock is currently trading near historic high, it is still a great investment for long-term investors who are betting on continuous growth momentum for the company.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology</div></body></html>
