(NASDAQ:ANGI) | Seeking Alpha Shares of Angie's List popped over 20%.Consumers don't like paying for online reviews, which is why Angie's growth is slowing down.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Angie 's List ( NASDAQ : ANGI ) has staged a massive turnaround is as the stock is up <b>almost</b> 100 % in the last three months .  (Uncertainty) </span>Although Angie's share price has recovered, there haven't been any positive developments in the company's business that justify this rise.Angie's shares jumped over 20% in the last two trading sessions on the back of its earnings report.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What 's <b>surprising</b> is the company 's earnings report were anything but good , which is why I think investors should short the stock .  (Surprise) </span>The company reported EPS of $0.00, which was $0.05 ahead of the consensus target.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given Angie 's high short interest , the stock jumped over 20 % on the positive earnings <b>surprise</b> as short sellers started covering .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the EPS was a positive <b>surprise</b> , it does n't justify the 20 % + rise in share price .  (Surprise) </span>The earnings were driven by extensive cost-cutting measures and investors can't expect Angie's to turn profitable just after one breakeven quarter.Angie's selling expense declined by 29% y-o-y and while it helped the company beat the earnings estimate, it isn't sustainable.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Angie 's list posted a similar positive earnings <b>surprise</b> two quarters ago thanks to a massive reduction in advertising expenses .  (Surprise) </span>Share jumped over 50% that day, only to fall over 60% in the next three months.Given the similar rise, investors can use this opportunity to short Angie's List.Consumers are very reluctant to pay for online reviews.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Companies like Yelp ( NYSE : YELP ) and TripAdvisor ( NASDAQ : TRIP ) provide free reviews , which is why I <b>believe</b> Angie 's List business model is not sustainable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Consequently , Angie 's list slowing growth is n't <b>surprising</b> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Angie 's revenue of $ 87 million missed the analysts ' estimate by <b>almost</b> $ 2.7 million .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company's paid memberships also grew only 9% y-o-y, a drastic slowdown from 25% growth in the same year-ago period.Moreover, Angie's also slashed its full-year 2015 guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA.The company now expects 2015 revenue of $344 million-$348 million, down from its previous range of $357 million-$363 million.Angie's also expects adjusted EBITDA of $27 million-$30 million, down from its guidance of $30 million-$32 million.With the arrival of competitors like HomeAdvisor and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Home Services , it is hard to see how Angie 's List can sustain its present valuation . Angie's ex-CEO Bill Oesterle identified these companies as a big threat to the company's business and said , "These are formidable competitors, and over the long term we have to have the best product, the best service in the marketplace."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Home Services is n't as widely available as Angie 's List , the company plans to expand to <b>roughly</b> 30 markets by the end of 2015 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The service has been well received since its launch, with customers giving workers an average rating of 4.71 out of 5 stars.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also guarantees all purchases so if clients are not satisfied , they get their money back . As far as trust and perception are concerned , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will have an edge over Angie 's List . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A study by Consumer Reports in 2013 criticized the company of allowing businesses with a B rating or <i>better</i> to pay to get their listing placed at the top of search results .  (Surprise) </span>The report said : We think that the ability of A- and B-rated companies to buy their way to the top of the default search results skews the results.Angie's List misleads consumers by prominently promising that "businesses don't pay" and that it's a consumer-driven service supported by membership fees.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But <b>almost</b> 70 percent of the company 's revenues come from advertising purchased by the service providers being rated .  (Uncertainty) </span>In addition , given that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Home Services does n't require a paid subscription , Angie 's growth will slow down as the former expands to all the markets in the U.S. . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A short squeeze <b>may</b> have pushed Angie 's List 20 % + <i>higher</i> , but the company 's business model is still unsustainable .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Consumers are always reluctant to buy a subscription, which is why I think people will stop buying Angie's subscription in the long-run.The company hasn't reported a profitable year in 20 years of existence, and given the increasing competition, I expect its growth to slow down drastically in the foreseeable future.Hence, I think investors should consider shorting Angie's List after the massive post-earnings pop.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
