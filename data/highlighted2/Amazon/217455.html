Angies growth is slowing down Angies List NASDAQ ANGI has staged a massive turnaround is as the stock is up almost in the last three months Although Angies share price has recovered there havent been any positive developments in the companys business that justify this rise Angies shares jumped over in the last two trading sessions on the back of its earnings report Whats surprising is the companys earnings report were anything but good which is why I think investors should short the stock The company reported EPS of which was ahead of the consensus target Given Angies high short interest the stock jumped over on the positive earnings surprise as short sellers started covering While the EPS was a positive surprise it doesnt justify the rise in share price The earnings were driven by extensive costcutting measures and investors cant expect Angies to turn profitable just after one breakeven quarter Angies selling expense declined by yoy and while it helped the company beat the earnings estimate it isnt sustainable Angies list posted a similar positive earnings surprise two quarters ago thanks to a massive reduction in advertising expenses Share jumped over that day only to fall over in the next three months Given the similar rise investors can use this opportunity to short Angies List Consumers are very reluctant to pay for online reviews Companies like Yelp NYSE YELP and TripAdvisor NASDAQ TRIP provide free reviews which is why I believe Angies List business model is not sustainable Consequently Angies list slowing growth isnt surprising Angies revenue of million missed the analysts estimate by almost million The companys paid memberships also grew only yoy a drastic slowdown from growth in the same yearago period Moreover Angies also slashed its fullyear guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA The company now expects revenue of million million down from its previous range of million million Angies also expects adjusted EBITDA of million million down from its guidance of million million With the arrival of competitors like HomeAdvisor and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Home Services it is hard to see how Angies List can sustain its present valuation Angies exCEO Bill Oesterle identified these companies as a big threat to the companys business and said These are formidable competitors and over the long term we have to have the best product the best service in the marketplace Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home Services isnt as widely available as Angies List the company plans to expand to roughly markets by the end of The service has been well received since its launch with customers giving workers an average rating of out of stars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also guarantees all purchases so if clients are not satisfied they get their money back As far as trust and perception are concerned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have an edge over Angies List A study by Consumer Reports in criticized the company of allowing businesses with a B rating or better to pay to get their listing placed at the top of search results The report said We think that the ability of A and Brated companies to buy their way to the top of the default search results skews the results Angies List misleads consumers by prominently promising that businesses dont pay and that its a consumerdriven service supported by membership fees But almost percent of the companys revenues come from advertising purchased by the service providers being rated In addition given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home Services doesnt require a paid subscription Angies growth will slow down as the former expands to all the markets in the US A short squeeze may have pushed Angies List higher but the companys business model is still unsustainable Consumers are always reluctant to buy a subscription which is why I think people will stop buying Angies subscription in the longrun The company hasnt reported a profitable year in years of existence and given the increasing competition I expect its growth to slow down drastically in the foreseeable future Hence I think investors should consider shorting Angies List after the massive postearnings pop We only use your contact details to reply to
