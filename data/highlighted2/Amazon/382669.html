(Uncertainty) </span>If only Apple's services business were larger.Through services, Apple can and should carve out a wide moat around itself.I don't think it's quite there yet as I discussed in a focus article about the Apple service business : To help ensure a large market share for the iPhone, even in cycles when it brings out a relatively weak product, is to increase customer captivity through added services.Apple's management is acutely aware of this and because its service business is now starting to become meaningful, at the same time the device business is flagging, they took the opportunity to draw some attention to it at the earnings call.Source: Q1 2016 supplemental materials I think Apple has plenty of ideas what to do with their cash, but they have been constrained due to the tax inefficiency of repatriating cash from abroad.This is certainly one of the largest negatives to Apple I can think of.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , it <b>could</b> also result in one of the largest potential share price catalysts at some point in the future .  (Uncertainty) </span>Imagine for a moment what would happen to Apple's share price if it were to negotiate a more tax effective cash repatriation strategy with the U.S. Government.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I would not invest in Apple on such a speculative basis , but it is worth keeping this <b>possibility</b> in mind .  (Uncertainty) </span>If Apple truly had a lot of opportunities to invest at a high rate of RoIC, it would have borrowed against the overseas cash.Alternatively, some of those ideas should be able to be realized overseas.The repatriation tax limits the firm's options to return cash to shareholders but even if the Government allows for a tax holiday or something, I don't think such a one-time event would do much for the company's value on the long term.It would be a positive for shareholders but hardly a game changer.Bonus chart: S&P 100 Constituents Free Cash Flow Yields (%) Vs. Net Cash as a % of Market Capitalization I have a beef with Bergseng's bonus chart (see above).Accompanied by the following explanation: Essentially, this is a matter of return vs. leverage.It is easy to find stocks with a low P/E, but you will usually find they have a lot of debt relative to their market capitalization.Conversely, stocks with strong net cash positions can attract a P/E premium as they still have the ability to use their cash position and debt facilities to create growth.As you can see, Apple is to the right and above the vast majority of constituents on this chart - a combination of both larger returns and less leverage than the rest.Again, there are not many alternative investments as attractive as Apple considering its current P/E relative to the S&P 500.When you take free cash flow and net cash to compare Apple against the S&P 100, it looks to me like you are cherry picking two metrics to make Apple look good.Everyone knows the company is a sick hoarder and currently generating terrific cash flows.The problem with value (above book) is that it's based on future cash flows.With Apple, that's the crux.Bergseng failed to come up with credible arguments why Apple's future cash flows are safe.Let me reiterate, I do not hate Apple as an investment.I do want to caution against a naive bullish equation like Apple is awesome + Apple trades at a low P/E = Slam Dunk.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are real <b>risks</b> with Apple 's business model with lots of operating leverage embedded and short product cycles .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The past ten golden years have coincided with its global expansion but now pretty much everyone who can afford an iPhone owns one ... Finally , its mountain of cash adds some stability to its stock price but there is the <b>risk</b> management will spend it in a foolish manner like a value destructive acquisition .  (Uncertainty) </span>In addition, the cash lowers the overall return of your investment dollar put in Apple.Bergseng ends his piece on the notion there are not many alternative investments as attractive as Apple considering its current P/E relative to the S&P 500 but let me shower you with choices: General Motors (NYSE: GM ), Banco Santander SA (NYSE: SAN ), Bayerische Motoren Werke ( OTC:BYMOF ), Mizuho Financial Group (NYSE: MFG ), Prudential Financial (NYSE: PRU ), Surgutneftegas ( OTCPK:SGTPY ), Electricite de France SA ( OTC:ECIFF ), HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ ), United Continental Holdings (NYSE: UAL ), American Airlines Group (NYSE: AA ), Fuji Heavy Industries ( OTCPK:FUJHY ), Anthem Group (NYSE: ANTM ), Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS ), Tesoro Corp. (NYSE: TSO ) and AerCap Holdings NV (NYSE: AER ).That's just a few of them, Morningstar's screener came up with 1199 stocks trading at a deeper discount to the S&P 500.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Short Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
