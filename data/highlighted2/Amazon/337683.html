( NYSE : CBS ) , Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , and Time Warner ( NYSE : TWX ) , with Hulu gaining steam and with Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) increasingly interested in video content . Not only does the competition take away some of Netflix's subscriber base, but it creates large bidding wars and increased prices for the video content, which Netflix can barely afford in the first place.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , giant companies like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , with sufficient resources at their disposal can better afford the content and <b>may</b> be able to price Netflix out . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Netflix is left with a big challenge: Either it pays exorbitant sums for content and puts pressure on its finances, or it stays on the sidelines while its content library dwindles or becomes stagnant, leading to loss of subscribers or much slower growth.Lose-lose situation.While Netflix has hovered at or near all-time highs, insiders and very importantly directors and officers have sold millions upon millions of dollars in stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sometimes this is just profit taking , but sometimes it is a sign of a lack of <b>faith</b> in a continued rise in the stock price .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If those on the inside , who have a better view of the company 's operations and growth opportunities , do n't have <b>faith</b> in the stock , why should other investors ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Moreover , the insider selling is further muddled by a <b>confusing</b> employee compensation arrangement .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Employees and directors are given options as compensation , but somehow those options are being quickly exercised at a cost of <b>nearly</b> a tenth of the share price on the open market and sold for millions of dollars .  (Uncertainty) </span>It's as if the company is creating shares out of thin air and giving them to employees to sell on the open market for ten times the profit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Management has attempted to <b>appear</b> fair and sacrificing for the good of the company by accepting reduced salaries .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But if this options compensation is as shady as it seems , there <b>could</b> be major trouble ahead .  (Uncertainty) </span>After soaring by more than 1000% from its 2012 lows and also being the best-performing S&P 500 stock of 2015, Netflix's parabolic rise is dangerously close to collapsing on itself.On the long-term monthly chart below, you can see the giant increase in the stock price as well as the significant drop since reaching the all-time high in late 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Though it is still uncertain , this looks like it <b>could</b> be a long-term peak or all-time high never to be reached again .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the weekly chart , a similar ominous signal is emerging - what <b>appears</b> to be a topping pattern .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the chart below, you can see a significant support level of $85-90.If NFLX falls below that level, there is plenty of space below.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Moreover , though this pattern could bottom out here and continue the uptrend , it is very <b>possible</b> that Netflix is currently undergoing one of two major topping patterns - either a `` Double Top '' or a `` Head and Shoulders . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>Additionally, the recent top in the stock at around $130 was accompanied by a major "divergence" in momentum.While the stock price was making new highs, the momentum (signaled by the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and MACD) was not matching those highs.Such a negative divergence is many times visible near major peaks, right before a big plunge.At the very best, Netflix is highly overvalued with huge expectations to live up to and the best stock performance already behind it.At worst, it is a company rapidly losing to competition, is financially unsustainable, and troubled with debt.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I so have some concerns about the accounting which investors need sufficient answers to , and which <b>could</b> drag Netflix stock significantly lower .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Simply put , an investment in Netflix is not worth the <b>risk</b> , and the stock is instead a great short candidate .
