class='textDiv'>Say It Aint So Bezos <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Looking At Live Online TV Service Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Amazons preliminary look at live online TV generates concern With just about every big tech or media company focusing on online TV differentiation is a must My first response to the news Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN and Jeff Bezos may be considering entering into the live Internet TV space was underwhelming at minimum and has me scratching my head as to the why of it Beyond the obvious connection to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime which with its current video streaming service would add more stickiness to the program there isnt much to like assuming there isnt something more the giant retailer is thinking about As it is all it would do is increase costs which would result in lower margin and earnings or force an increase in annual membership fees which I dont think would be a good move at this time If this is simply another service to entice new users of the platform or to help retain existing users my thought is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could be positioning itself for the downturn in the global economy where consumers will start looking for where they should cut spending Under that scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt want to be in the top tier of spending cut considerations by consumers So thats a possibility concerning the why of it Another is there may be potential ancillary revenue streams if it goes with live TV especially if it offers it to Prime members as it is and then offers a subscription option for nonmembers or possibly an advertising option for those wanting it for free or at a lower price if advertising is included Even though Internet live TV is in its infancy the idea has been around so long it almost seems like yesterdays news There is uncertainty as to how profitable live Internet TV would be in the increasingly crowded space which is for the most part a commodity business Thats the main reason I dont like this if Bezos is only going to compete at a lowprice level in the space Because there are strong efforts to protect the bundle by the industry it is unlikely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will be able to enter deals that would allow it to break down a lot of content it secures and offer it on an a la carte basis which is where the demand is especially on the Internet Not too long ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>acquired Elemental Technologies which offers a software that aids companies in reformatting and streaming live or ondemand video to a variety of screens One of its major customers is Netflix NASDAQ NFLX which confirms this is a product that is positioned well for the growing streaming market whether its live or always available Some pointed to the acquisition as proof <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going to go live but thats not necessarily how itll play out It could be putting itself in the position to generate revenue with the software which of course it will continue to do With the growing streaming market it should be significant It could also enhance its cloud service which has the potential to be a profitable growth engine for the company in the years ahead But if it is at least in part a way to internally grow out a live TV service it definitely has the capability to do so with the software under its control now After this story broke Bloomberg did some further research and found that among the companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is feeling out concerning content are NBCUniversal controlled by Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK and CBS NYSE CBS There will be others This could point to a potential live TV business Another possibility is like Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may be looking at what it will take to acquire content rights and offer it in more of an a la carte format which the industry has been furiously battling against The reason for that is it doesnt want to go through what the music industry went through when it unbundled albums Its inevitable that the industry will be forced to go that way because of consumer demand but its delaying it for as long as it can My thought there is the industry will try easing into smaller content bundles without having to offer it on an individual basis That may be able to be done in the near term but further out I think itll have to capitulate to consumer demand This is why Im not convinced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is simply looking at an online live TV streaming content deal Other than reinforcing its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime business it wouldnt make a lot of sense except for possible alternative revenue sources Where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could potentially do well here is if it decided to create its own channel which would be included with bundled content from the networks or cable channels There it could acquire or produce premium original content which would be a way it could differentiate its live TV offering This is where it could include ads consumers may not mind viewing Since its revenue is primarily derived from retail it would be easy to see it create its own hour shopping channel featuring numerous products consumers would be sure to buy up That could go beyond commodity products to unique products it has rights to There are a lot of ways it could go there and it would have the potential to be a complementary but significant revenue stream which if included with ad revenue and a possible subscription service to those that arent members of Prime would increase its revenue stream nicely If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has the goal of keeping people within its ecosystem it could decide to acquire the content and allow the live TV content to be shown only on its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire TV or by using a Fire TV Stick The challenge there is Fire isnt branded strongly at this time and it would have to be seen whether or not the live content offered would be attractive enough to entice consumers to buy a Fire product Thats a possibility but it would be risky depending on what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is trying to do overall with a live TV subscription Its recent moves to remove competitors hardware like Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Chromecast and Apple TV is what makes me think this may at least be an option being considered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Something like that may not be the only option but it could be offered with some type of incentive to give it a try If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is looking at acquiring content for the sole purpose of offering live streaming TV I hate the idea There is no differentiation there and this is a market that is going to only increase in competitors over the next two to three years And itll take time to see who the winners and losers will be On the other hand if this is being considered for some of the ideas mentioned above or possibly other ideas not known at this time this has potential Its easy to see a wide variety of potential revenue streams <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could include in a live TV streaming service if it has that on its plate A streaming live TV service with the purpose of only being implemented to attract some new Prime subscribers or retain the old would be too expensive in my opinion to justify the added expense For that reason if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does enter into a content deal Im expecting to see something beyond a
