( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's <b>preliminary</b> look at live online TV generates concern . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>With just about every big tech or media company focusing on online TV, differentiation is a must.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My first response to the news Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Jeff Bezos <b>may</b> be considering entering into the live Internet TV space was underwhelming at minimum , and has me scratching my head as to the why of it . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Beyond the obvious connection to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , which with its current video streaming service would add <i>more</i> stickiness to the program , there is n't much to like , <b>assuming</b> there is n't something <i>more</i> the giant retailer is thinking about . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As it is , all it would do is increase costs , which would result in <i>lower</i> margin and earnings , or force an increase in annual membership fees , which I do n't think would be a good move at this time .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this is simply another service to entice new users of the platform , or to help retain existing users , my thought is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> be positioning itself for the downturn in the global economy , where consumers will start looking for where they should cut spending . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Under that scenario , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't want to be in the top tier of spending cut considerations by consumers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So that 's a <b>possibility</b> concerning the why of it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Another is there may be potential ancillary revenue streams if it goes with live TV , especially if it offers it to Prime members as it is , and then offers a subscription option for non-members , or <b>possibly</b> an advertising option for those wanting it for free , or at a <i>lower</i> price if advertising is included .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even though Internet live TV is in its infancy , the idea has been around so long , it almost <b>seems</b> like yesterday 's news .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is <b>uncertainty</b> as to how profitable live Internet TV would be in the increasingly crowded space , which is for the most part , a commodity business .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's the main reason I don't like this, if Bezos is only going to compete at a low-price level in the space.Because there are strong efforts to protect the bundle by the industry , it is unlikely <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be able to enter deals that would allow it to break down a lot of content it secures and offer it on an a la carte basis , which is where the demand is ; especially on the Internet . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not too long ago <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> acquired Elemental Technologies , which offers a software that aids companies in reformatting and streaming live or on-demand video to a <b>variety</b> of screens . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>One of its major customers is Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), which confirms this is a product that is positioned well for the growing streaming market - whether it's live or always available.Some pointed to the acquisition as proof <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going to go live , but that 's not necessarily how it 'll play out . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> be putting itself in the position to generate revenue with the software , which of course it will continue to do .  (Uncertainty) </span>With the growing streaming market, it should be significant.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> also enhance its cloud service , which has the potential to be a profitable growth engine for the company in the years ahead .  (Uncertainty) </span>But if it is at least in part a way to internally grow out a live TV service, it definitely has the capability to do so with the software under its control now.After this story broke , Bloomberg did some further research and found that among the companies <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is feeling out concerning content are NBCUniversal , controlled by Comcast ( NASDAQ : CMCSA ) ( NASDAQ : CMCSK ) , and CBS ( NYSE : CBS ) . There will be others.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> point to a potential live TV business .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Another possibility is like Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> be looking at what it will take to acquire content rights and offer it in <i>more</i> of an a la carte format , which the industry has been furiously battling against . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The reason for that is it doesn't want to go through what the music industry went through when it unbundled albums.It's inevitable that the industry will be forced to go that way because of consumer demand, but it's delaying it for as long as it can.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>My thought there is the industry will try easing into <i>smaller</i> content bundles without having to offer it on an individual basis .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>may</b> be able to be done in the near term , but further out I think it 'll have to capitulate to consumer demand .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is why I 'm not convinced <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is simply looking at an online live TV streaming content deal . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Other than reinforcing its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime business , it would n't make a lot of sense , except for <b>possible</b> alternative revenue sources . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> potentially do well here is if it decided to create its own channel , which would be included with bundled content from the networks or cable channels . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There it <b>could</b> acquire or produce premium , original content , which would be a way it <b>could</b> differentiate its live TV offering .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is where it could include ads consumers <b>may</b> not mind viewing .  (Uncertainty) </span>Since its revenue is primarily derived from retail, it would be easy to see it create its own 24-hour shopping channel, featuring numerous products consumers would be sure to buy up.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>could</b> go beyond commodity products to unique products it has rights to .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are a lot of ways it could go there , and it would have the potential to be a complementary but significant revenue stream , which if included with ad revenue and a <b>possible</b> subscription service to those that are n't members of Prime , would increase its revenue stream nicely .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has the goal of keeping people within its ecosystem , it <b>could</b> decide to acquire the content and allow the live TV content to be shown only on its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire TV or by using a Fire TV Stick . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The challenge there is Fire isn't branded strongly at this time, and it would have to be seen whether or not the live content offered would be attractive enough to entice consumers to buy a Fire product.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's a possibility , but it would be risky , <b>depending</b> on what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is trying to do overall with a live TV subscription . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Its recent moves to remove competitors ' hardware like Google 's ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) Chromecast and Apple TV is what makes me think this <b>may</b> at least be an option being considered by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Something like that may not be the only option , but it <b>could</b> be offered with some type of incentive to give it a try .  (Uncertainty) </span>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is looking at acquiring content for the sole purpose of offering live streaming TV , I hate the idea . There is no differentiation there, and this is a market that is going to only increase in competitors over the next two to three years.And it'll take time to see who the winners and losers will be.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , if this is being considered for some of the ideas mentioned above , or <b>possibly</b> other ideas not known at this time , this has potential .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's easy to see a wide variety of potential revenue streams <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> include in a live TV streaming service if it has that on its plate . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>A streaming live TV service with the purpose of only being implemented to attract some new Prime subscribers or retain the old, would be too expensive in my opinion to justify the added expense.For that reason , if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does enter into a content deal , I 'm expecting to see something beyond a commoditized , live streaming TV from the company . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
