(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Factor in that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's profits are a lot <i>less</i> than their middle man revenue and the numbers look even <i>better</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In absolute terms , Apple spends billions <i>less</i> than tech peers .  (Surprise) </span>This year Apple is on track to spend $10 billion and $12 billion next year which is incredible considering they were spending a little over $3 billion four years ago.Data is from Neil Cybart at the Above Avalon blog.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If Apple was a baseball team they 'd be the Oakland As that are spending <i>less</i> than the Yankees , Red Sox , Dodgers and they 'd still be winning <i>more</i> games .  (Surprise) </span>Steve Jobs would obviously be Billy Beane in this analogy.The problem is that Jobs is gone and this data is backward looking.The iPhone was the winning lottery ticket, as was Windows, as was Google search and Facebook's social network.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Apple 's R&D interests you , again I 'd <b>suggest</b> reading this and other Above Avalon blog posts .  (Uncertainty) </span>These next two charts from the blog illustrate that Apple is rapidly increasing R&D.For something big?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do n't know where those investment dollars are being directed ( Apple did mention an increase in headcount ) but there 's plenty of <b>speculation</b> about Project Titan , a car .  (Uncertainty) </span>Overall the company is investing $15 billion in capex including their acqusitions and capital improvements.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple Campus 2 which <b>could</b> be complete next year is big enough to accommodate project Titan .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple also is opening an R&D facility in Yokohama, Japan, an area known to specialize in vehicles and the health industry.The Hyderabad, India, office will be a tech center.The smartphone market in the developed world is coming to saturation.65% of the population has a smartphone and many of the hold outs don't want them.So what?People are irrationally obsessed with their phones.iOs is what, 12% of the market?They can't just out compete Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and others?Do people say that the clothing market is saturated so Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) can't grow?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>No , if their air wick shirts are <i>better</i> than their competition you buy them .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many people replace their phones every year and a half , <b>maybe</b> that 's slowing to three years but it 's still a huge cash cow .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If iPhones are <i>better</i> than Samsung phones then forget the overall market , THEIR market grows .  (Surprise) </span>Even with slowing and declining revenue, the company already is trading at a cheap price.It's not like this is a 28 PE stock with flat revenue like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If you take the debt out of the equation the financials look even <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span>There are too many impatient investors who want a stock to always go up.It doesn't work like that.Cook has been buying shares on the way down.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tis <b>could</b> be a 2014 redux .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Cook knows <i>more</i> about the R&D than anyone and I do n't think he 's <b>panicked</b> at all .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It used to be that Apple was going to be the first trillion-dollar market cap, now the shorts are talking about Apple at $85, $80, $70s.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I initially bought Apple pre split under $ 80 per share ( ~ $ 11.40 post split ) and made additional purchases on the way up , <b>maybe</b> $ 200 , $ 220 , $ 240 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Added some during the last pull back without looking it up in I <b>believe</b> 2013 ~ $ 65 post split .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I trimmed some of my position when it hit $ 100 , and when it went over $ 110 due to portfolio management and everything firing on all cylinders and a <b>hope</b> to buy back later <i>cheaper</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>My portfolio is still about 15% Apple, I've had a great track record with this one and I'm here to tell you the time to buy back in is now.I'm not sure what that amped up R&D budget will bring - a car, heavily commercialized virtual reality, 3D pictures, improved voice search (Siri), additional breakthroughs in health, wearables, but Apple will innovate.I'm expecting results with their increased R&D budget.Apple lost their secret weapon in Jobs but the increased R&D headcount and additional facilities show the company's commitment to innovation.If Apple continues the Jobs way - focusing on a few strong/creative ideas likely to make money instead of spreading thin and working on everything they should do well.So far there are no indications of a strategy shift even with the increased spending.Based on Apple's sterling historical R&D return on investment, the market is currently underrating this stock.Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, GOOG, MSFT.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
