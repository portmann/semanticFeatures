(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Research (and real life) show no correlation between R&D budgets and innovation.Steve Jobs talents and vision saved the company billions in R&D.Apple has historically focused on improving existing products for consumers.They are a business, not a research lab.They focus on a limited number of ideas and there have been no signs of a shift in strategy under Tim Cook.Apple this, Apple that.A main argument that bears make is that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) needs to innovate.Releasing a new iPhone color isn't innovation, agreed.What investors want is that next game changing product.There are no guarantees but you have to play the R&D lottery to win the R&D lottery.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Interestingly , <b>possibly</b> Apple 's best analyst , Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein , came out with a study a couple years ago .  (Uncertainty) </span>He found that spending on R&D doesn't guarantee any results (obviously) and overall there really isn't a correlation between spending and shareholder returns.Tech or otherwise.I have some theories why this would apply but a couple factors regarding innovation.The Economic Recovery Act of 1981 gave us an R&D tax credit.Corporations have an incentive to classify everything as R&D.Is the next upgrade cycle of Windows really innovation?How much R&D is even innovation focused and how much is taking the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 6s?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What if one company with a big R&D budget pursues every willy nilly idea while the company with the <i>smaller</i> budget picks and chooses their battles <i>more</i> carefully from the get go ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It would be incredibly difficult to standardize the data factoring in true R&D , upgrades and long shot ideas vs <i>more</i> <b>probable</b> winners .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Steve Jobs echoed Tony Sacconghi's comments in 1981 when he told Fortune that "innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have."Jobs was fond of pointing to his small R&D spend as a key difference between Apple and Microsoft.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Some people can just do <i>more</i> with <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Is it talent, focus, strategy, luck?For jobs I'd say all of the above.The X factor was Steve Jobs.R&D can be a cash pit.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Every engineer has their pet project that <b>might</b> be the next big thing , they just need <i>more</i> time and resources to work on it .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Jobs was <b>apparently</b> good at spotting and cutting dead-end projects early on .  (Uncertainty) </span>He was a CEO with the engineering background that really understood the tech and had the ability to save millions of company dollars from sunk R&D costs.You can't say the same about "at the time" rival CEO Steve Ballmer.Steve Jobs was winning the R&D lottery and he wasn't even buying many tickets - it wasn't luck.Jobs kept a simplified product offering.If Apple was a restaurant they'd have a few items on their menu and they'd all be delicious.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's <i>easier</i> from an R&D perspective ( and inventory/supply chain ) than branching out so many ways .  (Surprise) </span>Simple, focused, quality.Focus.Are you trying to invent cool new technology or technology that consumers will actually buy?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple admits that they <b>may</b> be passing up decent opportunities , but they stay focused on money making ideas .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is a business, not a science lab.Apple didn't even invent the MP3 player, smartphone or tablet.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Others invented these products first , Apple just improved them and made them <i>more</i> commercial friendly .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's <i>easier</i> to improve an existing product and make it your own than create it from scratch .  (Surprise) </span>A good artist copies, a great artist steals.When people say that CEOs aren't worth X times the salary of the average employee - blah blah blah - I think those people are naive and don't understand business or even math and logic.Some CEOs are overpaid, others are underpaid - just like any other job.When you take the jealous emotion out of the argument you see that a poor CEO can drive a good company into the ground while a great CEO can turn a niche computer company into the most valuable company in the world.Apple was saving billions on R&D dollars yearly with Steve Jobs and the iPhone has one of the greatest ROIs of all-time.Oh but Steve should have only been making 20X what the part-time pimply faced high school kid at the Apple store makes?Steve Jobs was underpaid.Apple's approach to R&D is secretive which is correct for a hardware tech vendor.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you are in the market for a new phone but know that the iPhone 7 is coming out and will have virtual reality built in and other bells and whistles you <b>might</b> not buy the 6 now .  (Uncertainty) </span>That hurts sales so they keep future initiatives close to the vest.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Other tech titans do n't have to <b>worry</b> about that .  (Uncertainty) </span>In terms of R&D to revenue , Apple invests a fraction of what their tech peers Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , Alphabet ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) pay . In the trailing 12 months Apple invested 4 % of revenue into R&D while Facebook was investing 26 % , Alphabet 17 % , Microsoft 14 % and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 12 % . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As of Q2 earnings Apple 's number jumped to 5 % which is still <i>less</i> than half of their competitors when standardized by revenue .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Factor in that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's profits are a lot <i>less</i> than their middle man revenue and the numbers look even <i>better</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In absolute terms , Apple spends billions <i>less</i> than tech peers .  (Surprise) </span>This year Apple is on track to spend $10 billion and $12 billion next year which is incredible considering they were spending a little over $3 billion four years ago.Data is from Neil Cybart at the Above Avalon blog.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If Apple was a baseball team they 'd be the Oakland As that are spending <i>less</i> than the Yankees , Red Sox , Dodgers and they 'd still be winning <i>more</i> games .  (Surprise) </span>Steve Jobs would obviously be Billy Beane in this analogy.The problem is that Jobs is gone and this data is backward looking.The iPhone was the winning lottery ticket, as was Windows, as was Google search and Facebook's social network.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Apple 's R&D interests you , again I 'd <b>suggest</b> reading this and other Above Avalon blog posts .  (Uncertainty) </span>These next two charts from the blog illustrate that Apple is rapidly increasing R&D.For something big?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We do n't know where those investment dollars are being directed ( Apple did mention an increase in headcount ) but there 's plenty of <b>speculation</b> about Project Titan , a car .  (Uncertainty) </span>Overall the company is investing $15 billion in capex including their acqusitions and capital improvements.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple Campus 2 which <b>could</b> be complete next year is big enough to accommodate project Titan .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple also is opening an R&D facility in Yokohama, Japan, an area known to specialize in vehicles and the health industry.The Hyderabad, India, office will be a tech center.The smartphone market in the developed world is coming to saturation.65% of the population has a smartphone and many of the hold outs don't want them.So what?People are irrationally obsessed with their phones.iOs is what, 12% of the market?They can't just out compete Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and others?Do people say that the clothing market is saturated so Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) can't grow?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>No , if their air wick shirts are <i>better</i> than their competition you buy them .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many people replace their phones every year and a half , <b>maybe</b> that 's slowing to three years but it 's still a huge cash cow .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If iPhones are <i>better</i> than Samsung phones then forget the overall market , THEIR market grows .  (Surprise) </span>Even with slowing and declining revenue, the company already is trading at a cheap price.It's not like this is a 28 PE stock with flat revenue like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If you take the debt out of the equation the financials look even <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span>There are too many impatient investors who want a stock to always go up.It doesn't work like that.Cook has been buying shares on the way down.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tis <b>could</b> be a 2014 redux .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Cook knows <i>more</i> about the R&D than anyone and I do n't think he 's <b>panicked</b> at all .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It used to be that Apple was going to be the first trillion-dollar market cap, now the shorts are talking about Apple at $85, $80, $70s.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I initially bought Apple pre split under $ 80 per share ( ~ $ 11.40 post split ) and made additional purchases on the way up , <b>maybe</b> $ 200 , $ 220 , $ 240 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Added some during the last pull back without looking it up in I <b>believe</b> 2013 ~ $ 65 post split .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I trimmed some of my position when it hit $ 100 , and when it went over $ 110 due to portfolio management and everything firing on all cylinders and a <b>hope</b> to buy back later <i>cheaper</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>My portfolio is still about 15% Apple, I've had a great track record with this one and I'm here to tell you the time to buy back in is now.I'm not sure what that amped up R&D budget will bring - a car, heavily commercialized virtual reality, 3D pictures, improved voice search (Siri), additional breakthroughs in health, wearables, but Apple will innovate.I'm expecting results with their increased R&D budget.Apple lost their secret weapon in Jobs but the increased R&D headcount and additional facilities show the company's commitment to innovation.If Apple continues the Jobs way - focusing on a few strong/creative ideas likely to make money instead of spreading thin and working on everything they should do well.So far there are no indications of a strategy shift even with the increased spending.Based on Apple's sterling historical R&D return on investment, the market is currently underrating this stock.Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, GOOG, MSFT.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
