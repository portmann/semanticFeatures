(Uncertainty) </span>I would still recommend investing in all four companies because Google has made significant investments in cloud and is on an aggressive client acquisition path with Diane Greene leading the attack, but cloud revenues are not yet significant enough to have an impact on overall performance.In subsequent reports, I will continue to use the TTM approach to deciphering reported revenues.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is the best metric to keep your eye on if you 're looking to invest in the cloud space because it is <i>more</i> realistic than run rates .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , if you go back a few quarters , you 'll be able to see how IBM was actually leading the pack as far back as Q1-2015 , when they were at $ 7.7 billion and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> had only just started reporting AWS revenues separately . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>I expect all three companies to continue to grow at 50% levels year-over-year - especially Microsoft and IBM because they've barely penetrated the enterprise market.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With Microsoft now squarely in the hybrid cloud space with Azure Stack , the market now has two viable options , which will make them <i>more</i> open to moving to the cloud .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AWS will continue to grow in the SMB segment , with a <i>smaller</i> portion coming from enterprise .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They will also continue to provide the tools and services that make it <i>easier</i> for these companies to move to the cloud .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They 're already growing <i>more</i> than twice as fast as the industry average of 19.4 % CAGR , and the saturation point is still very far away .  (Surprise) </span>As a group, these three companies will drive the cloud industry forward.And that's why these are the three tickers you want to see in your portfolio when the decade comes to a close; and these are the three companies that will define the growth of cloud over the next several decades.If you found value in this article, please follow me by clicking on the "Follow" link next to my name at the top of this page.You can also do this in my profile page here .Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Quick Picks & Lists, Technology</div></body></html>
