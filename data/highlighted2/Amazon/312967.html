<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Doing Anything To Fight Latest Wave Of Fake PaidFor Reviews Consumerist Whoops It looks like portions of our site are being blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator Bookmark Post Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comments brought to you by the letter amazon online reviews fake reviews Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>began allowing customers to post reviews on product pages various waves of bogus reviewers have attempted to game the system by posting fictitious or dishonest writeups While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has recently taken legal action against people paid to write fake reviews for products and the site has a ban on most forms of paid reviews theres a new crop of compensated reviewers who are receiving free or discounted products in exchange for then writing honest reviews But some of these users are writing dozens of reviews a day sometimes for products they couldnt possibly have tried This newer form of fake paid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reviews are creeping in thanks to marketing sites that offer free and deeply discounted items if buyers promise to then share their honest feelings on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Thirdparty marketers are selling products or giving them away in exchange for honest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reviews <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>allows such reviews so long as the compensation is clearly disclosed in the review and the writeup is truthful Some people who receive freediscounted items are posting reviews for products they could not possibly have tried They are also posting dozens of reviews daily upwards of hundreds of reviews a month almost all star reviews without being flagged by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Ignore star ratings and read the full text of reviews to get an idea if the reviewer A actually tried the product and B has similar standards to yours <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>users can filter reviews so that only verified purchases show up This will also filter out people who bought items through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>at a deeply discounted price Use sites like FakeSpotcom to scan through reviews to help determine whether or not the content may be useful to you While Amazons review guidelines prohibit most paid reviews they do include an explicit exception when a free or discounted copy of a physical product is provided to a customer up front if the user clearly and conspicuously discloses that fact in their review Thats because etail giant has its own form of a free stuff for reviews in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Vine which allows select customers to get prerelease access to some products But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>knows who Vine members are and what theyve received through the program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does not however necessarily know if a reviewer purchased an item through some discount marketer with the promise of writing a review In an effort to avoid the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>police and to stave off legal concerns more on that in a minute these marketers require that reviews comply with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>policy and include disclosures like I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review But its those very statements that are giving regular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers an indication of just how bad this problem can be Case in point no pun intended Consumerist readers directed us to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>page for this phone case for the Lumia smartphone When we began researching this story there were reviews posted on this page many of them mentioning how well the phone fits on their Lumia It fits snuggly and provides good protection reads one review it is great fit my phone great opines another user All of the reviews indicated in some fashion that they had received the case for free or at a discount and all but one of the reviews was a fivestar writeup potentially leading a shopper to possibly believe that this is a decent product Except there arent yet any shoppers looking for this case because the Lumia hadnt been released when these reviews were written Perhaps its possible that all of these reviewers managed to get an early release of the device Three of the reviewers involved also posted their email addresses on their profiles so we wrote them to ask but have yet to hear back from any of them In one week in January a reviewer named Andrea wrote up approximately star opinions including reviews for cases for at least different phones Out of curiosity we looked at what else these users had reviewed and every single one of them with a public profile appears to have spent an inordinate amount of time writing up their supposedly honest feelings about dozens of products a day We looked at the list of reviews since Jan for each of these users and found that they averaged more than reviews each in just those few weeks The fewest was around reviews since Jan while one user managed to somehow crank out approximately reviews in a single month Assuming eight hours of sleep per day thats nearly two reviews an hour for every single waking hour every day of the week for days So what are these people reviewing Apparently anything they can get at a deep discount in exchange for a review In just a few hours one reviewer posted her thoughts on a USB travel charger melatonin pills two USB cords novelty wine glasses a selfie stick a bunion splint and phone cases lots of phone cases And not just for a single type of phone A quick scan of one users list turned up multiple reviews all from Jan for cases or screen protectors for each of the following devices Galaxy Note Galaxy E iPhone S iPhone S Plus iPhone C Galaxy S Galaxy S Plus a device that doesnt even exist Galaxy Grand Prime Galaxy Centura HTC One A LG V Galaxy S ZTE Grand X Max Galaxy Alpha Lumia Moto X Lumia Lumia Lumia ZTE Allstar Huawei Union Galaxy Avant Droid Turbo Galaxy S Edge Nexus P LG Optimus F OnePlus One Alcatel OneTouch Idol and thats when we just gave up taking notes By the way all these reviews stars In fact we had to scroll past approximately reviews to Jan before we got to one from this user that was not a star writeup Yes it is possible inasmuch as virtually anything is possible in an infinite universe that there is someone out there legitimately purchasing hundreds of items a month many of them redundant based on previous purchases then taking the time to write glowing reviews for each of those items But in the real world of limited possibility all of the above signs point to many of these reviewers being blatant fakes or at least meriting further scrutiny from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>So why are these reviews allowed to be posted Shouldnt the very fact that someone received something for free call into question that persons ability to provide an unbiased point of view At the very least that reviewer cant be fully relied upon to tell other shoppers whether something is worth the real price of the product Then again if someone receives an item as a birthday gift they arent expected to disclose that in a review And almost all publications that review products from cars to appliances to books music movies and video games get these items without spending a dime But the difference is that no one gets a birthday gift on the condition that they then review it And while professional reviewers have been known to be cut off from free products by companies that feel they were treated unfairly pros who routinely rave about everything they try rarely carry much authority with readers Given the obvious red flags shown in the examples above too many reviews too many raves use of easily identifiable language showing that these products were discounted in exchange for reviews youd think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would be able to filter out these users feedback much in the way that Yelps algorithm automatically hides reviews it deems questionable those writeups are still available for reading but they arent included in the star ratings and arent shown unless the reader deliberately unhides them After we brought the questionable reviews for Lumia case to Amazons attention some of the reviews were taken down As of now only one of the ten reviews from compensated users remains Interestingly its the only one that did not give the case five stars We do not allow paid reviews and terminate accounts that abuse the system or violate our guidelines an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>rep tells Consumerist That being said the vast majority of reviews on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are authentic helping millions of customers make informed buying decisions every day Our goal is to make reviews as useful as possible for customers Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>actually doing anything proactive to prevent the spread of these dubious reviews Aside from pointing to the recent legal actions taken against allegedly fake reviewers the company would not provide any information on any efforts to track andor filter users with questionable motives though a source at the company did say it is aware of the problem and how the presence of apparently fake reviews hurts real customers and Amazons image First off as weve advised on all crowdsourced review sites ignore the star rating not just the average rating for a product but for each individual review What is a star product for one person might be a star product for another Sometimes people knock off stars for reasons you wouldnt even consider like the color of a DVD players remote control or because they simply dont like the company that makes a product Read the actual text of the review and decide for yourself if its of any relevance to your needs Filter reviews so that youre only seeing verified purchases from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers Yes this will remove all the reviewers who legitimately bought a product elsewhere but at least youll know that the reviews you do see are from people who paid for it Some of these discount marketers have tried to game this verified purchase badging system Rather than sending the reviewer the product directly the reviewer buys the product through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>with a promotional code that allows it to be purchased at a discount However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>now only places the verified badge on reviews from a customer who purchased the product at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and didnt receive the product at a deep discount <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would not say what level of a discount triggers that verified threshold or whether that rule also applies to customers who purchase items directly from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as opposed to thirdparty sellers on the site Then there are third party sites like FakeSpot which analyzes not just the reviews on an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>product page but other reviews written by the users on that page Putting the Lumia case URL into FakeSpot turned up a thumbs down from the site and a poor rating of low quality reviews Our analysis has detected product exchange for reviews reads the results page We believe these reviews are harmful for real consumers because of the inherent bias and our opinion reflects that Combining these three tactics wont guarantee that you avoid fake reviews but they will give you a better sense of whether or not the reviews for a product have been overrun by compensated shills Aside from diluting real reviews to the point where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>customers dont know who to trust is anyone really doing anything they could get in trouble for That depends according to some lawyers we spoke to If people are deliberately posting false reviews to hurt a company thats certainly something that can and has been the subject of legal action Fake unfavorable reviews are actionable under product disparagement laws and other causes of action related to defamation explains Regina Austin the William A Schnader Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania When the fake reviews are negative its usually the manufacturer being slighted that does the suing says Austin not the customers who are getting bad information Its much more difficult to argue harm from bogus positive reviews But if a company makes a concerted effort to distort <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reviews either negatively or positively then that could lead to the involvement of a regulator like the Federal Trade Commission There would have to be a pattern of conduct on the part of the advertiser to encourage consumers to post reviews that are overly glowing or not truthful explains Dana Rosenfeld former assistant director of the FTCs Bureau of Consumer Protection So who is ultimately liable in such a case Certainly the individual reviewers shoulder the blame for writing the actual reviews but the more likely target of a regulatory complaint would be either the discount marketer or the manufacturer paying that marketer to get their products reviewed Yes the discounter requires honest reviews and transparent disclosures but at least judging by the examples weve seen they are not questioning why some of their customers seem to love everything they review or how some of these people are posting reviews for items that they couldnt possibly have used yet Rosenfeld tells Consumerist theres nothing inherently wrong with an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>page full of glowing reviews even ones for which reviewers receive some sort of compensation so long as they accurately reflect the reviewers experience are truthful and adequately disclose any incentive provided by the advertiser If however a significant number of the paidfor reviews reflect results that are nearly impossible to achieve or the review pertains to a product not yet released then there could be liability on the part of the advertiser if it does not take steps to remove the reviews she explains These reviews could be the result of the advertiser or affiliate marketer affirmatively encouraging such reviews or willful ignorance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Sues Individual Reviewers For Hire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Tweaks Review System To
