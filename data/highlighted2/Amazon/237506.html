So you can actually fire up other data centers to work along with your core data center.And it is really designed for large deployments.Right?We were able to stand up an infrastructure for 10,000 users in two weeks and which is not heard of, but it does require certain technical sophistication to do it.It is not something - it is not pushing a button.Glassware coming in at the marketplace, that's pushing a button.All those little micro small virtual servers that are located and spread out in Exosphere, they are shrunk down into one package so that you can go online, go into their store, pull the image, go download your client from one of the app stores whoever it is, put in the address for your virtual machine and connect to that virtual machine in Azure.So it is more geared towards, and I wouldn’t say necessarily it is small medium businesses because that is not the only target, because it can't do thousands of users, it is actually geared towards a more simple approach, less distributed, but can also cater for somebody who just needs access.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I mean if you needed access to Microsoft Office for the weekend , you <b>could</b> literally turnaround and fire up for a weekend .  (Uncertainty) </span>And in terms of Glassware remove everything and in about half an hour into the cloud and then come back and turn it off on Monday.Right?So it is two different sort of market use cases and the bigger difference between the two is really scale and flexibility as well as the amount of specification you need to actually run.Okay, who or how it will be marketed and by whom?How the product will be marketed and by whom?Well absolutely, so both products are done jointly between us and Microsoft.And so this is again to be very, very clear and I've heard these questions from a couple of other shareholders, I'll be as clear as I can, they are out marketing this think in many cases without us and they are patrolling leads over the fence saying, hey guys here is what I have come across, can you help, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.So their sales force is working this.Understand this is an Azure and I cannot speak to this, but from outside looking in if you look at all the push they've put on Azure, this is a major initiative for them, their cloud and that's why they grew I think 130% quarter-over-quarter last quarter.So they are definitely incentivized to go out there and this gives them a huge advantage over whomever else is out there right now when it comes to applications.I mean where we can deliver stuff no one else can and their sales folks know it, so they are in the front line.They took the just to add to that, I mean I wouldn’t look at it, when I know their sales teams are compensated.Compensation plans are in line with our compensation plans and I know that they are focused.Okay, so can you give me an example of how just something that's simple like we are perfect, how will it be used in marketplace, I would like to know that, if I want to use Exosphere, using Exosphere that way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So well , I mean , I 'll put it this way , if you were Corel -LSB- ph -RSB- or if you were a large employer with 20,000 or 50,000 or 80,000 workers you would <b>probably</b> deploy Word Perfect in Exosphere .  (Uncertainty) </span>And if you were the bank that we installed last week, you'd go to marketplace.And that would be the biggest difference, because Exosphere is network aware.Right?So Exosphere will literally switch from carrier to carrier.It will fire up backup instances without you getting involved.It is designed to literally deliver the world's software from the cloud.I mean it is a very unique application delivery platform.The cost efficiencies in both, that's a great questions Scott.They actually both perform when it comes to reducing the costs.We say penny per hour, it is penny per hour for Exosphere, pennies per hour for Azure marketplace [ph].Okay, one last question, GPU we've been hearing about this for six weeks now.We are due to hear something formal about this.One is this, which we…?So we do have a small GPU sitting in the GW2000.We do have a version which actually is in the field with is based on Dell hardware, the whole GPU access.So that's in the market and in the market and is available for sale today.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We will support GPUs in the Azure cloud as soon as Microsoft releases that which I <b>believe</b> is Q1 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>I think it is in pre-release today, no one quote me on that, but whenever it is available, it is available for us in the interim Exosphere can access GPU from appliances in other data centers so that you can actually deploy it today.In case of any hiccups with Azure it won't affect our ability to land GPU requirements from customers.We have time for one more question from the line of Chris Wilson [ph], a Private Investor.Your line is open.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hi guys , just real quick since you do n't have much time , I 'm interested in with all the stable of products that you have brought to market or are bringing to market <b>may</b> revolutionary , many state-of-the-art , how does that relate to the 16,000 authorized resellers that you 've got in your channel right now ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Is there, are they aware of these products and if so, at what point are they going to start putting some numbers up?So Chris, we've done it in stages, I mean, those are huge channels, but at the same time they are not actually all skilled or even interested to move to the virtualization portfolio.So we do have a number of that obviously are and so we started the process of training and introducing it.We've got a few, as always we've got a few great customers or partners that have signed up for it and we will continue to do that, but we expect putting up some numbers on the board for us, right.We did start in North America first.We'll work our way from there into Europe and then the rest of the world after that.So we'll do it in stages right?I mean we've got a great new skill set again supporting them all and we've got to do this little by little.We can't do them all at once.First, I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think you can <b>hopefully</b> hear from us our assignment that we are very pleased with the execution that we 've been achieving and becoming the premier cloud infrastructure company .  (Uncertainty) </span>The partnership that we have we've talked a lot about Microsoft and we have other partnerships with companies like VMware, I mean our channel partnerships, our key partners Tech Data, et cetera are all being brought up to speed and supporting our vision and delivering our cloud infrastructure, specifically our virtualization and storage platforms.So with that, I look forward to updating everyone on our progress in the future and operator I'd like to conclude the call.This concludes today's conference call.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>may</b> now disconnect .
