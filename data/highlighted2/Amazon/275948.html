style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is likely to report sales over billion for FY a big milestone The global retail ecommerce industry is expected to grow at a superfast pace in the next five years This article makes a topdown forecast of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales under five economic scenarios Internet giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Inc NASDAQ AMZN was started by Jeff Bezos in his garage and went public in Under his leadership <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has grown its revenues from million to million The lifetime sales growth makes for a compound annual growth rate or CAGR of Impressive growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is one of the few companies that grew during both the tech bubble and the Great Recession of This article presents my sales expectations for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The goal is to estimate sales growth for fiscalyear and beyond under different economic scenarios The article presents a topdown approach for sales forecasting where the key indicator of sales growth will be the retail ecommerce industry After forecasting sales the article uses a forward PS ratio to gauge the potential price movement of the stock after the announcement of Q results Online retail sales are expected to continue growing worldwide Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is one of the global leaders in ecommerce it is reasonable to expect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales will continue growing According to data from Emarketer global ecommerce sales are expected to amount to trillion by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales were trillion or billion last year Based on these numbers there is substantial growth potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales According to these expectations the worldwide ecommerce retail sales is expected to grow at a CAGR of for the next five years The growth rate is key in this analysis because it represents the market growth rate See table below Source Statista data from Emarketer Why using global retail ecommerce sales as the key market growth rate Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to derive most of its business and revenue from the sale of inventory products and service revenues from third party sellers on its websites Despite the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services or AWS for short is a fastgrowing segment of the entire business it contributed just of revenue as of Q The rest of Amazons revenue came from products and services related to retail sales Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a global company Furthermore the retail ecommerce sales also takes into consideration intangible products that are delivered through the internet For example an intangible product delivered through the internet is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video Services For those reasons I find it reasonable to use the growth rate of global retail ecommerce sales as the key metric to determine Amazons growth rates in sales going forward A quick overview of Amazons historical sales As mentioned before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is one of the few companies that was able to grow sales during the global financial crisis of The following chart plots <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales from to years of data Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Annual Report Chart from Author There are two key aspects of Amazons historical sales that need to be highlighted First the growth that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has achieved over the past years is impressive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>grew at an average rate of and CAGR of Second the growth in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales have been decelerating since The steep decline in the growth line on the chart shows the deceleration in sales since However growth is still healthy Forecasting sales under five scenarios In my opinion forecasting under different scenarios is important because it gives the forecaster an opportunity to account for different possible outcomes In order to form an unbiased longterm outlook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales were forecasted under five different scenarios as follows Emphasized Bull Scenario Under the emphasized bull scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to dominate the global retail ecommerce market Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>services Prime and others will continue to be most preferred services for consumers Under this scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>growth is neither accelerating nor decelerating The year CAGR of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales is so sales will continue to grow at that rate for the next three years This growth is above the industry growth rate of which means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to increase market share Bull Case Scenario Under the bull scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to dominate in the global retail ecommerce <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>services will be widely accepted but competition will take a portion of the market The bull case makes the assumption that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to grow faster than worldwide ecommerce industry Since the industry growth rate is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would grow faster than that Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>grew rates by so this rate seems fair for a bull case Given the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales have been decelerating since the bull case scenario builds in a deceleration of per year Base Case Scenario Under the base case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to grow simply because it operates in high growth industry The base case does not assume extraordinary growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The base case makes the simple assumption that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will grow at the industry rate of per year Bear Case Scenario Under the bear case sales will continue to grow but competitors will take a larger portion of the market than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>In this case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will lose some market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales will continue to grow but the deceleration will be larger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>growth will decelerate by every year slowing to a YY growth by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will grow slower than the key ecommerce industry rate Emphasized Bear Scenario Under the emphasized bear scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will find itself in trouble to maintain its market share This could happen for a variety of reasons such as bad press or other unforeseen event <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will simply grow because of inflation and industry growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales will underperform ecommerce industry growth and will decelerate by ever year Furthermore Q sales will be flat from last year YY growth in will be just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will lose substantial market share to competitors Note Only Q was estimated for FY because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already reported three quarters of sales Using PS instead of pricetoearnings PE as a gauge of potential stock price reaction to sales results One of the most interesting behaviors of AMZN is how useless the popular PE ratio is From to the PE ratio has fluctuated from x to x yes I said two thousand The wide fluctuations in PE is simply because the market gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a very high stock price for its low EPS earnings per share In fiscalyear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>reported a loss of cents per share but the stock price was approximately after the announcement Because the PE ratio is highly volatile a better measure of relative valuation is the PS ratio At the current price of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>trades at a PS of x which happens to be the highest PS ratio in the past years See chart below Considering the fact that the year average PS of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is approximately x we can see that AMZN stock is priced for high expectations The table below shows the projected PS ratios based on the sales expectations above Under the most optimistic scenario the PS of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will approach the average at the end of fiscalyear It seems that the market is expecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to continue growing at much higher pace than the industry If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>maintained a PS ratio of x for the past years then it appears that the current PS is based on high expectations of sales Investor takeaways from the forecast and PS analysis There are a number of conclusions that can be made from the analysis and forecast of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will probably surpass billion in sales for the first time ever even under the most bearish scenario This is a huge milestone not only for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but for any business Despite the fact that the market already expects this milestone reaching billion in revenue speaks about the popularity of Amazons business Second the industry growth of retail ecommerce is expected to be high in the future Despite its current popularity ecommerce has more room to grow Third and more importantly it appears that the current price of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is already reflecting very high expectations of sales growth A forward PS of x for indicates that the market already sees a bright future in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>In other words the share prices might suffer if the most optimistic expectations are not achieved Whereas if the most optimistic expectations are simply met AMZN shares might not shoot upwards because that was already expected Fourth the law of averages suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>PS will revert back to its mean of x This reversion can happen either when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock price decreases or when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sales increase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>stock price is already building high expectations Therefore one way of reverting to average that does not include a downturn in the stock price is by reporting extremely good sales numbers Under the most optimistic case scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>PS will revert to mean at the end of which gets reported around January At this point all the good expectations of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>appear to be already built into the price Based on the sales number I see
