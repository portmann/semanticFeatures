( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Under the most bearish forecast , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is likely to report sales over $ 100 billion for FY 2015 ; a big milestone . The global retail e-commerce industry is expected to grow at a super-fast pace in the next five years.This article makes a top-down forecast of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales under five economic scenarios . Internet giant <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Inc. ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) was started by Jeff Bezos in his garage and went public in 1997 . Under his leadership , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has grown its revenues from $ 147 million to $ 88,990 million . The lifetime sales growth makes for a compound annual growth rate (or CAGR) of 45.7%.Impressive growth!<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is one of the few companies that grew during both the tech bubble and the Great Recession of 2008 . This article presents my sales expectations for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . The goal is to estimate sales growth for fiscal-year 2015 (and beyond) under different economic scenarios.The article presents a top-down approach for sales forecasting, where the key indicator of sales growth will be the retail e-commerce industry.After forecasting sales, the article uses a forward P/S ratio to gauge the potential price movement of the stock after the announcement of 4Q results.Online retail sales are expected to continue growing worldwide.Since <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is one of the global leaders in e-commerce , it is reasonable to expect that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales will continue growing . According to data from E-marketer , global e-commerce sales are expected to amount to $3 trillion by 2018.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales were $ 0.089 trillion ( or $ 89 billion ) last year . Based on these numbers , there is substantial growth potential for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales . According to these expectations, the worldwide e-commerce retail sales is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.6% for the next five years.The 17.6% growth rate is key in this analysis, because it represents the market growth rate.See table below.Source: Statista , data from E-marketer Why using global retail e-commerce sales as the key market growth rate?Because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to derive most of its business and revenue from the sale of inventory products and service revenues from third party sellers on its websites . Despite the fact that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( or AWS for short ) is a fast-growing segment of the entire business , it contributed just 8 % of revenue as of Q3 2015 . The rest of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenue came from products and services related to retail sales . Also , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a global company . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , the retail e-commerce sales also takes into consideration <b>intangible</b> products that are delivered through the internet .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , an <b>intangible</b> product delivered through the internet is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video Services . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>For those reasons , I find it reasonable to use the growth rate of global retail e-commerce sales as the key metric to determine <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth rates in sales going forward . A quick overview of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's historical sales As mentioned before , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is one of the few companies that was able to grow sales during the global financial crisis of 2008 . The following chart plots <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales from 2004 to 2014 ( 11 years of data ) . Source : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Annual Report , Chart from Author There are two key aspects of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's historical sales that need to be highlighted . First , the growth that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has achieved over the past 11 years is impressive . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> grew at an average rate of 30 % and CAGR of 27 % . Second , the growth in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales have been decelerating since 2011 . The steep decline in the growth line on the chart shows the deceleration in sales since 2011.However, growth is still healthy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Forecasting sales under five scenarios In my opinion , forecasting under different scenarios is important because it gives the forecaster an opportunity to account for different <b>possible</b> outcomes .  (Uncertainty) </span>In order to form an unbiased long-term outlook , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales were forecasted under five different scenarios as follows : 1 ) Emphasized Bull Scenario : Under the emphasized bull scenario , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to dominate the global retail e-commerce market . Furthermore , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> services ( Prime and others ) will continue to be most preferred services for consumers . Under this scenario , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> growth is neither accelerating nor decelerating . The 11-year CAGR of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales is 26.6 % , so sales will continue to grow at that rate for the next three years . This growth is above the industry growth rate of 17.6 % , which means that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to increase market share . 2 ) Bull Case Scenario : Under the bull scenario , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to dominate in the global retail e-commerce . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> services will be widely accepted , but competition will take a portion of the market . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The bull case makes the <b>assumption</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to grow <i>faster</i> than worldwide e-commerce industry . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Since the industry growth rate is 17.6 % , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would grow <i>faster</i> than that . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Last year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> grew rates by 19.5 % , so this rate <b>seems</b> fair for a bull case . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Given the fact that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales have been decelerating since 2011 , the bull case scenario builds in a deceleration of 0.5 % per year . 3 ) Base Case Scenario : Under the base case , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to grow simply because it operates in high growth industry . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The base case does not <b>assume</b> extraordinary growth for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The base case makes the simple <b>assumption</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will grow at the industry rate of 17.6 % per year . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>4 ) Bear Case Scenario : Under the bear case , sales will continue to grow but competitors will take a <i>larger</i> portion of the market than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In this case , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will lose some market share . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales will continue to grow but the deceleration will be <i>larger</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> growth will decelerate by 2 % every year , slowing to a 12 % Y/Y growth by 2018 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will grow <i>slower</i> than the key e-commerce industry rate . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>5 ) Emphasized Bear Scenario : Under the emphasized bear scenario , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will find itself in trouble to maintain its market share . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This could happen for a variety of reasons such as bad press or other <b>unforeseen</b> event .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will simply grow because of inflation and industry growth . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales will underperform e-commerce industry growth and will decelerate by 5 % ever year . Furthermore, Q4 sales will be flat from last year.Y/Y growth in 2018 will be just 2.6%.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will lose substantial market share to competitors . ( Note : Only Q4 2015 was estimated for FY 2015 because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already reported three quarters of sales ) Using P/S instead of price-to-earnings ( P/E ) as a gauge of potential stock price reaction to sales results One of the most interesting behaviors of AMZN is how useless the popular P/E ratio is . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From 2006 to 2015 , the P/E ratio has <b>fluctuated</b> from 2000x to -2000 x ( yes , I said two thousand ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The wide <b>fluctuations</b> in P/E is simply because the market gives <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> a very high stock price for its low EPS ( earnings per share ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fiscal-year 2014 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reported a loss of 52 cents per share , but the stock price was <b>approximately</b> $ 300 after the announcement . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Because the P/E ratio is highly <b>volatile</b> , a <i>better</i> measure of relative valuation is the P/S ratio .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>At the current price of $ 663 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> trades at a P/S of 3.1 x , which happens to be the highest P/S ratio in the past 5 years . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>See chart below : Considering the fact that the 5-year average P/S of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is <b>approximately</b> 2.1 x , we can see that AMZN stock is priced for high expectations . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The table below shows the projected P/S ratios based on the sales expectations above.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Under the most <b>optimistic</b> scenario , the P/S of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will approach the average at the end of fiscal-year 2016 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>seems</b> that the market is expecting <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to continue growing at much <i>higher</i> pace than the industry . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> maintained a P/S ratio of 2.1 x for the past 5 years , then it <b>appears</b> that the current P/S is based on high expectations of sales . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Investor takeaways from the forecast and P/S analysis There are a number of conclusions that can be made from the analysis and forecast of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will <b>probably</b> surpass $ 100 billion in sales for the first time ever , even under the most bearish scenario . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This is a huge milestone not only for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , but for any business . Despite the fact that the market already expects this milestone , reaching $ 100 billion in revenue speaks about the popularity of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business . Second, the industry growth of retail e-commerce is expected to be high in the future.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite its current popularity , e-commerce has <i>more</i> room to grow .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Third and <i>more</i> importantly , it <b>appears</b> that the current price of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is already reflecting very high expectations of sales growth . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>A forward P/S of 2.2 x for 2016 indicates that the market already sees a bright future in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words , the share prices might suffer if the most <b>optimistic</b> expectations are not achieved .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whereas if the most optimistic expectations are simply met , AMZN shares <b>might</b> not shoot upwards because that was already expected .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Fourth , the law of averages <b>suggests</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> P/S will revert back to its mean of 2.1 x . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>This reversion can happen either when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock price decreases or when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sales increase . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock price is already building high expectations . Therefore, one way of reverting to average, that does not include a downturn in the stock price, is by reporting extremely good sales numbers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Under the most <b>optimistic</b> case scenario , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> P/S will revert to mean at the end of 2016 ( which gets reported around January 2017 ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At this point , all the good expectations of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>appear</b> to be already built into the price . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Based on the sales number , I see <i>more</i> downside <b>risk</b> than upside potential in AMZN at a price of ~ $ 660 going into the next earnings release .
