If you bought, you have made easy money since.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix is up 71 % over the last year , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 61 % , Facebook 38 % and Google 38 % , despite the plunge <i>earlier</i> this year that clobbered the two highest fliers , Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>But everyone's glory days end.No "system" lasts forever.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And it <b>may</b> be time to retire some of FANG to the shelf and look elsewhere for profit .  (Uncertainty) </span>Right now I'm especially concerned about Netflix and Google.Netflix needs to increase its Average Revenue Per User (or ARPU), as its revenue growth has to slow if it tries to maintain the $8/month price point and rely on subscriber growth only.Google, as I've written elsewhere today, is starting to look tired, lazy, consumed by a mid-life crisis with "moonshots" that are sputtering on their launchpads, the continuing failures at Google Plus, the unwillingness of YouTube to go beyond its ad-supported, short-video model, and laziness at sites like Google Finance, which is being crushed by (of all people) Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ).Other people can tell you why not to continue with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . I remain bullish on the company.And while I still don't own any Facebook (because I hardly ever use it) this is the most-respected member of the group at the present time, gauging from analyst chatter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) is starting to look <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I never understood it having an IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) Price/Earnings multiple , and it <b>seems</b> to be turning up the dial from 11 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Many have underestimated the value of its service revenue, I suspect they're underestimating the Apple Watch, and face it the numbers remain huge.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even if growth slows , even if it backs up for a quarter or two , it 's still worth <i>more</i> than its present price , if only for the cash .  (Surprise) </span>I 've written before about Equinix ( NASDAQ : EQIX ) , the best cloud stock not named <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . This is the best way I know of to play the hybrid cloud market, because Equinix is an important "arms merchant" here, providing and maintaining fast connections between private and public clouds.Disney (NYSE: DIS ) also looks woefully undervalued here.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Do you know it 's down <b>nearly</b> 7 % for the year , despite the success of `` Star Wars , '' and despite the fact that its Shanghai theme park is n't in the numbers yet ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>No company knows <i>better</i> how to profit from popular content than the `` mouse house . ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I suspect the <b>worries</b> about ESPN and its ABC network are overdone .  (Uncertainty) </span>There is over $4 billion in cash and the company knows how to do acquisitions.(Despite ending its distribution deal with the company, I'd put Dreamworks in the frame.)So Disney, Equinix, Apple, Facebook?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> I 'm just DEAF .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But in a market <i>more</i> concerned with safety than absolute growth that sounds like a good acronym to play .  (Surprise) </span>Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, DIS.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Quick Picks & Lists</div></body></html>
