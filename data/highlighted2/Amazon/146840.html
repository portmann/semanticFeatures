(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If you haven't been invested in the right sector or had a decent amount of your portfolio in just a few high growth stocks, it is unlikely that your portfolio has kept up with the S&P 500.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Nothing illustrates this <i>more</i> than the acronym FANG , which stands for the darlings of 2015 : Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As a whole , these stocks have accounted for <i>more</i> than 75 % of the S&P 500 's returns year-to-date .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is up 68 % so far this year . Facebook and Google are both up by 21%.Netflix is up a staggering 153%.These four stocks comprise just 3.5% of the S&P 500, yet have contributed 75% of its performance.Together, they have driven the S&P 500's total return up by 1.6%.The S&P 500 is up by just 2.1% so far this year.If you own individual stocks and you don't own these four companies, your portfolio is going to have a very hard time getting close to the market's performance.The question that must be asked is this: If just four stocks in the S&P 500 have been doing so well, why not own these four stocks?Why not buy shares in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Facebook , Google , and Netflix ? <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>An investor who puts money into a stock that does n't pay a dividend can only profit in one way : If someone else is willing to pay them <i>more</i> for their shares in the future .  (Surprise) </span>We invest in companies for which their market price growth closely follows dividend growth.A company that pays a dividend has shown that it can create cash from its business operations and is willing to share that cash with shareholders.A company that doesn't pay a dividend either (1) doesn't make money consistently enough to afford to pay a dividend (2) is growing rapidly or (3) is not shareholder-friendly.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Without a dividend , a company 's stock price is based far <i>more</i> on <b>speculation</b> about future earnings .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 've seen over time that earnings can be <b>volatile</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In 2008-09 , earnings for the companies in the S&P 500 plunged by <i>more</i> than 50 % with price going right along with it .  (Surprise) </span>They all trade for extremely high multiples.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The price-to-earnings ( P/E ) ratio is a quick way to see how <b>optimistic</b> other investors are about a stock 's future .  (Uncertainty) </span>It tells us how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of that company's earnings.The current P/E for the S&P 500 is right around 18.That means the average stock delivers $1 in earnings for every $18 the investor pays to own it.That represents an annual return on investment of 5.6% ($1 divided by $18).All four of these stocks are trading at extreme premiums to the rest of the market.Facebook's P/E is currently just under 100.Netflix trades for a staggering 277 times earnings.And <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't even have a P/E because it does n't have positive earnings over the past 12 months . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Google <b>appears</b> to be the `` value '' of the group trading at a price-to-earnings ( P/E ) ratio of 33 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The <i>higher</i> a P/E investors pay , the <i>more</i> <b>hope</b> they are putting in the future .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If the next few years don't pan out like investors currently expect, a company trading at a sky high P/E can see its stock price fall dramatically.Buying these stocks means signing up for a return on investment of: $1 divided by negative profits = ?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>( AMZN ) If these companies do n't have dramatically <i>higher</i> earnings in the future than they have today , their returns will be unattractive , to say the least .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The only way you can profit from these shares is if you can find someone to pay even <i>more</i> at some point in the future .  (Surprise) </span>Who knows what these stocks are worth?Are these P/E ratios too high?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They <b>might</b> also be too low .  (Uncertainty) </span>No one has any idea what Facebook , Netflix , Google , or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be worth 10 years from now . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's quite <b>possible</b> that one or <i>more</i> of these companies will be trading far <i>higher</i> than they are today .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's also quite <b>possible</b> that at least half of these companies will have been replaced by the latest and greatest technology of the day .  (Uncertainty) </span>What's clear is that earnings are not the major factor underlying the current market price per share.Instead, it's what each investor is willing to imagine about the company's future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Trying to predict the future of these companies is <b>nearly</b> impossible .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Predicting</b> what people will pay for them is even <i>more</i> impossible .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> most investors would be <i>better</i> off not to try , especially not with money they need to live on in retirement .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Conclusion: Wall Street is obsessed with trying to find the next "home run."Who is the next Netflix or Facebook?Who is going to triple in price over the next few years?Betting on these types of stocks is not much different than going out to the casino and plopping down money on the roulette wheel.Your payout is big when you win, but the odds are against you over the long term.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We find it much <i>easier</i> to hit `` singles and doubles '' investing in high-quality dividend growth stocks .  (Surprise) </span>Our multiple regression tool helps us identify stocks that are 10% to 25% undervalued.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We know these companies are n't going to blow the doors off of the market , but we do know this : The price of nearly every company in our portfolio is highly <b>predictable</b> based upon its future dividend payments .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For virtually all of the companies we invest in , the dividend has <b>predicted</b> 80 % -90 % of the movement of its stock price over a multi-year period .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That gives us <b>confidence</b> that our portfolios will continue to grow in value over the long term .
