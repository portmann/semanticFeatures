Remember when The New York Times published that raw dog takedown of working conditions at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>It led to a flash firestorm of criticism for the omnipresent online retailer and there were some ripples of conversation about the larger problem of how we work now You might have even had conversations during Labor Day weekend with your hippier friends about how morally repugnant it is to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>since they treat their workers with such misogynisthumanist distain But that was back in August Weve had so much Trump since then and playoff baseball Even your bohemian buddy from Labor Day is back to getting his weekly bulk Kombucha deliveries made to his Bushwick loft commune via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Weve pretty much forgivenforgotten <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>so apparently its high time that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>remind us about that whole affair Former White House Press Secretary and currentSenior VP of Corporate Affairs at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Jay Carney published a post on Medium this morning that should have been titled Choke On My Balls Sulzberger but was scaled back to be What The New York Times Didnt Tell You The post alleges that the reporters on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>piece provided an inaccurately narrow view of the conditions at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and failed to disclose that at least one of the former employees quoted in the piece was likely disgruntled after being fired for fraudulent behavior Heres the real zinger from Carneys retort In any story there are matters of opinion and there are issues of fact And context is critical Journalism instructs that facts should be checked and sources should be vetted When there are two sides of a story a reader deserves to know them both Why did the Times choose not to follow standard practice here We dont know But its worth noting that theyve now twice in less than a year been called out by their own public editor for bias and hype in their coverage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Last fall the public editor wrote a critique of the papers coverage of Amazons negotiations with Hachette titled Publishing Battle Should Be Covered Not Joined And in the wake of the story on Amazons culture she wrote The article was driven less by irrefutable proof than by generalization and anecdote For such a damning result presented with so much drama that doesnt seem like quite enough What we do know is had the reporters checked their facts the story they published would have been a lot less sensational a lot more balanced and lets be honest a lot more boring It might not have merited the front page but it would have been closer to the truth Its a scathing little post and worth a read but it comes at a strange time Why would <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>even want to talk about this again Carney probably has some internal egg on his face for letting the piece be so scathing so soon after his arrival butits hard to imagine a big bank wanting to so publicly reopen a story like this even if it felt rightly wronged The need for good guy validation is such an overwhelming force in the tech community thatcompetitiondestroying juggernauts like Uber and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>refuse to put on the black hats proudly worn by most flintyeyed capitalistmoney machines And now it seems that theyre choosing instead to issue butthurt responses on social journalism blog platforms Can you imagine what it would be like if Brian Moynihan went on his blog every time he and BofA got rapped on the knuckles by a news organization Sure it would be pretty awesome but also very dumb Yet Uber CEO Travis Kalanick goes into fits whenever his plan to replace drivers with robots is reported on in a way that mentions it will put human drivers out of work Considering that the automation plan will boost Ubers profits and that Kalanick is a businessman not the Pope it makes little sense to continue with the public charade that everything your private sector corporation does is for the greater good of humanity So maybe just let it go next time tech oligarchs The public has a short memory for this stuff Or if you do feel the need to issue a blistering response cant we do better than Medium I mean doesnt anyone at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>know anyone at a big paper like The Washington Post Or maybe just a news site like Business Insider
