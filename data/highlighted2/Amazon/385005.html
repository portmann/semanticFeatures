(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft's strategy will win over enterprises not willing to move everything to a public cloud.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But the long-term payoff for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's strategy <b>appears</b> <i>bigger</i> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Intel beats EPS estimates, offers light guidance, announces job cuts and CFO change, plans to exit some products - Quite the set of Tuesday afternoon announcements from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>After stating it plans to cut up to 12K jobs ( confirms a recent media report , but is still <i>more</i> than expected ) , the company said on its earnings call it 's looking to exit certain product lines .  (Surprise) </span>President Murthy Renduchintala, hired only last fall and reportedly the author of a memo criticizing Intel's execution and calling for changes in its R&D approach, will give CEO Brian Krzanich a proposal on which products to keep and which to divest.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are many <b>possibilities</b> here .  (Uncertainty) </span>Meanwhile, Intel strongly hints many of its job cuts will hit the Client Computing Group (PC/mobile CPUs) as it contends with weak PC sales and tries to further cut mobile losses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And the company 's decision to move CFO Stacy Smith to a new role covering manufacturing , sales , and operations is fueling <b>speculation</b> Smith is in line to succeed Brian Krzanich as CEO .  (Uncertainty) </span>Intel's actual earnings release was a mixed bag.Q1 EPS topped estimates with the help of gross margin strength and a low tax rate, and rising PC CPU ASPs helped offset soft PC demand.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition , with desktop and notebook CPUs volumes down just 4 % and 2 % Y/Y respectively ( Gartner/IDC estimate PC sales were down <i>more</i> sharply ) , it looks like Intel grabbed <i>more</i> share from AMD Inc. ( NASDAQ : AMD ) , even after accounting for an extra week .  (Surprise) </span>IoT Group (embedded CPU) and security sales were also strong points, rising 22% and 12%, respectively.On the other hand, Q2 guidance was below consensus and full-year guidance slightly cut.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition , Data Center Group ( DCG - server CPU division ) sales rose only 9 % Y/Y , once <i>more</i> missing Intel 's 15 % 2014-2018 CAGR target .  (Surprise) </span>On the call, Intel noted cloud and telecom DCG strength was offset by enterprise softness (partly the result of cloud adoption hurting traditional IT spend).The company expects to see "double-digit" 2016 DCG growth.Also: Intel's flash memory ops (broken out for the first time) saw a 6% revenue decline and recorded a $95M op.loss; industry price pressure is blamed.VMware jumps on Q1 beat, strong Q2 guidance, $1.2B buyback - Much like IBM, VMware (NYSE: VMW ) is trying to offset declines in traditional businesses vulnerable to cloud adoption by investing in several growth areas.Unlike IBM , the market is giving a thumbs-up to the company's latest update on its turnaround efforts.The server virtualization giant beat Q1 estimates and provided strong Q2 guidance on its earnings slides : Revenue of $1.66B-1.71B (+4%-7% Y/Y) and EPS of $0.94-0.97, versus a consensus of $1.66B and $0.94.Full-year guidance is in line.The company's Compute (server virtualization) license bookings, hurt by cloud adoption, container adoption , and competition, remain weak, dropping 10% Y/Y in Q1.And management software license bookings grew at a modest mid-single digit clip.But end-user computing (PC virtualization/enterprise mobility) license bookings grew at a mid-teens clip, NSX (networking virtualization) grew over 100%, and VSAN (storage virtualization) over 200%.NSX, which is shaping up to be a thorn in Cisco's (NASDAQ: CSCO ) side, now has over 1,400 paid customers, up ~200 Q/Q.Yahoo comments on strategic review, releases earnings along the way - "[W]e made substantial progress towards potential strategic alternatives for Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO )," Marissa Mayer is quoted as saying in the Q1 report.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Those comments , along with earnings call remarks about not providing further updates about the review , have given some encouragement to those <b>hoping</b> a sale is close .  (Uncertainty) </span>Shares rose moderately after-hours.As for Yahoo's business, it still looks fairly weak.Q1 results managed to slightly beat consensus, but revenue (excluding traffic acquisition costs) was down 18% Y/Y to $859M, with search revenue dropping 21% (search click-driven revenue fell 15%) and display ad revenue 1%."Other revenue" fell 39%, thanks to the loss of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA )-related fees last September.And Q2 guidance is light.WSJ: Yahoo bidders include Verizon, Daily Mail, and TPG - Also reportedly bidding: an investor group featuring Bain Capital, Vista Equity, and former interim CEO Ross Levinsohn (ultimately passed over for the top job in favor of Marissa Mayer).Bids are said to be in the $4B-8B range.Meanwhile, Reuters reports P-E firms Apax Partners, Apollo Global, and Warburg Pincus also submitted first-round bids.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Yahoo <b>might</b> ultimately be <i>more</i> valuable to Verizon ( NYSE : VZ ) than a P-E suitor , given its strategic interest in creating an online media empire and the potential to drive <i>deeper</i> cost cuts by eliminating functions duplicated by Yahoo and Verizon-owned AOL .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple refreshes 12 '' retina MacBooks with <i>faster</i> processors/storage , rose gold option - A fairly standard Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) notebook refresh , save for the addition of a new color option .  (Surprise) </span>The CPUs are now based on Intel's Skylake architecture rather than the prior-gen Broadwell, and an extra hour of battery life is delivered.When it launched last year, the 12" MacBook (starts at $1,299) got high marks for its ultra-thin-and-light build, long battery life, high-quality display, and Force Touch trackpad.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Much of the criticism revolved around its use of just a single USB Type-C port for both charging and data , and its reliance on <i>less</i> powerful Intel Core M CPUs rather than the Core i5/i7 CPUs found in MacBook Pro models and many rival high-end laptops .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Those needing to run <i>more</i> demanding applications will likely stick with the Pro ( starts at $ 1,099 , but is thicker/heavier ) , while those obsessed with portability ( and OK with having just one port ) will opt for the 12 '' MacBook .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given its history , Apple might refresh the MacBook Pro , and <b>perhaps</b> also the MacBook Air , at its June 13-17 WWDC conference .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple hires former Tesla engineering VP, reportedly has German car team - Until recently, Chris Porritt was Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA ) VP of Vehicle Engineering.He reportedly worked on the EV maker's S, X, and 3 cars, and before that, was a senior engineer for Land Rover and Aston Martin.Now, he's ( per Electrek ) Apple's "Special Projects Group PD Administrator," a job title that fits with Apple's secrecy regarding its much-rumored car efforts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There 's naturally <b>speculation</b> Porritt will be the new leader for the company 's car project , given the recent departure of project head/Ford vet Steve Zadesky .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In January , AppleInsider reported Apple had implemented a hiring freeze for its car project amid <b>disappointment</b> with its progress .  (Surprise) </span>The company reportedly wants to bring an EV to market by 2019 - an aggressive timetable, given the manufacturing and R&D work involved and the fact that this will be Apple's first car.Meanwhile, a German publication reports Apple has created a small German R&D arm for its car project.It adds local auto parts maker Magna will help build the car.Report: Sony's upgraded PS4 will feature improved CPU, GPU, and RAM - Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) revamped PS4, rumored to be in the works for several weeks, will reportedly contain a CPU sporting 8 AMD CPU cores running at 2.1GHz (up from a prior 1.6GHz.), and an AMD GPU sporting 36 compute units (up from 18).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That should spell a <i>higher</i> CPU/GPU selling price for AMD .  (Surprise) </span>As previously reported, the new PS4 will support 4K gaming (the current PS4 only goes up to 1080p).However, Sony wants to make sure any new games run on both old and new PS4 hardware.Existing games can take advantage of the new hardware if software updates are released.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Lexmark selling to Chinese group for $ 3.6 B - <b>Assuming</b> U.S. regulators approve , of course .
