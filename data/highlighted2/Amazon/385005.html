Murthy Renduchintala hired only last fall and reportedly the author of a memo criticizing Intels execution and calling for changes in its RD approach will give CEO Brian Krzanich a proposal on which products to keep and which to divest There are many possibilities here Meanwhile Intel strongly hints many of its job cuts will hit the Client Computing Group PCmobile CPUs as it contends with weak PC
