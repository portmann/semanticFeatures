It's geared toward high-income customers of the MacBook Pro.The $2,699 Surface Book has a touchscreen-friendly and detachable PixelSense 13.5-inch display that no MacBook Pro can match right now.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There also are dozens of new all-in-one touch-enabled desktop PCs that are <i>cheaper</i> than the iMac .  (Surprise) </span>The $2,700 HP Z1 G2 all-in-one is as powerful as any Apple iMac Retina available now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unless Apple surrenders to the current trend toward touchscreen-equipped computers , I <b>fear</b> that the Mac 's current popularity will eventually wane .  (Uncertainty) </span>I understand that Apple wants to maximize monetization of die-hard Mac users by not giving them a touch-enabled computer.They will be forced to buy an iPad or an iPad Pro as a companion tool for their expensive MacBook Pros and Mac Pro computers if they want touchscreen productivity.However, Microsoft and its partner OEMs are now shifting toward an all-touchscreen PC product line-up.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>could</b> eventually persuade even the most ardent Mac-using graphic artist to defect .  (Uncertainty) </span>As long as Tim Cook does not allow a touchscreen-friendly Mac computer design, Apple's PC business is in danger of repeating the same downward spiral of iPad sales.The cult-like following of the Mac is what is helping it gain traction now.However, this is not going to last forever.Microsoft has the advertising budget to aggressively promote its Surface Book and Surface Pro as superior alternatives to outdated Mac laptops that still rely on mouse and keyboard operations.Smart consumers will obviously see the great savings in buying just the 2-in-1 Surface Pro instead of buying the MacBook Air and the iPad Pro.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Mac computers running a Yosemite 10.10 or <i>newer</i> OS should be able to go full touchscreen-friendly .  (Surprise) </span>It is only Apple's love for its lucrative product differentiation that is holding back touch-enabled Mac computers.Enterprising Americans are now exploiting this by modifying MacBooks to function like Mac OS X tablets.ModBook buys Macbooks and then modifies them to work with a touchscreen display.Their clients are mostly creative professionals like me.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> Apple is missing a great opportunity to really dominate the PC market by refusing to equip its Mac computers with a touchscreen display .  (Uncertainty) </span>Consequently, I will not endorse a buy for AAPL.Tim Cook should not ignore the threat posed by touchscreen-friendly Windows 10 desktop computers and laptops.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>hope</b> that he will eventually change his mind like he did last year when he finally released phablet-sized iPhones last year .  (Uncertainty) </span>The product differentiation needed to sell a non-touchscreen Macbook to force loyal Apple users to also get the iPad is not tenable in the long run.Imitating the large-screen phablets of Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) definitely helped the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to break record sales.In the future, when MacBook sales go stagnant, Apple will have no choice but to also imitate the 2-in-1 form factor and touchscreen usability of the Surface Book/Surface Pro 4.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Editor 's Note : This article discusses one or <i>more</i> securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange .
