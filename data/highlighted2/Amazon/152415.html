According to Abuza an average of bombings and shootings a month have been recorded in the region over the past five years Those fighting the Thai state include a raft of separatist organizations as well as presumably smaller cells and individual insurgents They are up against some security forces in the three border provinces But the diverse and extremely decentralized nature of the insurgency

this httpwwwnewrepubliccomarticlecornwars One wonders what outcomes we or at least those of us whose vote and leverage actually count want cf Need from our political economy Reports of massacres of civilians in rebelheld areas by the Syrian regime should be interpreted critically A preliminary investigation of the Douma market attack on August has shown that of the fatalities were recorded as adult males and at least of these were buried in mass graves As in previous massacres attributed to the regime the segregation of victims by sex and their burial in mass graves unclaimed by their families are consistent with a massacre of rebelheld captives Regarding Carly Fiorina I havent read the article but as an electronics engineer I did watch with dismay as she ran that formerly great company into the ground by starving RD and spinning the heart and soul of it off into Agilent She bought into every silly new management philosophy that came along while joining the race to the bottom with shtty consumergrade computing equipment and peripherals It was very sad What Blow reminds me of is there are a limited number of actual Black voices in the press and on opinion pages so Whites who are not exposed to these issues would have a limited idea of race For example would ending police brutality end racism related deaths The answer is no The health care or lack of treatment of Blacks due to views of race likely leads to allow of premature death So I as a Black guy am subject to people like Blow who frankly I question whether they are serving the interest of all Black people or just Middle Class Bkack People Police brutality is a real concern However if you are poor and Black it is not your only concern It must be nice to have the luxury of focusing ones attention on just brutality or just voting rights rather the far ranging issues Black actually have to address The NY Times ran a study about the following httpmobilenytimescombusinessracialwealthgappersistsdespitedegreestudysayshtmlreferrer My point is that we have the wrong people trying to engage folks like Sanders in the press If their agenda isnt to get Clinton elected some arent and those that are should just be ignored as opportunist they seem to lack an appreciation of the challenges of race beyond bumper sticker slogans Being Black does not mean one understands how race related to class Todays Tech is also like yesterdays tech check out The Soul of a New Machine and tell me what has changed so much Frederick Christ Trump grandfather of Donald Trump was also a true American entrepreneur Immigrating to America in he began his fortune running the Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in Bennett British Columbia during the Klondike Gold Rush Christine who would later become his wife was only when he left Germany but they kept in touch by mail and eventually married httpgenealogyaboutcomodfamous_family_treesptrumphtm America was a land of machines and it was through machines the miraculous handmaidens of mob culture that the muses of illiteracy brought America her voice and vision during the years of the immigrants waves Centuries ago movable type had given literacy to the common man Now through these wondrous newer machines he would give it back Nick Tosches certainly i have my questions about the bacon lettuce and mayonnaise sandwich movement but many organizations origins and motives can be questioned when i spoke with paul robesons son and his former personal secretary about why paul the supposed communist could care less about fidel and chethey both said many used the communists because of the dirt cheap printing they would provideand that batista was removed by a white fidel who campaigned that batista was not quite white enough to lead cuba when in chicago i poked around looking at the panther assassinations and ended up with a dirty cop who may have been a partner of one of the cointelpro cops at the event who put his gun to my head in front of a crowd as he tried to pin me to a wallhis wife pulled him off of mebut I still can question the origins of the movementas any adult would considering who put out the original publicity and film footagebut the panthers took on a life of their ownregardless of the side show of its origins all this analysis paralysisand eloquent ignorance whatever their motives the bacon lettuce and mayonnaise sandwich movement has found a way to use modern tools to get peoples attention I can question many public radicals ramsey clarke signed off on cointelpro so it is funny watching him over the years claim to be this antithem guyespecially when he was at that drowning of a civil rights fighter while they were on vacation who cares if they ate johnnys peanut butter and jelly sandwich in kindergarten while sarah palin watched out for the hall monitors Amortization of control fraud by liquidation of human beings rinse and repeat and you have the classical business cycle Some food for thought with a reference to Krugman as he is still beholden to the ISLM To put it in the simplest possible terms Krugman et al still talk with occasional lapses into the realm of truth as though the government has to finance its deficits by borrowing from the public out of a fixed supply of loanable funds Thus theyre still vulnerable to the crowding out argument If the government borrows out of the supply of loanable funds it deprives private investors of those funds thus crowding out their investment The only reply one can give is that the government makes better investments than private investors Does it The Right are perfectly justified in questioning this assumption and by casting doubt on it they can make the case for expansionary austerity Krugman et al place the argument about austerity into a domain where it depends on intuitionswapping about the efficacy of state vs private investment Thats a good place for the antiausterity side to lose the argument Better to stay within the domain of reality There expansionary austerity makes no sense because crowding out is impossible speaking in terms of available money rather than available resources

sound like they wouldnt have a problem working in a well run concentration camp There is one point of nomenclature that I think could be cleared up and that is the use of the C label which in itself does not indicate any particular danger Octanoic acid which has carbon atoms occurs naturally It is a fatty acid found many places notably goats milk and coconuts In other words this is mothers milk and nothing to do with Dupont or any other chemical company except as they may use it to make other things What brings me to this is that I have been using a garden fungicide consisting of copper octanoate It is widely and openly available and in fact is just a form of soap So far I am not worried about it Yet What might be of concern is that the octanoic acid that is used to make copper soap is almost certainly synthesized as I dont think anyone is bothering to collect it from coconuts If this is a benign process and it probably is there should be no worry On the other hand should this involve the use of some vile catalyst or such a thing then we all have to worry S Haust on Links Re The Case Against DuPont There is one EoinW on On Syriza as a Party Tragic Flaws or Tragic Errors Two
