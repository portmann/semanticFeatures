(NASDAQ:SWKS) | Seeking Alpha Inventory buildup has raised eyebrows.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Skyworks Solutions Inc. ( NASDAQ : SWKS ) reported earnings last Thursday , July 21 , 2016 , and the market reaction was <i>less</i> than enthusiastic , sending the stock down about 9 % on the following Friday .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This drop came after a <b>horrid</b> year where the stock has dropped from a high of $ 112.88 last summer down to $ 64.94 ( 42 % down ) a share where it finished up the following Monday .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>After such a tumble of a former high flying stock , I think it might be worth considering dipping your toe into Skyworks as Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) concerns seem fully priced in , the inventory buildup that have analysts in a tizzy seems much ado about nothing , and Skyworks <b>amazing</b> fundamentals could mean a 50 % upside to the stock ( $ 100 price target ) as <b>worries</b> and concerns fizzle away in the back half of the year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Skyworks gets a lot of its revenue from being an Apple supplier.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most analysis I have seen places the revenue estimate around 40 % -45 % , though being an Apple supplier means pretty much all information is secretive and hush hush if you have any <b>hopes</b> of continuing to do business with the company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The first rule of Apple Club is you do n't talk about Apple Club , you <b>could</b> say .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This revenue dependence means that Skyworks tends to trade along the lines of Apple though it seems to experience <i>higher</i> highs and <i>lower</i> lows ( <b>volatility</b> ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Here is a chart of the past year of Skyworks in black and Apple in yellow.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When things are going well Skyworks tends to trade alongside or above Apple 's line and when things are going badly ( like most of the past year ) Skyworks tends to trade under the Apple line giving Skyworks a <i>higher</i> Beta .  (Surprise) </span>This means that if you think that Apple is going to have a good second half of the year, betting on Skyworks would most likely give you an outsized gain compared to however much Apple appreciates in value.Now, the concerns about Apple and primarily its upcoming iPhone 7 release are real and justified.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The latest downgrade comes from BGC Partners ( article ) who lowered its price target from $ 110 to $ 85 on July 25 , 2016 amid concerns such as a <i>slower</i> 6s upgrade cycle , minimal revenue diversification , declining iPad revenues , and the big kahuna of low demand expectations for the upcoming iPhone 7 scheduled to launch on September 16 , 2016 ( shiver ) .  (Surprise) </span>These are some of the main reasons that Apple stock is down from a high of $134.54 last year to close today at $97.34.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , with all these negatives known and baked into the stock over the last year , <b>maybe</b> , just <b>maybe</b> , there is a potential upside run coming for Apple and , by proxy , Skyworks if the world does n't end after the iPhone 7 is released .  (Uncertainty) </span>What happens if Apple's earnings aren't as bad as everyone thinks tomorrow morning the 26th of July.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Most of all , what happens if , when the iPhone 7 launches , it is a <i>bigger</i> hit than all the lowball expectations think it will be ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I have grown to love watching the lineup at stores the day of a new iPhone launch and expect plenty of lines and excitement to build around this launch when the date closes in.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Finally , what <b>might</b> signal that the upcoming iPhone launch is potentially <i>more</i> successful than most people think ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>How about a prelaunch inventory build-up at a key supplier like... hmm..Skyworks?Skyworks recently reported Q3, 2016 results and held a very interesting earnings call where most of the analysts were mainly concerned with an inventory buildup from the past 9 months as inventory went from $267.9 million 9 months ago to $437.6 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The drop in the stock price <b>suggests</b> the market attributes this inventory buildup to supply chain issues ( article ) related to the upcoming iPhone 7 launch .  (Uncertainty) </span>I, however, would argue that the buildup is actually a good thing based on management's comments during their earnings call explaining the buildup and the fact that inventory should gradually return to normal over the back half of the year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` Our new program ramps ... we expect fourth quarter revenue to be up 10 % -11 % sequentially '' `` The double-digit revenue growth we expect in Q4 ... will reduce inventory '' `` We have level loaded our factories ... to address a series of new filter-rich program ramps '' Then in the Q and A section management answered a host of questions concerning inventory in <i>greater</i> detail .  (Surprise) </span>Some of the main answers to these inventory questions were that inventory buildup was mainly filter driven with known second half ramp-ups and a clear demand curve (sounds good to me).There was a one time stocking bump in inventory for a new hub arrangement in Asia with a large customer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Finally , the CFO stated that <b>almost</b> all of the additional inventory build in the quarter was in raw materials and work in progress and very little of the buildup was in finished inventory .  (Uncertainty) </span>Based on management's comments and catalysts like the upcoming iPhone 7 release I think it is perfectly reasonable that the company is prudently preparing for a potential demand based stellar back half of the year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whether or not you buy the inventory theories and explanations heading into the end of the year from Skyworks , I <b>believe</b> the fundamentals of the company make it a long term buy whether or not the iPhone 7 flops like analysts expect or exceeds all the low ball expectations .  (Uncertainty) </span>Some of the facts that make Skyworks a great long term buy include the following: Skyworks has no long term debt.This gives the company great downside protection and the ability to go after M&A opportunities should they arise, or boost dividend and stock buybacks at will.Quarterly dividend increased 7.7% to a forward yield of 1.58%.Skyworks also initiated a new $400 million share repurchase program.Dividend increases and stock buybacks look to be a regular occurrence going forward as long as M&A opportunities remain on the sidelines.Skyworks has been successfully diversifying its revenue streams.It has design wins with top companies such as Apple , Huawei , Samsung , Motorola ( NYSE : MSI ) , Oppo , Vivo , ZTE , and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) , along with internet of things engagements with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , ARRIS ( NASDAQ : ARRS ) , Cisco ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) , Fitbit ( NYSE : FIT ) , GE ( NYSE : GE ) , Google Nest , Honeywell ( NYSE : HON ) , Itron ( NASDAQ : ITRI ) , and LG , along with automotive presences with auto companies like Ford ( NYSE : F ) , Continental , Audi , Kia , GM ( NYSE : GM ) , and Volkswagen ( OTCPK : VLKAY ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The market has priced in over the last year a horrible Apple iPhone 7 launch which very well <b>might</b> be unwarranted .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The market might have overreacted to Skyworks ' growth in inventory over the past 9 months based on management 's commentary , which <b>seems</b> reasonable , and will be played out over the back part of the year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Finally , the rock star fundamentals of this growth company give it a realistic 50 % upside over the next year as concerns disappear over the back half of the year as Apple releases its iPhone 7 and inventory returns to a <i>more</i> normal level over Q4 and next year 's Q1 .  (Surprise) </span>I am long both Skyworks and Apple for the long haul.Disclosure: I am/we are long SWKS, AAPL.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Semiconductor - Integrated Circuits</div></body></html>
