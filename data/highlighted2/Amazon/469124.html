Skyworks Solutions Inc NASDAQ SWKS reported earnings last Thursday July and the market reaction was less than enthusiastic sending the stock down about on the following Friday This drop came after a horrid year where the stock has dropped from a high of last summer down to down a share where it finished up the following Monday After such a tumble of a former high flying stock I think it might be worth considering dipping your toe into Skyworks as Apple NASDAQ AAPL concerns seem fully priced in the inventory buildup that have analysts in a tizzy seems much ado about nothing and Skyworks amazing fundamentals could mean a upside to the stock price target as worries and concerns fizzle away in the back half of the year Skyworks gets a lot of its revenue from being an Apple supplier Most analysis I have seen places the revenue estimate around though being an Apple supplier means pretty much all information is secretive and hush hush if you have any hopes of continuing to do business with the company The first rule of Apple Club is you dont talk about Apple Club you could say This revenue dependence means that Skyworks tends to trade along the lines of Apple though it seems to experience higher highs and lower lows volatility Here is a chart of the past year of Skyworks in black and Apple in yellow When things are going well Skyworks tends to trade alongside or above Apples line and when things are going badly like most of the past year Skyworks tends to trade under the Apple line giving Skyworks a higher Beta This means that if you think that Apple is going to have a good second half of the year betting on Skyworks would most likely give you an outsized gain compared to however much Apple appreciates in value Now the concerns about Apple and primarily its upcoming iPhone release are real and justified The latest downgrade comes from BGC Partners article who lowered its price target from to on July amid concerns such as a slower s upgrade cycle minimal revenue diversification declining iPad revenues and the big kahuna of low demand expectations for the upcoming iPhone scheduled to launch on September shiver These are some of the main reasons that Apple stock is down from a high of last year to close today at However with all these negatives known and baked into the stock over the last year maybe just maybe there is a potential upside run coming for Apple and by proxy Skyworks if the world doesnt end after the iPhone is released What happens if Apples earnings arent as bad as everyone thinks tomorrow morning the th of July Most of all what happens if when the iPhone launches it is a bigger hit than all the lowball expectations think it will be I have grown to love watching the lineup at stores the day of a new iPhone launch and expect plenty of lines and excitement to build around this launch when the date closes in Finally what might signal that the upcoming iPhone launch is potentially more successful than most people think How about a prelaunch inventory buildup at a key supplier like hmm Skyworks Skyworks recently reported Q results and held a very interesting earnings call where most of the analysts were mainly concerned with an inventory buildup from the past months as inventory went from million months ago to million The drop in the stock price suggests the market attributes this inventory buildup to supply chain issues article related to the upcoming iPhone launch I however would argue that the buildup is actually a good thing based on managements comments during their earnings call explaining the buildup and the fact that inventory should gradually return to normal over the back half of the year Our new program rampswe expect fourth quarter revenue to be up sequentially The doubledigit revenue growth we expect in Q will reduce inventory We have level loaded our factories to address a series of new filterrich program ramps Then in the Q and A section management answered a host of questions concerning inventory in greater detail Some of the main answers to these inventory questions were that inventory buildup was mainly filter driven with known second half rampups and a clear demand curve sounds good to me There was a one time stocking bump in inventory for a new hub arrangement in Asia with a large customer Finally the CFO stated that almost all of the additional inventory build in the quarter was in raw materials and work in progress and very little of the buildup was in finished inventory Based on managements comments and catalysts like the upcoming iPhone release I think it is perfectly reasonable that the company is prudently preparing for a potential demand based stellar back half of the year Whether or not you buy the inventory theories and explanations heading into the end of the year from Skyworks I believe the fundamentals of the company make it a long term buy whether or not the iPhone flops like analysts expect or exceeds all the low ball expectations Some of the facts that make Skyworks a great long term buy include the following Skyworks has no long term debt This gives the company great downside protection and the ability to go after MA opportunities should they arise or boost dividend and stock buybacks at will Quarterly dividend increased to a forward yield of Skyworks also initiated a new million share repurchase program Dividend increases and stock buybacks look to be a regular occurrence going forward as long as MA opportunities remain on the sidelines Skyworks has been successfully diversifying its revenue streams It has design wins with top companies such as Apple Huawei Samsung Motorola NYSE MSI Oppo Vivo ZTE and Google NASDAQ GOOG along with internet of things engagements with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN ARRIS NASDAQ ARRS Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Fitbit NYSE FIT GE NYSE GE Google Nest Honeywell NYSE HON Itron NASDAQ ITRI and LG along with automotive presences with auto companies like Ford NYSE F Continental Audi Kia GM NYSE GM and Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY The market has priced in over the last year a horrible Apple iPhone launch which very well might be unwarranted The market might have overreacted to Skyworks growth in inventory over the past months based on managements commentary which seems reasonable and will be played out over the back part of the year Finally the rock star fundamentals of this growth company give it a realistic upside over the next year as concerns disappear over the back half of the year as Apple releases its iPhone and inventory returns to a more normal level over Q and next years Q I am long both Skyworks and Apple for the long haul Disclosure I amwe are long SWKS AAPL I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not
