(Surprise) </span>Disney has a great history of successful acquisitions.These acquisitions helped the company diversify and grow its revenue and EPS.They played a critical role in turning Disney into the huge media conglomerate it is.Here is a partial acquisition list: 2001: Saban Entertainment (owners of the Power Rangers franchise).2006: Pixar (an animation film studio that created blockbusters like Toy Story).2009: Marvel Entertainment (owner of many comic books figure like The Avengers and The Fantastic Four).On the other hand, Disney has had several partnerships with other companies that were unsuccessful.The fact that X-Men, for example, has its film rights owned by Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ) made Disney bury the successful franchise.Spider-Man also made Disney form an odd deal with Sony (NYSE: SNE ) to settle the rights for the character.The cooperation in Disneyland Paris also knew several ups and downs, and the park wasn't profitable for a significant period of time.Disney has some great prospects for 2016.The parks will have a great boost from the new resort that will be opened in Shanghai.The Star Wars film is estimated by analysts to gross around $2 billion worldwide and the pre-order websites collapsed .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The consumer products arm enjoyed double-digit growth due to the films ' merchandise and Star Wars is going to drive it forward even <i>faster</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With growth engines in <b>almost</b> every cylinder , the only problem is the forecast stagnation in the television department and ESPN in particular .  (Uncertainty) </span>If Disney is willing to drive its television business forward, a key acquisition can be the solution for that.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It already bought ESPN and ABC to boost this segment and now <b>might</b> be the right moment to make another big purchase that will drive it forward in 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am not going to discuss fundamentals or valuation too much, as I discussed it back in April and it hasn't changed much.There was a dividend hike in July and another great quarter for the company.The valuation is still a little bit high, with the P/E ratio at around 21 for FY 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>High valuation is good when acquiring companies , as the acquired companies are <b>sometimes</b> paid with stock and cash .  (Uncertainty) </span>Using the highly-valued stock as a payment method will reduce the necessary cash and debt.Disney is ready to make a major acquisition.According to Trefis, it has a net debt of only 5.7%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The debt-to-equity ratio is <i>lower</i> than it was several years ago and much <i>lower</i> when compared to several of its peers .  (Surprise) </span>The company is not too leveraged to try and go for a major acquisition.In addition, Disney is buying its own shares on a regular basis.Therefore, the company owns millions of treasury shares that are ready to be used for this major acquisition.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The long-term debt is also <i>lower</i> than it was several years ago and stands at $ 12 billion .  (Surprise) </span>The debt-to-assets ratio stands at only 0.14.Disney can raise large amounts of cash by issuing cheap debt using the zero-interest environment and its very high A2 credit rating from Moody's.The acquired company should be a leader in the streaming services industry, and therefore, Netflix is a perfect candidate.Netflix faces fierce competition from HBO ( NYSE : TWX ) , Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my opinion , its moat is n't very wide and it <b>depends</b> on its streaming division , as the DVD service is shrinking , and the content it creates , as good as it is , does n't bring in the majority of the revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix already suffers from <i>smaller</i> growth opportunities within the U.S , and it is looking internationally to find new sources of income .  (Surprise) </span>However, this isn't that easy as well, as new markets require Netflix to buy new rights for the same media.This is increasing the company's expenses when it still is in a highly competitive industry.Yet, Netflix is still managing to grow its revenues by over 20% annually.However, it is complicated for Netflix to turn revenue into net income.This growth, together with the stagnation in Disney's television sector, can help drive Disney forward.Disney can add live sports and live television with its ABC and Disney channels, and with that, it will have a superior product - a streaming service that includes premium live content.Cord-cutting is a growing trend in the U.S. Today, Netflix offers three plans.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just as these plans include different features ( mainly the number of screens that can share one account ) , it would be <b>possible</b> to give the streaming service an edge by creating a plan that includes ESPN , ABC and the Disney Channels .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix would also have the <b>possibility</b> to stream Disney , Pixar and Marvel movies before competitors .  (Uncertainty) </span>This would help Netflix against its rivals and would help Disney increase the number of subscribers to ESPN.In this hypothetical situation, Disney would hold ESPN, ABC and the Disney Channels together with premium content such as House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black.It will also have the platform to stream any new media, such as Disney movies and the current Netflix database.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am not an expert in financing or mergers and acquisitions , but in my opinion , both companies <b>could</b> benefit from this acquisition .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney has the financial <b>might</b> to make this deal happen .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix would have extra value when facing competition.Disney would have growth prospects in the television sector.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This deal would contribute to Disney much <i>more</i> in confronting stagnation than any <b>possible</b> joint venture with Netflix or any of its peers .
