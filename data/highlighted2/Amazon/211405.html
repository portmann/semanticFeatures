(Uncertainty) </span>Netflix already suffers from smaller growth opportunities within the U.S, and it is looking internationally to find new sources of income.However, this isn't that easy as well, as new markets require Netflix to buy new rights for the same media.This is increasing the company's expenses when it still is in a highly competitive industry.Yet, Netflix is still managing to grow its revenues by over 20% annually.However, it is complicated for Netflix to turn revenue into net income.This growth, together with the stagnation in Disney's television sector, can help drive Disney forward.Disney can add live sports and live television with its ABC and Disney channels, and with that, it will have a superior product - a streaming service that includes premium live content.Cord-cutting is a growing trend in the U.S. Today, Netflix offers three plans.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Just as these plans include different features ( mainly the number of screens that can share one account ) , it would be <b>possible</b> to give the streaming service an edge by creating a plan that includes ESPN , ABC and the Disney Channels .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix would also have the <b>possibility</b> to stream Disney , Pixar and Marvel movies before competitors .  (Uncertainty) </span>This would help Netflix against its rivals and would help Disney increase the number of subscribers to ESPN.In this hypothetical situation, Disney would hold ESPN, ABC and the Disney Channels together with premium content such as House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black.It will also have the platform to stream any new media, such as Disney movies and the current Netflix database.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am not an expert in financing or mergers and acquisitions , but in my opinion , both companies <b>could</b> benefit from this acquisition .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney has the financial <b>might</b> to make this deal happen .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix would have extra value when facing competition.Disney would have growth prospects in the television sector.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This deal would contribute to Disney much more in confronting stagnation than any <b>possible</b> joint venture with Netflix or any of its peers .
