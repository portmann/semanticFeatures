his eye on banks Its also easy to see why he is worried and ready to pull the trigger on a statesponsored bank bailout <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has done it again Moments ago Jeff Bezos company reported Q earnings that blew away expectations when it printed revenues of billion well above the expected billion up YY and generating EPS of more than higher than the expected However it is what drove this surge in profitability because while AMZN reported a respectable jump in its North American retail operating income which doubled from MM a year ago to MM in the current quarter or a profit margin it was Amazons cloud service the AWS that was the standout with a whopping MM in profit a whopping margin on billion in AWS sales beating expectations of a billion in revenue and up from the margin in Q The AWS profit was also higher than the profit reported by any other part of the company Cloud revenue growth was in the quarter modestly less than in Q and down

consensus expected billion Operating income is expected to be between million and million compared with million in third quarter this was below the Wall Street consensus estimate of million The guidance may also be the reason why unlike last quarter the stock saw some early weakness after the report however with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>traditionally lowballing expectations we doubt this will be a sufficient reason to keep the stock lower in the aftermarket session and expect it to surge to new all time highs shortly and continue trading at some ridiculous three digit multiple Overall sales growth also picked up to from last quarter as the company boosted its total headcount to a record mostly parttime employees More importantly consolidated operating
