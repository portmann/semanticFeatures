Can It?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>- Amazon.com , Inc. ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Nothing is <i>more</i> important concerning <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> than its solution to rising shipping costs . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is the key to long-term growth for the company , and shipping will determine revenue and earnings performance . It 's no secret <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is aggressively pursuing ways it can cut its delivery costs , or in some cases , create new services that will allow it to provide new revenue streams , as in the case of Instant Home Delivery , where it charges $ 7.99 for one-hour delivery . This is centered around the need to protect its flagship <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime business , which is the long-term growth catalyst for the company . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There has been a lot of <b>speculation</b> as to how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will solve the problem , including its less-than-realistic drone delivery program . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>My thought is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will not be able to solve the rising delivery costs with only one method , but will employ several different ways of meeting delivery needs that will lower costs over the long term . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Among some of the known options are crowdsourcing deliveries ( similar to Uber ) , increasing pickup service locations , creating additional delivery services it can charge for , or <b>possibly</b> even build some physical retail locations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Concerning the latter , if that were to happen , I think they would be <i>more</i> like a retail fulfillment center , rather than a physical retail store .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I do n't think it would be wise for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to attempt to reverse engineer its business and become similar to Wal-Mart , which has been struggling . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Some people have been suggesting a <b>possible</b> move towards traditional retail stores , but I do n't see that happening unless it 's some type of <i>smaller</i> hybrid location that allowed for package pickup and included some products in strong demand on an everyday basis .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Unless <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going to radically change its business model by increasing its retail presence in a traditional manner , delivery costs will remain its top priority because of its core <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime business . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is no <b>doubt</b> at this time <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is how the company plans on building a sustainable , profitable business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That's its growth model.To meet the goal of profitably building it out , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> must come up with a way or ways to manage shipping costs , so they do n't overwhelm margin and earnings . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some investors erroneously <b>believe</b> that at any time <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can just turn on the earnings spigot and produce positive earnings from quarter to quarter . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That's an illusion.It's not true.The heavy emphasis on controlling rising delivery costs is one piece of evidence to confirm that.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Having said that , if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> were to quit chasing after all those unprofitable schemes , it <b>may</b> be able to settle down into steady profits . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>So far it hasn't shown it has the discipline or will to do so.That means reducing shipping costs while it expands Prime is the key to its results.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> be argued that its cloud services are a catalyst that <b>could</b> change that scenario , but I do n't see that .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It accounts for <i>less</i> than 10 percent of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenue , which , of course , means retail sales account for over 90 percent of the company 's revenue . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>I don't see that changing in the near future.Within the retail segment of the company, Prime is by far the most important, as those customers far outspend non-Prime members on an individual basis.Anything that cuts into its membership program will be aggressively tackled, which again, is why we hear so much about shipping costs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't want to have to raise the price of its membership on an ongoing basis , as that would produce <i>higher</i> churn and <i>lower</i> revenue . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>That's the essence of shipping challenges the company faces.It's also why it won't stop until it solves them.One step I really like that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has taken is its Prime Now , which it charges $ 7.99 for delivery within an hour . For delivery in two hours, customers get it for free.What I like about it is it's a classic example of turning lemons into lemonade.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not only is it solving an issue associated with <i>higher</i> delivery costs , but it has created a new revenue stream by tapping into the demand from many customers to get their products <i>quicker</i> .  (Surprise) </span>It's also another perk of Prime members, and an incentive to continue their subscription.Also interesting is it will work with restaurants to deliver food to customers, adding an additional revenue source to the business.It usually works with existing delivery companies in various markets to offer the service.Another delivery option <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is looking at is a crowdsourcing one , similar to Uber , in the sense of creating an app where drivers would then pick up and deliver packages . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This would involve becoming excellent at vetting carriers , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already has experience in that with its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Home Services business , which <b>probably</b> requires a <i>more</i> robust search into an individual 's qualifications and integrity , than on associated with a carrier . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>There are similarities though , in that there are sure to be insurance requirements and other factors <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will have to check into in order to make it work . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Where the challenge would lie is there would be a lot <i>more</i> carriers to vet than there will be repair companies .  (Surprise) </span>The good news is this would be a huge moat for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> if and when it employs such a service . Like some of the other delivery solutions , this one would n't require a lot of capital expenditure , which is a huge plus for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already has a service in place where customers can go to 7-Eleven stores and pick up their deliveries in lockers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is something <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> expand upon in certain markets where it would be convenient for them to do so . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It also is reportedly working on some drive-up grocery locations , which would be certain to grow in number if the concept is approved and launched .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With these types of strategies , it is easy to see how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> combine that with crowdsourced services to provide options for customers to choose from , while not having to invest huge amounts of capital to build large facilities . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Over time, it would be big winner on the pick-up side as once it's in place, maintenance of the service wouldn't be that costly.There would be the added benefit of not investing in shipping costs of any kind beyond development expenses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>assumes</b> it builds its own storage facilities or works similar deals to what it has with 7-Eleven .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 've heard talk of the idea <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> decide to open up retail stores around the world . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Personally, I don't really see that happening.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Like Wal-Mart , it would open it up to being disrupted , as <i>younger</i> people prefer to shop online .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That is likely to be their preference in the future as well , which would put pressure on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> if it went physical retail . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Where the decision would be made concerning any physical store or storage facility would be whether or not it would be <i>lower</i> cost than the way it ships now .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Now I <b>could</b> see what I would call a retail fulfillment center , which would be something like I mentioned <i>earlier</i> , with a location for customers or its crowdsourced drivers to pick up their deliveries .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it included some impulse products that would be used by most people on an everyday basis , that <b>may</b> make some sense .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yet I <b>doubt</b> that will be how it works out .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There <b>could</b> be only one reason <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would go that way , and that would be because it <b>could</b> n't figure out ways to <i>lower</i> shipping costs . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It would also assume shipping costs were so high it <b>could</b> n't generate a profit .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's a <b>doubtful</b> scenario .  (Uncertainty) </span>The idea <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is building locations for customer pick-up as a prelude to building physical retail stores is a stretch to me . I just don't see it happening, and what value it would add to customers.The trend is going the opposite direction, and that isn't going to change in the near future.The primary focus of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> going forward will be reining in shipping costs . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is the catalyst there , and it must find solutions to those rising costs . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't <b>believe</b> the company will be able to raise its membership price soon , as it would breach the psychological $ 100 barrier , which would substantially increase churn .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Outside of retail stores and the dubious drone delivery program , the delivery options mentioned in the article , or something very close to them , is the <b>probable</b> way <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> deals with the issue . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It will definitely employ <i>more</i> than one method to deal with the different markets it serves in .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We 're <b>probably</b> going to see some intersections in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's pursuit of delivering cost containment , with some facilities being built for <i>more</i> than one service ; such as grocery storage and pick-up of non-grocery items . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Geek Wire also recently reported <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> appears to be working on a new initiative called `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Flex , '' which at this time <b>seems</b> to be a hybrid solution to lowering shipping costs , by the combination of crowdsourcing and pick-up mentioned above . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Whatever the end product , this is the major part of the business to watch with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , as it is the key to being able to successfully keep its <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime subscription service profitably growing .
