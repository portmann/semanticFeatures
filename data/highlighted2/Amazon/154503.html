style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>than its solution to rising shipping costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is the key to longterm growth for the company and shipping will determine revenue and earnings performance Its no secret <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is aggressively pursuing ways it can cut its delivery costs or in some cases create new services that will allow it to provide new revenue streams as in the case of Instant Home Delivery where it charges for onehour delivery This is centered around the need to protect its flagship <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime business which is the longterm growth catalyst for the company There has been a lot of speculation as to how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will solve the problem including its lessthanrealistic drone delivery program My thought is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will not be able to solve the rising delivery costs with only one method but will employ several different ways of meeting delivery needs that will lower costs over the long term Among some of the known options are crowdsourcing deliveries similar to Uber increasing pickup service locations creating additional delivery services it can charge for or possibly even build some physical retail locations Concerning the latter if that were to happen I think they would be more like a retail fulfillment center rather than a physical retail store I dont think it would be wise for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to attempt to reverse engineer its business and become similar to WalMart which has been struggling Some people have been suggesting a possible move towards traditional retail stores but I dont see that happening unless its some type of smaller hybrid location that allowed for package pickup and included some products in strong demand on an everyday basis Unless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going to radically change its business model by increasing its retail presence in a traditional manner delivery costs will remain its top priority because of its core <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime business There is no doubt at this time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is how the company plans on building a sustainable profitable business Thats its growth model To meet the goal of profitably building it out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>must come up with a way or ways to manage shipping costs so they dont overwhelm margin and earnings Some investors erroneously believe that at any time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can just turn on the earnings spigot and produce positive earnings from quarter to quarter Thats an illusion Its not true The heavy emphasis on controlling rising delivery costs is one piece of evidence to confirm that Having said that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>were to quit chasing after all those unprofitable schemes it may be able to settle down into steady profits So far it hasnt shown it has the discipline or will to do so That means reducing shipping costs while it expands Prime is the key to its results It could be argued that its cloud services are a catalyst that could change that scenario but I dont see that It accounts for less than percent of Amazons revenue which of course means retail sales account for over percent of the companys revenue I dont see that changing in the near future Within the retail segment of the company Prime is by far the most important as those customers far outspend nonPrime members on an individual basis Anything that cuts into its membership program will be aggressively tackled which again is why we hear so much about shipping costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt want to have to raise the price of its membership on an ongoing basis as that would produce higher churn and lower revenue Thats the essence of shipping challenges the company faces Its also why it wont stop until it solves them One step I really like that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has taken is its Prime Now which it charges for delivery within an hour For delivery in two hours customers get it for free What I like about it is its a classic example of turning lemons into lemonade Not only is it solving an issue associated with higher delivery costs but it has created a new revenue stream by tapping into the demand from many customers to get their products quicker Its also another perk of Prime members and an incentive to continue their subscription Also interesting is it will work with restaurants to deliver food to customers adding an additional revenue source to the business It usually works with existing delivery companies in various markets to offer the service Another delivery option <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is looking at is a crowdsourcing one similar to Uber in the sense of creating an app where drivers would then pick up and deliver packages This would involve becoming excellent at vetting carriers but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has experience in that with its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Home Services business which probably requires a more robust search into an individuals qualifications and integrity than on associated with a carrier There are similarities though in that there are sure to be insurance requirements and other factors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have to check into in order to make it work Where the challenge would lie is there would be a lot more carriers to vet than there will be repair companies The good news is this would be a huge moat for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>if and when it employs such a service Like some of the other delivery solutions this one wouldnt require a lot of capital expenditure which is a huge plus for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has a service in place where customers can go to Eleven stores and pick up their deliveries in lockers That is something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could expand upon in certain markets where it would be convenient for them to do so It also is reportedly working on some driveup grocery locations which would be certain to grow in number if the concept is approved and launched With these types of strategies it is easy to see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could combine that with crowdsourced services to provide options for customers to choose from while not having to invest huge amounts of capital to build large facilities Over time it would be big winner on the pickup side as once its in place maintenance of the service wouldnt be that costly There would be the added benefit of not investing in shipping costs of any kind beyond development expenses This assumes it builds its own storage facilities or works similar deals to what it has with Eleven Ive heard talk of the idea <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may decide to open up retail stores around the world Personally I dont really see that happening Like WalMart it would open it up to being disrupted as younger people prefer to shop online That is likely to be their preference in the future as well which would put pressure on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>if it went physical retail Where the decision would be made concerning any physical store or storage facility would be whether or not it would be lower cost than the way it ships now Now I could see what I would call a retail fulfillment center which would be something like I mentioned earlier with a location for customers or its crowdsourced drivers to pick up their deliveries If it included some impulse products that would be used by most people on an everyday basis that may make some sense Yet I doubt that will be how it works out There could be only one reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would go that way and that would be because it couldnt figure out ways to lower shipping costs It would also assume shipping costs were so high it couldnt generate a profit Thats a doubtful scenario The idea <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is building locations for customer pickup as a prelude to building physical retail stores is a stretch to me I just dont see it happening and what value it would add to customers The trend is going the opposite direction and that isnt going to change in the near future The primary focus of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>going forward will be reining in shipping costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is the catalyst there and it must find solutions to those rising costs I dont believe the company will be able to raise its membership price soon as it would breach the psychological barrier which would substantially increase churn Outside of retail stores and the dubious drone delivery program the delivery options mentioned in the article or something very close to them is the probable way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>deals with the issue It will definitely employ more than one method to deal with the different markets it serves in Were probably going to see some intersections in Amazons pursuit of delivering cost containment with some facilities being built for more than one service such as grocery storage and pickup of nongrocery items Geek Wire also recently reported <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>appears to be working on a new initiative called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex which at this time seems to be a hybrid solution to lowering shipping costs by the combination of crowdsourcing and pickup mentioned above Whatever the end product this is the major part of the business to watch with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as it is the key to being able to successfully keep its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime subscription service profitably growing Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned
