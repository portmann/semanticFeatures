PG WMT by Dana Blankenhorn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Dash is a very simple Internet of Things button for creating shopping lists The button is tied to major brands which will benefit over store brands While some are thinking its an April Fools joke and others are wondering what this means for shopping AmazonCom NASDAQ AMZN has given a huge boost for brands with its Dash button Each button carries the logo of a branded product Each one is designed to be placed where that product is used Press the button when youre about to run out of that product and your WiFi will take that signal to a shopping cart from which the order can be quickly fulfilled Only branded merchandise is going into the program from companies like Clorox NYSE CLX Proctor Gamble NYSE PG and Kraft NASDAQ KRFT Its Amazons first foray into the Internet of Things a home inventory application that builds shopping lists at the point of use Home inventory is sort of the lowhanging fruit Its the cheapest area to implement next to home entertainment where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has its Fire Stick linking WiFi to the selection of Internetbased TV programming WiFi becomes a platform for applications that literally live in the air tied to singlechip computers with specialized applications for monitoring conditions and controlling them In that world the Dash buttons are supersimple and supercheap They are as the name implies just onoff switches What complexity will exist will be in the shopping cart which customers maintain through their connection back to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>They are truly an IoT application Eventually as cheap chips become more powerful youll be able to monitor the condition of what you have and the quantity of what you have not just its existence and have shopping lists built onthefly What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants when that happens is to be ready on the back end to get its store at the front of the line for fulfillment and to make it the only choice for highend consumers While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>originally made its name with low low prices its now trying to sell convenience and automate the buying process This isnt about shopping its about buying about taking shopping out of purchasing entirely You can click between the products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers and their prices and compare them to what the competition offers Sometimes as with Tide Amazons price is best In others as with Glad drawstring trash bags other merchants have better pricing But thats not the point of Dash The point of Dash is to eliminate the pricecomparison process from the buying experience Its also to eliminate the productcomparison process from the buying experience and this may be more important Theyre not offering diapers theyre offering Huggies Theyre not offering baby food theyre offering Gerber If you previously used a different brand youre going to be challenged with Dash at least until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>decides to offer different brands Chances are the highend target market for Dash isnt going to care and if Dash gains traction it could move market shares The technology is so simple however that it is brandname stores who may eventually benefit first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has shown the way for WalMart NYSE WMT to further automate the construction of shopping lists for Costco
