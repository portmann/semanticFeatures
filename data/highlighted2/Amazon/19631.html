( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Apr. . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>1 , 2015 9:47 AM ET | About : Amazon.com , Inc. ( AMZN ) , Includes : CLX , COST , KR , KRFT , PG , WMT by : Dana Blankenhorn <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Dash is a very simple Internet of Things button for creating shopping lists . The button is tied to major brands, which will benefit over store brands.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While some are thinking it 's an April Fool 's joke , and others are <b>wondering</b> what this means for shopping , Amazon.Com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has given a huge boost for brands with its Dash button . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Each button carries the logo of a branded product.Each one is designed to be placed where that product is used.Press the button when you're about to run out of that product, and your WiFi will take that signal to a shopping cart, from which the order can be quickly fulfilled.Only branded merchandise is going into the program, from companies like Clorox (NYSE: CLX ), Proctor & Gamble (NYSE: PG ), and Kraft (NASDAQ: KRFT ).It 's <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's first foray into the Internet of Things , a home inventory application that builds shopping lists at the point of use . Home inventory is sort of the low-hanging fruit.It 's the cheapest area to implement , next to home entertainment , where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> already has its Fire Stick , linking WiFi to the selection of Internet-based TV programming . WiFi becomes a platform for applications that literally live in the air, tied to single-chip computers with specialized applications for monitoring conditions and controlling them.In that world the Dash buttons are super-simple, and super-cheap.They are, as the name implies, just on-off switches.What complexity will exist will be in the shopping cart , which customers maintain through their connection back to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . They are truly an IoT 1.0 application.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Eventually , as cheap chips become <i>more</i> powerful , you 'll be able to monitor the condition of what you have , and the quantity of what you have , not just its existence , and have shopping lists built on-the-fly .  (Surprise) </span>What <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants , when that happens , is to be ready on the back end , to get its store at the front of the line for fulfillment , and to make it the only choice for high-end consumers . While <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> originally made its name with low , low prices , it 's now trying to sell convenience , and automate the buying process . This isn't about shopping, it's about buying, about taking shopping out of purchasing entirely.You can click between the products <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> offers , and their prices , and compare them to what the competition offers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Sometimes</b> , as with Tide , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's price is best . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In others , as with Glad drawstring trash bags , other merchants have <i>better</i> pricing .  (Surprise) </span>But that's not the point of Dash.The point of Dash is to eliminate the price-comparison process from the buying experience.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's also to eliminate the product-comparison process from the buying experience , and this <b>may</b> be <i>more</i> important .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>They're not offering diapers, they're offering Huggies.They're not offering baby food, they're offering Gerber.If you previously used a different brand , you 're going to be challenged with Dash - at least until <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> decides to offer different brands . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Chances are , the high-end target market for Dash is n't going to care , and if Dash gains traction it <b>could</b> move market shares .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The technology is so simple , however , that it is brand-name stores who <b>may</b> eventually benefit first .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has shown the way for Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) to further automate the construction of shopping lists , for Costco ( NASDAQ : COST ) to automate the construction of shopping lists , and for Kroger ( NYSE : KR ) to further automate the construction of shopping lists . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>bigger</i> retailers are about to get much , much <i>bigger</i> .
