efforts to drive mobile app subscriptions Qualcomms launch of a connected car platform and Hewlett Packard Enterprises IoT deal with GE Also covered The apparent demise of mobile payments platform CurrentC Intels wireless charging pullback the delayed closing of the MicronInotera deal and new BlackBerry enterprise mobility software Facebooks hiring of a creative strategy chief a Salesforce VC fund and reports on app download rates and US ad sales also get attention Apple revamps App Store policies to drive subscriptions confirms plans for App Store search ads Google reportedly also plans a subscription revamp Apple NASDAQ AAPL plans to take just a cut of App Store subscription revenue following the first year of a subscription down from a current It also plans to expand subscription support to all app categories and to provide numerous pricing options and tiers Meanwhile Recode reports Google GOOG GOOGL will lower its subscription cut to from the start of a subscription Also Apple has confirmed as previously indicated by Bloomberg it will begin showing app ads against App Store search results Google already shows app ads within both Google Play and Google Search results and Facebook NASDAQ FB has created a massive business out of ads that relying on Facebooks user and appinstall data urge users to either download or resume using an app The upshot Both Apple and Google realize the struggles of small and midsized developers to get noticed and generate meaningful revenue are a major problem for their respective mobile ecosystems By making subscriptions more appealing theyre trying to provide an alternative to inapp purchases which often see limited traction outside of games and paid downloads which are often a tough sell and can be hard to derive recurring revenue from after an initial purchase typically less than is made They might also be trying to win over companies such as Spotify that have tried to limit the number of subscriptions they have to give AppleGoogle a cut on Others have observed productivity apps not previously available on the App Store via subscriptions could be a major beneficiary of Apples policy changes Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Adobe NASDAQ ADBE Autodesk NASDAQ ADSK and others have been aggressively migrating their enterprise app user bases to subscriptions providing access to a mixture of PC cloud and mobile apps Others selling productivity apps on a subscription basis include Citrix NASDAQ CTXS Atlassian NASDAQ TEAM Slack Private SLACK and LogMeIn NASDAQ LOGM Qualcomm launches a connected car reference platform Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM GG modems have made their way into many cars and the company also provides Snapdragon processors tailored for the automotive market Its now providing a connectivity reference platform for automakers and auto suppliers that features its modems GPS and dead reckoning location chips WiFi Bluetooth and AMFM radios and support for invehicle networking technologies The breadth of Qualcomms connected car offerings underpinned by its widelyused modems could help it stand out the company has had a lot of success at getting phone reference platforms adopted by mobile OEMs Intel NASDAQ INTC is also going after the automotive connectivity market as is Cypress Semi NASDAQ CY which is set to buy Broadcoms NASDAQ AVGO wireless IoT chip business Qualcomm launched new a wearables processor and IoT WiFi radio last week as it looks for ways to lower its exposure to a pressured mobile chip business Hewlett Packard Enterprise strikes an IoT deal with GE opens up The Machine to developers On the heels of disclosing its providing the hardware used by Dropbox Private DROPB to migrate from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services Hewlett Packard Enterprise NYSE HPE has announced it will be the preferred hardware partner for General Electrics NYSE GE cloudbased Predix IoT platform its used to create apps that collect and analyze data from webconnected industrial hardware and has unveiled new converged integrated serverstorage systems for IoT data capture and analytics GE forecast last year revenue from Predix and other software offerings would triple to B by Separately HPE has announced its opening up The Machine a nextgen computing architecture which does away with main memory and storage memory eg DRAM and hard drivesSSDs in favor of a common universal memory and in which this memory is connected to processors via optical links to opensource developers to create the groundwork for the ecosystem needed for such a system to take off Much like IBMs quantum computing efforts The Machine is unlikely to produce significant revenue in the next few years Wouldbe Apple PayAndroid Pay rival CurrentC appears set to bite the dust Just as mobile carriers launched the Softcard mobile payments JV once known as Isis before changing its name for obvious reasons in an attempt to keep Apple and Google from dominating NFCbased mobile payments a slew of major bricksandmortar chains backed CurrentC supporters included WalMart NYSE WMT Target NYSE TGT CVS Health Corp NYSE CVS Kmart NASDAQ SHLD Dunkin Donuts NASDAQ DNKN and Best Buy NYSE BBY And like Softcard shuttered last year CurrentC went nowhere fast Last month MCX the consortium behind CurrentC announced major layoffs And on Tuesday MCX notified CurrentC beta test users their accounts are being deleted To be fair Apple Pay and Android Pay havent exactly seen explosive growth either a December survey found only of US iPhone users had used Apple Pay at least once with of them having used it to make an instore purchase and an inapp payment Android Pay and for that matter Samsung Pay OTCSSNLF adoption appears to be lower still Even with a transition to chipbased EMV payments not quite as fast as traditional card swipes underway most consumers are content for now to keep relying on payment cards Intel ceases work on wireless charging efforts Much like the companys Atom mobile processors Intels wireless charging RD appears to be a casualty of the companys major layoffs The decision could have some impact on Integrated Device Technology NASDAQ IDTI a top player in the wireless charging chip market and an Intel wireless charging partner since IHS estimates the wireless charging receiver market grew over in to M units But the lions share of those units went into nonIntel powered Android phones Apple is reportedly looking to integrate an overtheair wireless charging solution within iPhones The closing of Microns B purchase of Inotera is delayed Micron NASDAQ MU announced last December its buying the of Taiwanese DRAM maker Inotera it doesnt yet own for B net of cashdebt on hand It now says the deal wont close in midJuly as previously expected and that an update will be given later this year No explanation for the holdup is provided regulatory scrutiny is a plausible explanation Micron stock fell following the announcement The Inotera deal was well received by the sell side when it was first struck with analysts arguing itll improve Microns margins by allowing it to obtain Inoteras DRAM at cost and provide manufacturing synergies BlackBerry launches email protection software takes steps to integrate enterprise mobility management software While BlackBerrys NASDAQ BBRY stilldeclining phone business gets more attention the companys turnaround efforts largely revolve around morphing into a provider of multiplatform enterprise mobility software tools and subscription services It added to those efforts on Wednesday by announcing a security service for email attachments part of its WatchDox file syncingsharing platform and steps to jointly manage devices and apps handled by its BES enterprise mobility management EMM software and the EMM offerings of Good Technology acquired last fall Gartners enterprise mobility management Magic Quadrant BlackBerry is listed as a niche player while recently acquired Good Technology is listed as a leader It helps that CEO John Chen is quite familiar with this space he was once the CEO of Sybase acquired by SAP in an early player in enterprise mobility software But theres a ton of competition Microsoft Citrix VMware NYSE VMW IBM Corp NYSE IBM Box NYSE BOX and MobileIron NASDAQ MOBL are among the companies that are notable players in EMM andor enterprise file

InterActiveCorpowned CollegeHumor will now be in his words working with all types of creators and organizations to figure out how best to use the biggest network in the world to better connect people with engaging and meaningful content Its a safe bet that a lot of his work will revolve around the Facebook Live streaming platform which Facebook has gone as far as to pay media companies to support Not as clear is whether Facebook will ultimately join several other web giants in directly financing original content If the company does head in that direction its huge reach and contenttargeting abilities would work in its favor Salesforce is creating a M VC fund for startups using its app platforms creating an incubator Salesforce NYSE CRM is no stranger to the corporate VC world The company

Facebook WhatsApp YouTube Instagram Gmail and Netflix NASDAQ NFLX They provide some context for Apple and Googles attempts to revamp their app store policies as well as Apples plans to join Google in selling app ads Though still rising mobile app usage isnt growing the way it once did which in turn adds to the pressure faced by smaller developers In spite of the download slowdown Uber Private UBER and Snapchat Private CHAT each saw tripledigit global download growth Airbnb Private AIRB and Pinterest Private PINIT also saw healthy growth Pandora NYSE P saw a big annual decline PwC US online ad revenue is set to eclipse TV ad revenue in PwC estimates US online ad revenue totaled B in and TV ad revenue B It sees the former figure rising to B in and the latter only to B Considering the impact of cordcutting on TV subscriptionsratings its not farfetched to imagine TV ad revenue growth turning negative and the dollars leaving TV often finding their way to online video PwC also estimates mobile ads accounted for of online ad revenue in and will make up in The estimate could be conservative given mobile already makes up well over half the traffic seen by many big online content
