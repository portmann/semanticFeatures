(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha At the beginning of this year, I saw Netflix entering a major correction due to slowing domestic growth and regional issues hindering the international expansion.This short thesis worked out decently and was initially confirmed by weak Q2 guidance.Recently, new surveys and a Disney deal have given Netflix significant momentum..Netflix shares (NASDAQ: NFLX ) are a daytrader's dream.Any positive news or offhand comment by a banker can cause shares to gain momentum for days.They also cause headaches to investors basing their decisions on fundamental considerations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the past 2 weeks , shares have gained about 20 % , <b>almost</b> recovering from their sharp Q1 earnings reaction .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I originally recommended a short position <i>earlier</i> this year when shares were just below $ 108 .  (Surprise) </span>This worked out well until about a week ago.In this article, I ponder my short thesis and in particular trend-breaking catalysts.First, let me preface this article with some perspective on share prices.The way I continue to think about Netflix is by comparison with Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) price: That is, the premise of my short thesis has always been the following.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>assumption</b> of unending growth and market domination combined with underestimating the competition and rising content costs have created a peak valuation similar to Microsoft 's before the burst of the dot-com bubble .  (Uncertainty) </span>It took Microsoft well over a decade to grow back into the pre-crash valuation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft 's valuation compression came as part of a <i>larger</i> stock market correction and a deflation of expectations towards tech stocks .  (Surprise) </span>Ultimately, I expect something similar happening to Netflix for a number of reasons which I will discuss in a moment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has a valuable business just as Microsoft , but its current valuation is based on a far future that the company still has to grow into , surrounded by a lot of risk and <b>uncertainty</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>The issue with being right about shorting a momentum stock is that being right is not enough.Shorting via puts costs money through time-decay, borrowing shares comes with a loan fee.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Timing is thus <i>more</i> critical than with a buy-and-hold strategy .  (Surprise) </span>In the remainder of this article, I will analyze what I perceive as likely short catalysts and timing aspects.By any reasonable metric, Netflix is comically overvalued.A recent fundamental breakdown can be found here .However, cognitive biases work against a Netflix short.The all time high just a few months ago was over $130, thus creating a mental anchoring point for growth investors who will view any price below this as a discount.This actually makes sense considering the all time high was prior to the announcement of global expansion.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If $ 130 was the pre-expansion announcement price , surely , $ 100 is an even <i>better</i> discount ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>seems</b> like an unreasonable mindset to fundamental investors but completely justified to others .  (Uncertainty) </span>The growth hypothesis is based on Netflix being the first mover in providing high-quality streaming content in an appealing mix of original content, classic productions and recent Hollywood films, thus likely capturing the lion share in most markets it moves into.Weak Q2 guidance seemed to have put a dent in the expansion euphoria.Reports of regional problems emerged.It looked like Netflix had rushed the launch in some countries.There has also been news about the EU imposing regional content quotas as some act of protectionism.In the past week, Netflix soared again on new favorable survey data indicating increasing international awareness of Netflix, willingness to pay for streaming content and a preference for US content over local content.How do we reconcile this?There are two independent effects going on and Netflix is banking on both working out for them.The first is simply a lack of competition for high-quality US content in many markets.Hulu's international move (apart from Japan) will take time as its stakeholders are still figuring out a competitive domestic strategy.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) instant video/prime is <i>more</i> widely available but has a <i>smaller</i> content library and <i>less</i> original content , even though <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is working on that . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As of now , Netflix <b>seems</b> to have enough brand awareness to become the default choice for new streaming customers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Bottom line, new data points are showing that we can continue to expect Netflix to add new users in new regions.Note that I am deliberately excluding the financial aspects of content financing here - as long as the growth perspective is intact, debt structuring and capital raises will be likely be overlooked in my opinion (see Tesla).The other point is churn and the temporal aspect here is really what caught my eye.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix has enjoyed <i>lower</i> churn rates than competitors <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Hulu , according to this report : Netflix was revealed as being the service with the lowest churn rate as a percentage of its total subscriber base . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In the past 12 months, 5% of US broadband households cancelled their Netflix account, including those who cancelled at the end of the trial period.That figure was up from 4% in Q2 2015 and represents 9% of the company's current subscriber base.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Of course , this <b>might</b> just be a meaningless correlation , but an increase in subscriber churn coincides with a <i>smaller</i> content library .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It is reasonable to assume that <i>smaller</i> libraries create <i>less</i> continued perceived value and thus cause <i>higher</i> churn after users have watched whatever fraction of the content they deem relevant -- which <b>might</b> be not very much given some of the older/less known titles used to prop up libraries .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This brings me to the key point of this article: there will be a growth-churn crossover at some point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Domestically , this <b>might</b> be pretty soon ( this year ? )  (Uncertainty) </span>, as subscriber growth has already slowed down.Internationally, Netflix has just launched.It is likely that users are still experimenting with the service in many new countries.It will take time to establish churn rates and local growth perspectives.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Given the much <i>smaller</i> content libraries in some of these countries , churn rates will very likely be considerably <i>higher</i> and <b>maybe</b> similar to Hulu 's in the US ( half their subscribers cancelled in 2015 ! )  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , this will likely be offset by <i>more</i> new subscribers in countries with rapidly growing/emergent streaming markets , at least for some time .  (Surprise) </span>Shorting this quarter?No thank you.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Net-net , this effect means that Netflix ' international expansion <b>might</b> look intact for a little while <i>longer</i> and thus will also divert attention from rising domestic competition .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix is racing against the clock to streamline its international content libraries fast enough to enjoy <i>better</i> economies of scale while avoiding <i>higher</i> churn .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is an incredibly <b>risky</b> bet because it means a fight on many fronts , e.g. regional political issues such as EU quotas or understanding the specifics of some Asian markets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my view , the valuation of Netflix does not accurately present the risks of this maneuver and particularly the potential effect of this growth-churn crossover which <b>could</b> lead to a net-subscriber loss in the US in the not-so-far future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It also does not represent the <b>risk</b> that at some point , Netflix will not be the default choice for new cord-cutters any <i>more</i> but merely one of many , as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Hulu and others ( e.g. HBO ) are moving ahead with their original content plans . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It will take them at least 1-2 years to catch up to where Netflix is now internationally but they do present an imminent threat in the states.On the other hand, the data in new international regions is just not there yet.Churn versus growth is still a question mark.Entering a short position in the next few months is thus a highly dangerous game.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A positive subscriber <b>surprise</b> could continue masking these <b>risks</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Earlier</i> this year , I underestimated the positive reaction in new regions like Germany .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I hence recommend waiting for <i>more</i> data here to enter another short position , particularly given this recent momentum .
