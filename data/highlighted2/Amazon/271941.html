decline in net income Last week I discussed how we were seeing a number of negative analyst reports regarding Apple NASDAQ AAPL Wall Street has been worried about the iPhone as supply chain checks seem to indicate demand for the companys newest phones is not doing as well as hoped As a result weve seen some pretty dramatic estimate reductions lately for the Marchending fiscal Q This puts Apple management in the spotlight because the company can overcome this panic if it decides to release some new products and services earlier than some may have expected Frankly Im surprised at how quickly Wall Street has turned against Apple It wouldnt be surprising to see a number of estimate reductions shortly after an earnings report but to see this happen during a quarter a month before earnings seems unprecedented In the chart below you can see how the fiscal Q revenue average has dropped in just over a weeks time Source Yahoo Finance analyst estimates The average revenue estimate is down by billion and it takes a lot for that to happen with estimates on the name currently If we take a look at last years Q financials and the iPhones average selling price analysts are basically reducing their unit sales estimate by about million or so units Since the iPhone is a high margin product this has also resulted in an average EPS estimate drop of cents over the above charted time period Now a billion plus dollars of revenues may not seem that important for Apple since analysts are still looking for more than billion in fiscal Q However analysts have cut their year over year percentage growth estimate from to in just over a week and thats almost half of the companys projected growth Remember Apple in this years Q has the benefit of Apple Watch and Apple Music that werent in last years period so it seems likely that analysts will now be looking for the company to report a year over year decline in iPhone sales Its also interesting to note that analysts are looking for just a cent gain in EPS to a share in Q Based on Apples strong share repurchase plan I am currently projecting at least a cent year over year EPS increase thanks to the buyback That number could be even more if the lower share price results in management stepping in with additional accelerated share repurchases This basically tells me analysts are looking for Apple to report a decline in Q net income something we havent seen from Apple in a couple of years So how can Apple overcome this sudden panic which has sent shares back down towards Well this is where management needs to step in If designs are ready and decent production can be found the company should move up some productservice launches that the street is looking for The most recent rumors have an Apple event in March that could see the launch of the Apple Watch and the smaller iPhone c that Ive discussed at length We are also waiting for the company to launch a refreshed iPad Air as well as a streaming TV service that has recently been put on the back burner If you remember the launch of the iPhone s Apple only launched the smartphone with a couple of days left in the quarter If the company hopes to overcome this recent analyst panic it cannot do the same with the upcoming launches To generate meaningful revenues since the company usually is supply constrained at launch with most items Apple probably needs to have these products available for weeks during fiscal Q Im not suggesting Apple move up these launches to January but every extra sales day works out to a few hundred million in revenues That could easily be the difference between making and missing quarterly estimates Why is this Q panic such a big deal for investors in the longterm Well it all has to do with perception When the street fears that Apples largest product isnt growing and company revenues are plateauing the stock is sold off and investors flee to names that are perceived to have more growth Just take a look at the following month chart showing Apple against Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Intel NASDAQ INTC and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Apple has lost more than over this time because investors and analysts are worried about the companys near term future To show you how bad sentiment is Microsoft shares are up in this period and yet analysts are looking for revenues at that company to decline in this fiscal year However Microsoft has a growing cloud business and is expected to do better in the future so investors are jumping on that train Alphabet Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are showing plenty of growth so investors are sending those names to alltime highs Even a name like Intel which has struggled to grow revenues in recent years thanks to a declining PC industry is being favored because revenue growth is likely in thanks to the Altera NASDAQ ALTR acquisition an extra week in its fiscal year and some other items In early Tuesday morning trading Apple shares are fetching less than times expected fiscal EPS and that includes the companys massive cash pile Weve continued to see negative analyst notes in recent days sending fiscal Q and even the current Q estimates down quite significantly Apple management needs to earn its pay now and the best way to do that is to move up potential productservice launches Investors are selling the stock because growth doesnt seem to be there and management can help overcome that panic by refreshing products that consumers are waiting for while launching other new ones This is critical for the stocks longterm success because if Apple doesnt prove it can grow going forward more investors are going to bail moving to names that currently have growth potential
