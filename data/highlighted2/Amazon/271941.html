Even a name like Intel, which has struggled to grow revenues in recent years thanks to a declining PC industry, is being favored because revenue growth is likely in 2016 thanks to the Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) acquisition, an extra week in its fiscal year, and some other items.In early Tuesday morning trading, Apple shares are fetching less than 11 times expected fiscal 2016 EPS, and that includes the company's massive cash pile.We've continued to see negative analyst notes in recent days, sending fiscal Q2 (and even the current Q1) estimates down quite significantly.Apple management needs to earn its pay now, and the best way to do that is to move up potential product/service launches.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors are selling the stock because growth does n't seem to be there , and management can help overcome that <b>panic</b> by refreshing products that consumers are waiting for , while launching other new ones .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is critical for the stock's long-term success, because if Apple doesn't prove it can grow going forward, more investors are going to bail, moving to names that currently have growth potential.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
