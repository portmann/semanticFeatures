been greatly exaggerated It is important to consider gold in local currency terms In euro gold is up in after gain in Its time to challenge the notion that the decline of a currency can be measured

from the site Curious why after its massive drubbing yesterday which led to the second highest volume day for AAPL stock in the phone market is down another this morning The reason Wall Streets momentum chasing penguins have reemerged and moments ago Bank of America right on time as in just after the stock broke its DMA and entered a correction decided to downgrade AAPL from Buy to Neutral lowering its price target from to The reasons for the downgrade from the report We downgrade shares of Apple Inc ticker AAPL to Neutral from Buy with a PO of Although the long term opportunity is significant we expect near term pressure on shares driven by significant slowdown in revenue growth as iPhone growth decelerates and other initiatives like Apple Watch Apple Pay Apple Music take time to ramp China now accounts for of iPhone sales CQ and share gains will be more difficult to come by the stock price is correlated to gross profit dollar growth Figure which despite the mix benefit of the iPhone will decelerate significantly over the next few quarters the magnitude of the beats is diminishing creating higher risk to negative revisions particularly as the Apple watch expectations are likely too elevated in the iPhone SS are likely to be an incremental upgrade force touch but not likely compelling enough for driving a significant change in the pace of share gains and we do not see incremental capital return announcements beyond the already announced plans in the near term We model EPS impact from Apple Watch in C and from Apple Pay At its current mn subscribers for Apple Music not yet paying the contribution will remain relatively small in C at less than share Although the potential exists for each of these to become significant revenue drivers in the longrun the shorttomedium term direction of the stock remains dependent on the iPhone We do not dispute that valuation metrics remain compelling for Apple however in the last downcycle despite compelling valuation the stock retraced AAPL stock has rallied in C vs SINFT up and is trading at multiples at a slight discount to peers PO moves to Stronger than expected share gains of iPhones from Android or increased enterprise penetration could drive upside relative to our model Reacceleration in iPad sales could offset some of the iPhone decline but with lower margins Our new PO of is based on x C EPS of The iPhone remains a major driver of the companys revenue in FE and operating profit in FE While the iPhone plus represents a super cycle in our opinion demand is being pulled in from the next year and we see the December quarter of as the peak shipment quarter for iPhones until the potential iPhone release in Sep likely with force touch dual rear cameras Importantly China accounted for est of total iPhone sales in the June quarter On a yy basis this is significant growth however market share trends are easing after quarters of gains Given the upside in iPhone estimates largely depends on new users we see incremental risk to units in the near term The iPhone sales over the past quarters combined with the replacement rates see above suggest that there was a significant acceleration of replacements driven by the iPhone which has since tailed off sharply offset by very strong new user adoption See our detailed analysis of this here A detailed look at the iPhone installed base The stronger new user growth is bullish overall installed base grows larger over time but also makes the quarterly sales more volatile We view this latter dynamic at significant risk given the headwind being created by the stronger dollar and broader economic uncertainty which can lead to lower sales from large markets like China In short fears over Chinas dramatic mood swing where there has been nothing substantially new in the past months and if BofA really cared it could have released this report back in late June when we said the Chinese market crash would impact AAPL sales and its stock price shortly and concerns the momentum shift will become selfreinforcing once again confirming that even for such a fundamental case as AAPL only the abundance of greater fools matters Wed Headbanger
