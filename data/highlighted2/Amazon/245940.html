(Uncertainty) </span>The stock has not generated alpha when compared to the S&P 500.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The weakness in performance will likely continue given the low <b>probability</b> of a meaningful sales and earnings beat for Q1 FY16 and concerns over unit demand throughout the course of FY ' 16 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Institutional investors are interpreting the weakness in orders as both a Q1 and Q2 2016 headwind.I think the reduction in orders is going to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly due to guidance that will be below consensus.Yes, below consensus because the sell-side is extremely hesitant to model weakening sales as evidenced by recent reports.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's <b>almost</b> like Apple is set up to fail due to the mid-cycle iPhone weakness and lack of confirmation of any meaningful improvement in Apple 's supply chain .  (Uncertainty) </span>While many of the analysts are backing up their analysis, the sentiment has been underwhelming.In some cases, stock prices can be a good leading indicator.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analog Devices ( NASDAQ : ADI ) is expected to report earnings on November 24th ( tomorrow from the time of writing ) , and quite frankly , analysts are anticipating a cut in guidance for next quarter , which corresponds to weakening mix of iPhone 6S/6S + <b>variants</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>It will be easier to ascertain global mix as opposed to the US mix following Analog's guide.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> Analog does come in with a weak guide , we have even more evidence from the Apple supply chain that things are in fact worsening .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's pretty bad and quite frankly Tim Cook has lamented about analysts in the past.He even openly declared that he flat out disagrees with the financial models of analysts on the prior conference call.Despite the flamboyant gesturing made by the CEO, no one is buying his tune this year with the exception of the retail crowd.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , either the top 100 holders of Apple are flat out stupid , or <b>maybe</b> they caught a whiff of what is likely to happen next year .  (Uncertainty) </span>My guess?They're getting flashbacks of 2012, and if we see a repeat of weakening sentiment in conjunction with weak results, the stock will crater.As such, I continue to maintain my hold rating.The risk-to-reward doesn't become very compelling until we see the stock floating at $100 to $105.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words , I truly believe this next quarter <b>could</b> be a back-breaker for investors , and due to that fact I 've changed my stance quite considerably .  (Uncertainty) </span>This isn't for the sake of sensationalism.In fact, I realized that at some point I would have to change my tune on Apple.I just didn't realize to what extent I would hate doing this.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
