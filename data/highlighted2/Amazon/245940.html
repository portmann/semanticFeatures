( NASDAQ : AAPL ) | Seeking Alpha UBS published a report on Friday clarifying their recent claims on ASPs and while the data only pertains to the United States , the evidence is convincing .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I still anticipate the iPhone 6C ( 4-inch ) <b>variant</b> to be a negative headwind on gross margins and pricing mix .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>believe</b> a <i>cheaper</i> device will not unlock incremental unit demand .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>This is primarily due to device cannibalization along all the pricing tiers, as a 4-inch model will not only sway high-end buyers but the low-end as well.The top 100 institutions have trimmed their Apple holdings throughout 2015 and the various concerns expressed by institutional investors have not been resolved.In other words, nobody's buying Tim's story.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Finally , the weakness in price action <b>could</b> be exacerbated if Analog Devices offers below consensus guidance for Q4 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I maintain a highly <b>cautious</b> outlook .  (Uncertainty) </span>In an article I published yesterday with regard to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), I found some fault with the UBS analyst's research when pertaining to ASPs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , in a research note released last Friday , Steve Milunovich helps to clarify the ASP dynamic for the upcoming quarter , and for the most part , the survey data is <b>somewhat</b> reassuring in that it indicates storage per unit had increased in the past quarter to offset the unit mix shift to prior generation models .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As such , there may be much <i>more</i> momentum to the pricing than I had originally <b>anticipated</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>However, I'm not exactly certain about unit growth on aggregate going into the next quarter as this data only pertains to the United States, so the data won't be reflective of China, Japan and rest of world.Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) has updated its survey findings of initial US-only iPhone 6s demand for the first 30 days and compared it to the 6 introduction a year ago.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The results confirm a <i>slower</i> uptake of iPhone 6s than of the iPhone 6 , but the associated ASP decline <b>appears</b> to be offset by increased spending on storage .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The mix of the newest iPhone models is 15-20 % <i>less</i> in that the <i>older</i> 6/6s still are 24 % of sales compared to the 5s at just 7 % a year ago .  (Surprise) </span>Average storage per device registered at 55.7GB, up 15% YoY and a new high.For the most part, the US segment will generate a flat quarter in terms of iPhone ASPs.Whether that carries over into the rest of world is a different issue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After all , the United States is n't <b>nearly</b> as price sensitive when compared to other foreign markets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When using the data from UBS I come up with a $ 720 retail price point , which is about $ 12 <i>lower</i> than UBS at $ 732 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The reason for this discrepancy is due to their inclusion of 128 GB <b>variants</b> of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus , which is not a model currently sold via Apple , Verizon ( NYSE : VZ ) or AT&T ( NYSE : T ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The only carriers offering the 128 GB <b>variation</b> of prior generation are T-Mobile ( NASDAQ : TMUS ) and Sprint ( NYSE : S ) , which collectively combine for 20 % market share of the U.S. telecom market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Therefore , I found the device mix assumptions to be a little aggressive for 6/6 + 128GB as it 's <i>more</i> likely that Sprint and T-Mobile are clearing <i>older</i> inventory and Apple 's actual sell-in of 128 GB <b>variants</b> of prior generation ended in Q1 FY 2016 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course , it 's hard to verify this , but I arrive at this <b>assumption</b> due to the lack of an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus 128GB listing on the Apple retail website .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Furthermore , the $ 720 I come up with is around $ 5 <i>lower</i> than the 2015 weighted average retail price that UBS recently published .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The prior year is <i>easier</i> to work with because ASP data is readily available .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When working off of prior year figures , I believe the retail markup is currently 7.51 % , which means Apple 's ASP from each iPhone <b>approximates</b> to $ 666.01 .  (Uncertainty) </span>This amounts to a $4.53 reduction in ASP from prior year from just the United States alone.That's a .68% reduction in pricing from prior year which indicates that storage upgrades offset the impact from prior generation unit mix.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The degree to which it helped relieve the ASP dynamic is <b>startling</b> , but I believe that the sale of a $ 400 to $ 550 <b>variant</b> ( iPhone 6C ) with current generation parts will mitigate ASPs this year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Credit Suisse believes that a lower-priced <b>variant</b> will generate 30 million unit sales over the course of FY 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When working off of those figures , my ASP drops to $ 636 ( <b>roughly</b> in-line with my prior comments ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This drop in ASP <b>assumes</b> no further incremental improvement to demand as there are plenty of <i>older</i> version models that would be cannibalized by the 6C .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , based on that unit mix $ 145.5 billion in iPhone revenue <b>seems</b> likely , which compares to $ 155.04 billion in the prior-year .  (Uncertainty) </span>For Apple to report 5% year-over-year growth (in-line) with consensus views Apple would need to generate 70 million iPhone 6C shipments totaling to 268.73 million unit shipments in FY 2016.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's 37.51 million <i>more</i> iPhone shipments than prior-year with the backdrop of weakening supply chain orders .  (Surprise) </span>Not to mention, 70 million units from iPhone 6C without the usual CY Q4 holiday season lift?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wow , I 'd have to be delusional or believe in the existence of fairy tales and dragons to buy into that model <b>assumption</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It also seems highly <b>probable</b> that consumers will buy the <i>smaller</i> screen size to avoid paying the premium for a <i>bigger</i> screen as it would appeal to Apple purists that prefer <i>smaller</i> phones .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>They still gain the features of current generation models.However, the 6C will have one drawback as it won't have force touch capability, which indicates that Apple is trying to minimize on some production cost.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The differential in sales price and costs is n't really closed with the exclusion of components and a <i>smaller</i> screen , so there will be negative impact on gross margins .  (Surprise) </span>Force touch is not a must have, and from personal experience I noticed very little difference in functionality with my 2015 MacBook Pro in comparison to my 2014 MacBook Air.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In other words , the refresh in Apple products between 2014 and 2015 inclusive of <i>better</i> processing , cam , OS and force touch will do little to convince recent buyers ( unless they 're a real diehard like me ) .  (Surprise) </span>In CY 15 Q3, the institutional weighting of Apple amongst top 100 holders declined from 2.9% to 2.6% q-o-q, according to Morgan Stanley Research.This implies a 10.33% reduction in holdings among the top 100 institutions in the span of three months.The stock cratered in response to falling institutional interest across the board, and I know some of you on Seeking Alpha have accused individual investment banking firms, but quite frankly, everyone is exiting the Apple trade with the exception of non-actively managed funds that are index weighted.Some hedge fund managers have added to their positions, but the consensus view among managers has been to sell Apple and buy other alpha-generating tech names.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Companies like Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) trade at much <i>higher</i> multiples but offer distinct opportunities that are n't as tied to hardware . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These are three names I have consistently recommended over the course of 2015 while I have had to <b>revise</b> my price target and stance on Apple on numerous occasions ( I 'll explain my thought process on that in a different article ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock has not generated alpha when compared to the S&P 500.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The weakness in performance will likely continue given the low <b>probability</b> of a meaningful sales and earnings beat for Q1 FY16 and concerns over unit demand throughout the course of FY ' 16 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Institutional investors are interpreting the weakness in orders as both a Q1 and Q2 2016 headwind.I think the reduction in orders is going to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly due to guidance that will be below consensus.Yes, below consensus because the sell-side is extremely hesitant to model weakening sales as evidenced by recent reports.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's <b>almost</b> like Apple is set up to fail due to the mid-cycle iPhone weakness and lack of confirmation of any meaningful improvement in Apple 's supply chain .  (Uncertainty) </span>While many of the analysts are backing up their analysis, the sentiment has been underwhelming.In some cases, stock prices can be a good leading indicator.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Analog Devices ( NASDAQ : ADI ) is expected to report earnings on November 24th ( tomorrow from the time of writing ) , and quite frankly , analysts are anticipating a cut in guidance for next quarter , which corresponds to weakening mix of iPhone 6S/6S + <b>variants</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It will be <i>easier</i> to ascertain global mix as opposed to the US mix following Analog 's guide .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Assuming</b> Analog does come in with a weak guide , we have even <i>more</i> evidence from the Apple supply chain that things are in fact worsening .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That's pretty bad and quite frankly Tim Cook has lamented about analysts in the past.He even openly declared that he flat out disagrees with the financial models of analysts on the prior conference call.Despite the flamboyant gesturing made by the CEO, no one is buying his tune this year with the exception of the retail crowd.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now , either the top 100 holders of Apple are flat out stupid , or <b>maybe</b> they caught a whiff of what is likely to happen next year .  (Uncertainty) </span>My guess?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They 're getting flashbacks of 2012 , and if we see a repeat of weakening sentiment in conjunction with weak results , the stock will crater .  (Uncertainty) </span>As such, I continue to maintain my hold rating.The risk-to-reward doesn't become very compelling until we see the stock floating at $100 to $105.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other words , I truly believe this next quarter <b>could</b> be a back-breaker for investors , and due to that fact I 've changed my stance quite considerably .  (Uncertainty) </span>This isn't for the sake of sensationalism.In fact, I realized that at some point I would have to change my tune on Apple.I just didn't realize to what extent I would hate doing this.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
