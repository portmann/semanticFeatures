class='textDiv'>Why Leasing A Smartphone is a Dumb Move Frugal Rules Posted on November by John Schmoll in Frugal Living Money Management Ive written in the past about how we used to enslave tether ourselves to Verizon each month At nearly per month in payments we were hemorrhaging cash we couldve put to far better use We were like countless others who thought getting the latest iPhone for my wife at least Im an Android guy for just was a great deal The phone itself sells for something like or so thats got to be a deal right In one of the many hand palm moments of my life I failed to look at the fact we were really just agreeing to finance our phones over the course of two years Many of the big players in the space are killing twoyear contracts Thats great to seeon one hand On the other hand its not because they are still accomplishing the same thing in a different way through leasing Leasing a smartphone has replaced the twoyear contract in some instances and in nearly every circumstance thats going to continue to cost you in the long run Verizon ATT Apple you name it they know what we want They know we love technology and we want new technology yesterday Smartphones are no different I like me a good smartphone Who doesnt A Consumer Intelligence Research Partners survey revealed that million iPhones were in use in the US as of March so I know Im not alone I love that I can be virtually anywhere and do pretty much anything I want To say a smartphone is a phone is a bit of an oxymoron really Think Im wrong Ask yourself how much time you spend talking on said smartphone If youre like me its very little Rather its a minicomputer in the palm of your hands I dont know how Id live without one especially with our business and the sites I run Anyway the big boys count on us not doing simple math when we go to make purchasing decisions When we give up the simple math we guarantee ourselves being on the losing end Its just that simple That being said lets take a look at what leasing a smartphone from Verizon will really cost you in the long run Lets say youre an iPhone fan and want the latest and greatest model Below are the costs for Verizons midlevel plan iPhone but you lease it for months This comes to per month GB data with unlimited talk and text per month Right now youre at per month before tax If you live in a high tax state like Nebraska our cell taxes are nearly per month youll be paying per month It doesnt stop there What happens if you dent or lose your phone Youre on the hook not Verizon to cover that cost So you decide youd rather not carry that risk and want the insurance coverage That adds another to the equation bringing you to per month Over the course of two years that comes out to The traditional carriers also promote the flexibility of these plans So if a new iPhone is released a year after you get your phone you have the flexibility to upgrade to that new phone However you must pay off the original phone or trade it in assuming its in good working order and start another cycle of monthly payments That doesnt sound like flexibility to me it sounds like a neverending treadmill of paymentsfor a phone It truly is the payment mentality at its finest There is one main reason behind the moves by the major carriers Its the nocontract movement started by the likes of Republic Wireless Straight Talk and others They have brought true flexibility which is better for consumers How does a plan at Republic Wireless compare to the at Verizon above Quite well in my opinion Lets say you want the top of the line phone Republic Wireless offers the Moto X second generation That runs currently The highest plan Republic Wireless offers is GB which runs per month Over the course of two years that would amount to or a savings of Thats good but you can do far better If youre on WiFi most of the time like we are then you can get their base plan at per month They also pay you back for data you dont use each month which only sweetens the deal In fact the Republic Wireless site says an average bill for a user is just under per month Thats not to say you have to choose Republic Wireless to save money by any means There are many cheap cell phone plans to choose from and many of them around per month The plan we have at Cricket for example is per month That saves us per month over what we were paying at Verizon The device payment plans the big carriers offer are misleading They dont provide flexibility In reality they shackle you to them in a slightly longer chain The solution to that problem is buying your own unlocked phone to break that chain Admittedly this can be expensive especially when youre used to financing your phones Dont let the sticker price scare you You will still save good money in the longrun by going this route vs leasing a smartphone You can buy unlocked cell phones at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Ebay and many other places This gives you the control not the carrier to come and go when you want and not have to worry about making a monthly payment for a smartphone which is true flexibility How much do you pay for your monthly cell bill Why do you think so many of us fail to do simple math when thinking through things like a cell phone Is having new technology all the time worth the added expense Im the founder of Frugal Rules a Dad husband and

agree with that last paragraph When I was comparing plans in I noticed that even if I purchased my phone outright the major carriers still wanted to charge me a monthly line fee ranging from on top of the plan fee It didnt make any sense I feel like they will do anything to get that extra money out of you no matter what you do Perhaps it has changed since then I sure hope so because Im ready to find a cheaper alternative Thats just the thing Nicole Im not talking about staying with a major carrier Im talking about going with a nocontract alternative thats not with any of the major carriers Most of the alternatives are per month You can bring a phone to most of them and not get hit with a nasty fee They can either be a new phone or a refurbished one just so long as it works with their specific network I really dont understand needing to have the newest and shiniest tech Usually something a bit older will do the same job for a fraction of the cost Weve been with Verizon but are getting ready to switch to Cricket I wish we could just keep our old phones but were going with very moderately priced Androids that will be on par with the two year old models we bought last year Good move thats who we moved to You should check into if your current phones will work on their network Both my wifes my old phones worked on the Cricket network so we just needed to change out the SIM cards and we were good to go We have been with Verizon long enough that we have negotiated our monthly phone bill to about the price of Republic per user I have frequently thought about switching but I always get concerned with the unknown transfer costs like lost connectivity and unplanned downtime I live in an area that has poor cell coverage as it is and I would be afraid of losing anymore
