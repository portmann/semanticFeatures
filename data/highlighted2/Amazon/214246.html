( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Oct. 22 , 2015 4:24 PM ET | About : Amazon.com , Inc. ( AMZN ) , Includes : CSCO , EMC , FB , GOOG , GOOGL , NFLX , ORCL by : Thomas Pound Given Dell 's upcoming buyout of EMC , I 'm reflecting on what happened to the `` Four Horsemen of The Internet . '' If one studies history, future mistakes can be avoided.This is why one needs to avoid a specific member of the FANG club.If you own <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , get out now before it meets the same fate as Sun Microsystems . A brief history lesson will tell you why.I recently read an article by Matt Krantz, " Another 'Horseman of the Internet' loses its head ."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In it , Krantz outlines the perils if one had invested in Oracle ( NYSE : ORCL ) , Cisco ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) , EMC ( NYSE : EMC ) , and Sun Microsystems in 1999 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The reason the article was written is Dell announced it's buying EMC for $70 billion, marking the second (along with Sun Micro) of these companies to be bought out.I'm not sure what Krantz's purpose is.In the treatise, he states, "Three of the four Internet horsemen have underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 since the beginning of 1999.Oracle is the only member of the horsemen that has beaten the S&P 500."<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With that in mind , Krantz says <i>earlier</i> , `` Investors can only <b>wonder</b> if the current ` FANG ' favorites will meet a similar fate . ''  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It 's generally accepted by most media outlets that `` FANG '' is an acronym for Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and Alphabet ( aka Google ) ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one accepts Krantz 's premise where one bought these four Internet giants and held them forever ( ala Warren Buffett ) , then the divergent results Krantz cites were real .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>assumes</b> of course that someone who never studies fundamentals is involved in this process .  (Uncertainty) </span>Below is an earnings chart for Sun Micro based on its reports to the SEC: As one can see, Sun Micro was pretty much a dog beginning in 2001 and stayed that way until it was bought out by Oracle in 2010.The question then becomes, "Would any serious investor try to make money in a company that can't make money for itself?"The S&P 500, as a methodology doesn't seem to think so.From the S&P 500's methodology paper , we have, "The sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters' as reported earnings should be positive as should the most recent quarter."That is one of the criteria for index inclusion for a large-cap index.What does this mean?This means using current methodologies, Sun Micro should have been dropped when earnings hit negative territory, and certainly should have been dropped when it announced negative earnings for the trailing 12 months and the first quarter for the fiscal year in mid November 2001.This is the part of what one does not understand about the S&P 500 as an index - it is not a static blob of stocks that never change.According to Standard & Poor's, the average capitalized turnover for the S&P 500 (1999-2014) is 4.35% annually.That means a full 50% of the index changed since 1999.Wouldn't a retail investor do the same during that period?The premise that no changes should occur in an investor's portfolio is poor investing and needs to stop.Even Warren Buffett, famous for holding stocks forever, sells off holdings when he no longer feels they fit his methodology.Recently Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) sold its holdings in Phillips (NYSE: PSX ) and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE: NOV ), so even the most loyal investor is willing to sell holdings when necessary.It's November 15, 2001, and Sun Micro has just announced its most recent earnings, and for the second consecutive quarter, it has been a losing three months.On top of that, Sun Micro has been losing money for the past year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Our astute investor looks at their portfolio and sees the following adjusted returns since the beginning of 1999 : At this point , it <b>appears</b> that while our investor has been losing money , and they would have fared <i>better</i> in the overall technology index , there is no significant difference from the S&P 500 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So let 's <b>assume</b> that our reasonably astute investor decided to sell the dog Sun Micro on November 15 , 2001 , and invest the proceeds in the remaining holdings that they still had .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is how they would have done since November 16, 2001, as of October 16, 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All returns <b>assume</b> reinvested dividends .  (Uncertainty) </span>As one can see, the returns are fairly comparable, if one, like the S&P 500, is willing to make changes based on negative earnings.Even Krantz in 2003 acknowledged that things did not look good for Sun Micro, so why not make changes?The fact that Oracle is the only stock that outperformed the market becomes irrelevant.As a whole, the portfolio did earn a decent return compared to the various market indices, and that is all that matters.I'm willing to admit this analysis even provides an argument for investing in index funds or ETFs and calling it a day.Today 's four-pack of Internet giants , also known as FANG , are Facebook , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Netflix and Alphabet . As recently as October 19, these companies are discussed together as potential candidates for a different buy and hold strategy.These are the earnings per share for the most recent quarters for each corporation : Clearly , if one wants to use the anecdotal lesson of the past , one should avoid <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> like a virus . It certainly should not pass muster for initial consideration.The reasons are : It 's difficult to even place a valuation on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Given that its recent 12-month earnings per share are a loss of $0.40, there is no fair way to evaluate a future price for the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if one wanted to use the price-to-sales ratio as a multiplier , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> with its 29 % growth rate <b>might</b> be worth a projected $ 556 , which is just under its current $ 560 price tag . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That <b>assumes</b> , though , that a P/S ratio of 2.1 is warranted , which is 24 % <i>higher</i> than the market average of 1.7 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If one wants to be <i>more</i> conservative , and use the S&P 500 's average , then a fair price is <i>more</i> like $ 450 .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has not had consecutive fiscal years with positive earnings since 2011 . Think about that for a minute.It has been four years since Jeff Bezos' company has posted positive earnings in back-to-back fiscal years.Heck, it can't even post positive earnings for consecutive quarters.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Compare this to Facebook , Netflix and Alphabet where earnings have remained positive for every available fiscal year in the last 10 years , with FB and GOOGL showing the <i>stronger</i> earnings persistence .  (Surprise) </span>So far, the growth rates for Facebook (78.90% 5-year), Netflix (16.89% 5-year) and Alphabet (14.70% 5-year) are positive.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because the remaining companies have at least posted positive earnings growth , it 's <b>possible</b> to calculate a future value for each company , albeit , that is not the focus here .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The current trend is that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's earnings are getting <i>worse</i> , not better . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>That alone should tell one to simply avoid this company as a potential dumpster fire.Suze Orman was right, "if a company cannot make money for itself, how is it going to make money for you?"Should you trust <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to make you money ? The answer is no.History tells us to avoid headless horsemen and toothless FANGs.If you own <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , sell it . If not, don't buy.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Find <i>better</i> opportunities elsewhere .
