One major challenge was getting TV networks, movie studios and other content providers to sell their content to Netflix.Over time, networks have had to balance their need for revenues in a tough market with the strong desire to remain in full control of their content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They have tried selling it themselves ( either directly or through Hulu , for example ) , but Netflix has been able to increase its market share ( and thus ability to pay ) , making it <i>harder</i> and <i>harder</i> to say no .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As media companies such as Disney ( NYSE : DIS ) and Viacom ( NASDAQ : VIA ) ( VIB ) continue to fight low margins , they are having a <i>harder</i> time saying no to Netflix .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix faced severe criticism and <b>doubts</b> when it started pouring significant cash into producing original content , but I do think it had no other choice .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First off , owning rights to Disney 's content or to AMC 's `` The Walking Dead '' is great , but it 's hard to promote that content when promoting Netflix , knowing that a few months or years later , that content <b>might</b> no longer be part of the package .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Also , in a world where users can search for content <i>more</i> efficiently , most of these shows will be <b>possible</b> to access through many different services , making it <i>harder</i> to justify paying for that Netflix subscription .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>House of Cards and Orange is the New Black is recognized as Netflix content, raising the service's profile but also giving compelling reasons to sign up.I personally think there are two main reasons why Netflix is a buy at these levels.#1 - The company currently has over 69 million members around the world, including 42 million in the US.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I strongly <b>believe</b> that over time , Netflix can reach 80-85 million members in the US and achieve comparable penetration in much of the rest of the world .  (Uncertainty) </span>That would represent hundreds of millions of members.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yes , in many markets that will require much <i>lower</i> pricing , but over time , I think international penetration and margins will ( slowly ) move towards what Netflix is currently seeing in the US and Canada .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix is racing to be available around the world as quickly as <b>possible</b> which is exactly what needs to be done .  (Uncertainty) </span>#2 - Within a few years, Netflix will be able to gain significant pricing power over both content suppliers and members.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As Netflix is becoming the only `` truly global '' player , it will be able to buy premium content all around the world and rebroadcast it <i>more</i> efficiently than anyone else ( thus , being able to pay <i>more</i> ) , which will mean content providers will be looking to Netflix as the `` main '' buyer of content .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix will also be able to ask for <i>more</i> conditions , including exclusive rights , international distribution , etc. .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the other side , while there was once outrage when Netflix discussed price increases , consumers seem to be <i>more</i> reluctant to cancel their subscription , and so far , the increases have been done through the introduction of tier pricing .  (Surprise) </span>If done correctly, Netflix should be able to increase its revenue/user in each market over time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given that much of the user growth will happen in <i>lower</i> priced countries , it will take <i>more</i> time for that trend to occur for the entire company .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix is increasingly becoming the one dominant, high-quality streaming player.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this new world dominated by `` winner take all '' markets ( Uber ( <b>Pending</b> : UBER ) , Airbnb ( <b>Pending</b> : AIRB ) , Alphabet , Facebook , etc. ) , Netflix can become to online video streaming what Uber will become to the global taxi/transport industry - the one truly global player that sits between the consumers and producers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Through original content, Netflix will be able to offer packages at a minimal amount in local markets in order to gain market share that will grow in value over time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I strongly <b>believe</b> that the market , despite its high P/E ratio for Netflix , is not correctly pricing in the long-term growth that Netflix will generate over the next 5-10 years .
