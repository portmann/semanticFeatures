content providers NFLX has been right to invest in original content and needs to do a lot more Ive been a believer in Netflix NASDAQ NFLX for a long time but I think the stock might be about to experience a new period of growth as it continues to gain power in its pricing with both consumers and content producers As many of you know I have been doing my tech investing around my ecosystem belief and Netflix has been able to position itself very well within the existing platforms which are as a reminder Apple NASDAQ AAPL Facebook NASDAQ FB Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Thats key when you consider the increasing leverage that these players are able to have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Primes content for example is not available through the Apple TV and Googles Chromecast which will limit its longterm potential One major challenge was getting TV networks movie studios and other content providers to sell their content to Netflix Over time networks have had to balance their need for revenues in a tough market with the strong desire to remain in full control of their content They have tried selling it themselves either directly or through Hulu for example but Netflix has been able to increase its market share and thus ability to pay making it harder and harder to say no As media companies such as Disney NYSE DIS and Viacom NASDAQ VIA VIB continue to fight low margins they are having a harder time saying no to Netflix Netflix faced severe criticism and doubts when it started pouring significant cash into producing original content but I do think it had no other choice First off owning rights to Disneys content or to AMCs The Walking Dead is great but its hard to promote that content when promoting Netflix knowing that a few months or years later that content might no longer be part of the package Also in a world where users can search for content more efficiently most of these shows will be possible to access through many different services making it harder to justify paying for that Netflix subscription House of Cards and Orange is the New Black is recognized as Netflix content raising the services profile but also giving compelling reasons to sign up I personally think there are two main reasons why Netflix is a buy at these levels The company currently has over million members around the world including million in the US I strongly believe that over time Netflix can reach million members in the US and achieve comparable penetration in much of the rest of the world That would represent hundreds of millions of members Yes in many markets that will require much lower pricing but over time I think international penetration and margins will slowly move towards what Netflix is currently seeing in the US and Canada Netflix is racing to be available around the world as quickly as possible which is exactly what needs to be done Within a few years Netflix will be able to gain significant pricing power over both content suppliers and members As Netflix is becoming the only truly global player it will be able to buy premium content all around the world and rebroadcast it more efficiently than anyone else thus being able to pay more which will mean content providers will be looking to Netflix as the main buyer of content Netflix will also be able to ask for more conditions including exclusive rights international distribution etc On the other side while there was once outrage when Netflix discussed price increases consumers seem to be more reluctant to cancel their subscription and so far the increases have been done through the introduction of tier pricing If done correctly Netflix should be able to increase its revenueuser in each market over time Given that much of the user growth will happen in lower priced countries it will take more time for that trend to occur for the entire company Netflix is increasingly becoming the one dominant highquality streaming player In this new world dominated by winner take all markets Uber Pending UBER Airbnb Pending AIRB Alphabet Facebook etc Netflix can become to online video streaming what Uber will become to the global taxitransport industry the one truly global player that sits between the consumers and producers Through original content Netflix will be able to offer packages at a minimal amount in local markets in order to gain market share that will grow in value over time I strongly believe that the market despite its high PE ratio for Netflix is not correctly pricing in the longterm growth that Netflix will generate over the next years We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
