(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>We recently wrote on why we feel the traditional package delivery market in the US is prime for disruption .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Specifically , we detailed how portions of United Parcel Service 's ( NYSE : UPS ) business are at-risk as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) develops its own delivery system and the sharing economy provides a <i>more</i> efficient and <i>quicker</i> method for B2C intra-metro deliveries . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Recent news suggests that this disruption <b>may</b> happen <i>sooner</i> than we initially expected .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is <b>apparently</b> in talks to lease 20 Boeing 767 jets for its own air-cargo business . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This comes on top of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> purchasing thousands of truck trailers to transport goods across the country a few weeks ago , announcing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Air ( drone delivery ) just a few days ago , and rolling out <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Flex ( gig-economy-based intra-metro delivery system ) in <i>more</i> than 10 metro areas throughout 2015 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It is becoming increasingly clear that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> plans to flesh out its own delivery system independent of UPS . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Considering the wealth of catalysts in the past few weeks , we <b>believe</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's delivery system is positioned to make significant strides in 2016 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>According to one cargo industry source , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> `` expects to make a decision to go beyond the trial run and pull the trigger on a <i>larger</i> air cargo operation by the end of January '' . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> or <i>less</i> , it looks like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will launch quasi-full-scale air cargo operations by February 2016 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This would make sense to us , and we think that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to squeeze UPS out of its delivery process at an accelerated rate throughout 2016 . We think <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's delivery system will use a combination of Amazon-branded trailer trucks and airplanes to transport goods to and fro fulfillment centers and sortation centers , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Flex drivers to transport goods the final leg ( to the customer 's door ) . In essence , we see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's delivery system being a hybrid of the traditional delivery system for intra-state cargo transport and a gig-economy-based delivery system for intra-metro package delivery . The infrastructure is largely there to support this sort of delivery to a significant portion of the US population , but some gaps in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current infrastructure create holes in the final leg of delivery in some regions . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has an extensive network of fulfillment centers throughout the United States , and Piper Jaffray estimates that an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> fulfillment center is within 20 miles of 31 % of the US population . While this is a strong network, it does leave some big blank spaces in the delivery process, namely all of Middle America.The <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Flex driver network will not support delivery of packages in states without a fulfillment center , so the final leg for rural deliveries is still something <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has to figure out . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We think the most viable option for filling in these blank spaces is using <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> trucks , but regardless of which route <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> takes , we do strongly <b>believe</b> , given the company 's recent moves , that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will figure out how to get goods to states like Montana and Iowa without the assitance of UPS . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>At the current moment , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's extensive fulfillment and sortation center infrastructure in the United States gives the company leverage in the initial steps of creating its own delivery system , especially in dense , metro markets . Beyond the infrastructure and capability , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is strongly motivated to develop its own delivery system . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> needs to get a handle on its shipping costs as the company is scantily and erratically profitable . According to SA, leasing a Boeing 767F costs between $600K-$650K/month, while leasing a converted freighter jet costs $300-$325K/month.Going with the top-end in each range , leasing 20 freighter jets would cost <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> $ 78 million per year , while leasing 20 Boeing 767Fs would cost $ 156 million per year . These are lease costs only and exclude fuel, labor, and other costs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even if you throw <i>more</i> jets in there and add up all the labor and fuel costs , we do not see this total cost coming anywhere close to eclipsing the $ 8.7 billion <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> spent on shipping last year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The motivations extend beyond just saving on long-term shipping costs.Two Christmases ago , UPS 's inability to keep up with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after December 25 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This cost <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> some money in the form of $ 20 gift cards , but <i>more</i> deeply , it affected <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's reputation ( late Christmas gifts are never a good thing ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>A reputation hit at the hands of UPS likely inspired CEO Jeff Bezos to make creating an independent delivery system a priority.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As a result , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>apparently</b> began running an air cargo trial out of Wilmington , Ohio . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Now , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has ( or will soon have ) trailer trucks , planes , drivers , and drones at its disposal . It is no secret that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is leading the e-commerce shift , so losing the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> business will hurt UPS both now and in the long-term as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> retail continues to grow . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although we think it unlikely to happen any time soon , the threat of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> becoming a direct competitor with UPS for third-party e-commerce delivery is a <b>possibility</b> considering <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's path with AWS . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>All things considered , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> leasing 20 planes is a big deal for UPS . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>UPS will lose <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> business at some point in time , and we <b>believe</b> that a large portion of this loss will happen in 2016 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The current valuation does not account for this lost business and the potential longer-running threat that the gig economy and drones pose , so we reaffirm our short position on the stock and <b>believe</b> 2016 will present several headwinds .
