with AWS We recently wrote on why we feel the traditional package delivery market in the US is prime for disruption Specifically we detailed how portions of United Parcel Services NYSE UPS business are atrisk as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN develops its own delivery system and the sharing economy provides a more efficient and quicker method for BC intrametro deliveries Recent news suggests that this disruption may happen sooner than we initially expected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is apparently in talks to lease Boeing jets for its own aircargo business This comes on top of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>purchasing thousands of truck trailers to transport goods across the country a few weeks ago announcing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Air drone delivery just a few days ago and rolling out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex gigeconomybased intrametro delivery system in more than metro areas throughout It is becoming increasingly clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>plans to flesh out its own delivery system independent of UPS Considering the wealth of catalysts in the past few weeks we believe that Amazons delivery system is positioned to make significant strides in According to one cargo industry source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>expects to make a decision to go beyond the trial run and pull the trigger on a larger air cargo operation by the end of January More or less it looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will launch quasifullscale air cargo operations by February This would make sense to us and we think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will continue to squeeze UPS out of its delivery process at an accelerated rate throughout We think Amazons delivery system will use a combination of Amazonbranded trailer trucks and airplanes to transport goods to and fro fulfillment centers and sortation centers and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex drivers to transport goods the final leg to the customers door In essence we see Amazons delivery system being a hybrid of the traditional delivery system for intrastate cargo transport and a gigeconomybased delivery system for intrametro package delivery The infrastructure is largely there to support this sort of delivery to a significant portion of the US population but some gaps in Amazons current infrastructure create holes in the final leg of delivery in some regions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has an extensive network of fulfillment centers throughout the United States and Piper Jaffray estimates that an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>fulfillment center is within miles of of the US population While this is a strong network it does leave some big blank spaces in the delivery process namely all of Middle America The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex driver network will not support delivery of packages in states without a fulfillment center so the final leg for rural deliveries is still something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has to figure out We think the most viable option for filling in these blank spaces is using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>trucks but regardless of which route <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>takes we do strongly believe given the companys recent moves that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will figure out how to get goods to states like Montana and Iowa without the assitance of UPS At the current moment Amazons extensive fulfillment and sortation center infrastructure in the United States gives the company leverage in the initial steps of creating its own delivery system especially in dense metro markets Beyond the infrastructure and capability <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is strongly motivated to develop its own delivery system <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>needs to get a handle on its shipping costs as the company is scantily and erratically profitable According to SA leasing a Boeing F costs between KKmonth while leasing a converted freighter jet costs Kmonth Going with the topend in each range leasing freighter jets would cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>million per year while leasing Boeing Fs would cost million per year These are lease costs only and exclude fuel labor and other costs Even if you throw more jets in there and add up all the labor and fuel costs we do not see this total cost coming anywhere close to eclipsing the billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>spent on shipping last year The motivations extend beyond just saving on longterm shipping costs Two Christmases ago UPSs inability to keep up with Amazons holiday orders led many Christmas gifts to arrive after December This cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>some money in the form of gift cards but more deeply it affected Amazons reputation late Christmas gifts are never a good thing A reputation hit at the hands of UPS likely inspired CEO Jeff Bezos to make creating an independent delivery system a priority As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>apparently began running an air cargo trial out of Wilmington Ohio Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has or will soon have trailer trucks planes drivers and drones at its disposal It is no secret that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is leading the ecommerce shift so losing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business will hurt UPS both now and in the longterm as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>retail continues to grow Although we think it unlikely to happen any time soon the threat of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>becoming a direct competitor with UPS for thirdparty ecommerce delivery is a possibility considering Amazons path with AWS All things considered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>leasing planes is a big deal for UPS UPS will lose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business at some point in time and we believe that a large portion of this loss will happen in The current valuation does not account for this lost business and the potential longerrunning threat that the gig economy and drones pose so we reaffirm our short position on the stock and
