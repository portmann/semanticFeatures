( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is switching to paying authors based off pages read rather than copies downloaded . The switch should produce substantial increases in average quality of new content.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) recently delivered some big news about the way they are going to pay artists for e-books . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The change <b>may</b> seem trivial to people that are not involved in the publication business , but this is a big deal for the quality of work that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be able to offer readers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Enhancing the quality of the offerings is a big deal for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because it makes their services that much <i>more</i> attractive to readers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going to pay self-published authors on the e-book platform based off `` pages read '' rather than `` copies downloaded '' . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is an excellent development for <b>almost</b> everyone involved .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When the system works <i>better</i> , it is a bullish factor for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'll grant <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> seems to have their hands in <b>almost</b> everything and does n't have a great track record on actually turning profits , but they do know how to take market share . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For investors to understand why I <b>believe</b> this change will drive substantial increases in the use of their platform , they need to understand the incentives from each point of view .  (Uncertainty) </span>I 'm a frequent customer at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . I have <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and I 've never had any issues with it . When I need to make a unique or large purchase ( other than food ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the first place I go to shop . When it comes to books though, I generally don't trust self-published authors.Some will be good, some will be bad, and all will have incentives to sell their product.It reminds me of commentary made by the management of Buzzfeed in an interview from some time ago.Trying to find the interview wasn't a great experience, as including "Buzzfeed" in the search ruins the results.The premise was that around 75% of the time spent on a piece would be designing a great title, everything beyond that was no longer necessary to gain page views.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While that premise is true from the perspective of displaying ads , the resulting experience for the reader is <i>less</i> than ideal .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There are two kinds of writers , if I <b>may</b> be so blunt .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are writers that are only seeking page views and there are writers that want to communicate information to readers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The problem is that an expert at seeking page views will generate <i>more</i> page views and thus this kind of author generates <i>more</i> of the impressions for the customer .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let 's <b>assume</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> intends to pay out the same amount of money to authors as they paid before , but the new system is used to allocate payment . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The writer that is only seeking page views and brilliant at generating a title would succeed under the `` Buzzfeed '' system , but they would fail <b>horribly</b> under <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's new system because their audience is not reading enough to trigger substantial payments . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On the other hand an author that is providing material the reader was seeking will find they get substantially <i>more</i> income than before because <i>more</i> of the people that try their book will continue to read it .  (Surprise) </span>In effect, each reader is voting on which author they want to pay by continuing to read the content.In a system with an enormous pool of readers and authors it can be difficult for an author to stand out, and that case is compounded if many of the readers find themselves subject to "clickbait".<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When the `` Buzzfeed '' writing style is <i>less</i> successful , there should be <i>less</i> of it .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When there is <i>less</i> of it , readers can locate quality material <i>more</i> rapidly .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That increases their interest in the service because of a <i>better</i> experience and it increases the incentive for the talented author to focus on continuing to deliver quality .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> benefits from this system because they are automatically having readers cast their votes , even unintentionally , on which books and which authors are worthy of payment . The previous system resulted in many votes cast for compelling titles rather than quality content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The new system should result in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> achieving <i>better</i> quality for their customers without paying <i>more</i> for content . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Effectively , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has found a way to automate the removal of their weakest authors . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe we <b>may</b> see a dramatic shift toward this method .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Readers want <i>higher</i> quality and this is an automated method toward achieving it .  (Surprise) </span>I will grant that it is still far from perfect, but this is a meaningful improvement.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> the future of the industry will shift in this direction .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As we see writers compensated based on reader engagement there will be new problems to solve as writers try to work around the system , but the economic forces <b>may</b> be overwhelming .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even niche books of high quality <b>may</b> gain meaningful compensation if they can achieve a following .  (Uncertainty) </span>The process of removing barriers from publication has dramatically increased the amount of content that can be effectively published, but this change will allow an automated method of quality control.I 'd like to see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> be exceptionally clear and forth coming in providing statistics to all interested authors . For the service to be a success, it is still vital that they recruit talented authors.It is hard to recruit a talented author without being clear about compensation.Source : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Automates Quality Control For Authors : Publishing Changes Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
