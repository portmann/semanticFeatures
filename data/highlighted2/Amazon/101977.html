#A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is switching to paying authors based off pages read rather than copies downloaded The switch should produce substantial increases in average quality of new content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN recently delivered some big news about the way they are going to pay artists for ebooks The change may seem trivial to people that are not involved in the publication business but this is a big deal for the quality of work that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will be able to offer readers Enhancing the quality of the offerings is a big deal for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because it makes their services that much more attractive to readers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going to pay selfpublished authors on the ebook platform based off pages read rather than copies downloaded This is an excellent development for almost everyone involved When the system works better it is a bullish factor for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Ill grant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seems to have their hands in almost everything and doesnt have a great track record on actually turning profits but they do know how to take market share For investors to understand why I believe this change will drive substantial increases in the use of their platform they need to understand the incentives from each point of view Im a frequent customer at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and Ive never had any issues with it When I need to make a unique or large purchase other than food <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the first place I go to shop When it comes to books though I generally dont trust selfpublished authors Some will be good some will be bad and all will have incentives to sell their product It reminds me of commentary made by the management of Buzzfeed in an interview from some time ago Trying to find the interview wasnt a great experience as including Buzzfeed in the search ruins the results The premise was that around of the time spent on a piece would be designing a great title everything beyond that was no longer necessary to gain page views While that premise is true from the perspective of displaying ads the resulting experience for the reader is less than ideal There are two kinds of writers if I may be so blunt There are writers that are only seeking page views and there are writers that want to communicate information to readers The problem is that an expert at seeking page views will generate more page views and thus this kind of author generates more of the impressions for the customer Lets assume <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>intends to pay out the same amount of money to authors as they paid before but the new system is used to allocate payment The writer that is only seeking page views and brilliant at generating a title would succeed under the Buzzfeed system but they would fail horribly under Amazons new system because their audience is not reading enough to trigger substantial payments On the other hand an author that is providing material the reader was seeking will find they get substantially more income than before because more of the people that try their book will continue to read it In effect each reader is voting on which author they want to pay by continuing to read the content In a system with an enormous pool of readers and authors it can be difficult for an author to stand out and that case is compounded if many of the readers find themselves subject to clickbait When the Buzzfeed writing style is less successful there should be less of it When there is less of it readers can locate quality material more rapidly That increases their interest in the service because of a better experience and it increases the incentive for the talented author to focus on continuing to deliver quality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>benefits from this system because they are automatically having readers cast their votes even unintentionally on which books and which authors are worthy of payment The previous system resulted in many votes cast for compelling titles rather than quality content The new system should result in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>achieving better quality for their customers without paying more for content Effectively <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has found a way to automate the removal of their weakest authors I believe we may see a dramatic shift toward this method Readers want higher quality and this is an automated method toward achieving it I will grant that it is still far from perfect but this is a meaningful improvement I believe the future of the industry will shift in this direction As we see writers compensated based on reader engagement there will be new problems to solve as writers try to work around the system but the economic forces may be overwhelming Even niche books of high quality may gain meaningful compensation if they can achieve a following The process of removing barriers from publication has dramatically increased the amount of content that can be effectively published but this change will allow an automated method of quality control Id like to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>be exceptionally clear and forth coming in providing statistics to all interested authors For the service to be a success it is still vital that they recruit talented authors It is hard to recruit a talented author
