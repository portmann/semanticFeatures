class='textDiv'>Amazons Strategy To Dominate Cloud Computing With AWS Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha The role low pricing has in the longterm growth outlook for AWS How products and services are adding value in a lowprice environment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN has been ramping up the pace of its growth strategy for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS as it moves from primarily servicing small and midsize businesses to enterprise companies Its existing strategy has been based upon gaining market share by slashing prices having done so for just under times since That will probably continue going forward That has some risk associated with it because of the potential it could be considered a commodity business rather than one that adds value Some of that appears to have been mitigated by its large number of announcements of new products or services added to its cloud business Rather than look at the new services in this article well look at the strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is using to gain market share while positioning itself for future price boosts once its customers are locked in With AWS possibly representing the most significant growth driver for the future with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>its important to understand the company isnt only cutting prices but adding enormous value with the numerous new products its adding to the service Investors need to know how this will eventually increase not only revenue but add significant earnings to the companys performance Its hard to see at times because it is expected to continue to cut prices in the future So far its strategy seems to be working on the market share side as some like RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>now has approximately percent of cloud computing platform sales market share If it starts to gain with the larger companies its going to move above that percentage To get an idea of whether or not AWS is not much more than a commodity service at this time when Oracle NYSE ORCL recently said it would cut prices to of AWS AWS kept prices at its current level it was still able to not only maintain share but incrementally grow it What that suggests to me is AWS is already gradually moving away from competing solely on price and is considered to have value to a growing number of its customers That said on its latest earnings call CFO Brian Olsavsky said there would still be more pricing cuts in the future That tells me <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wants to be the dominant force in the cloud segment and its going to do whatever it needs to ensure it is able to maintain that leadership far into the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has faced a similar type of battle in the retail sector as it realized it needed to compete beyond price alone So it developed and offered its premium retail subscription service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime It had incorporated and still incorporates a strategy of developing new products and services to enhance the business in order to differentiate from the large number of retail competitors it competes with The test of its value to its customers was when it increased the annual price of the service from to By then it had shown and convinced users its service was valuable enough to keep on using even with that boost in price I think its going to do something similar in its cloud business as it continues to add value by releasing an enormous number of tools and apps to use in the service What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has done so far is moved so quickly and aggressively with pricing and added products and services it has positioned itself rather quickly into the market leader If it continues to operate in that manner as it has in the past itll be difficult to compete at that level as other cloud companies are starting to look old stodgy and satisfied rather than nimble and hungry like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is In a general way as far as strategy goes were going to see a repeat of how it attacked giant retail competitors using Prime as its major tool to secure a loyal customer base willing to pay for the perceived added value of the service To the extend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can lock in cloud customers this is probably something well continue see in the future meaning eventually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will have so much value in its AWS itll be difficult for companies to decide to leave it even when the time comes for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to boost prices I think Oracle was a trial balloon to see where its existing and potential new customers were at in how they viewed AWS It appears they now consider it valuable enough to not leave or try another cloud service based on price alone It should be taken into consideration Im talking about the long term here I dont see AWS increasing prices in the near future What I see it doing is continuing to cut prices and add products and services as quickly as possible Once that value is in place thats when it will probably reverse pricing direction Even though AWS accounts for only a small portion of revenue and earnings at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the potential for future growth on the top and bottom lines is strong Looking ahead to BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis estimates AWS will generate close to billion in revenue with an operating profit of billion AWS is the biggest wild card in Amazons valuation and the reason is that the growth rates are significantly higher than the retail growth rates and the profit margins are higher and its a small part of their business today If you think about what could potentially have the biggest impact on the stock over the next five years its most likely AWS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is in this for the long term and with higher margin spread in this market its more than willing to sacrifice that for share as it can still generate a profit while it grows the business If is able to pull of taking the business to the next level with a lot more enterprise business those numbers could easily surprise to the upside in A risk the company does face because it has attracted so many startup companies is any number of them could fail over time which would put some downward pressure on its growth trajectory This is why it needs to grow out the number of enterprise customers using AWS While I dont want to gravitate toward products in services in this article one that is important in the overall picture which should help it with enterprise growth is its partnership with Accenture NYSE ACN to help companies migrate to and run their business in the AWS Cloud Chief Strategy Officer Accenture Omar Abbosh said this Cloud is increasingly becoming a starting point with our clients for their enterprise solutions Whether our clients need to innovate faster create new services or maximize value from their investments the Accenture AWS Business Group will help them get there faster with lower risk and with solutions optimized for AWS What the new group will do which includes cloud experts and professionals from both companies will primarily target enterprise businesses in order to easy the transition to AWS removing a major obstacle to change One thing I like about this is both companies are committed to the longterm view which should help AWS boost its market share in the enterprise market resulting in a more consistent and larger revenue and earnings stream over the long term Beyond helping companies move to AWS further out the group will work on developing new services to offer in market segments like Security on the AWS Cloud and Internet of Things One thing I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doing in all this as part of its productbuilding strategy with AWS is to quickly develop and release so many products while lowering prices that it makes its competitors look like those that have commodity cloud businesses Its not that there arent new products being offered by its competitors but theyre at nowhere near the aggressive pace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has launched them at So when companies start to compare cloud services there will be an increasing spread between what is offered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and what is offered by its competitors I dont think too many investors are looking at this as part of its share strategy Im convinced it is Larger companies especially will have to be given a reason to go through the headache of changing cloud services and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is quickly moving to increase the number of reasons it is well worth the effort Adding its new focus on helping the migration coupled with an ongoing array of new offerings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is likely to continue to grow market share incrementally At this time I believe the surprising performance of AWS has given the company a lot of impetus with its share price What investors should watch for is how all the announcements of new products and services play into the overall strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is incorporating to be the dominant global player in the cloud sector meaning looking for the market to look at AWS as more than a commodity service Its harder to analyze the new offerings because you never know which one may help the company differentiate and be the deciding factor in the decision to go with AWS Thats why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>continues to throw a lot of things out there to see what will stick Since we know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going to continue to do this tying that into its strategy is important in order to get a hold on its progress with AWS Also vital is the inroads it makes with enterprise businesses That is the real key to sustainable future growth for AWS and how well it does there in share will determine how consistently the company performs over the long term Its low price addedvalue strategy is helping move the
