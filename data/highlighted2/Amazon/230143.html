The Cortex-A72 is ARM Holdings' (NASDAQ: ARMH ) most advanced 64 bit CPU design, which is only just now finding its way into production processors.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>MediaTek actually considers this a tablet processor , so we 'll <b>probably</b> see <i>more</i> products using it this quarter .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>A number of processors are expected to feature the A72 design, and one of the big questions I have had is how well it stacks up against the A9 (iPhone 6s) and A9X (iPad Pro).As I pointed out in The Huawei Challenge , Huawei's next flagship phones are expected to feature the A72.All told, even with the competition from ARM processors (which always exists), I expect the reduction in Intel tablet processor shipments to boost iPad sales by about 1 million units, to about 20 million for the quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> the greatest factors in boosting sales for iPad this year have come from Apple itself .  (Uncertainty) </span>iOS 9 contains significant enhancements for iOS productivity in the form of split screen multitasking and the touchpad mode of the on screen keyboard that allows manipulating an on screen text cursor.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite Apple 's protestations against convergence , these features clearly represent movement in the direction of affording <i>greater</i> personal computing power within iOS .  (Surprise) </span>Apple clearly wants to use these enhancements to boost the appeal of iPad.As I've said in the past, the A8 processor in the iPhone 6 Plus is capable of running the full multitasking options of iOS 9.This is proven by the fact that the iPad Mini 4 runs the multitasking functions and has an A8 processor.But iPhone 6 and 6s will not get the multitasking features.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Despite the fact that iOS and Mac OS are drawing ever <i>closer</i> together , Daniel Eran Dilger had to reiterate the obvious recently , that Apple is n't going to merge iOS and Mac OS X. Yeah .  (Surprise) </span>We know.Keeping them separate is a good strategy, but that doesn't mean convergence isn't happening.It is, and will continue.iOS is Apple's most important personal computing platform.It has been for a long time.The significance of iPad Pro is that for the first time, Apple is positioning the iPad to really challenge the Windows PC, specifically the Windows PC notebook.Is iPad Pro all the way there in terms of replacing a laptop?Certainly not from the standpoint of software suites such as Adobe Creative Cloud.In choosing iOS as its fundamental platform for personal computing, Apple has had to forgo some near term software compatibility.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The advantage of iOS is that it is completely modern and does n't have to drag along any legacy compatibility baggage , which is the double-edged sword of operating systems such as Windows 10 and Mac OS X. And unlike Windows 10 , which still <b>seems</b> like a pastiche of desktop and tablet user interfaces , iOS is seamless and self consistent .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So I <b>believe</b> Apple 's strategy for iOS is to keep enhancing its capabilities until it becomes the converged , do everything personal computing platform .  (Uncertainty) </span>But Apple is creating this platform gradually so that it maintains its beautifully integrated character.iPad Pro is yet another Apple take on "the computer for the rest of us".<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such , its impact and potential for success are being vastly underestimated in my view , <b>perhaps</b> even by Apple itself .  (Uncertainty) </span>Does iPad Pro move the needle for Apple in the December quarter?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> not , based on the rumored availability .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , I expect iPad Pro to unlock considerable pent up demand for a <i>larger</i> screen iPad in much the same way that iPhone 6 did for a <i>larger</i> screen iPhone .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If I 'm correct , the indication of that will be that iPad Pro sells out very quickly , and continues to be on several weeks back order through the December quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>Obviously, this is something I'll be watching very closely.I recently rated Apple a Hold on the basis of Apple's September quarter earnings and guidance for the December quarter.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This may have been excessive caution on my part , but now that I have a fairly substantial following and audience , I feel obligated to be <b>cautious</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This <b>may</b> displease the fan base , but I 've always written for fellow Apple investors , rather than pandering to the fans .  (Uncertainty) </span>Part of that investor orientation is to demonstrate a certain equanimity often lacking in fan writers such as Dilger.I acknowledge, for instance, that not all creativity and innovation flows out of Cupertino.I acknowledge that choice of personal computing device is fundamentally a matter of personal preference.Computing devices are just tools in the end, not religious icons.My current Hold rating on Apple is based on my reading of the competitive environment and Apple's near-term prospects.iPad Pro has the potential to change those dynamics, but this remains to be seen.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
