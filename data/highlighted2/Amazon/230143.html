this quarter making it difficult to gauge sales success I expect iPad Pro to unlock pent up demand for a larger screen iPad similar to the effect of iPhone Apple NASDAQ AAPL will begin accepting orders for the iPad Pro on Wednesday The iPad Pro could prove to be Apples most important personal computing product since the first Mac Investors and the tech industry will be watching closely to see how its received in the marketplace Since its debut at Apples September event sales expectations for the iPad Pro have been rather modest too modest in my view The Digitimes report from late October pegged orders to suppliers at million units by the end of calendar Prominent Apple analyst MingChi Kuo has estimated Pro sales at about million units for the December quarter Apples own revenue guidance range for the quarter of billion yy growth didnt convey high expectations for iPad Pro either Rumors have it that the Pro will be supply constrained at about the two million unit level but its unclear whether this is the result of production issues Kuos view or the result of a selfimposed conservatism Digitimes Overall it looks like sales of iPad could come in flat to slightly lower than fiscal Q December sales of million iPads iPad unit shipments have been dropping yy at about which puts iPad sales at about million for this quarter plus iPad Pro sales of about million One of the continuing factors in the sales decline of iPad has been Intels contra revenue subsidy of its tablet processors This has resulted in low cost Windows and Android tablets coming to market at the low end of the iPad price range sub I believe this has drained off a large number of firsttime buyers who might have opted for iPad were it not for the just as good and much cheaper options of Intel NASDAQ INTC based tablets Based on Intels Q earnings report there are indications that contra revenue is starting to be withdrawn as I discussed in my recent article on Intels earnings release Intels tablet processor shipments for calendar Q fell yy to million units There was an indication based on my analysis of Intels financials that this was due to a reduction in contra revenue subsidy How much the reduction in Intel tablet processor sales will benefit Apple is difficult to gauge but the effect will probably show up this quarter Theres about a one quarter delay between Intels sale of a tablet processor and that processor getting into products at the retail level There will also be more competition from ARMbased tablets Mediatek has released a new ARM CortexA based processor which has seen its first application in the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Fire TV set top box The CortexA is ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH most advanced bit CPU design which is only just now finding its way into production processors MediaTek actually considers this a tablet processor so well probably see more products using it this quarter A number of processors are expected to feature the A design and one of the big questions I have had is how well it stacks up against the A iPhone s and AX iPad Pro As I pointed out in The Huawei Challenge Huaweis next flagship phones are expected to feature the A All told even with the competition from ARM processors which always exists I expect the reduction in Intel tablet processor shipments to boost iPad sales by about million units to about million for the quarter Perhaps the greatest factors in boosting sales for iPad this year have come from Apple itself iOS contains significant enhancements for iOS productivity in the form of split screen multitasking and the touchpad mode of the on screen keyboard that allows manipulating an on screen text cursor Despite Apples protestations against convergence these features clearly represent movement in the direction of affording greater personal computing power within iOS Apple clearly wants to use these enhancements to boost the appeal of iPad As Ive said in the past the A processor in the iPhone Plus is capable of running the full multitasking options of iOS This is proven by the fact that the iPad Mini runs the multitasking functions and has an A processor But iPhone and s will not get the multitasking features Despite the fact that iOS and Mac OS are drawing ever closer together Daniel Eran Dilger had to reiterate the obvious recently that Apple isnt going to merge iOS and Mac OS X Yeah We know Keeping them separate is a good strategy but that doesnt mean convergence isnt happening It is and will continue iOS is Apples most important personal computing platform It has been for a long time The significance of iPad Pro is that for the first time Apple is positioning the iPad to really challenge the Windows PC specifically the Windows PC notebook Is iPad Pro all the way there in terms of replacing a laptop Certainly not from the standpoint of software suites such as Adobe Creative Cloud In choosing iOS as its fundamental platform for personal computing Apple has had to forgo some near term software compatibility The advantage of iOS is that it is completely modern and doesnt have to drag along any legacy compatibility baggage which is the doubleedged sword of operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS X And unlike Windows which still seems like a pastiche of desktop and tablet user interfaces iOS is seamless and self consistent So I believe Apples strategy for iOS is to keep enhancing its capabilities until it becomes the converged do everything personal computing platform But Apple is creating this platform gradually so that it maintains its beautifully integrated character iPad Pro is yet another Apple take on the computer for the rest of us As such its impact and potential for success are being vastly underestimated in my view perhaps even by Apple itself Does iPad Pro move the needle for Apple in the December quarter Probably not based on the rumored availability However I expect iPad Pro to unlock considerable pent up demand for a larger screen iPad in much the same way that iPhone did for a larger screen iPhone If Im correct the indication of that will be that iPad Pro sells out very quickly and continues to be on several weeks back order through the December quarter Obviously this is something Ill be watching very closely I recently rated Apple a Hold on the basis of Apples September quarter earnings and guidance for the December quarter This may have been excessive caution on my part but now that I have a fairly substantial following and audience I feel obligated to be cautious This may displease the fan base but Ive always written for fellow Apple investors rather than pandering to the fans Part of that investor orientation is to demonstrate a certain equanimity often lacking in fan writers such as Dilger I acknowledge for instance that not all creativity and innovation flows out of Cupertino I acknowledge that choice of personal computing device is fundamentally a matter of personal preference Computing devices are just tools in the end not religious icons My current Hold rating on Apple is based on my reading of the competitive environment and Apples nearterm prospects iPad Pro
