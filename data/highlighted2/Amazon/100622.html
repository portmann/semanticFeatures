market discriminator for Apple Music appears to be in the creative leadership provided by the Beats team enhanced by Apple tech Apple Music debuts Tuesday amidst fierce competition from streaming music rivals such as Spotify and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Play Music Has Apple NASDAQ AAPL found the necessary discriminators that will put it ahead of the competition More importantly what is the business case for such a service Apple investors will soon learn if the Beats acquisition has been worth the billion purchase price On the surface Apple Music can be characterized as just another example of Apple playing catch up with industry leaders such as Spotify or even Google Play Music Ive often seen the criticism in comments that Apple doesnt usually take a leading role but deliberately waits for others to go first This is certainly true in the case of Apple Music The comment of Jonathan Forster head of Spotifys European operations that Apple Music validates Spotifys business model may be the understatement of the year Digital content of all types is moving to the subscription revenue model Whether that content is an app a song or a video content producers love subscriptions There are two basic reasons for this The first is that subscriptions smooth out the revenue stream for the given content Instead of an up front surge of onetime purchases theres a monthly income More importantly subscriptions with the appropriate digital rights management pretty much eliminate piracy which has been the bane of both the music and movie industries Subscriptions also provide a winwin for content producers and consumers For instance Apple Music Spotify and Google Play Music subscriptions all cost about month and offer unlimited access to the music libraries of the respective services That access includes downloads to all the users devices such as all the users iOS devices for Apple Music Apple and Google Play are touting music libraries of about million songs which is far more music than could be purchased for the same month over a human lifetime So Apple has belatedly realized that the subscription model is replacing the on line purchase model that Apple itself pioneered with iTunes Apple has typically entered new markets only after carefully reviewing the existing state of the art and coming up with something better What is it thats better about Apple Music I got the impression from Jimmy Iovines presentation at WWDC where he introduced Apple Music that he and Apples leadership are still struggling to find an answer to this question More than with any recent or past new product introduction from the iPod to Apple Watch the case for Apple Music seems shaky at best Unlike with most other new products Apple Music seems to exist because well the other guys have subscription music services so Apple needed one too The technical discriminators just arent there for the consumer Apples subscription music library is about the same size as Google Play Music The audio format and quality will be about the same as what Apple currently makes available for iTunes purchases k AAC that is supposed to be better than the standard k MP I doubt anyone will notice the difference And of course subscriptions will come with DRM that will keep music from leaking out of the subscribers set of iOS devices With Apple Music the company seems to have embarked on an interesting and perhaps not uncharacteristic strategy of pushing the technology into the background humanizing it by bringing the artists into the foreground The key elements of this strategy are the Connect service and Beats radio and music recommendations All the artists in the Music library get their own blog pages This has been compared to SoundCloud but its not quite so unlimited Connect is only open to artists who have music in the Apple Music library which means having a label or going through an Appleapproved aggregator Connect will provide artists with a means of communicating with their following and will probably be most valuable to artists who are already well known The star system isnt dead although perhaps the music labels are dying The main humanizing element is of course contributed by Beats Beats radio along with curated play lists is clearly intended to set Apple Music apart by providing an element of artistic leadership that other services lack This kind of creative leadership has always been a part of the business of music and film and still is But its always been a doubleedged sword since it depends on the acumen of the media producer in spotting a trend and identifying a hit Often there are as many misses as hits and the traditional movie studios and record labels have seen highly variable revenue as a result If the error rate of the traditional media businesses has been rather high Apple Music may provide its leadership with a technical means of reducing that error rate Apple Music will be able to provide its leaders with considerable real time feedback heretofore lacking in the traditional media businesses Apple will be able to derive realtime stats on whats popular as well as the demographics of the audience for a particular music type artist or song Likewise Beats radio will provide feedback about whos listening and where what songs resonated with listeners or how much a song was skipped The Connect service will also provide another source of feedback about the audience of artists and their popularity With Apple Music Iovine Cue et al may have created the music producers dream Now music producers wont have to guess about what works and what doesnt wont have to rely exclusively on their own intuition or tastes although these will still be the starting point Very quickly as in hours or days at most Apple Music execs will know if a particular new song or artist is making it This combination of artistic sensibility and real time feed back is probably the key discriminator provided by Apple Music What are the prospects for Apple Music as a contributor to Apples revenue Actually pretty good The Apple Music app is being built into the next iteration of iOS version which will be released a few hours in advance of Beats going live on June Ive previously estimated the worldwide iOS device population to be upwards of million If we assume an average ownership rate of devices then the target market on day one of Apple Music is about million people If sign up for the paid subscription service in the first year thats million subscribers The correlates pretty well with another estimate by Jan Dawson of Jackdaw research reported by the NY Times Dawson estimates that Apple Music could have million subscribers in two years more than double the subscriber base of million of all the other music services combined The math on this is pretty attractive million subscribers is about billionmonth in revenue Apple will pay artists about of this keeping about pretty close to the usual iTunesApp store fee Apple charges There are additional costs for server maintenance and software development but this is probably fairly high margin for Apple Using Apples overall operating margin of yields an Apple Music operating profit of about million per quarter on revenue after content expense of million per quarter Apple has been posting some huge operating profits lately about billion per quarter average in calendar So this isnt a huge uptick at the operating profit level about But its growth that adds to the bigger growth picture for Apple The bigger growth picture is almost certainly a subscription video service equivalent to Apple Music There are substantial hurdles yet to be overcome not the least of which is content availability The limited content available on services such as Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Prime demonstrate how reluctant video content creators are to participate in the subscription model But if Apple Music succeeds and I believe it will a video subscription service on similar terms wont be far behind Source Have Apple And Beats Created The Future Of The Music Business Disclosure I amwe are
