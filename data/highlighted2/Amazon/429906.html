more powerful when its Disney exclusivity deal kicks in this September Netflixs traditional TV rivals each have concocted plans to win back some of the market share being lost to streaming networks Of all of them HBO has the most wellrounded approach and a roster of intriguing onlinestreaming fare slated to roll out over the course of this year As we all know when it comes to TV Netflix NASDAQ NFLX is the pound elephant in the room Netflix has truly changed the game multiple times and now has forced its rivals to find new ways to counter them The other fact becoming abundantly clear is that Netflix is only getting more powerful The network not only has more buzzy original planning on the horizon but its acquired content is about to get a boost as well This September Netflix will become the pay TV home to the entire Disney NYSE DIS catalog and the exclusive home to all future content In case youve forgotten that includes everything from Frozen to The Avengers so yes thats a lot of content Its a million deal and marks the first time Disneys properties have gone to a nontraditional network With this new change in power Netflix has taken a major advantage over HBO NASDAQ TWX Showtime NYSE CBS and Starz NASDAQ STRZA However that doesnt mean the other networks are going to just concede In fact they each have a strategy in place to counter the streaming leader Lets start with Starz because the NetflixDisney deal impacts them the most Why Because guess which network had the Disney package prior Yep Starz which has recently overtaken Showtime in total subscribers previously had a longstanding deal with the Mouse House Starz though has a plan for the change and that involves making a bold move it wasnt fully confident in doing before The network intends to shift its original programming to air on Sunday nights Personally Im convinced one of the main reasons why Starzs original series have never seen the same widespread support as one on HBO or Showtime is because it had always aired on odd days I give Starz credit for trying something different but the idea of programming its new and important series on less watched nights like Friday and Saturday seemingly was doomed from the start Shows like Boss Magic City and Outlander are quality series but they never lived up to their full potential Outlander at least has a chance to up its viewer count when the change starts next month The network is fully aware in a headtohead fight with HBO and AMC they will likely lose however Starzs series have always been big DVR growers and at times have leapt over percent during the course of a week In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter Starz head Chris Albrecht discussed the shift Sundays are a prestige night and we feel our shows are definitely going to be very competitive not just in viewership but in the attentiongetting business on Sundays So it made sense to move And hes right Albrecht who for a time ran HBO is a smart executive and shifting his original series to Sundays while moving the networks film premieres back to Saturdays is the right move Starz has a number of Alevel prospects on the horizon including American Gods which analysts and the company believe could be their Game of Thrones This needed to be done especially as Albrecht also pointed out because not airing on Sunday cuts them out of the watercooler conversation which drives ratings Cables big night has long been Sundays and the king of that is usually HBO expect for when Walking Dead is on Speaking of HBO the network knows it has some issues to overcome as well Specifically the fact it hasnt launched a successful new drama in a while Not to take away anything from Vinyl or The Leftovers which are both underrated but the dial is not moving for those shows and it was critically acclaimed alone that got them renewed Yet HBO has a few more cards to play including the longdelayed but highly anticipated Westworld hitting this fall along with the return of Sarah Jessica Parker in the comedy Divorce HBO this week also signed pilot deals for new potential projects from Oscar winners Adam McKay and Kathryn Bigelow so the pipeline is quickly being restocked However whats really going to impact the stock is how HBOs streaming services do especially after the negative reaction to HBOs first subscription revelations earlier this year The good news is that the network has made sure shareholders know that area is still a priority HBOs streaming strategy is very clever and incorporates all of its marquee properties From a Game of Thrones aftershow that is essentially a streaming exclusive to new online content on the horizon from prized acquisitions Bill Simmons and Jon Stewart you are going to begin seeing the emphasis on streaming begin to pay off Showtime also cant be overlooked While its deals for new films have been severely cut in recent years the networks original scripted and sports programming has never been stronger For example the Showtimes signature drama series Homeland has seen a resurgence and its stable includes equally critically acclaimed fare like Masters of Sex Ray Donovan The Affair and Shameless which is being called upon for doubleduty in Like its rivals could also be stellar for the CBSowned cabler as it has the anticipated Twin Peaks revival and Purity on the horizon Purity is a big win for Showtime as the limited series starring and coproduced by Daniel Craig ignited a bidding war Showtime is just now beginning to embrace the limited series craze which has worked out well for HBO and other cable networks The channel also has a streaming presence with a standalone app and addon deals with companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>While it doesnt have the same level of upcoming webstreaming based projects as HBO it likely still will be able to draw in new subscribers based on that original content The question for all of them eventually becomes will that help them compete with Netflix The answer is essentially we will have to wait and see as it is important to keep in mind in many homes people have both Netflix and a premium subscription Still networks want to maintain an advantage over their competition and no matter the price that will never change Business relationship disclosure All opinions expressed are the authors and no compensation
