( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.NFLX will report on Tuesday.Markets will focus on domestic subscriber growth and overseas expansion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Domestic subs <b>could</b> <b>disappoint</b> to the downside and overseas expansion <b>could</b> hit EPS in 1H16 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) will report its 4Q15 earnings on Tuesday.Two things will be in focus for the quarter: First, domestic subscriber growth has been facing some challenges on the back of growing competition from other OTT providers such as YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Hulu and HBO (NYSE: TWX ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Recall that last quarter , NFLX reported a <i>weaker</i> than expected domestic subscriber number and management blamed it on the shift toward chip-based credit and debit cards that resulted in involuntary churn .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I suspect that competition is the <i>bigger</i> culprit and I believe the recent momentum seen by NFLX competitors <b>could</b> result in another miss in the domestic subscriber numbers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Second, global expansion will likely be another widely discussed topic in the quarter with NFLX's recent announcement of simultaneously entering 130 countries at CES.I see this aggressive over-expansion to be an indicator that domestic subscriber growth is weakening and the company needs international growth to offset domestic weakness.Additionally, front-loading of content costs given the aggressive expansion will drag EPS in the first half of 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That said , I remain <b>cautious</b> on NFLX shares .  (Uncertainty) </span>In my view, one way to play the OTT theme is not through distributors, but through the content owners.My preferences are Time Warner, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Lions Gate (NYSE: LGF ).Although NFLX has been outperforming the market and benefiting from the cord-cutting trend in North America , the company is seeing increased competitive pressure from GOOG , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Hulu and HBO . All have presented a challenging backdrop for NFLX to maintain its subscriber growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The migration of content to OTT is giving consumers <i>more</i> choices in addition to NFLX and I suspect that this has resulted in NFLX 's domestic subscriber churn last quarter .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>My conversation with competing OTT vendors did not suggest similar churn impact from the shift to chip-based cards , making me believe that competition is now the key <b>risk</b> to NFLX 's growth profile in North America ( see - Netflix : 2016 Outlook - Slight Chance Of Shower ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>That said, investors can expect maturing domestic subscriber growth for the quarter and further deceleration of the domestic revenue.Judging by the recent momentum seen from HBO, AMZN and Hulu, it is evident that NFLX's domestic growth will be challenged in the foreseeable future (see - Netflix: Competitive Trend Accelerating? )<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To offset the consolidated deceleration in subscribers , NFLX <b>surprised</b> the market with its announcement of overseas expansion at the CES involving 130 countries .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I think this is the clearest sign that domestic subs <b>could</b> <b>disappoint</b> to the downside and that the company needs overseas subscriber growth to offset the weak domestic growth so that the consolidated growth profile can be at least sustainable in the near term .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The issue involved with this strategy is that <i>higher</i> content costs will create a significant drag to NFLX 's earnings in the first half of 2016 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Local competing OTT service is another area where I think the market has underestimated in that NFLX content <b>may</b> not appeal to the local population .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although working with local producers is a good strategy , local producers certainly have no incentive to work with NFLX , given their existing relationship with the local OTT providers ( see - Netflix Comes Out Swinging At CES , Expect Downside <b>Risk</b> To EPS ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I remain <b>cautious</b> on NFLX .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the new OTT age, NFLX is gradually evolving into a media distributor that ultimately has little value.For the skeptics, we can simply look at how cable companies have evolved over the past 20 years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That said , investing in content owners ( <i>higher</i> pricing power ) rather than distributors ( <i>lower</i> pricing/negotiation power ) is the best way to play this trend .  (Surprise) </span>TWX, LGF and DIS are three preferred picks.</div></body></html>
