(Uncertainty) </span>But there's an interesting fact that comes out when you inspect the income statement.In the statement Microsoft divides its revenue into Product, and Service and other, categories.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Presumably</b> , Service and other includes all subscription based productivity software , as well as cloud services .  (Uncertainty) </span>It turns out that the Service and other category gross margin isn't very good at 36.5%, whereas the Product gross margin is 73%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This may say that cloud services may not be the cornucopia that has been <b>assumed</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Microsoft 's fundamental problem is how to convert the <b>roughly</b> 1.15 billion Windows users who are not on Win10 to a modern Windows platform that has an app store , can use Cortana and other advanced services , and which can be <i>more</i> effectively monetized .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft has acknowledged that Windows 10 is not going to accomplish this.Figuring out how to do this should be priority one for Microsoft.Is the problem so intractable that Microsoft has simply given up?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>seems</b> unlikely .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft management and CEO Nadella surely understand what is at stake.But it doesn't seem that they've decided on a course of action.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And Microsoft <b>might</b> not want to preview a successor to Windows 10 while still trying to increase the Win10 user base .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Any such preview would <b>probably</b> have to wait at least another year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As attractive a concept as Surface Phone is , it <b>probably</b> does n't have much leverage on the problem at this stage .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's unlikely that Surface Phone <b>could</b> sell in sufficient volume to make up the shortfall .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Nadella mentioned the development of `` new device categories '' , I really doubt there 's anything on the horizon ( Band , or Hololens , for example ) that <b>could</b> close the gap as well .  (Uncertainty) </span>It really falls to the Windows 10 successor to win over the current base of Win7 users.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Along those lines , the ugly thought occurred to me that <b>maybe</b> the reason Win10 turned out so poorly was that no one in upper management was really paying attention to it .  (Uncertainty) </span>While consumers were promised a whole new operating system, what they got was a band-aided Windows 8.It just got waved through because Microsoft was taking the Windows franchise for granted.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One could argue that <b>maybe</b> Nadella does n't need to care about Windows .  (Uncertainty) </span>The franchise is secure and Nadella is focused on the growth areas in cloud services.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is merit to that , and I might almost <b>believe</b> it , if it were n't for the importance of the smartphone ecosystems .  (Uncertainty) </span>The ecosystems of Android and iOS have become the personal computing platforms for most people's day to day activities, including a lot of professional activities.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Lumia collapse makes plausible a scenario in which Windows gradually declines over time , losing users to <i>newer</i> <i>more</i> robust mobile device ecosystems .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Windows 10 , <i>more</i> than anything , is an attempt to emulate the key features of those ecosystems : a curated app store , search based monetization , and AI driven voice response .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But the lack of a smartphone to host Win10 ( besides the now <b>dreadful</b> Lumias ) , is a major headwind to user acceptance and support from developers .  (Uncertainty) </span>The relatively small number of Windows Store apps, still well under a million by the latest estimate , is symptomatic of that lack of developer support.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't think the Windows problem is insoluble at all , but faced with a lack of clear direction from Microsoft management , investors have to simply <b>hope</b> that everything is going to work out .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I continue to rate Microsoft a hold , but it 's become a <i>more</i> <b>cautious</b> hold .
