(Surprise) </span>Despite acknowledging that Windows 10 won't achieve the goal of 1 billion users, Microsoft offered no plan for converting the over 1 billion Windows users who aren't using Win10.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) reported another quarter of y/y revenue decline (-7% to GAAP $20.614 billion), and faces a number of challenges to its operating system dominance, as well as lack of presence in smartphones.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If investors were <b>hoping</b> for some insight on these issues out of the earnings report and conference call , there was none to be had .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The focus was <b>almost</b> exclusively on cloud and productivity services .  (Uncertainty) </span>Listening to CEO Nadella, it becomes clear that he's very passionate and knowledgeable about cloud computing.I don't detect a similar passion, let alone sense of urgency, when he talks about Windows.It's as if he's simply a caretaker for some legacy software, Windows, which is dead last in his list of priorities.It was certainly dead last in his prepared remarks for the conference call .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>He waxed poetic for 1300 words on productivity software and cloud services before getting around to the <i>More</i> Personal Computing segment .  (Surprise) </span>He mentioned the 350 million monthly active devices running Windows 10, and once again touted its adoption rate as the fastest in history.He didn't acknowledge what Microsoft had acknowledged only last week, that Windows 10 would fail to reach its goal of 1 billion active devices.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> importantly , there was no real sense of urgency , either about Windows or about Windows phone .  (Surprise) </span>This, despite the continuing implosion of Windows phone revenue, down 71% y/y.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Instead , there <b>seems</b> to be a sense of <b>relief</b> in putting the Nokia fiasco behind it .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But absolutely no inkling of where Microsoft goes from here.Nadella's statements also convey that enterprise is the chief focus for Windows 10 adoption going forward.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft 's Windows 10 strategy is to `` deliver <i>more</i> value and innovation , particularly for enterprise customers . ''  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft expects to drive "increased adoption for Windows 10, particularly in the enterprise."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If this sounds familiar , this was exactly the same fall back position that Blackberry ( NASDAQ : BBRY ) tried to pursue with Blackberry 10 when it was clear that consumers were rejecting it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Of course , Microsoft has a much <i>higher</i> <b>probability</b> of success in the enterprise , but it still sounds uncomfortably as though the company is giving up on the consumer .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The emphasis on enterprise <b>seems</b> odd in light of the <i>More</i> Personal Computing ( MPC ) Segment results .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>OEM consumer licensing actually grew robustly at 27% y/y, indicating that new convertible PCs running Win10 are gaining some traction.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And that 's great , devices such as Surface Book and Surface Pro are <b>probably</b> the best solutions for mobile productivity available , and are far <i>more</i> useful than Apple 's ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) aging notebooks .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Surface revenue is up <b>almost</b> 9 % y/y .  (Uncertainty) </span>Overall, MPC revenue was down 4% y/y, dragged down by Windows Phone.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As Microsoft has shed costs associated with the Nokia acquisition , MPC operating income has grown by <b>almost</b> 60 % to $ 964 million .  (Uncertainty) </span>But this ignores the ongoing restructuring and impairment costs, which were $1.11 billion for the quarter, and booked under Corporate (negative) revenue.Obviously, if the costs associated with the Nokia restructuring had been booked under MPC, the story would have been different.I agree it doesn't really matter where the costs get booked.What does matter is what's the plan now?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 've been <b>assuming</b> that there is one , and that it involves the rumored Surface Phone , but there has been absolutely no discussion of what Microsoft does once it finishes selling ( or writing off ) the last of the Lumia phones .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It seems a glaring omission , but <b>perhaps</b> it 's just normal secrecy ahead of a new product launch .  (Uncertainty) </span>Productivity and Business Processes grew revenue 5% y/y to $6.97 billion, but operating income declined by 5% to $3 billion.Operating expenses grew due to investments in sales and infrastructure.Intelligent Cloud also grew revenue by 7% y/y to $6.71 billion, but also suffered a 17% decline in operating income to $2.19 billion.The decline in operating margin is very much driven by the intense competition Microsoft faces from the other cloud providers such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , Alphabet ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , and IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on the attention focused by analysts during the conference call on cloud services , one <b>might</b> construe that growth in cloud related services ( whether in Productivity or Cloud segments ) would just overwhelm whatever decline Microsoft faces in personal computing .  (Uncertainty) </span>But there's an interesting fact that comes out when you inspect the income statement.In the statement Microsoft divides its revenue into Product, and Service and other, categories.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Presumably</b> , Service and other includes all subscription based productivity software , as well as cloud services .  (Uncertainty) </span>It turns out that the Service and other category gross margin isn't very good at 36.5%, whereas the Product gross margin is 73%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This may say that cloud services may not be the cornucopia that has been <b>assumed</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Microsoft 's fundamental problem is how to convert the <b>roughly</b> 1.15 billion Windows users who are not on Win10 to a modern Windows platform that has an app store , can use Cortana and other advanced services , and which can be <i>more</i> effectively monetized .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft has acknowledged that Windows 10 is not going to accomplish this.Figuring out how to do this should be priority one for Microsoft.Is the problem so intractable that Microsoft has simply given up?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>seems</b> unlikely .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft management and CEO Nadella surely understand what is at stake.But it doesn't seem that they've decided on a course of action.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And Microsoft <b>might</b> not want to preview a successor to Windows 10 while still trying to increase the Win10 user base .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Any such preview would <b>probably</b> have to wait at least another year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As attractive a concept as Surface Phone is , it <b>probably</b> does n't have much leverage on the problem at this stage .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's unlikely that Surface Phone <b>could</b> sell in sufficient volume to make up the shortfall .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Nadella mentioned the development of `` new device categories '' , I really doubt there 's anything on the horizon ( Band , or Hololens , for example ) that <b>could</b> close the gap as well .  (Uncertainty) </span>It really falls to the Windows 10 successor to win over the current base of Win7 users.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Along those lines , the ugly thought occurred to me that <b>maybe</b> the reason Win10 turned out so poorly was that no one in upper management was really paying attention to it .  (Uncertainty) </span>While consumers were promised a whole new operating system, what they got was a band-aided Windows 8.It just got waved through because Microsoft was taking the Windows franchise for granted.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One could argue that <b>maybe</b> Nadella does n't need to care about Windows .  (Uncertainty) </span>The franchise is secure and Nadella is focused on the growth areas in cloud services.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is merit to that , and I might almost <b>believe</b> it , if it were n't for the importance of the smartphone ecosystems .  (Uncertainty) </span>The ecosystems of Android and iOS have become the personal computing platforms for most people's day to day activities, including a lot of professional activities.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Lumia collapse makes plausible a scenario in which Windows gradually declines over time , losing users to <i>newer</i> <i>more</i> robust mobile device ecosystems .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Windows 10 , <i>more</i> than anything , is an attempt to emulate the key features of those ecosystems : a curated app store , search based monetization , and AI driven voice response .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But the lack of a smartphone to host Win10 ( besides the now <b>dreadful</b> Lumias ) , is a major headwind to user acceptance and support from developers .  (Uncertainty) </span>The relatively small number of Windows Store apps, still well under a million by the latest estimate , is symptomatic of that lack of developer support.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't think the Windows problem is insoluble at all , but faced with a lack of clear direction from Microsoft management , investors have to simply <b>hope</b> that everything is going to work out .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I continue to rate Microsoft a hold , but it 's become a <i>more</i> <b>cautious</b> hold .
