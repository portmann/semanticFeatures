class='textDiv'>Todays Market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>And Starbucks Among Names Leading The Market Higher Seeking Alpha AMZN SBUX are both trading higher this morning and will help push the Nasdaq higher AMZNs market cap is now larger than WMTs Look for a rebound in the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite today following strong numbers from a number of tech companies and others listed on the exchange With Amazoncoms NASDAQ AMZN strong numbers last night we have now seen some amazing moves in company market values following quarterly results this earnings season The other big move came from Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL following its strong quarter and upbeat commentary and when one looks at the numbers it is quite staggering The changes in market cap are bigger than many companies and in some cases are equal to market caps of the largest publicly traded companies in certain industries The news from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and how it aligns with what we heard from others in the tech industry leads us to continue to believe tech is one of the two main pillars investors want to drive returns for their portfolios through the end of the year Expect to see the Nasdaq make another move towards the point level today on the back of strong tech earnings We have economic news today and it is as follows Seattle saw two of its largest corporate citizens report solid quarterly results and fullyear guidance after yesterdays closing bell While Amazoncom stole the headlines with their unexpected blowaway earnings Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX also had good news to report and talked about the success of their mobile payments strategy and the product mix Amazons strong EPS were fueled by the companys revenues coming in higher than expected which was due to strength in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services and Marketplaces Interestingly enough it appears that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is not only pushing top line growth with AWS but is also seeing margin expansion for the cloud unit something which is an anomaly of sorts when discussing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its historical business model With this being a potential breakout quarter and data indicating that Prime Day was a success for the company analysts are out with bullish comments and have raised their price targets once again This is partly in response to the quarter but probably has a lot more to do with the fact that the stock shot up more than in after hours trading The move pushed Amazons market cap above that of WalMart NYSE WMT which was something unthinkable only a few years ago and increased Jeff Bezos net worth by roughly billion Investors can expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to have a tailwind propelling them higher so long as AWS and Prime membership continue to grow because the margin expansion that has occurred at AWS is a real benefit to the bottom line and new Prime members help drive revenues as they typically spend times more than nonPrime members While Starbucks move after hours paled in comparison to Amazons move it was nothing to turn ones nose up to The move to share is a new alltime high for the companys shares and continues the winning streak that Starbucks has been on over the last few years While technology is most certainly benefiting the company the stores continue to be the strength with sales at stores open at least months increasing by on a global basis and individual customer transactions increasing by some million over the previous years quarter Same store sales in the Americas which includes the US rose but the company stressed that analysts should continue to use midsingle digit same store sales growth The board of directors also voted to increase the companys share repurchase program by authorizing another million shares to be added to the current program Separately the company also announced that it had entered into an agreement to expand its distribution agreement with PepsiCo NYSE PEP to enter Latin American countries as the two partners seek growth from new markets While ATT NYSE T may have missed revenue projections for the quarter the company did report EPS of which handily beat analysts expectations of share While the bottom line results are something that investors should feel good about we think that the wireless net additions figure is more important ATT reported million net additional wireless customers which blew away the million estimate and shows that TMobile US NYSE TMUS is not the only carrier which can steal away customers right now Regarding the companys purchase of DirecTV NASDAQ DTV Bloomberg is reporting that the FCC has voted to approve the deal While an official announcement has not been made this is most certainly good news for investors as it ensures ATTs ability to cover its dividend in the future and will enable both companies to better compete against the cable companies Source Todays Market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>And Starbucks Among Names Leading The
