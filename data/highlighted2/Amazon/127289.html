The move to $59/share is a new all-time high for the company's shares and continues the winning streak that Starbucks has been on over the last few years.While technology is most certainly benefiting the company, the stores continue to be the strength with sales at stores open at least 13 months increasing by 7% on a global basis and individual customer transactions increasing by some 23 million over the previous year's quarter.Same store sales in the Americas, which includes the US, rose 8% but the company stressed that analysts should continue to use mid-single digit same store sales growth.The board of directors also voted to increase the company's share repurchase program by authorizing another 50 million shares to be added to the current program.Separately, the company also announced that it had entered into an agreement to expand its distribution agreement with PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP ) to enter 10 Latin American countries as the two partners seek growth from new markets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While AT&T ( NYSE : T ) <b>may</b> have missed revenue projections for the quarter , the company did report EPS of $ 0.69 which handily beat analysts ' expectations of $ 0.63 / share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the bottom line results are something that investors should feel good about , we think that the wireless net additions figure is <i>more</i> important .  (Surprise) </span>AT&T reported 2.1 million net additional wireless customers, which blew away the 1.32 million estimate and shows that T-Mobile US (NYSE: TMUS ) is not the only carrier which can steal away customers right now.Regarding the company's purchase of DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ), Bloomberg is reporting that the FCC has voted to approve the deal.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While an official announcement has not been made , this is most certainly good news for investors as it ensures AT&T 's ability to cover its dividend in the future and will enable both companies to <i>better</i> compete against the cable companies .
