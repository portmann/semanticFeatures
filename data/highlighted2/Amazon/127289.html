(Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AMZN 's market cap is now <i>larger</i> than WMT 's .  (Surprise) </span>Look for a rebound in the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite today following strong numbers from a number of tech companies and others listed on the exchange.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With Amazon.com 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) strong numbers last night we have now seen some <b>amazing</b> moves in company market values following quarterly results this earnings season . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The other big move came from Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) following its strong quarter and upbeat commentary, and when one looks at the numbers it is quite staggering.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The changes in market cap are <i>bigger</i> than many companies and in some cases are equal to market caps of the largest publicly traded companies in certain industries !  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The news from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and how it aligns with what we heard from others in the tech industry leads us to continue to <b>believe</b> tech is one of the two main pillars investors want to drive returns for their portfolios through the end of the year . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Expect to see the Nasdaq make another move towards the 5,200 point level today on the back of strong tech earnings.We have economic news today, and it is as follows: Seattle saw two of its largest corporate citizens report solid quarterly results and full-year guidance after yesterday's closing bell.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Amazon.com stole the headlines with their <b>unexpected</b> blowaway earnings , Starbucks ( NASDAQ : SBUX ) also had good news to report and talked about the success of their mobile payments strategy and the product mix . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's strong EPS were fueled by the company 's revenues coming in <i>higher</i> than expected , which was due to strength in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services and Marketplaces . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Interestingly enough , it appears that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is not only pushing top line growth with AWS , but is also seeing margin expansion for the cloud unit ; something which is an <b>anomaly</b> of sorts when discussing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and its historical business model . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>With this being a potential breakout quarter and data indicating that Prime Day was a success for the company, analysts are out with bullish comments and have raised their price targets once again.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This is partly in response to the quarter , but <b>probably</b> has a lot <i>more</i> to do with the fact that the stock shot up <i>more</i> than 18 % in after hours trading .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The move pushed <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's market cap above that of Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , which was something unthinkable only a few years ago , and increased Jeff Bezos ' net worth by <b>roughly</b> $ 7 billion . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Investors can expect <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to have a tailwind propelling them <i>higher</i> so long as AWS and Prime membership continue to grow because the margin expansion that has occurred at AWS is a real benefit to the bottom line and new Prime members help drive revenues as they typically spend 2-4 times <i>more</i> than non-Prime members . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>While Starbucks ' 4.3 % + move after hours paled in comparison to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's move , it was nothing to turn one 's nose up to . The move to $59/share is a new all-time high for the company's shares and continues the winning streak that Starbucks has been on over the last few years.While technology is most certainly benefiting the company, the stores continue to be the strength with sales at stores open at least 13 months increasing by 7% on a global basis and individual customer transactions increasing by some 23 million over the previous year's quarter.Same store sales in the Americas, which includes the US, rose 8% but the company stressed that analysts should continue to use mid-single digit same store sales growth.The board of directors also voted to increase the company's share repurchase program by authorizing another 50 million shares to be added to the current program.Separately, the company also announced that it had entered into an agreement to expand its distribution agreement with PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP ) to enter 10 Latin American countries as the two partners seek growth from new markets.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While AT&T ( NYSE : T ) <b>may</b> have missed revenue projections for the quarter , the company did report EPS of $ 0.69 which handily beat analysts ' expectations of $ 0.63 / share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the bottom line results are something that investors should feel good about , we think that the wireless net additions figure is <i>more</i> important .  (Surprise) </span>AT&T reported 2.1 million net additional wireless customers, which blew away the 1.32 million estimate and shows that T-Mobile US (NYSE: TMUS ) is not the only carrier which can steal away customers right now.Regarding the company's purchase of DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ), Bloomberg is reporting that the FCC has voted to approve the deal.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While an official announcement has not been made , this is most certainly good news for investors as it ensures AT&T 's ability to cover its dividend in the future and will enable both companies to <i>better</i> compete against the cable companies .
