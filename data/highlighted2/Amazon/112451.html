(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix has repeatedly insisted that they will not include ads into their service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>suggest</b> that Netflix should consider adding a free tier with ads , similar to Spotify .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Online video streaming giant Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) has had significant coverage in recent years , with equal amounts of hope and <b>doubt</b> on either side .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We believe that Netflix , though unbelievably successful , <b>could</b> heighten that success by considering an addition to its business model .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that Netflix should switch its model toward a dual-tiered model , similar to the model offered by music streaming service Spotify .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix should offer a free tier and a premium tier to its users.The free tier would give a user full access to the Netflix library while introducing ads during playback.The premium tier would be the exact same service that current Netflix subscribers receive.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that Netflix should adopt such a model for two reasons .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , we <b>believe</b> that the introduction of a Netflix free-tier would transform the video streaming market in Netflix 's favor .  (Uncertainty) </span>Currently , Netflix 's primary competitors in the streaming market are Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . Neither of the two services offer free unlimited access to their library.Hulu offers very limited access to their streaming catalog to free users.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime 's instant video library is only available to Prime subscribers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In a switch to our proposed dual-tiered model , we <b>believe</b> that Netflix would offer the strongest video streaming product at both the free and paid price-points .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , we <b>believe</b> that the new model would steal free viewers from Hulu 's and piracy 's market share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Second , and most importantly , we <b>believe</b> that the adoption of a free-tier with ads would grow Netflix 's revenues .  (Uncertainty) </span>With the size of Netflix's user base, Netflix would become one of the most in-demand platforms for online advertisers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While there are many different online advertising strategies , we <b>believe</b> Netflix adopting a CPM model ( cost per thousand views ) is feasible as it is one of the models that YouTube employs .  (Uncertainty) </span>We modeled such a scenario based on subscriber and viewing activity reported by Netflix in their most recent quarter.There are currently over 62 million Netflix subscribers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These are the <b>assumptions</b> we used to model the new business model : 20 % of users are paid , 80 % of users are free ( the ratio of paid to free subscribers for Spotify ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Industry average CPM of $25 (chart below).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Every 30 minutes there are 4 ads ( similar to Hulu , <i>less</i> than TV ) .  (Surprise) </span>Free and subscription users watch the same number of hours of TV/Movies.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Based on the previous <b>assumptions</b> , we calculate a total revenue of $ 1,753,228,000 , which is <i>higher</i> than their Q1 FY2015 results of $ 1,486,140,000 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To examine other possible scenarios , we created tables with different <b>assumptions</b> on the free/subscription distribution , hours watched and CPM price .  (Uncertainty) </span>As you can see, even at the low-end of CPM prices, revenue has the potential to beat current Q1 results of $1,486,140,000.The most influential factor for NFLX's management to consider is whether the daily view count would increase enough to make the switch realistic.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that the switch would mean a significant increase in viewing activity , especially in international markets .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the war for library content, Netflix is already winning - by a lot.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Thus , the additional revenue would only increase their competitive advantage from a consumer standpoint through further content acquisition and <i>more</i> Netflix original titles ( Orange Is the New Black , House of Cards , etc ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We know that Netflix 's current business model is strong , but if management is trying to increase their viewer basis by <i>larger</i> numbers , considering a free service would be the best option .
