Those seem like fantasies, but I recently noticed how heavily ESPN is pushing their mobile app.They had a campaign where they tried to bring awareness that you can watch ESPN anywhere, on any device with the app.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now sure , the app <b>might</b> not bring in the same kind of revenue and profit per viewer that cable does , but if that is the direction this type of media is heading then ESPN is well-positioned to be on board .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If I was an analyst on the Disney calls I would ask about how they are increasing monetization of the WatchESPN app as that should be a key driver of growth going forward that <b>may</b> help offset some of the lost revenue from regular TV subscribers .  (Uncertainty) </span>Mobile advertising is in its infancy, though, compared to TV advertising.Only time will tell if mobile ads and other monetization methods can be as lucrative for the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Ultimately , I <b>believe</b> ESPN is in a time of transition and that will cause some near-term headwinds , but to totally write Disney off neglects every other segment that is by all measures doing excellent , as well as the other parts of the Media Networks division that is not ESPN .  (Uncertainty) </span>As of writing this, my brokerage shows that Disney is trading at 16.8 TTM earnings and 14.6 next year's earnings projections.The S&P 500 P/E ratio, for comparison, is at 20.45.Notable growth stocks such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Netflix are priced at 30 times earnings and above, even with this recent downturn.What these numbers tell me is that Disney is priced as if it can't grow at all and is simply a cash-generating dinosaur.This is not a cigarette company that is struggling to hold on to the remnants of the glory days as their industry is slowly swallowed by shifting consumer tastes and regulation.I have seen some recent commentary on Disney that the stock is too expensive based on free cash flow numbers.One example had the company at 24 times enterprise value/free cash flow.I am agnostic to this kind of valuation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While numbers do n't lie , free cash flow does n't <b>worry</b> me because the company only pays out 24 % of its earnings anyway .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even if the company does generate slightly <i>less</i> free cash flow , they are certain to get a <i>better</i> return on that cash making another Marvel movie or licensing out their intellectual property for <i>more</i> Star Wars video games .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They <b>could</b> even create an exclusive Star Wars channel to help out the media network segment .  (Uncertainty) </span>A Star Wars-only channel streaming online with ads every 15 minutes - I would watch it, and I am a millennial for what it is worth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not sure what it would show , <b>maybe</b> just loop the original trilogy or the cartoon ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Anyways ... My fair value of Disney shares is around $ 120 , where it was <i>earlier</i> this year .  (Surprise) </span>I think it can easily reach that plateau if ESPN starts to turn around and the rest of the company continues chugging along, steady as ever.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A lack of another Star Wars movie for the next two years is a bit concerning as the company <b>might</b> lack a short-term catalyst and get dragged through the mud with the rest of the market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Disney 's share price has declined <i>more</i> than it <b>probably</b> should have as a reaction to a 7 % drop in ESPN subscribers over two years .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even as revenue in the Media Networks segment continues to grow , pessimism about one network has obscured the true growth rate and <b>wonderful</b> progress being made at Disney across its many business divisions .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This pessimism has provided the opportunity of a lifetime to buy Disney and I <b>believe</b> that a bargain has awakened , but for how long ?
