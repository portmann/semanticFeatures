class='textDiv'>The Real Threat To UPS Is UPS United Parcel Service Inc NYSEUPS Seeking Alpha UPS risks losing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>business in bits and pieces as the retailer explores new shipping options <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>posing a competitive risk to UPS is minimal at this point United Parcel Service Inc NYSE UPS knows what its like to take on the competition From FedEx NYSE FDX in the United States to DHL in Europe theyve faced aggressive competition on the ground and in the air as it were to come out as the global leader in logistics and transportation Having said that one of the most challenging business situations is to have a customer become a competitor Though relatively new the phenomenon has been seen on more than one occasion in the past few years Take Dish Network Corp for example which saw HBO skirt past them to deliver programming direct to the customer When cosmetics giant Estee Lauder decided to take the same route that pain was felt by the likes of Macys NYSE M Over and over we see this phenomenon unfolding and the UPSAmazon NASDAQ AMZN relationship is now undergoing the same difficult phase The question now is Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>pose a serious threat to UPS I dont think so not by a long shot and most definitely not in the United States Heres why First we need to understand the moat that companies like UPS and FedEx have built around themselves for the entire time theyve been around This is a huge moat constructed on an investment knowledge and ontheground logistical foundation that cannot be duplicated in a matter of a few years To achieve the reach and depth of penetration that these companies have any competitor would need to periodically invest billions of dollars over a prolonged period of time and even then theyd be nowhere near the levels of accuracy and consistency that theyd need to be a serious competitor The only real threat that UPS faces right now from AMZN is the fear of losing a customer and a very good one at that and even that may not happen for a long while yet So why then does everyone think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is just going to magically create its own logistics business to rival a yearold company like UPS Whats <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Been Doing in Shipping I do not believe that Amazons multipronged attempts at improving the fulfillment part of its business have anything to do with weaning off dependency from UPS or anyone else Amazons only objectives are to reduce shipping time and cost and expand their extremely tight margins that are more often than not on the negative end of the scale Everything else is a knockon effect The possible leasing of freighters for shipping is part of that as is its purchase of the French company Colis Priv In fact even the drone shipment idea is a part of trying to meet all of those objectives To put it another way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>only wants whats best for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its own customers and stakeholders Theyre not doing a favor to UPS by giving them a billion dollars worth of business every year they need UPS and its vast network to provide a missioncritical service to them Its as simple as that If that changes I dont think it will be because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can operate as a completely independent entity from ordering to fulfillment It will be because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has found a cheaper way to have its parcels delivered to its end users Look at the escalating cost of shipping that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>currently faces In Q shipping cost as a percentage of revenue was up to Smaller wonder why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doing everything it can to reduce shipping costs Whats happening here is that because theyre exploring cheaper options people are assuming that theyre trying to muscle in on UPSs business Thats not whats really going on Whats the Real Threat to UPS from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I think the immediate threat is losing segments of business that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>currently depends on them for As an example take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Air and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Flex These offerings are intracity options that could see UPS losing some of Amazons business Similarly the addition of freighters to the already increasing size of Amazons lastleg fleet of trucks will see more business going away How much business will they lose in Thats anyones guess but judging by the speed at which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is rolling out these initiatives it may even negate the price increase that UPS announced for The net increase for ground shipping and net increase for UPS Air are sure to affect Amazons bottom line even considering their concession pricing status as UPSs biggest customer For now UPS may have averted a loss situation by hiking up their prices but its not something they can repeat every year Customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities If these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts Theyre obviously directing this comment at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but I dont think theyve left themselves wide open to such contingencies The price hike is a result of that and other possibly related factors in my opinion So there is definitely a threat to UPS from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but not from the angle that several analysts are speculating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is just too far away from achieving competitor status against UPS or FedEx Maybe years from now that will change for now however UPS will remain a dominant player in the US logistics and transportation game To counter the effects of losing a major client like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and in fact any downturn in revenues UPS has been working in several directions One such undertaking is to create a healthcare niche within its own shipping business In the last two years the company opened dedicated healthcare facilities on four continents to help create a dedicated healthcare transportation and distribution network that can piggyback on their global footprint There are literally dozens of industries where UPS can position itself as a supply chain partner and facilitator Healthcare is just one of them that UPS has made a serious commitment to essentially any industry that relies on materials being moved from point A to point B is up for grabs All of these niches can easily and quickly be built on the backbone of the network that UPS has already created so theres not much of a Capex outlay involved in such expansion exercises UPS is not a onetrick pony The company generated nearly of its revenues from overseas markets in and that number has slowly grown over a period of time They already have the technology backbone and nothing is going to stop them from expanding in developing countries and keep establishing their network wherever they see an opportunity Investorspeak The Real Threat to UPS is UPS I strongly believe that the only serious threat UPS faces now is in terms of what it isnt doing to keep expanding its margins and increasing its top line On the margins front their supply chain and freight seems to be the immediate pain point It generates of the companys revenue but only accounts for of operating profit Its definitely an area they should dig deeper into In regards to increasing its top line there are several opportunities that are still not being exploited The healthcare supply chain niche is just a scratch on the surface of a potentially multibilliondollar segment of its own If they can offer such services to manufacturing companies pharmaceutical giants petrochemicals across the globe they wont have to worry about top line income for another hundred years figuratively speaking The best part about that is this they already have a ready network to put this into play in a short period of time Even within the ecommerce industry alone there are billions of untapped dollars that UPS can get their hands on Heres an interesting statistic from Forrester Inc With such growth the demand for shipping can only go up Some may argue that shipping to individual consumers is not a hugely profitable business and theyd be right UPS will need to deal with the lastleg delivery issue which has been the biggest bane of ecommerce fulfillment Nevertheless the economies of scale still make it a profitable endeavor something theyve experienced firsthand with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as their client It is one of the safest companies to invest in They have achieved a dominant global status in an industry that is thousands of years old As such they are a traditional business that has leveraged the power of technology to their advantage I strongly believe that the future growth of UPS depends more on what strategies it deploys and the positioning of itself in niche markets than what its competitors or even clients for that matter can do to it
