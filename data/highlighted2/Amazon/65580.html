manufacturers Intel and Rockchip are aggressively wooing Chinese OEMs to use the new quadcore Atom X GR CRK processor for Android tablets Intels tablet strategy is not limited to dirtcheap tablets Fujitsu is coming up with a Intel CoreM powered Windows tablet Digitimes supply chain sources are reporting that Intel NASDAQ INTC and Rockchip are trying to win the support of more Chinese whitebox tablet manufacturers for the new quadcore Atom X CRRK processors Intel is reportedly offering a subsidy of around per device as incentive for Chinese firms to use the Rockchipmade Atom X product Intel recruited Rockchip last year to help penetrate the Chinese smartphone application processor market which is still currently dominated by ARMbased processors Rockchip is one of the top ARMbased mobile application vendors in ChinaAsia and has a network of longterm clients Intels shrewd partnership with Rockchip is one more reason why I believe the Atom X SoC could threaten Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and MediaTeks lowpriced smartphonetablet processors Whitebox tablet manufacturers in Shenzhen also are likely responsible for the production of generic Android phones that get sold on a wholesale basis out of China Generic tablets and smartphones from whitebox producers in China are then rebranded and sold by vendors like Oppo Ainol or Onda Even Indias biggest local smartphone vendor Micromax also has rebranded generic Android phones since Intels friendliness toward local Chinese companies has longterm benefits Toptier companies like Samsung OTC SSNLF are still ignoring the new Atom X products Chinese firms can help make up for this lack of interest from tier companies According to Gartner Chinese whitebox manufacturers will continue to ship out huge numbers of phones and tablets this year smartphones and million tablets Samsung the worlds top seller of Android tablets might regret ignoring the Cherry Trail Atom X products once Intelpowered phablets like the Teclast X start getting distributed outside of China The Teclast X has the cheapest dualcore Atom XC SoC but Rockchip and Intel are now promoting the quadcore G Atom XCRK version The higher CPU frequency and better GPU of the XCRK should appeal to more whitebox manufacturers accustomed to quadcore ARM processors from MediaTek or Allwinner Digitimes also reported that Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is now subsidizing dualOS Windows Android devices from whitebox manufacturers Microsoft is reportedly offering a subsidy in addition to Intels own contra revenue for each tabletin notebook that use the older Atom BayTrail chips However I believe the Rockchipmade Cherry Trail Atom X processor also is ready to help Intel beat its million tablet processor sales last year Teclast has a dualboot Windows Android tablet Onda has one too <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is selling the dualboot Chuwi tablet in the US which is more proof that Microsoft now approves of these dualOS devices Contra revenue from Microsoft goes a lot in helping Intel gain wider support for its new Cherry Trail Atom X processor The SoFiAX was first revealed as Intels first smartphone chip with an integrated modem last year The emerging tactic now is that Krzanich is pushing it first to whitebox tablet manufacturers hoping that it might lead those companies to also try the Atom X for their generic smartphones The Atom Xs total addressable market is much bigger in smartphones than in tablets Furthermore investors also should appreciate that Intels tablet strategy is not limited to selling dirtcheap processors Fujitsu will soon launch a Windows tablet with an Intel CoreM processor The Fujitsu ARROWS Tab QL will go on sale next month The Dell Venue Pro Series is another highpriced tablet with an Intel CoreM processor Since Apple NASDAQ AAPL also used an Intel Core M for its new fanless Macbook laptop theres a probability that the upcoming inch iPad Pro might also use one Apple needs an x processor for the iPad Pro if it intends to sell them to Photoshopusing creative professionals The Surface has an Intel Atom X processor and it can run Photoshop Pro Tools and AutoCAD This is the unique advantage of Intels x mobile application processors they can run any industrystandard programs and operating systems INTC is a buy Investors should not focus too much on cheap whitebox tablets from China The more important thing is that Microsoft and Intel are back to their old Wintel tagteaming ways Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US
