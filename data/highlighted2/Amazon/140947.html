The fitness trend amongst the younger generation is also here to stay.That is why Nike (NYSE: NKE ), Skechers (NYSE: SKX ), and Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) are up and hit 52-week highs on Wednesday.The government-pushed solar theme had stocks like First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR ) up and running on new orders.People are also moving towards organic food and hence stocks like Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ) ( CMG.B ) are moving up along with Kellogg's (NYSE: K ) that announced it will be removing artificial ingredients from its food.CEO interview - R.R. Donnelley & Sons (NASDAQ: RRD ) R.R. Donnelley & Sons announced that it is splitting itself into three parts; the financial and data services company, the multi-channel communications management business and the printing business.By the end of 2016, these will be different companies which are much easier to understand.The company also reported a good last quarter with a $0.04 beat.Cramer interviewed CEO Tom Quinlan to hear what the split will do in terms of unlocking value.Quinlan said that the dividend is safe and they are going to recommend a $0.26 dividend to the board.On the split up, he said that, "Customer dynamics are changing, and the industry is changing and we've got the scale.So, we have a position of strength with the acquisitions that we have done over the years and we wanted to be an integrated communications services provider.The acquisitions that we have done have gotten us there."He added that though the top lines are challenged, the margins are increasing.They're always trying to save the customers money and all of these companies are instant leaders in their fields.They serve 95% of the Fortune 1000.Disney is no ordinary stock."You have to ask yourself, has that much changed with one quarterly report?To figure that out you have to analyze not just Disney's fundamentals, but the stock itself," said Cramer.He said that the stock came down due to 3 words from CEO Bob Iger - "some subscriber loss."Disney's stock has been a good performer and was priced at 25 times earnings coming into the quarter.When a stock is that expensive, they cannot afford to miss estimates, but Disney did and the stock plunged 9%."So, I'm not dismissing this decline, but most stocks do get cheaper when they go lower, and that certainly goes for Disney's," said Cramer.Regarding fundamentals, every line-item shows much better than expected numbers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <b>disappointing</b> cable numbers and CEO 's three words caused the stock to decline .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cramer thinks , `` Disney paid too much for very good sports programming , and now it is n't getting the subscribers it needs to pay for all of that programming because people are n't taking the bundle like they used to ... Given the run in the stock and the high-profile departures , investors <b>presumed</b> the worst and they are betting that subscriber losses are happening , and the change is n't glacial anymore , '' he added .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company has a lot of good news coming in the form of Disneyland Shanghai and new movies.Cramer thinks the stock is still a terrific buy for the long term as long as Bob Iger is at the helm.Cramer was shocked when Avnet reported a strong quarter after a tough 2015.He said that Avnet is the largest supermarket of technology on earth.It distributes electronic components, including semiconductors and is one of the largest suppliers of information technology hardware, software and services.Cramer interviewed CEO Rich Hamada to find out more about the quarter and their acquisition strategy.Hamada said that Europe is doing well which led to 146% cash flow improvement for the year.He added that the Internet of Things is still in the early stages and it not only includes devices, but also connectivity and computing power.On acquisitions, he said that, "We've got great cash flow to support our aspirations for profitable growth, Jim.We remain open for business for acquisitions, but we are going to be very disciplined about our approach.We are very actively interested in deploying this capital to create future EBIDTA and cash flow wherever we can."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cramer mentioned that in the market , <b>fear</b> is more powerful than common sense .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is why investors are selling stocks when commodities are falling, instead of buying them.He reminded investors that a fall in prices of oil and other commodities is actually good for companies, as they make more money due to a fall in input costs.That is why stocks like Pepsi (NYSE: PEP ), Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) and Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN ) that are buyers of commodities, went up on Wednesday.Wednesday was also a day for growth stocks as they are valued much more in the future as inflation is subdued.He said that stocks retain value if inflation goes up, so why sell them?"I need you to remember this kind of other-side-of-the-coin action.It's typical of day three after any extended commodity collapse," said Cramer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Humana ( NYSE : HUM ) : Many <b>believe</b> that the deal will still go through .
