( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Competition will get knocked out by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's merciless discounting . I do not think Alphabet and Apple can match the lowball pricing of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's smart devices . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Google Home and the future Apple Smart Speaker will still get outsold by <i>cheaper</i> Alexa-powered products of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is again implementing a fire-sale promotion for its tablets , Kindle readers , Fire TV console , and Alexa speakers . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AMZN sells its hardware below cost to gain <i>more</i> repeat customers for its online marketplace .  (Surprise) </span>It also does this to hurt the hardware/software sales of its rivals.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) had the perfect answer to the potential threat posed by Alphabet 's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) upcoming Google Home intelligent home assistant . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's prompt answer was to just sell a $ 20-off Alexa-powered <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Tap Bluetooth speaker/smart home assistant . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>In fact , Apple 's ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) alleged upcoming Siri Speaker will also likely get a beat-down from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo 's <i>cheaper</i> <b>variations</b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Deep discounting is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's deadly weapon against any threat to its popular brands of smart devices . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't prioritize making a profit on hardware . All the cheapo Fire tablets , Fire TV console/stick products , and Alexa-powered speakers it sells are mere customer recruitment avenues for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's online marketplace . I also reiterate that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> intentionally sells its own products at below cost to reduce the hardware/software revenue of Alphabet and Apple . Please study the screenshot below , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is obviously not making any hardware profit on the $ 39.99 Fire Tablet or the $ 94.99 Fire TV+HD antenna bundle . The major benefit that a $ 39.99 Fire Tablet gives is that increases the total number of potential repeat customers for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's online store . The other benefit is that it hurts the sales of the iPad and Android tablets.Apple and Google also lose potential customers for their app stores since Fire tablets/consoles are tied exclusively to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's own app store . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Bezos recently revealed that <i>more</i> than 1,000 employees are now working on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo and Alexa . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>That kind of manpower focus strongly says that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> wants to protect its big lead on cloud computing and artificial intelligence computing . Smart home assistants like Google Home and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Tap will have to rely on online neural networks to service millions of homes . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I previously wrote that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will likely buy <i>more</i> pricey Tesla GPUs from Nvidia ( NASDAQ : NVDA ) to build deep-learning computer servers for its enterprise customers . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>However , I also think <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will also allocate many deep-learning computers for its own online Alexa smart voice assistant . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Yes , Alexa now touts <i>more</i> than 1,000 skills , up from just 135 last January .  (Surprise) </span>However, the diverse needs of different people means third-party developers will continue to code custom skills for Alexa.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Processing all the new skills require <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to keep building <i>more</i> powerful server farms for Alexa . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>I expect that all Amazon-branded devices will eventually be powered by Alexa . The $ 39.99 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire Tablet can already be called a legit smart home assistant . Alexa is now accessible via a web browser .Anybody with an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ID can test Alexa through their connected and mic-equipped devices at Echosim.io . Everybody should test the browser-based <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo simulator before they spend for any <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Alexa-powered products . Letting people test drive the league-leading artificial intelligence power of Alexa is a masterful marketing strategy.The cheapest smart home assistant available now is still the $ 89.99 <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo DOT . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A little test drive is necessary to convince <i>more</i> people to trust these kind of deep-learning home appliances .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Alexa-powered devices like the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo are key toward persuading <i>more</i> households to rely only on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ecosystem ( rather than iTunes or Google Play Store ) for their shopping and entertainment needs . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Losing $ 10 or $ 15 on a smart home gadget like the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Tap is a small sacrifice . The great Mary Meeker's most revealing Internet 2016 trend warning is that the Alexa-powered Echo is allegedly emerging as a threat to the iPhone.Without Siri, the iPhone is really just a dumb smartphone.Meeker was smart and clairvoyant when she dared to compare the small ( but rising ) sales numbers of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo against the massive sales of the iPhone . Meeker only wanted to point out that the smartphone industry is slowing down while sales of smart home assistants are just starting to take off.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock has had a great one-year return . However, we should still remain long on AMZN because it is the company which kick started the era of voice-powered, machine-learning appliances.Google and Apple failed to see the threat of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo last year . They are now relegated to playing catch-up with the real innovator , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Bezos and his 1,000-strong Alexa army will crush the imitators.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's reign as the de facto king of smart home assistants will remain unchallenged for many years to come . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can undercut the prices of its rivals . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also has a dedicated development team and proprietary technology to compete with the artificial intelligence platforms of Google or Apple .
