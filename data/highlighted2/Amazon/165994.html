which is reflected in its results Last week eBay NASDAQ EBAY one of the worlds first and bestknown ecommerce names celebrated its th birthday In the age of the internet this is quite a venerable age and the passing of the mark offers a suitable opportunity to review the companys prospects At the company is starting to show its age as it lags growth in the broader market and increasingly cedes market share to players like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN By now more or less a legacy business it is hard to see upside catalysts aside from its relatively low valuation Even before the PayPal spinoff it was fairly clear that eBays marketplace segment was simply not keeping up with the broader industry According to Forrester US ecommerce sales grew by an average of about per year between and In the growth rate is projected at roughly the same number How does eBay stack up Increasingly badly In eBay marketplace still outpaced matched the overall industry growth rate US sales up versus an increase for the industry overall Not bad at all By the end of things werent looking quite as good Overall marketplace revenue increased by only versus the growth recorded in US ecommerce sales This year things are looking even worse A recent report highlights eBays main problem which is that its traditional business model isnt really working any more Consumers today prefer buying a product instantly rather than risking a sniper picking off the highly prized baseball card or comic book they have been waiting to buy for weeks A report released in March shows just how much consumers have gone off the auction model In February eBays auction sales fell by a whopping while its fixedprice sales rose by Overall comp store sales growth clocked in at well below the industry average used by comScore and ChannelAdvisor The number is barely comparable to the growth recorded by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>over the same period In January Amazons growth rate was at versus overall eBay marketplace growth of eBay has proven itself reluctant to let go of its auction business model which was initially wildly successful but now feels more like a relic of another time To remain relevant it must move more of its sales to a fixedprice model but even in this sphere it doesnt come anywhere near <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in terms of growth eBays expected earnings growth rates arent particularly convincing either This year annual EPS is expected to drop by around Between and things are expected to recover with earnings growth projected at This isnt bad but it also isnt great As far as I can tell the only tangible benefit eBay has over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>right now is its valuation The stock currently trades at times trailing earnings which is certainly lower than the industry average as well as Amazons negative PE It is also well below the companys historical average However valuation alone does not an investment thesis make eBay pioneered the world of ecommerce with its auctionbased business model helping create an industry that is now booming However as its business model became increasingly irrelevant replaced by a faster fixedprice model the company is starting to show its age Even its fixedprice segment cannot compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in terms of sales growth and sales in its auction segment continue to plummet Without a nearterm catalyst in terms of fixedprice sales growth and
