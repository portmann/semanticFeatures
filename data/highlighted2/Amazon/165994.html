(NASDAQ:EBAY) | Seeking Alpha As one of the first major players, eBay pioneered an industry.However, its business model is becoming increasingly irrelevant, which is reflected in its results.Last week eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), one of the world's first and best-known e-commerce names, celebrated its 20th birthday.In the age of the internet, this is quite a venerable age, and the passing of the mark offers a suitable opportunity to review the company's prospects.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At 20 , the company is starting to show its age , as it lags growth in the <i>broader</i> market and increasingly cedes market share to players like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By now <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> a legacy business , it is hard to see upside catalysts aside from its relatively low valuation .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even before the PayPal spinoff , it was fairly clear that eBay 's marketplace segment was simply not keeping up with the <i>broader</i> industry .  (Surprise) </span>According to Forrester US e-commerce sales grew by an average of about 9.4% per year between 2011 and 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In 2015 , the growth rate is projected at <b>roughly</b> the same number .  (Uncertainty) </span>How does eBay stack up?Increasingly badly.In 2013, eBay marketplace still outpaced matched the overall industry growth rate, US sales up 14% versus an 11.5% increase for the industry overall.Not bad at all.By the end of 2014, things weren't looking quite as good.Overall marketplace revenue increased by only 6%, versus the 10.3% growth recorded in US e-commerce sales.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This year , things are looking even <i>worse</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A recent report highlights eBay 's main problem , which is that its traditional business model is n't really working any <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Consumers today prefer buying a product instantly , rather than <b>risking</b> a sniper picking off the highly prized baseball card or comic book they have been waiting to buy for weeks .  (Uncertainty) </span>A report released in March shows just how much consumers have gone off the auction model.In February, eBay's auction sales fell by a whopping 26%, while its fixed-price sales rose by 8.6%.Overall, comp store sales growth clocked in at 5.5%, well below the 15% industry average used by comScore and ChannelAdvisor.The number is barely comparable to the 22.7 % growth recorded by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> over the same period . In January , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth rate was at 27 % versus overall eBay marketplace growth of 8.6 % . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>eBay has proven itself reluctant to let go of its auction business model , which was initially wildly successful , but now feels <i>more</i> like a relic of another time .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To remain relevant , it must move <i>more</i> of its sales to a fixed-price model , but even in this sphere , it does n't come anywhere near <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in terms of growth . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>eBay's expected earnings growth rates aren't particularly convincing either.This year, annual EPS is expected to drop by around 6.4%.Between 2015 and 2016, things are expected to recover, with earnings growth projected at 10.1%.This isn't bad, but it also isn't great.As far as I can tell , the only tangible benefit eBay has over <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> right now is its valuation . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The stock currently trades at 13.7 times trailing earnings , which is certainly <i>lower</i> than the 21.5 industry average as well as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's negative P/E . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It is also well below the company's historical average.However, valuation alone does not an investment thesis make.eBay pioneered the world of e-commerce with its auction-based business model, helping create an industry that is now booming.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , as its business model became increasingly irrelevant , replaced by a <i>faster</i> fixed-price model , the company is starting to show its age .  (Surprise) </span>Even its fixed-price segment can not compete with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in terms of sales growth , and sales in its auction segment continue to plummet . Without a near-term catalyst in terms of fixed-price sales growth, and without PayPal to pad its results, it's hard to make a case for upside in the near future.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
