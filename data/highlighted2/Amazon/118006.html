the necessary deals are coming together The June Apple NASDAQ AAPL World Wide Developers Conference has come and gone with no mention of a streaming TV service The service that the Wall Street Journal reported for this fall is expected to carry the major TV channels in an over the top OTT service that would allow you to bypass the normal cable providers A year ago I wrote a piece Apples New Strategic Centerpiece This year I believe is when this plan will be implemented the Apple TV will move wholeheartedly from selfproclaimed hobby to full fledged critical product Apple TV is a small set top box that connects to the internet typically via wifi and provides content to your entertainment system Currently it provides access to several services I describe what is currently available and what is rumored to come in my survey post The Coming Revolution The Apple TV sold for several years for until in March the price was dropped to At the same time Tim Cook announced a special deal for early release of the HBO Now streaming service from parent company Time Warner NYSE TWX Apples plan is clear get the price for the ATV low enough to increase purchases and then like the Kindle from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN let subscription services bring in the real revenue Perhaps the most exciting expectation for the updated device is the streaming OTT service for major networks The video streaming service should include video from the networks including local affiliates According to the Post article But networks dont control affiliate feeds So Apple CEO Tim Cooks team asked the networks to obtain those rights instead of having Apple chase those rights around the country itself The article continues that the networks are close to having these rights The new service will allow a user to pick the channels desired and not subscribe to all the others This should lead to both increased control by the consumer and reduced cost The important thing here is the business model that Apple would use While there are several possibilities there are two major models of operation First is one in which Apple itself provides the complete service serving out the content while licensing from the networks and other providers In this scenario Apple would essentially replace the cable company and provide all the physical and logistic infrastructure It would receive all the income and pay out royalties and licensing fees In a second model providers would provide a channel app similar to what HBO Now Netflix ESPN and ABC do now Here Apple would provide logistic support including centralized billing but the provider would be responsible for streaming and would own the customer and that revenue Apple would receive a fee a percentage of the subscription This would be similar to the app store where Apple takes and gives the rest to the app developers and whats presumably done with HBO Now The question is How much could Apple potentially make from a streaming TV service The NY post article reports that Apple is asking what it charges for apps and in app purchases in the App Store but that this is being negotiated This seems hard to justify given the economics of the situation My guess is that will be the final number for Apples fee To analyze this lets look at some facts all for the US market At the end of the US contained households Of these over million had broadband internet Also about million are payTV subscribers of some sort The number of cable TV subscribers in was down from million in Cable industry revenues from subscriptions for were billion up from billion the year before The average monthly cable subscription fee was in and is expected to be in and may top in So how much of this pie can Apple expect to ingest TV Everywhere viewing for example has seen growth yearoveryear with Apple TV devices doubling their share of premium video viewing quarter over quarter from to overtaking Roku Adobe Digital Index ADI OTT services are growing rapidly and The chart shows that Apple devices have an enormous lead in video viewing and that the Apple TV has shown a remarkable gain to over the past year to become the No settop box There have been many reports that cable cutting is becoming more common particularly in the desirable age range where stream video Additionally cable companies have terrible customer satisfaction ratings This means that Apple is now positioned to break out as the leader in OTT enablement and that a well accepted streaming service could very well provide the impetus to initiate a mass migration to OTT cablecutting services Note the plummeting blue line below Thats Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK and Time Warner Cables NYSE TWC revenue going down the drain as consumers are increasingly cutting the cord in favor of settop boxes like Roku and Apple TV I am assuming that the service would work on the second model given above with Apple being a facilitator and not a replacement cable company and that Apple will receive a fee for its services So Im focusing on the approximately billion in cable and satellite subscription revenue just to get an idea of whats possible Im projecting out three to five years and making the following assumptions that are a bit aggressive but not irrational In five years of current subscribers will switch from cablesatellite to OTT network TV provisioning These subscribers represent of revenues thats B as higher paying customers see the most benefit and thus are more likely to switch Driver of switch is a reduction in cost to consumer Also more flexibility in choice This reduction of subscription fees gives a total OTT subscription value of B x Apple streaming service provides of this new overall OTT service B Apple takes to fee for income of B to B The result is that Apple sees an annual revenue stream of up to billion and this is just the US At first glance this does not seem that large compared to Apples billion ttm gross revenue but one needs to remember that this would be almost all profit Apple would not directly stream any content Apple TV would only make the connection and Apple would handle billing The expenses for this would not be great since the infrastructure and procedures are already in place for related services Therefore I would suggest that about of Apples cut would go to the bottom line Note this is not of the streaming revenue If you add in international sales then revenue would grow to the to billion range and net would be to billion This would add up to of the last months net income of B This is significant indeed for whats essentially a sideline to the main business Interestingly Barrons reported on a conference call with JPMorgan analysts discussing this very topic While they were working on the model that Apple would provide a complete service with more or less fixed subscription rates they used similar margins giving estimates for and even up to They note Turning to the cable and telco implications Cusick noted that hes always been very skeptical about claims regarding Apple storming the TV content world Said Cusick there was always a misunderstanding by tech investors of the complexity of the bundle such as DisneyESPN or Fox and Fox News This argues to my reasoning that the independent channel model may be more likely as it sidesteps these issues The downside here is that discounts for buying multiple channels may be difficult to manage This model also is supported by the NY Post article Apple reported in January that it had sold some million Apple TV units since the product was initiated This reflected an increase of million for the previous announcement nine months earlier This is tiny compared to the roughly million iPhones sold worldwide to date While no one expects Apple TV sales to reach that number clearly there is room for growth With growth already accelerating it is easy to see million units installed in just a couple of years A more powerful new product with new streaming apps games and Home Center should drive real growth add a significant revenue stream and bring new customers to the platform As such it is the epicenter of Apples new strategy As we have seen streaming video alone could easily add billion to the bottom line or even more if our assumptions turn out to be conservative That would be roughly per share It is important to note that this revenue is not the only motivation behind Apples venture into streaming and I think this is essential for the investor to note if he is to understand Apple The other features of the device apps games home control center all add up to make it uniquely suitable to this function As such it will bring the Apple ecosystem to more and more people as described here An April Parks Associates press release noted The paradigm is changing thanks to the growing amount of online and OTT content available to connected CE which has allowed streaming media devices to carve out a key niche in the connected home said Barbara Kraus Director of Research Parks Associates With the popularity of content streaming CE manufacturers must
