( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Using the methodology of one investment adviser and correcting for missed capitalized lease rents , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock is way overvalued . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is using capital leases because of how they are presented in financial statements , causing tech analysts not used to seeing these financial engineering strategies to omit cash flows . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should improve its lease disclosures and provide forward capital expenditure guidance on both cash and capitalized lease PP&E investments to clear up the <b>confusion</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) capital lease investments mean <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock price target should be $ 381 per share , not $ 698 as one investment bank calculated , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's disclosures are the reason for analyst and investor <b>confusion</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is regularly criticized for limiting information it provides to the investment community . In the post Sarbanes-Oxley Act era, financial presentation obfuscation is a head-scratcher, especially when it relates to basic financial detail.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Something as simple as segmenting lease accounting from other forms of debt and cash flows is not going to reveal anything proprietary about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business , unless the company 's business is to intentionally <b>confuse</b> and mislead analysts and investors . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>When reviewing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's financial presentations , which are at the very least unique , it 's hard not to conclude that the company is engaged in some sleight-of-hand . A great article on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cash flow metric can be found here . After reviewing one major investment bank 's analytical report issued after <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Q2 2015 earnings release , it 's clear to me that the tech analyst community does n't fully understand the financial strategy behind leases and the underlying accounting . On September 29 , 2015 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock closed at $ 496 per share . This article will walk the reader through Credit Suisse 's ( NYSE : CS ) July 2015 incorrect computations for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation at $ 698 per share . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This article will then <b>recalculate</b> the target price for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to be $ 381 per share using the investment bank 's own methodology , but correcting the mistakes the analyst made around <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's lease financing . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Table 1 is Credit Suisse 's long-range forecast for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> published on July 24th , 2015 . The report was obtained from Charles Schwab and is widely disseminated among financial advisors.You can bet a large number of retail investors rely on this report for their investment decisions.Credit Suisse 's valuation model calculated a $ 698 price target for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You will note that the <b>assumption</b> for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's 2016 to 2020 sales growth is strong and the bank 's expectation for increasing net income is substantial . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The calculations for the price target are presented later in this article.The problem with CS' model is that it omits cash flows associated with capital and financing lease investments.Capital and financing leases are capitalized and their cash rents show up reclassified in the income and cash flow statements just as you would see debt; just labeled a bit differently.As shown in Chart 1 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's trailing twelve-month ( `` TTM '' ) investment outlays for both cash and capital lease financed property plant and equipment ( `` PP&E '' ) was $ 9.3 billion as of June 30 , 2015 , and growing at a 39.3 % compound annual growth rate `` CAGR '' . Capital lease financing is growing at a very fast 66.7% CAGR.Clearly, the rents are growing at a similar rate.A reader reviewing the CS report and looking at the expenses would expect to see interest expense growing, or in lieu of growing interest expense, growing investments in PP&E; however, that is not what is occurring in the CS valuation model.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The PP&E investments in the CS forecast <b>appear</b> to only be for the investments classified as `` purchases of property and equipment ( incl .  (Uncertainty) </span>internal-use software & website development)".These PP&E investments do not include the investments made using capitalized leases.CS looks like it missed the capitalized lease cash flows altogether.For growth capital, lease obligations are one of the most contentious and complex accounting mechanisms and financial engineering solutions a company can use.Lease arrangements come in three flavors: operating, capital and financing.Operating leases are recorded as an expense and are differently presented on the company's financial statements from capital and financing leases, but that does not mean that operating leases are not long-lived obligations.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As of June 30 , 2015 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's operating lease commitments totaled $ 6.1 billion , indicating on average <b>approximately</b> a six-year lease term . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The focus of this article is directed <i>more</i> toward <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's capital lease activity because that <b>seems</b> to be <i>more</i> directly connected to the AWS growth . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The questions an investor should ask are , why would a company <b>suddenly</b> transition away from acquiring equipment with retained earnings ( or debt and equity ) to utilizing capital lease arrangements for equipment like servers ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Is the company unable to borrow debt or raise equity?Are retained earnings insufficient?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Is the lease transaction a <i>better</i> cost/benefit transaction ?  (Surprise) </span>Is a lease the only option a vendor offers the company?Is the company purposefully using capital lease financing because of how it shows up ( or does not show up ) in the cash flow measures used for valuing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ? <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's financial presentations emphasize growth and cash flows , and that 's appropriate . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately , the CS model indicates that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's disclosures are <b>confusing</b> to the investment community . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After reviewing other analyst recommendations and the forecasts used to base their recommendations , it does n't appear the <b>confusion</b> is limited to just one financial advisor .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It is <b>apparent</b> the market is excited about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth prospects , but it is much <i>less</i> clear that investors and even professional analysts understand the investment needs and lease financial strategies <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is utilizing to drive <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenue growth , especially for AWS . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>I regularly find analyzes that publish a 40 times or so multiple on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's EBITDA . Here is a link to a recent Forbes article ( linked to the author 's blog ) calculating <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's EV/EBITDA multiple at `` 43.9 '' . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The `` 40ish '' multiple is seemingly <i>more</i> in line with other growth companies as shown in the article 's comparisons , but unfortunately , calculating <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current multiple <b>depends</b> on how you include the cash flows from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's capitalized leases . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In its own presentations , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> seems to be encouraging this multiple <b>confusion</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As can be seen in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's third slide in its Q2 earning 's call web presentation . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's presentation emphasizes its non-GAAP `` Free Cash Flow '' metric , which excludes most cash flows for capital and financing leases . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's use of cash flow from operations in its Free Cash Flow metric also means <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is picking up the positive cash flows associated with its working capital . Over the past four years , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's working capital has contributed $ 3.6 billion in cash to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Free Cash Flow metric . The problem with this cash-flow item is the thinking that it belongs to stockholders.It doesn't really belong to stockholders.Technically, it's debt because the majority of working capital cash has been provided through accounts payable growth.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is efficiently using excess working capital for its PP&E investments , but this cash flow is not appropriate for calculating stockholder returns in my view . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Slide 3 is a slide you <b>might</b> use to discuss <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ability to borrow money , but it 's an inappropriate slide for discussing value with your stockholders , especially without significantly <i>better</i> disclosures around leases . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So let 's take a look at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's EBITDA and EBITDAR , adjusted for non-cash items and also adjusted for cash rents . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From there , let 's <b>recalculate</b> the current valuation multiples .  (Uncertainty) </span>We will then adjust the CS model with the cash effects from rents and working capital.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As can be seen in Table 3 , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's cash flow multiple is <b>dependent</b> upon whether you include rent or do n't include rent . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` T6A '' refers to annualizing the last six months ' performance , which upon review was slightly <i>better</i> than the trailing twelve months ending June 30 , 2015 .  (Surprise) </span>These cash flow figures do not include cash flows from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's working capital changes . So now, adjusting for cash rents, how would that change the CS model?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To make an <b>assumption</b> for future cash rents attributable to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's capital leases , let 's first refer back to Chart 1 and look at the average life on its lease obligations . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The short-term nature and CAGR growth in capital lease obligations indicates these are equipment assets like servers for AWS.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has indicated as such in its conference calls . Another point to make regarding <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's capital lease obligations is how quickly it must amortize the investments as compared to financing and operating leases . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At <i>less</i> than three years , capital leases are creating <i>more</i> term <b>risk</b> for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> when compared to the term <b>risk</b> found in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's other leases and the vast majority of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's long-term debt . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Short lease terms <b>could</b> result in <i>higher</i> cash rents <i>sooner</i> , should interest rates increase or should <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's credit quality decline . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To calculate the future rents , an <b>assumption</b> on future investments is required , especially for the AWS segment .  (Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does not provide future guidance on investments . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So the adjustments to the CS model will <b>assume</b> AWS continues its fast growth , which is in keeping with the forecasts in the CS report .  (Uncertainty) </span>Therefore, cash rents will also quickly grow.Here is a quote on the trend from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's 2nd quarter 10-Q filing : `` Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $ 1.4 billion and $ 920 million during Q2 2015 and Q2 2014 , and $ 2.3 billion and $ 1.6 billion for the six months ended June 30 , 2015 and 2014 . This reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS.We expect this trend to continue over time."<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>( bold emphasis added ) The analysis assumes a 40 % CAGR cash rent growth as the sensitized mid-point for the <b>recalculation</b> of the CS model , which is much <i>less</i> than the prior six quarter 67 % CAGR for capital lease PP&E and similar to the 44 % Q2 2015 over Q1 2015 annualized growth rate .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It should also be pointed out that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's lease investments ( especially for server investments ) will need to be replaced or at least renewed every three years or so . If AWS is going to continue to grow and maintain its existing infrastructure as analysts and stockholders forecast , we need to understand <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's PP&E equipment needs in the future for both recurring and new investments . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>might</b> think of it in terms of 1/3 of the cumulative past capital expenditures plus inflation will need to be reinvested every year in addition to new investments to support AWS ' infrastructure .  (Uncertainty) </span>Exhibit 10 is CS' adjustments to NI to get to "Unlevered Free Cash Flows".Note that CS is including the cash contributions from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's working capital . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Table 5 recreates the CS valuation model and then Table 6 <b>recalculates</b> the price target after including cash rents and removing changes in working capital .  (Uncertainty) </span>The results are sensitized around cash rent CAGR growth and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's weighted average cost of capital `` WACC '' . The results are significantly different.One last thought : Let 's think about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's `` Return on Invested Capital '' metric . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is an <b>unusual</b> metric because of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's use of capital leases and the way <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> computes Free Cash Flow . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With growing short-lived recurring capital leases , this metric becomes a little <i>trickier</i> to comprehend .  (Surprise) </span>The metric is presented in slide 5 within <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's second-quarter slide presentation . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> likes to show how the return is growing and is now 17 % as of the second quarter 2015 . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Return on Invested Capital is not just a yield . It's a capitalization rate that needs to not only provide a return on capital, but also a return for required recurring investments not reflected in Free Cash Flow like replacing servers financed with capital leases.A lot of pieces make up this metric, including the corresponding assets financed with capital and financing leases.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For assets that need to be replaced every three years and financed with capital leases , the capitalization rate for those assets must be <i>greater</i> than 33.3 % .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is neither helping the investment community nor itself in the long run unless it improves its lease accounting disclosures and assists the investment community with <i>better</i> understanding its lease financial strategy . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Beginning with the third quarter 2015 results , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should provide <i>greater</i> detail behind its lease accounting . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>On a quarterly basis , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should break out capital and financing leases on its balance sheet . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The term `` Other Long-Term Liabilities '' , which includes capital and financing lease obligations , no longer <b>seems</b> fitting .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will be well served if it provides non-GAAP cash rents and reconciles the rents back to GAAP . At the very least , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will improve investor understanding with a breakdown in interest expense between capital and financing leases , long-term debt , and other interest expense . Finally , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should seriously consider providing forward PP&E investment guidance . Capital expenditure guidance for all investments , including capital and financing lease investments , segmented between estimates for recurring and new ( EBITDA enhancing ) investments will help to improve the investment community 's assessment of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's future value prospects , including understanding <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's financial strategy for AWS . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The disclosures will greatly assist analysts and investors with a <i>better</i> understanding of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current and future cash flows .
