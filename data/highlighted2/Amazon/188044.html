methodology of one investment adviser and correcting for missed capitalized lease rents Amazons stock is way overvalued <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is using capital leases because of how they are presented in financial statements causing tech analysts not used to seeing these financial engineering strategies to omit cash flows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should improve its lease disclosures and provide forward capital expenditure guidance on both cash and capitalized lease PPE investments to clear up the confusion Amazons NASDAQ AMZN capital lease investments mean Amazons stock price target should be per share not as one investment bank calculated and Amazons disclosures are the reason for analyst and investor confusion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is regularly criticized for limiting information it provides to the investment community In the post SarbanesOxley Act era financial presentation obfuscation is a headscratcher especially when it relates to basic financial detail Something as simple as segmenting lease accounting from other forms of debt and cash flows is not going to reveal anything proprietary about Amazons business unless the companys business is to intentionally confuse and mislead analysts and investors When reviewing Amazons financial presentations which are at the very least unique its hard not to conclude that the company is engaged in some sleightofhand A great article on Amazons cash flow metric can be found here After reviewing one major investment banks analytical report issued after Amazons Q earnings release its clear to me that the tech analyst community doesnt fully understand the financial strategy behind leases and the underlying accounting On September Amazons stock closed at per share This article will walk the reader through Credit Suisses NYSE CS July incorrect computations for Amazons valuation at per share This article will then recalculate the target price for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to be per share using the investment banks own methodology but correcting the mistakes the analyst made around Amazons lease financing Table is Credit Suisses longrange forecast for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>published on July th The report was obtained from Charles Schwab and is widely disseminated among financial advisors You can bet a large number of retail investors rely on this report for their investment decisions Credit Suisses valuation model calculated a price target for Amazons stock You will note that the assumption for Amazons to sales growth is strong and the banks expectation for increasing net income is substantial The calculations for the price target are presented later in this article The problem with CS model is that it omits cash flows associated with capital and financing lease investments Capital and financing leases are capitalized and their cash rents show up reclassified in the income and cash flow statements just as you would see debt just labeled a bit differently As shown in Chart Amazons trailing twelvemonth TTM investment outlays for both cash and capital lease financed property plant and equipment PPE was billion as of June and growing at a compound annual growth rate CAGR Capital lease financing is growing at a very fast CAGR Clearly the rents are growing at a similar rate A reader reviewing the CS report and looking at the expenses would expect to see interest expense growing or in lieu of growing interest expense growing investments in PPE however that is not what is occurring in the CS valuation model The PPE investments in the CS forecast appear to only be for the investments classified as purchases of property and equipment incl internaluse software website development These PPE investments do not include the investments made using capitalized leases CS looks like it missed the capitalized lease cash flows altogether For growth capital lease obligations are one of the most contentious and complex accounting mechanisms and financial engineering solutions a company can use Lease arrangements come in three flavors operating capital and financing Operating leases are recorded as an expense and are differently presented on the companys financial statements from capital and financing leases but that does not mean that operating leases are not longlived obligations As of June Amazons operating lease commitments totaled billion indicating on average approximately a sixyear lease term The focus of this article is directed more toward Amazons capital lease activity because that seems to be more directly connected to the AWS growth The questions an investor should ask are why would a company suddenly transition away from acquiring equipment with retained earnings or debt and equity to utilizing capital lease arrangements for equipment like servers Is the company unable to borrow debt or raise equity Are retained earnings insufficient Is the lease transaction a better costbenefit transaction Is a lease the only option a vendor offers the company Is the company purposefully using capital lease financing because of how it shows up or does not show up in the cash flow measures used for valuing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Amazons financial presentations emphasize growth and cash flows and thats appropriate Unfortunately the CS model indicates that Amazons disclosures are confusing to the investment community After reviewing other analyst recommendations and the forecasts used to base their recommendations it doesnt appear the confusion is limited to just one financial advisor It is apparent the market is excited about Amazons growth prospects but it is much less clear that investors and even professional analysts understand the investment needs and lease financial strategies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is utilizing to drive Amazons revenue growth especially for AWS I regularly find analyzes that publish a times or so multiple on Amazons EBITDA Here is a link to a recent Forbes article linked to the authors blog calculating Amazons EVEBITDA multiple at The ish multiple is seemingly more in line with other growth companies as shown in the articles comparisons but unfortunately calculating Amazons current multiple depends on how you include the cash flows from Amazons capitalized leases In its own presentations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seems to be encouraging this multiple confusion As can be seen in Amazons third slide in its Q earnings call web presentation Amazons presentation emphasizes its nonGAAP Free Cash Flow metric which excludes most cash flows for capital and financing leases Amazons use of cash flow from operations in its Free Cash Flow metric also means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is picking up the positive cash flows associated with its working capital Over the past four years Amazons working capital has contributed billion in cash to Amazons Free Cash Flow metric The problem with this cashflow item is the thinking that it belongs to stockholders It doesnt really belong to stockholders Technically its debt because the majority of working capital cash has been provided through accounts payable growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is efficiently using excess working capital for its PPE investments but this cash flow is not appropriate for calculating stockholder returns in my view Slide is a slide you might use to discuss Amazons ability to borrow money but its an inappropriate slide for discussing value with your stockholders especially without significantly better disclosures around leases So lets take a look at Amazons EBITDA and EBITDAR adjusted for noncash items and also adjusted for cash rents From there lets recalculate the current valuation multiples We will then adjust the CS model with the cash effects from rents and working capital As can be seen in Table Amazons cash flow multiple is dependent upon whether you include rent or dont include rent TA refers to annualizing the last six months performance which upon review was slightly better than the trailing twelve months ending June These cash flow figures do not include cash flows from Amazons working capital changes So now adjusting for cash rents how would that change the CS model To make an assumption for future cash rents attributable to Amazons capital leases lets first refer back to Chart and look at the average life on its lease obligations The shortterm nature and CAGR growth in capital lease obligations indicates these are equipment assets like servers for AWS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has indicated as such in its conference calls Another point to make regarding Amazons capital lease obligations is how quickly it must amortize the investments as compared to financing and operating leases At less than three years capital leases are creating more term risk for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>when compared to the term risk found in Amazons other leases and the vast majority of Amazons longterm debt Short lease terms could result in higher cash rents sooner should interest rates increase or should Amazons credit quality decline To calculate the future rents an assumption on future investments is required especially for the AWS segment Unfortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does not provide future guidance on investments So the adjustments to the CS model will assume AWS continues its fast growth which is in keeping with the forecasts in the CS report Therefore cash rents will also quickly grow Here is a quote on the trend from Amazons nd quarter Q filing Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were billion and million during Q and Q and billion and billion for the six months ended June and This reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS We expect this trend to continue over time bold emphasis added The analysis assumes a CAGR cash rent growth as the sensitized midpoint for the recalculation of the CS model which is much less than the prior six quarter CAGR for capital lease PPE and similar to the Q over Q annualized growth rate It should also be pointed out that Amazons lease investments especially for server investments will need to be replaced or at least renewed every three years or so If AWS is going to continue to grow and maintain its existing infrastructure as analysts and stockholders forecast we need to understand Amazons PPE equipment needs in the future for both recurring and new investments You might think of it in terms of of the cumulative past capital expenditures plus inflation will need to be reinvested every year in addition to new investments to support AWS infrastructure Exhibit is CS adjustments to NI to get to Unlevered Free Cash Flows Note that CS is including the cash contributions from Amazons working capital Table recreates the CS valuation model and then Table recalculates the price target after including cash rents and removing changes in working capital The results are sensitized around cash rent CAGR growth and Amazons weighted average cost of capital WACC The results are significantly different One last thought Lets think about Amazons Return on Invested Capital metric This is an unusual metric because of Amazons use of capital leases and the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>computes Free Cash Flow With growing shortlived recurring capital leases this metric becomes a little trickier to comprehend The metric is presented in slide within Amazons secondquarter slide presentation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>likes to show how the return is growing and is now as of the second quarter Amazons Return on Invested Capital is not just a yield Its a capitalization rate that needs to not only provide a return on capital but also a return for required recurring investments not reflected in Free Cash Flow like replacing servers financed with capital leases A lot of pieces make up this metric including the corresponding assets financed with capital and financing leases For assets that need to be replaced every three years and financed with capital leases the capitalization rate for those assets must be greater than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is neither helping the investment community nor itself in the long run unless it improves its lease accounting disclosures and assists the investment community with better understanding its lease financial strategy Beginning with the third quarter results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should provide greater detail behind its lease accounting On a quarterly basis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should break out capital and financing leases on its balance sheet The term Other LongTerm Liabilities which includes capital and financing lease obligations no longer seems fitting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will be well served if it provides nonGAAP cash rents and reconciles the rents back to GAAP At the very least <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will improve investor understanding with a breakdown in interest expense between capital and financing leases longterm debt and other interest expense Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should seriously consider providing forward PPE investment guidance Capital expenditure guidance for all investments including capital and financing lease investments segmented between estimates for recurring and new EBITDA enhancing investments will help to improve the investment communitys assessment of Amazons future value prospects including understanding Amazons financial strategy for AWS The disclosures will greatly assist analysts and investors with a better understanding of Amazons current and future cash flows Providing better information to the investment
