(Surprise) </span>Look at the AWS Operating Income chart above in combination with the GAAP Net Income chart below to see how true this is.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Q4 2015 should be an even <i>bigger</i> replacement number for Q4 2014 .  (Surprise) </span>The P/E should go down.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Consider also that AWS ' $ 521 million in profit in Q3 2015 will likely rise to <i>more</i> than $ 1B by Q4E 2016 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if you conclude that the rest of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will only reach a no-loss , no-profit state , the <b>roughly</b> $ 3B + in AWS profits should amount to <b>roughly</b> 9x-12x the FY2015 GAAP Net Income . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one postulates another <b>approximate</b> doubling of the AWS profit in FY2017 , that would yield a ballpark FPE about 1/20 of the current P/E of 968 ( or about 50 ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>With an average analysts' next five years' EPS Growth estimate per annum of 60.40%, this makes AMZN a great buy, especially for the long term.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A 60 % EPS growth rate with a <b>roughly</b> 50 FPE would allow for good growth in FY2016 , with even <i>better</i> stock price growth in 2017 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>A common rule of thumb is that the FPE can match the expected five-year EPS Growth estimate per annum.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's other businesses become <i>more</i> profitable themselves , the upside should be even <i>greater</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The recent huge Fire and Fire TV sales argue that such upside is coming.This is a great chart.The uptrend has been hugely positive lately.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some <b>might</b> think that this chart has to fall from here .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , the AWS profits , along with the improving Prime metrics would <b>suggest</b> that this steep uptrend has at least a couple of years to go ( if not much <i>more</i> ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>AMZN is finally becoming profitable, and that profitability is likely to be great.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When the company reports Q4 2015 earnings early next year , everyone will be able to see the then much <i>lower</i> FPE .
