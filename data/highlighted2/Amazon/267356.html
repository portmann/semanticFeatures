( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha AWS profits were up 432 % and its revenues were up 78 % year over year for Q3 2015 . This is part of a very positive and continuing trend.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Many of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's new products , which should drive Prime results <i>higher</i> , outperformed over the recent Thanksgiving holiday weekend . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This bodes well for Q4 2015 results.Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has a largely deserved reputation for being `` the online marketplace . '' It earned this reputation many years ago, and since then, it has been a Wall Street darling.AMZN has been designated a "momentum" stock, and its value has been run up beyond all reason.Its FPE (Forward P/E) is 116.65.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That number puts <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> at a <b>roughly</b> a 10-fold premium to most of its retail peers . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Does any stock deserve this kind of valuation?I would have argued that no stock does.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , Q3 2015 results from AWS ( `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services '' ) <b>may</b> present a justification for all of the previous years of hype . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given that the Thanksgiving long weekend ( Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday ) retail sales review by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> management is hugely positive , that makes the stock a still <i>better</i> buy both for the long term and the near term . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The following is an `` exact '' excerpt from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's review of its Thanksgiving sales ( Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday ) : The top-selling products across all of the products available on Amazon.com this Black Friday were <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> devices - # 1 was Fire , # 2 was Fire TV Stick . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Fire TV Sales are up <i>more</i> than 6x year over year this holiday shopping weekend . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>From July through October Fire TV has been the #1 streaming media player in the US across all retailers.On its first Black Friday , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo was the # 1 best seller across all $ 100 + products on Amazon.com . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The new $ 49.99 Fire Tablet is the fastest-selling <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> tablet ever , with millions sold since launch - <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> tablet sales this weekend are up <i>more</i> than 3x year over year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Historically , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't present defined numbers in these performance announcements . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Still , the above is <b>probably</b> as close as you will get to a rave review announcement by the company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It indicates that its retail business is doing <i>better</i> than expected this holiday season .  (Surprise) </span>It indicates a number of the company's long-term plans to gain market share are progressing splendidly.This bodes well for the future of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's profits . It likely bodes ill for Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Aside from the regular sales , which is the biggest , but not the most profitable part of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's business , AWS had what <b>could</b> only be called stellar results in Q3 2015 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In fact, AWS has been having fantastic growth results for some time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Recently , it has become a much <i>larger</i> percentage of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's profits , and AMZN expects that percentage to grow quickly . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In Q3 2015, AWS reported $2.1B in revenue and $521 million in profit.That's a 78% rise in revenue and a 432% rise in profit year over year.AWS accounted for about 8 % of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's total revenue of $ 25.4 B in Q3 2015 . Its $521 million in profit in Q3 2015 moved AMZN into the black for Q3 2015 with $79 million in profit (+$0.17 per diluted share).By comparison, the company lost -$437 million (-$0.95 per diluted share) in Q3 2014.Consider that Q4 each year is usually <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's best quarter . In the past, that has meant that the e-commerce business has done well during the Christmas season.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the bullish report above , this season <b>may</b> be even <i>better</i> for the e-commerce business .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is a little <b>worrisome</b> that the company is selling so many Fire , Fire TV Stick , Echo 's , and Kindle e-readers - they are usually unprofitable or barely profitable .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , that also means <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is getting a lot <i>more</i> streaming customers , which is extremely bullish <i>longer</i> term . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if the e-commerce part of the business is unprofitable for Q4 2015 , the market will likely bid the price of the stock up due to the new customer/subscription gains .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has n't provided enough information to make the profitability call on the e-commerce business . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( Source : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Investor Relations ) If one estimates a gain of about $ 300 million in AWS revenues sequentially , one gets to <b>approximately</b> $ 2.4 B in Q4 2015 AWS sales . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>For Q3 2015, about 25% of the Net Sales fell to the bottom line of the Operating Income.25% of $2.4B is about $600 million.If you then also look at the chart of the GAAP Operating Income, you can see that the last negative quarter for this metric was in Q3 2014.That quarter has already rolled off the trailing twelve-month list of statistics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Further , what <b>seems</b> likely to be a big Q4 2015 is about to cycle onto the TTM books .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>AWS revenues and profits should add still <i>more</i> upside .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Given the good Thanksgiving Weekend news , it <b>seems</b> likely that the GAAP Operating Income for Q4 2015 will be significantly <i>higher</i> than the GAAP Operating Income reported for Q4 2014 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Q4 2015 AWS results should help that along.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The much <i>higher</i> sales of the items cited above should help that along .  (Surprise) </span>However, the really important factors from an investor's standpoint will be the outlook for AWS growth and the outlook for profits from the overall business.As readers can see, the TTM GAAP Operating Income has been increasing rapidly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the good Thanksgiving weekend news , this very rapidly rising trend <b>seems</b> likely to continue in Q4 2015 and beyond .  (Uncertainty) </span>That makes <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> a buy , even though the stock is up considerably this year . Remember, the FPE is about 120.However, this references FY2016 earnings.Once <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> reports its Q4 2015 earnings early in 2016 , the metric will shift its reference to FY2017 . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That should the cut the FPE of 120 <i>more</i> than in half .  (Surprise) </span>Look at the AWS Operating Income chart above in combination with the GAAP Net Income chart below to see how true this is.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Q4 2015 should be an even <i>bigger</i> replacement number for Q4 2014 .  (Surprise) </span>The P/E should go down.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Consider also that AWS ' $ 521 million in profit in Q3 2015 will likely rise to <i>more</i> than $ 1B by Q4E 2016 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if you conclude that the rest of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will only reach a no-loss , no-profit state , the <b>roughly</b> $ 3B + in AWS profits should amount to <b>roughly</b> 9x-12x the FY2015 GAAP Net Income . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one postulates another <b>approximate</b> doubling of the AWS profit in FY2017 , that would yield a ballpark FPE about 1/20 of the current P/E of 968 ( or about 50 ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>With an average analysts' next five years' EPS Growth estimate per annum of 60.40%, this makes AMZN a great buy, especially for the long term.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>A 60 % EPS growth rate with a <b>roughly</b> 50 FPE would allow for good growth in FY2016 , with even <i>better</i> stock price growth in 2017 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>A common rule of thumb is that the FPE can match the expected five-year EPS Growth estimate per annum.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's other businesses become <i>more</i> profitable themselves , the upside should be even <i>greater</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The recent huge Fire and Fire TV sales argue that such upside is coming.This is a great chart.The uptrend has been hugely positive lately.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some <b>might</b> think that this chart has to fall from here .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , the AWS profits , along with the improving Prime metrics would <b>suggest</b> that this steep uptrend has at least a couple of years to go ( if not much <i>more</i> ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>AMZN is finally becoming profitable, and that profitability is likely to be great.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When the company reports Q4 2015 earnings early next year , everyone will be able to see the then much <i>lower</i> FPE .  (Surprise) </span>Many people in the market only pay attention to P/E and FPE numbers.They don't know how they work.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They do n't <b>anticipate</b> the changes .  (Uncertainty) </span>Readers of this article have a chance to do that.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You can not know for sure what the Q4 2015 earnings report will bring , but the results are <b>almost</b> sure to be interpreted positively .  (Uncertainty) </span>AMZN is a "buy."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
