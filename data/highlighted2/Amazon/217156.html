class='textDiv'>Foxconn Branching Out Of Its Core Big Electronics Factory Domain Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd OTCMKTSHNHAF Seeking Alpha Foxconn has multiple future growth drivers beyond being a very large electronics device manufacturer Diversification includes industrial robots as well as investments in India and elsewhere such as telecommunications and ecommerce services Even without accounting for these new growth drivers Foxconns stock offers a solid upside using conservative growth assumptions which are below Foxconns historical averages Apple China slowdown and currency wars are just some of the many future risks and headwinds A return to historical growth of the core business plus growth boost from the new investments that are currently in the pipeline would mean a stock upside potential Note this article has been originally presented to my Seeking Alpha subscription service members about a month ago The stock is up roughly since then but still offers plenty of upside The figures have been updated to reflect the latest data available Foxconn Hon Hai Precision Industry OTC HNHAF OTC HNHAY is clearly operating in a lowmargin business The contract manufacturing side of its operations has a low chance of increasing margins significantly for a sustained period of time However thanks to its massive size its inhouse RD and production of industrial robots and other automation tools as well as its proactive drive to relocate factories to lowercost regions closer to the future demand such as India Foxconns margins are likely to be maintained and the company is an attractive longterm investment that is undervalued by now and should deliver doubledigit longterm annual returns Foxconn will most likely remain costcompetitive under most scenarios I would characterize Foxconn as a mediummoatcompany within a lowmargin business If the stock price paid is low enough the investment can deliver solid returns despite the low margins I believe Foxconn has currently approached such a low price area and should be bought for the long run The USlisted GDRs are not suitable for investing due to very low liquidity so I suggest trading HonHai under its primary ticker on the Taiwan Stock Exchange TPE via Bloomberg Although Foxconns sales are largely dependent from the final consumer demand and are inherently cyclical there is a large difference between buying any one specific consumer electronics brand such as Samsung Sony Lenovo HTC etc because consumers may switch brands But as long as they continue buying new devices yet to be invented as well as smartphones and tablets every few years and refreshing their notebooks and TVs once in a while I believe Foxconn will be there to offer its increasingly integrated services to whichever consumer electronics brand owner will be in fashion in any given time Foxconns strategy to offer a onestopshop service experience to brand manufacturers combined with its large size and low cost will continue to provide a competitive advantage in a lowmargin highlycompetitive business Apple is not going away any time soon but it could diversify away from Foxconn Despite recent fears of Apples revenue falling Apple will continue upgrading its products and come up with new ones as its customer base is very loyal and hooked to the Apple ecosystem Foxconn as a key supplier will continue benefiting from the Apple partnership Foxconns other customers such as Sony and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are probably not going to disappear Even if they do some of their competitors will likely take their place Of course the shortterm shock from losing Apples business would be significant and margins would likely be hurt so this is clearly a major risk Foxconn realizes this of course and has been trying to diversify away by expanding sales to counterbalance Apples gargantuan size Lowerend Chinese smartphone makers such as Xiaomi and Huawei contributed to a surge in YY earnings at FIH Mobile which is partially owned by Hon Hai and assembles phones and provides other products and services for nonApple brand owners India is one of the fastest sometimes the fastest growing countries in the world in terms of the GDP Unlike most developed countries and lately China India has a very favorable population curve that is not aging as much as other economies India is an overbillionpeople market where almost all citizens speak English in addition to their local language or dialect and the country has relatively central government policies and rules as well as a common currency In short the Indian market has huge potential to become the fastest growing economy in the next years Its proximity to China means lots of cheaper manufacturing will move from India to China as labor costs in China continue rising relentlessly Therefore its no coincidence that Foxconns expansion plans focus on India For example the company is planning to build up to new factories and employ up to M workers in India by as one alternative to cope with rising Chinese wages and labor disputes Another alternative is to employ more of its robots Foxconn is also partnering with Indian companies to achieve the goal for example with Adani Enterprises Foxconns other endeavors in India include a plan to invest B into Indias startups as well as its deal to purchase a B stake in Snapdeal Foxconn will also coinvest alongside SoftBank and Bharti for a total B into Indian solar energy In short Foxconn is strategically becoming so much more than the largest electronics factory of the world In addition to the initiatives mentioned above Foxconn also has ventures in telecommunication services in Taiwan retail business in China and its own ecommerce platform Foxconn will become a RD technology and services powerhouse but current services sales are still too small to make a big impact In Foxconn has continued to accelerate its technical development by obtaining patents ranking it the th highest in the world The company is also strategically moving more and more toward smart manufacturing utilizing big data technology to understand and anticipate enduser demand improving the production volume planning Foxconn also strives to shorten the manufacturing time and chain by moving toward allinone solutions integrating manufacturing services and ecommerce to the process Due to its large sales volume RD expenses comprise only roughly of sales While the lions share of Foxconns revenue is driven by the products category which has been growing by single digits the services segment has almost tripled YY between and showing the companys future focus However the services segment still accounts for only roughly of the companys overall sales so this is a longdistance run Rage against the machines all over again Foxconn is at the front of the next stage in the global manufacturing assembly and logistics revolution in which robots and AI will be replacing many human jobs This will be a structural change similar in magnitude and impact as the th century industrialization and the resulting rage against the machines movement Foxconns goals to have M robots working for it by this year have proven too ambitious in part due to labor groups backlash against human labor cuts but Foxconns own factories are churning out robots per year that are then used in the companys manufacturing process And the company is also preparing to market these robots to other manufacturers In short Foxconn is the largest assembly line in the world by most criteria and is now at the edge of becoming also a leader in the industrial robots area which will be in high demand due to cost savings and efficiency it brings to the manufacturing process Simply put Foxconn is a company to own for the long run The shortterm headwinds are creating a solid buying opportunity Most recent sales numbers from September show rising sales in US dollar terms H sales are crucial for Foxconn as they are seasonally very strong especially the Q sales With several Apple product refreshes and releases being recently announced sales should do relatively well in the second half of September sales have shown a YY sales growth in Taiwan Dollar terms Apples numbers will be crucial to watch of course For the months yeartodate Foxconns sales are higher YY in local currency terms Given the average level of Taiwanese dollar vs the US dollar is roughly lower YY at the end of September the US dollar YTD sales growth rate in US dollar terms seems to be around with the cautionary note that the recent months have shown much lower rates of growth Foxconn trades at a PS of TTM PE and forward PE below x The companys FCF generation ability has been at least on par with the net earnings so Foxconn trades at x forward PFCF My base case assumptions in a DCF valuation are a very modest CAGR in sales and FCF for the next years below global GDP growth and well below the emerging markets growth followed by zero terminal growth rates I am also assuming just FCFE margins and a equity discount rate Even under these conservative assumptions Foxconn is undervalued by with the midpoint of its intrinsic value at per Taiwanlisted share which currently trades at TWD per share I used recent depreciation levels as a guide for sustainable future FCF and because current capital expenditures are low and underestimate the longterm needs required to sustain the current earnings power and earnings growth The company often uses acquisitions to grow so lumpy capex in the short run is not surprising and is nothing of concern especially given the companys zero net debt Should Foxconn manage to grow at its recent historical growth rate of pa the company has a much more attractive upside assuming a equity discount rate Foxconns average interest rate on all of its debt seems to be well below with the average duration when issued of roughly five years ranging from two years to years The company has zero net longterm debt and has a solid net cash pile available equal to of annual sales This financial power provides room for further expansion to boost growth Since growth priced in is very low any speedup would offer a significantly higher upside Hon Hais Chairman Terry Gou Gou Taiming owns more than a stake at the company showing a strong longterm commitment and strategy continuity He had been first elected years ago More than of Foxconn sales come from a single customer Apple The development of the share shows that Apples share has been increasing and with Apples new product releases announced very recently this share could temporarily increase There is a large onetime risk that Apple will announce a plan to switch major portions of its products to a different manufacturer With Foxconns margins already razorthin the incentive to switch to another manufacturer entirely are not that high compared to the hassle However a gradual diversification of manufacturers is part of Apples strategy so there is a relevant probability that Foxconns share of Apples total production might gradually fall In case of a catastrophic loss of of sales entire Apple Foxconns shares have a downside from the current price which is a clear risk to the bullish thesis The drive to be the biggest at all costs could cause continuous stock dilution and low margins Foxconn has been growing fast and it has not shielding away to use stock and debt issuance to speed up the expansion usually issuing shares to acquire companies While debt issuance might be seen as mere optimization of the capital structure in light of growing sales and balance sheet stock issuance has been clearly dilutive Hopefully the high insider stake of over will protect shareholders from excessive stock dilution without corresponding earnings increase Hon Hai Foxconn is not a simple investment theme for the shortterm oriented investors There are many moving parts and risks such as Apples future performance and its potential diversification from Foxconn the currency devaluation wars in the APAC region and even the ChinaTaiwan political and military relations risks However the current China weakness and Apples possible peak of the cycle together with a substantial Taiwanese dollar devaluation created an ideal opportunity to buy Hon Hai at a solid discount The current price of TWD per share local currency prices in almost no future growth while Foxconn has been diversifying from Apple and venturing into new growth areas such as industrial robots India ecommerce and many others At a FCF CAGR in the next years followed by flat FCF Foxconn offers a upside If growth remains close to recent historical numbers around the growth rate the stock has a upside In any case Foxconn should be viewed as a longterm investment with doubledigit annual price growth potential but also with its risks Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on
