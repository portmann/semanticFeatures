Netflix needs to keep adding content if it wants to attract new subscribers but it has to raise prices to pay for that content which turns members away Well show below that Netflix has few if any options that can produce the level of profitability it needs to justify its valuation over the next decade Theres a leak in Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX moat The streaming service added just million subscribers including just domestically last quarter These results came in well below its already weak forecast of million new subscribers These results reinforce our belief that Netflix no longer has a significant competitive advantage When it tries to raise prices as it did for many longtime members this quarter it loses customers to rivals such as HBO NYSE TWX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video NASDAQ AMZN and Hulu Netflix needs to keep adding content if it wants to attract new subscribers but it has to raise prices to pay for that content which turns members away This problem is only magnified by international expansion To stay competitive across the globe Netflix needs content tailored to a wide variety of audiences which is why its now rolling out original series for audiences in countries such as India and France to make up for its sparse international offerings Adding all that extra content is incredibly expensive Through the first six months of Netflix spent billion on new streaming content up from the year before Meanwhile revenues only grew by However Netflix cant raise prices in many of its new markets where income is not nearly as high as the US In India where average income is just over month consumers will be much more price sensitive than they are in the developed world If Netflix didnt have such an overpriced stock it might not be facing such a serious dilemma The company could commit to a strategy of hitting a massive market and squeaking out razor thin margins or it could market itself as a premium platform and earn high margins from a smaller customer base that places a high value on its original content However as Figure shows neither option can produce the level of profitability Netflix needs to justify its valuation over the next decade Scenario If we assume Netflix keeps prices steady has longterm margins that are equivalent to its average over the past three years and grows subscribers by compounded annually over the next decade the stock has a fair value of just share today In this scenario Netflix grows net operating profit after tax NOPAT by compounded annually for years at which point it would have million subscribers Scenario If Netflix raises its price to the level of HBO Now cuts back its content investment to get its margins back to their highwater point in and grows subscribers at the much slower rate of compounded annually more in line with the most recent quarters results the stock has a fair value of just share In this scenario Netflix grows NOPAT by compounded annually for years at which point it would have subscribers Only a combination of those two scenarios allows Netflix to justify its present valuation and weve already detailed why thats not possible Even after the recent price drop it would still take NOPAT growth for nine years for Netflix to be worth share at which point it would have million subscribers compared with million subscribers after Q In addition to the headline subscriber numbers we saw a number of other items that reinforced previous concerns weve had about Netflix Free Cash Flow Continues To Fall Netflix continues to see massive cash outflows Through the first six months of it reported negative million in free cash flow That number actually understates the amount of cash burned by the company as it ignores stock compensation and proceeds from the sales and maturities of shortterm investments We currently show Netflix at billion in negative free cash flow over the trailing twelve months and that number should get worse once we get the Q for this quarter Reported Expenses Understate Real Cash Payments Netflixs reported content costs continue to understate its actual cash payments for new content Through the first six months of Netflix recorded billion in streaming content costs but paid billion to license new content Content Library Keeps Shrinking With all its investment in original content and more competition to license older shows and movies Netflix has less money to spare on fleshing out its library One recent count has Netflixs content library shrinking by over the past four years As its massive library contracts Netflix has less differentiation from other streaming services This article originally published here on July Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
