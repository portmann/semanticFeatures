(Surprise) </span>The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) is the world's largest aerospace company, designing and producing commercial airplanes, defense systems, and space systems.Boeing products include airplanes, helicopters, missiles, satellites, and advanced information and communication systems.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While obviously a stock pick of James Bond and other high-flying adrenaline seekers , the vast majority of Boeing 's revenues arise from commercial airplane sales , a <i>more</i> conservative long-term business with stable growth rates and large order backlogs .  (Surprise) </span>(Source: Boeing 2015 Q4 Performance Review ) While John Maynard Keynes would say "In the long-run we are all dead," I prefer Warren Buffett's view of a successful long-term portfolio being that of a snowball.Indeed, Boeing has rolled quite the snowball.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The aerospace industry is not as glamorous as tech or healthcare , sectors which many analysts <b>believe</b> will `` outperform '' in the coming years .  (Uncertainty) </span>Aerospace has been, and will continue to be, a stable business in the decades to come.According to Boeing's market outlook for 2015-2034, global GDP and passenger traffic are expected to grow by 3.1 percent and 4.7 percent per annum respectively, figures which are backed up with data and I agree with.Given these numbers, and running a discounted cash flow analysis factoring in (1) the current Boeing backlog of orders, (2) a conservative growth rate of 3.0% in future orders, and (3) a conservative growth rate of 3.0% in efficiency in delivering future orders, I get a target price of $190.85.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Pundits may say that all the <b>possible</b> efficiency gains in airplane production have been taken advantage of , and there are no future gains to be had in airplane manufacturing efficiency .  (Uncertainty) </span>I would argue that the numbers speak for themselves, and Boeing has done an incredible job in investing in the assets and capabilities that allow the company to move forward in gaining efficiencies in production, maintaining its dominant market position in the aerospace industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many public companies search for growth in places they <b>maybe</b> should n't be looking ( Hint : companies like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) that continually invest heavily in PP&E for decades to improve top-line growth and somehow never seem to turn a sustainable profit ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Other companies seek to grow too quickly, and eventually hit the "maturation" stage of their company life-cycle, where earnings and revenues stagnate and eventually decline.Boeing has done a fantastic job of setting reasonable growth targets and managing growth - management skills which are often significantly undervalued in the marketplace.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Boeing has a sustainable and impressive return on assets , and with a market capitalization currently valued at <i>less</i> than its asset base , profitable growth will follow .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It should also be noted that the quarterly dividend has been increased by 20 % in Q4 2015 , while the market capitalization of the company has dropped <i>more</i> than 17 % YTD , making many value analysts ( including myself ) salivate at the buying opportunity .  (Surprise) </span>Earnings Per Share (Adjusted vs. Unadjusted) On January 26, 2016 BA closed at $128.01 prior to the Q4 2015 earnings release.The next day, the stock dropped like a stone, closing at $116.58, and has continued to stay suppressed at the sub-$120 level ever since.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Looking at the financial statements , some cause for concern <b>could</b> be interpreted via the drop in revenues and earnings relative to 2014 Q4 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Analysts have also shown concern over the commercial airline industry and global weakness overall affecting Boeing's top and bottom lines.(Source: Fourth Quarter Revenue & Earnings, Annual Performance Review) We can see that while Q4 revenues, year-over-year, did in fact drop, the earnings per share on an adjusted basis improved.The 747 charge listed in the financial statements is statistically significant, and needs to be factored into the analysis.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( Source : Full Year Financial Results , Annual Performance Review ) Taking the longer-term view , and expanding out our horizon to an annual perspective from a very short-term quarterly YOY perspective , we see that on an adjusted basis , Boeing 's position <b>appears</b> to be strong on all three fronts : revenue , earnings , and cash flow .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What I see is short-term sentiment taking over the cognitive function of many traders , and I view such speculation and <b>fear</b> as both illogical and a massive buying opportunity .  (Uncertainty) </span>The current dividend yield of 3.64%, coupled with potential for over 50% in capital appreciation in the short to medium-term should make investors re-think their bearish stance on this industry juggernaut.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Industrial Goods , Aerospace/Defense Products & Services</div></body></html>
