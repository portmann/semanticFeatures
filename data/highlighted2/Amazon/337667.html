class='textDiv'>Can Boeing Hit In The Boeing Company NYSEBA Seeking Alpha Boeing has increased its total contractual backlog to over Billion from under Billion in an increase of in five years Total cash and marketable securities as of Q now total Billion and has grown Billion since Q Strong and productive asset base of over Billion which is higher than the current Boeing market capitalization of under Billion The Boeing Company NYSE BA is the worlds largest aerospace company designing and producing commercial airplanes defense systems and space systems Boeing products include airplanes helicopters missiles satellites and advanced information and communication systems While obviously a stock pick of James Bond and other highflying adrenaline seekers the vast majority of Boeings revenues arise from commercial airplane sales a more conservative longterm business with stable growth rates and large order backlogs Source Boeing Q Performance Review While John Maynard Keynes would say In the longrun we are all dead I prefer Warren Buffetts view of a successful longterm portfolio being that of a snowball Indeed Boeing has rolled quite the snowball The aerospace industry is not as glamorous as tech or healthcare sectors which many analysts believe will outperform in the coming years Aerospace has been and will continue to be a stable business in the decades to come According to Boeings market outlook for global GDP and passenger traffic are expected to grow by percent and percent per annum respectively figures which are backed up with data and I agree with Given these numbers and running a discounted cash flow analysis factoring in the current Boeing backlog of orders a conservative growth rate of in future orders and a conservative growth rate of in efficiency in delivering future orders I get a target price of Pundits may say that all the possible efficiency gains in airplane production have been taken advantage of and there are no future gains to be had in airplane manufacturing efficiency I would argue that the numbers speak for themselves and Boeing has done an incredible job in investing in the assets and capabilities that allow the company to move forward in gaining efficiencies in production maintaining its dominant market position in the aerospace industry Many public companies search for growth in places they maybe shouldnt be looking Hint companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN that continually invest heavily in PPE for decades to improve topline growth and somehow never seem to turn a sustainable profit Other companies seek to grow too quickly and eventually hit the maturation stage of their company lifecycle where earnings and revenues stagnate and eventually decline Boeing has done a fantastic job of setting reasonable growth targets and managing growth management skills which are often significantly undervalued in the marketplace Boeing has a sustainable and impressive return on assets and with a market capitalization currently valued at less than its asset base profitable growth will follow It should also be noted that the quarterly dividend has been increased by in Q while the market capitalization of the company has dropped more than YTD making many value analysts including myself salivate at the buying opportunity Earnings Per Share Adjusted vs Unadjusted On January BA closed at prior to the Q earnings release The next day the stock dropped like a stone closing at and has continued to stay suppressed at the sub level ever since Looking at the financial statements some cause for concern could be interpreted via the drop in revenues and earnings relative to Q Analysts have also shown concern over the commercial airline industry and global weakness overall affecting Boeings top and bottom lines Source Fourth Quarter Revenue Earnings Annual Performance Review We can see that while Q revenues yearoveryear did in fact drop the earnings per share on an adjusted basis improved The charge listed in the financial statements is statistically significant and needs to be factored into the analysis Source Full Year Financial Results Annual Performance Review Taking the longerterm view and expanding out our horizon to an annual perspective from a very shortterm quarterly YOY perspective we see that on an adjusted basis Boeings position appears to be strong on all three fronts revenue earnings and cash flow What I see is shortterm sentiment taking over the cognitive function of many traders and I view such speculation and fear as both illogical and a massive buying opportunity The current dividend yield of coupled with potential for over in capital appreciation in the short to mediumterm should make investors rethink their bearish stance on this industry juggernaut I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Industrial Goods AerospaceDefense Products Services </div></body></html>
