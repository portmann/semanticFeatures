<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Perks Youve Forgotten to Use With the recent news of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>changing how they charge for Prime and allowing users to pay on a monthbymonth basis it has many revisiting their membership and asking themselves if theyre using Prime to its fullest potential Its with this frame of mind that I wanted to talk about some of the lesser known Prime perks After all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime these days is much more than just free twoday shipping and some of these perks can actually replace monthly premium pay services and help reduce your overall entertainment costs One of the least used Prime perks is the free unlimited photo storage service Their cloud drive is secure and allows you to upload and access photos from your PC mobile device or via any web connection So the next time your smartphone or SD card on your digital camera is reaching capacity you can easily upload your photos to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cloudThe only limit that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>places on your cloud storage is with p video youre only allowed GB of storage where the Google free storage option allows unlimited storage The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Music Streaming Service has gotten much better in recent months and is worth revisiting Its improvements make it a fantastic alternative to premium pay music services like Spotify Premium and Pandora One For example all Prime Music Stations and custom created playlists now offer adfree listening with unlimited skips making it very comparable to premium services You can now also download songs directly to your listening device allowing for offline playback when an Internet connection is not available As a Prime member have you ever heard of a site called MyHabit If youre like most members probably not but its definitely worth a look as its owned by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and specializes in highly discounted clothing shoes handbags jewelry and home items The deals often in the off range are only available to registered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>members and minute early access to these deals is granted only to Prime members Once on the MyHabit website simply look for the Early Access logo and start your bargain shopping before popular items get snatched up by nonPrime members Its also worth mentioning that unfortunately free twoday Prime shipping is not available on your orders from MyHabit Their standard shipping rate is a flat Another perk that many busy families are not taking advantage of is Prime Pantry which offers lowpriced everyday essentials in everyday sizes delivered to your home The key takeaway to their tagline is everyday sizes as you no longer have to order in bulk and hope you use it all You can now order the amount that youll actually use As long as it fits in your virtual box youll get it delivered to your doorstep for a flat It becomes kind of a fun game to follow your box fillpercentage while building your online order Popular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Pantry product categories include groceries snacks household pet supplies and baby care If youve never explored this Prime service and you could use some help keeping your kitchen pantry full its definitely worth a look Are you a Prime member and currently paying for an online streaming service like Netflix or Hulu Plus If so you probably havent explored Prime Video recently For many users it has become an excellent replacement for the above mentioned pay services Improvements in recent months include several highly rated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>original series more monthlyadded Prime movies and TV shows and an easier to navigate interface My wife and I had our Prime membership for two years before we took the time to see if the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Family program formerly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Mom could benefit us Come to find out I wish we had used it much earlier as it saves us a lot of time and money every month Straight from their site <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Family provides Prime members exclusive familyoriented offers coupons agebased recommendations off diaper subscriptions and a Baby Registry completion discount The diaper savings alone would have been of a great benefit Also if you have young children the coupon offers will often save you on baby health items baby food as well as kitchen and beauty items I was just recently chatting with a college freshman and he was telling me about all the things he needed to buy for his dorm room I asked if he had taken advantage of the free sixmonth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime trial that they offer Surprisingly he had never heard of it and was excited to get the free twoday shipping on all products sold directly by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Its worth noting that other perks like Prime Video Prime Music and the Kindle Lending Library are not available during the trial period But after your sixmonth trial ends youll have the option to purchase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime for off the price tag at which point youll gain access to all the Prime perks How do you use <span style='background-color:
