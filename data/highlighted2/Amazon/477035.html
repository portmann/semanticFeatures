Tesla ; <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's New Planes ; Rackspace Buyout ? - Eye On Tech - Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) | Seeking Alpha Mercedes-Benz plans on releasing four new electric vehicles before 2020, including two SUVs and two sedans.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's new plane , the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> One , is set to launch Friday . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Rackspace <b>could</b> be getting bought out by Apollo Global Management .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is rewarding hackers who find security flaws.It 's no secret that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) would be involved in leasing its own planes to improve its logistics operations . But that plan is now set to go into action Friday , with the company primed to launch the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> One . The plane is an Amazon-branded Boeing ( NYSE : BA ) 767-300 and will be unveiled at Seattle 's Seafair Air Show . And no, CEO Jeff Bezos won't be the pilot.Instead, Atlas Air (NASDAQ: AAWW ) will be doing the honors.It's among 40 of the planes that the e-commerce giant has leased from Atlas and Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG ).So why is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> doing this ? <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Surprising</b> to imagine , but the company <b>believes</b> its logistics operations can improve .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But honestly , the move is just for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to continue cementing itself in our everyday lives . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> efficient the supply chain , the <i>faster</i> ( and potentially <i>cheaper</i> ) it can get products from Point A to Point B .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The <i>faster</i> it moves the products , the <i>quicker</i> it can deliver , and in the end , ( <b>hopefully</b> ) the <i>more</i> products its customers will buy .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The end goal is to soak up not just one-time or occasional purchases, but staple products as well.That's why the company has launched and continues to add to its bevy of Dash buttons .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It also sends a message to UPS ( NYSE : UPS ) and FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) that before it gets to drone deliveries and other futuristic methods , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is n't <b>afraid</b> of anyone . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Including its delivery service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tesla ( NASDAQ : TSLA ) is <b>perhaps</b> the most well-known producer of electric cars , but that has n't prevented others from entering the race .  (Uncertainty) </span>General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and BMW ( OTCPK:BMWYY ) have introduced electric vehicles, but there's another player entering the race: Mercedes-Benz ( OTCPK:DDAIY ).Reportedly , Mercedes will produce four cars in total, two SUVs and two sedans.The company plans to roll out the new vehicles before 2020, with the first prototype being introduced in September at the Paris Auto Show.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's expected that the vehicle will be an SUV , with a driving range of <b>roughly</b> 310 miles .  (Uncertainty) </span>Would Mercedes be a competitive threat to Tesla?Of course.Add in BMW and the California-based Tesla will have its work cut out in Europe, particularly in Germany.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But it <b>seems</b> as if Tesla CEO Elon Musk is welcoming to competition - and even encourages it , after he made TSLA 's patents <i>more</i> widely available .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Why <i>more</i> competition ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The <b>assumption</b> is that it will drive interest and public awareness to the industry .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Tesla is able to hold down the reputation for having the best electric car , the thinking ( I <b>believe</b> ) goes along the lines of having BMW , Mercedes-Benz and others drive interest with their ad dollars and branding power , which will ultimately boost Tesla .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For what it 's also worth , Mercedes and Tesla <b>could</b> also be battling for market share in the electric trucking market as well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Shares of Rackspace ( NYSE : RAX ) have been a <b>disappointment</b> for quite some time .  (Surprise) </span>Before Thursday and Friday's big gain, shares were down 22% and 33% over the past one and five years, respectively.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But investors have got a bit of good news to end this week : Rackspace <b>could</b> be a takeover target for Apollo Global Management .  (Uncertainty) </span>Shares have been flying since, up 25% from Thursday's open.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Reports suggest the deal may happen around $ 3.5 billion , but a Wells Fargo analyst made the case that the stock <b>could</b> be valued at $ 32 per share in a takeover attempt , a little <i>higher</i> than current levels .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>While the stock initially traded towards that figure on Friday, it has since backed off and fallen to around $29.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Perhaps investors are <b>hopeful</b> , but leery , as buyout talks for Rackspace have surfaced before .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Given that this situation has happened before , it really would n't be <b>surprising</b> to see nothing come of it .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But given that Rackspace has struggled against gigantic cloud competitors like Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , among many others , <b>perhaps</b> a sale makes the most sense for management . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Likewise , Apollo is reportedly looking to up its exposure to tech , and given the relatively low market cap , <b>perhaps</b> Rackspace would be a good fit .  (Uncertainty) </span>After all, Rackspace is trading at its lowest valuation in some seven years.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Buyers in previous years <b>may</b> have been turned off by the high valuation , but with a low valuation , it 's likely <i>more</i> attractive .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has always been serious about security.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So serious in fact , that rather than build a backdoor operating system for a specific case involving the FBI ( although it does n't sound easy , you know Apple <b>could</b> do it ) , the company refused to do so .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The fear , it said , was that it <b>could</b> be used to jeopardize the security of other users ' phones .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company was ready to fight all the way to Supreme Court if it had to.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And whether you agree with the company or not , it does n't change the fact that when faced with <b>nearly</b> all imaginable situations , Apple will side with user privacy .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In that light , it <b>seems</b> unsurprising that the company is now offering rewards for those who can find security flaws .  (Uncertainty) </span>But it's not open to just anyone.First, Apple will start with hackers that have previously notified the company of a potential issue.Then, the hacker or group will need to show proof, and upon satisfaction, Apple will dole out a reward between $25,000 and $200,000.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The size of the payout <b>depends</b> on how severe the flaw is .  (Uncertainty) </span>If the tactic sounds familiar, it's because a number of big-name tech companies already use similar tactics, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ).There's not much to dislike here.The company is finding alternative ways to keeping its most valuable asset safe, and that's the customer.I'm not sure why, but it sort of reminds me of an exchange between legendary NFL quarterback Peyton Manning and teammate cornerback, Tracy Porter."In one spring 2012 practice, Porter intercepted Manning on a series, then got burned by a pass a few plays later.[ESPN The Magazine's Ryan] McGee added: As he walked off the field, the defensive back felt a hand on his shoulder.It was the quarterback, who said: 'You tell me what I did wrong on that first play and I'll tell you what you did wrong on that next play.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That 's the only way we 're going to get <i>better</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Deal?'"I guess I'm not sure why it reminded me of that exchange.But it did.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Only this is <i>more</i> of a , `` tell us what we did wrong , and we 'll pay you '' scenario .  (Surprise) </span>Either way, I think it's good for Apple.Or at least, not bad.The NASDAQ hit a new 52-week on Friday, as the better-than-expected jobs report propelled the stock markets to new highs.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Macro View , Market Outlook, Author Newsletter, Editors' Picks</div></body></html>
