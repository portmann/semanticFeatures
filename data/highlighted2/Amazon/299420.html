(Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.No , you should n't short <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If anything , you might want to consider buying it , provided you hedge to limit your downside <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> currently has the highest calculated potential return of any security in Portfolio Armor 's universe . We describe how potential returns are calculated and show next highest-ranked names.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We also show an optimal collar hedge for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> for an investor who would like a shot at capturing its potential return while limiting his downside <b>risk</b> to 15 % . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Jeff Bezos ( pictured below , accompanying his newly freed Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian back from Iran - image via NBC Nightly News ) had a <i>better</i> 2015 than value investor David Einhorn did .  (Surprise) </span>Shares of Bezos 's <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) were up about 120 % on the year . Meanwhile, Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund run by David Einhorn (pictured below - image via Institutional Investor ) posted losses of 20.2% last year, according to Institutional Investor's Alpha , punctuated by losers such as SunEdison (NYSE: SUNE ) which was down about 90% on the year.Now , Institutional Investor 's Alpha reports that Einhorn 's Greenlight has been short <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , along with Tesla ( NASDAQ : TSLA ) and Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , as of last quarter . Should you short <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> too ? We think not.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>On the contrary , we 'd <b>suggest</b> you 'd be <i>better</i> off being long <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , provided you are hedged . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We discuss why and provide an <b>optimal</b> collar hedge for it below .  (Uncertainty) </span>First , though , let 's consider the bearish case for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . Greenlight 's most recent shareholder letter , reprinted at ValueWalk , does n't give a short thesis for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ; it just notes that it and Netflix were `` powerful momentum plays '' . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Presumably</b> though , as a value investor , Einhorn is offended by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's high valuation . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>And indeed, according to the valuation metrics below (data via Fidelity), the stock does look pricey.Price/Sales <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> : 2.8 ; Industry Average : 3.5 . These numbers all look high, and, except for Price/Sales, they are all well above the Internet retail industry average, which look high to begin with.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The metric a bearish value investor <b>might</b> focus on most here is the PEG ratio , since it takes growth into account , and even an investor as growth-oriented as Jim Cramer prefers stocks with PEG ratios below 2 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The main reason we 're bullish on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is that it 's currently Portfolio Armor 's highest-ranked name when ranked by potential return ( and has been one of its highest-ranked names since August ; as you can see here , it <b>appeared</b> in a hedged portfolio created on August 11th ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Potential return, in our terminology, is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next six months.Because our universe includes every security with options traded on it in the US , including stocks as well as exchange-traded products such as ETFs , we ca n't use fundamental metrics such as the ones we listed for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> above to rank securities , since they do n't apply to every security ( such as a fixed income ETF ) . Instead, after using two screens to eliminate the least promising securities, we use price action as well as option market sentiment to calculate potential returns.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Essentially , we start with the <b>assumption</b> that a security 's return over the next six months will begin to revert to its long term mean six-month return .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Then , we test that assumption by looking at the prices of options on the security that expire in <b>approximately</b> six months .  (Uncertainty) </span>That test of option market sentiment gives a forward-looking element, because it represents the views of option market participants on where the underlying security is likely to be several months out.We backtested this method by running our analysis every trading day from 1/2/2003 to 10/31/2013 and then looking at the actual returns of the securities with the highest potential returns on our daily scans over the next six months.Over that 11-year period, we conducted 25,412 comparisons of our calculated potential returns to actual returns, an average of 9.4 top-ranked securities each trading day.The average potential return we calculated was 22.4%.The average actual return over the next six months, unhedged, was 6.84%.Since the average actual return was 0.3x the average potential return, we use that 0.3x multiple to derive expected returns from our potential returns.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While a potential return represents a bullish upside , an expected return is the <i>more</i> likely result .  (Surprise) </span>Our current potential return for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is 30 % . To give an idea of the sort of names that currently score highly according to this method, these were the top five names in our system as of Friday.Note that our site is agnostic about whether a security is a stock, an ETF, or even a leveraged inverse ETF.Although the top-5 names have usually been stocks, as you can see below, two are leveraged bets against China stocks and oil, respectively.Other reasons to be bullish on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> are the company 's history of executing in online retail - is there anyone reading this article who has n't ordered from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ? - and its track record of successfully entering new businesses , for example , cloud computing with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It <b>seems</b> <i>harder</i> , at this point , to come up with a bearish thesis .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Yes , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a pricey stock , but that 's not new , as the 5 year average P/E shows , so it 's not something one would expect to tank the stock . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The most likely catalysts for a significant pullback in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shares would be a continuation of the recent stock market correction , or <b>disappointing</b> quarterly numbers ( the company is expected to release its fourth quarter and annual numbers after the close on January 28th ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 're going to use Portfolio Armor 's iOS app to find an <b>optimal</b> collar to hedge <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> below . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Whether you run the calculations yourself, or use the app, two pieces of information you'll need to supply (in addition to the number of shares you're looking to hedge) are your "cap" and your "threshold"."Cap" refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly.A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge.Since our site calculated a potential return of 30 % for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> over the next several months , we 'll use that as the cap . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>All else equal though , the <i>lower</i> the cap , the <i>less</i> expensive it will be to hedge .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other term , `` threshold , '' refers to the maximum decline you are willing to <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This will vary depending on your <b>risk</b> tolerance .  (Uncertainty) </span>For the purposes of the example below, we've used a threshold of 15%.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you are <i>more</i> risk averse , you <b>could</b> use a <i>smaller</i> threshold , and you are <i>less</i> risk averse , you <b>could</b> use a <i>larger</i> one .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>All else equal though , the <i>higher</i> the threshold , the <i>cheaper</i> it will be to hedge .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As of Friday 's close , this was the <b>optimal</b> collar to hedge 100 shares of AMZN against a <i>></i> 15 % drop over the next several months , while not capping an investor 's upside by <i>less</i> than 30 % : As you can see in the first part of the <b>optimal</b> collar above , the cost of the put leg was $ 3,460 , or 5.8 % as a percentage of position value .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But if you look at the second part of the collar below, you'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was $755, or 1.27% of position value.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Note that , too be conservative , the cost of the hedge above was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls ; in practice , an investor can often buy puts for <i>less</i> ( at some price between the bid and the ask ) , and sell calls for <i>more</i> ( again , at some price between the bid and the ask ) , so , in reality , an investor would likely have paid <i>less</i> than $ 2,705 when opening this collar .  (Surprise) </span>The threshold on this collar takes into account the cost of hedging, i.e., in the worst case scenario, the investor would be down 15% including the cost of the hedge (the investor be down 10.46% in the worst case scenario not including the hedging cost).Tagged: ETFs & Portfolio Strategy , Technology</div></body></html>
