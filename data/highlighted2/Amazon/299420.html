(Surprise) </span>The threshold on this collar takes into account the cost of hedging, i.e., in the worst case scenario, the investor would be down 15% including the cost of the hedge (the investor be down 10.46% in the worst case scenario not including the hedging cost).Tagged: ETFs & Portfolio Strategy , Technology</div></body></html>
