(Uncertainty) </span>But if you look at the second part of the collar below, you'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was $755, or 1.27% of position value.Note that, too be conservative, the cost of the hedge above was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls; in practice, an investor can often buy puts for less (at some price between the bid and the ask), and sell calls for more (again, at some price between the bid and the ask), so, in reality, an investor would likely have paid less than $2,705 when opening this collar.The threshold on this collar takes into account the cost of hedging, i.e., in the worst case scenario, the investor would be down 15% including the cost of the hedge (the investor be down 10.46% in the worst case scenario not including the hedging cost).Tagged: ETFs & Portfolio Strategy , Technology</div></body></html>
