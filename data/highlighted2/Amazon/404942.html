</span>Seller app to your phone and scan inventory in the store You are looking for items that sell for more on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>than what you can buy them for in

Because of the low barriers of entry there is fierce competition and plenty of spammy get rich quick schemes to watch out for But that should not diminish the fact that this is a legitimate way to

around Facebook LinkedIn Pinterest Twitter or Instagram You may take these skills for granted but when you translate these skills to small business marketing you could easily sell your consulting services to local small businesses Many small businesses are either too busy to worry with social media or dont want to take the time to learn They would much rather pay a professional to handle this for them That is where you come in You can charge a onetime consulting fee to setup the accounts for the small business or you can chase recurring monthly revenue by charging a monthly maintenance fee to manage the channel for the business You can offer packages to bundle your services and you can increase your prices based on the number of channels you manage for the business Pro tip Focus on mastering one channel and position yourself as a subject matter expert You may use all of the popular social media channels as a casual user but if you can deep dive into Pinterest for example you can charge much more as the Pinterest Guru Want more examples of businesses you can sell Here are more ways that you can start a business Another more slightly advance method of affiliate marketing is to become an affiliate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>products The concept is the same you refer buyers to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>products in exchange for a commission The catch with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is that there commissions are MUCH lower than ClickBank You will start at and only slightly increase based on your referral sales volume The upside is that everybody knows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Rather than selling a private potty training guide you could become an affiliate through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for name brands and refer your readers to physical products on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This gives you a builtin trust factor and legitimacy to your audience This method of affiliate marketing works best if you already have some form of an audience through a blog website newsletter or email list However if you are savvy with web design and SEO you could easily create niche sites to drive traffic to your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Affiliate links Pro tip Take advantage of the seasonality of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>th Quarter and Christmas sales make up the bulk of the traffic yearround on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Be sure that your content is ready to market by the beginning of November and maximize the holiday season referrals Fancy yourself a writer This could be your opportunity to write the next great American novel and get paid at the same time eBooks can be written on virtually any topic and can be sold through existing marketplaces like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Kindle Apple iBooks Nook and many others You can also create your own website to market your eBook and setup a content delivery software to manage the digital fulfillment for you A great recommendation to begin with is ejunkie The beauty of digital content is that you can sell it in multiple platforms and it is passive income You write the book once and then after your
