(Surprise) </span>They were interviewing Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), who has clearly done a great job guiding that company.In 2005, Netflix did $682 million in revenue, and this past year, it did $5.5 billion in revenue.Quite an accomplishment.Yes, there are a lot of competitors out there, but he has clearly done a great job.So he was talking about how having negative free cash flow and very low profit is proof that the company is in this for the long run, and he is 100% correct.We are actually starting to operate our business the same way, as I said in a previous post about Dell's new approach to growth.And this is exactly what you would want to see as an investor.HOWEVER, the problem with this is that most investors are not smart enough to do the trickle-down analysis of what this means.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) has the same issue , and it 's something I have lamented about over and over . What a good investor SHOULD do is analyze what the company would have made had it not reinvested.What would there profit be if the company stopped reinvesting and just operated normally for normal growth?That is exactly what you need to do to analyze the value of a business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Because at the end of the day , what is happening now is that with no profit and negative free cash flow , an investor 's eyes are growing <i>wider</i> and <i>wider</i> saying `` The profit potential is infinite ! ''  (Surprise) </span>Clearly, it's not infinite.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Clearly , a company with $ 100 billion in revenue ca n't make <i>more</i> than $ 100 billion in profit , which is also impossible .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Netflix , on a normalized basis , has 15 % in profit , its $ 5.5 billion in revenue would lead to around $ 825 million in bottom line profit , and at 20 times earnings - which is high based on history , but we will give it that due to just me being overly <b>optimistic</b> - that 's a valuation of $ 16.5 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now, I am not saying that its profit margin is 15%, because I know it to be.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am purely <b>speculating</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>But Netflix is currently selling for a valuation of $47 billion.Hmmm.So, based on 20 times earnings, that's a bottom line profit of $2.35 billion, which is over 42% margin.Not likely.The same goes with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . In the company's best year ever, it did 3.5% or so in bottom line profit margin.This last quarter, it made $75 million after making $500 million on its cloud-based AWS business, and that was on total revenue of over $25 billion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Not exactly something that I deem to be worth <i>more</i> than Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , which has <b>almost</b> $ 500 billion revenue per year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Either way , the point is that valuing something today for future potential is fine , but you also have to be realistic about it and realize that you have to let things grow into what you <b>hope</b> them to be , without overpaying today for that .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Make realistic <b>assumptions</b> about their profit margins based on other businesses in their markets and their gross margins .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's too easy to get stuck in a market like this <b>assuming</b> the best will happen , since it has for the last 6 years .
