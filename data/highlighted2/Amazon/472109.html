(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jul 28 2016, 15:41 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric McCaffrey , SA News Editor In negotiations with The Walt Disney Company early last year, Apple ( AAPL +1%) demanded an extended invariable monthly per-viewer rate to license Disney's channels.Other negotiations with 21st Century Fox and CBS Corporation ( CBS ) reportedly hit similar walls.The separation of terms between Apple and major cable networks signals Apple's demands as too aggressive or programming too expensive ( Google has this issue as well).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Networks fear a specialized deal with Apple <b>may</b> reduce the amount of money they can generate from traditional cable distributors .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple's style of negotiation has also reportedly not aided its efforts.Senior vice president of Internet Software Services Eddy Cue has let media executives know that Apple has time to wait and will eventually get its way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While looking for new areas to grow , Apple has so far not significantly innovated or disrupted in a TV industry it <b>could</b> stand to gain mightily from .
