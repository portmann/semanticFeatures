Ever heard of "Transparent?"Apple, meanwhile, has long been associated with music and movies just as much as it is known for software and hardware devices.And in the fall, television is expected to be part of Apple's platform.But Apple's television ambitions are not likely to impress unless Apple dabbles in some form of original content.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's what Netflix 's results <b>suggest</b> and it 's why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going to Hollywood , looking for ways to grow its library of original content . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>For Sirius XM, this all proves why it's model of original programming is now invaluable.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>No <i>longer</i> does it matter whether Sirius is <i>better</i> than Pandora ( NYSE : P ) or Spotify or ... fill in the blank .  (Surprise) </span>Sirius's original content will continue to give it an edge over competitors that merely broadcast/play what's already available on any other platform.Plus, that Sirius - by its connected car capabilities with Agero - continues to push further into the tech realm, gives it an additional edge where neither Pandora or Spotify can compete.The car is the next new frontier , according to Apple.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But the car is not `` new '' for Sirius , which already has <i>more</i> than 27 million subscribers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Not to mention , its self-pay subscribers are signing up at <i>more</i> than 20 % each quarter .  (Surprise) </span>Apple can't ignore this.Why?Because Sirius's original content has had a lot to do with its growth.This means if the auto is indeed a new frontier for Apple, it's tough to see how Sirius, then, is not a takeout target - if not for Apple, certainly by one of Apple's competitors like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) that's looking to play defense.In short, Sirius has taken everyone's best shot and lives to tell about it.With M&A having become the new strategy in media/tech, it's only a matter of time before Sirius' advantage in original content and in the auto becomes a "must-have" for any company looking to gain an edge in this new era of media.Source: Sirius XM: Why Apple Still Remains A Likely Suitor Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) The author wrote this article themselves , and it expresses their own opinions .
