How come we are favoring a long position on Microsoft in light of such headwinds?Although Microsoft would also be vulnerable to macro headwinds such as a strong dollar, Brexit and political turmoil, its growth prospects (given the prospects for the Cloud and LinkedIn acquisition) relative to its P/E ratio and market capitalization is still favorable.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the case of Apple and Skyworks , their revenues are highly <b>dependent</b> on the smartphone market , which has decelerated substantially , with resulting declining revenues for Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span>Hence, any macro headwinds would further curtail consumer spending, hence further stressing the smartphone market's prospects.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Meanwhile , in the case of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , although it has benefited from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) , it is vulnerable due to its excessive forward P/E ratio of about 76 for next year , along with its massive market capitalization of $ 359 billion ( although Microsoft 's market capitalization is <i>larger</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , its forward P/E ratio of 17.57 for next year is substantially <i>lower</i> than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , even if such a ratio expands to between 19 and 20 ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>We favor buying Microsoft shares as a result of Microsoft's exit from its Nokia acquisition, the positive prospects of its LinkedIn acquisition, and expected revenue growth from its cloud initiatives.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , Microsoft 's recent ability to borrow <b>almost</b> $ 20 billion through the issuance of bonds ( including 30-year bonds at a yield of only 3.7 % and 10-year notes with a yield of only 2.4 % ) also bodes very well for the company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite the possibility of macro headwinds , and potential related <b>volatility</b> , we would still favor establishing such a long position at this time .
