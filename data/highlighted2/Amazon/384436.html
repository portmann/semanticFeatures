Microsoft’s new Azure Container Service adds to the company’s efforts to grow hybrid cloud usage.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>New AWS offerings continue <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's drive to get as much as <b>possible</b> moved to AWS . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft’s strategy will win over enterprises not willing to move everything to a public cloud.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But the long-term payoff for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's strategy <b>appears</b> <i>bigger</i> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>While a lot of Microsoft 's ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) rhetoric has changed during Satya Nadella 's time as CEO ( just ask Linux developers ) , one message remains the same from Steve Ballmer 's time : The company argues a hybrid cloud platform - one in which companies are able to run cloud workloads both on their own infrastructures and that of a public cloud service provider , as well as move workloads between the environments - is superior to a platform that only offers as a public cloud , such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) or the Google Cloud Platform ( GOOG , GOOGL ) . Microsoft has gone to great lengths to talk up Azure's hybrid cloud support, and has also integrated its server OS (Windows Server), systems management software platform (System Center), and server virtualization software (Hyper-V) with Azure.The company has even gone as far as to launch the Cloud Platform System ("CPS"), an integrated server/storage/networking system (sold by OEM partners) that lets companies quickly start running cloud workloads within their own data centers.In a recent interview , Nadella elaborated on the reasoning behind Microsoft's hybrid cloud strategy.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's not just about appeasing companies unable or unwilling to move some workloads to a public due to privacy and security <b>fears</b> , but a belief that it 's <i>more</i> effective to keep some workloads close to end-users . ''  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>[T]here's going to be an edge to the cloud.It's not like all compute is going to be only in the cloud and there is no edge compute.It's not even just the device.It's not that I have a phone and that's the only edge device.That's just so narrow a view of the richness of compute in our lives.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` This thing called Azure Stack , where we are now getting so much traction , is because of IoT needs - not just the current needs that some enterprise customers <b>may</b> have for hybrid , where they want to have a private cloud for security , regulation , or what have you , those are also temporal , because over time they will change .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It will be for other reasons , where for sources of energy , because of the service-level agreements , because they are putting custom ASICs -LSB- integrated circuits , a type of hardware -RSB- and running things <i>faster</i> . ''  (Surprise) </span>Tuesday's Azure announcement - the general availability of the Azure Container Service ("ACS") - furthers Microsoft's efforts to drive hybrid cloud adoption.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Containers , which have seen adoption grow like wildfire over the last couple of years , act as a quick-and-easy ( and <i>less</i> resource-intensive ) alternative to deploying virtual machines such as those enabled by Hyper-V and VMware 's ( NYSE : VMW ) vSphere platform .  (Surprise) </span>Notably, apps housed within containers can often be easily moved between cloud infrastructures - even ones from rival platforms.Moreover, container movement can be automated between servers via software relying on pre-defined rules.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> offers container management services that can automate container movement ( among other things ) . However , the services are meant for clusters running containers within <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> public cloud . By contrast, Microsoft asserts ACS is "fully portable across any cloud and on-premises."In other words, it's a service that (with the help of open-source container orchestration software ) can be used as easily with hybrid clouds as it can solely on Azure's public cloud.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While Microsoft makes it <i>easier</i> to adopt hybrid clouds , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doubling down on its efforts to get enterprises to migrate as much as <b>possible</b> to the AWS public cloud . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company launched Application Discovery Service , which allows businesses to take an inventory of what apps they 're running internally so as to make it <i>easier</i> to move those apps to AWS .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also launched a <i>bigger</i> version of its Snowball appliance ( 80TB vs. a prior 50TB ) - it lets companies transfer all of the data migrating to AWS onto the appliance , and then ship the system to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> previously launched database-migration services for AWS , and also partnered with consulting/outsourcing giant Accenture ( NYSE : ACN ) to provide AWS migration services . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> CTO Werner Vogels indicated in a 2015 interview when asked about Azure 's hybrid cloud approach , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - though willing to provide some tools that work with both AWS and on-premise systems - ultimately wants to sell companies on moving <b>nearly</b> everything to AWS . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>"Slowly but surely what is in the on-premises world will start disappearing.Why is this happening?Because managing hardware is not a competitive differentiator for anybody - everyone has to do it.Often these on-premises environments are run by folks who have significant intellectual capabilities.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>could</b> be using them for something that really matters for your company , but instead they 're just keeping the lights on .  (Uncertainty) </span>At AWS, we've become really efficient at running data centers, so let us handle that."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So which strategy will end up being <i>more</i> lucrative ?  (Surprise) </span>In the short term, Microsoft's approach should help it win over companies looking to keep some cloud workloads on their infrastructures for one reason or another - particularly companies that are Microsoft shops to begin with.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And even beyond the short term , there are ( as Nadella <b>suggested</b> ) use cases where it makes sense to keep workloads close to end-users rather than on a public cloud data center hundreds or thousands of miles away .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But looking , say , ten years down the line , I think AWS has the <i>bigger</i> opportunity : The chance to get many enterprises to mostly or fully outsource their data center infrastructures to a public cloud .  (Surprise) </span>GE's (NYSE: GE ) recent announcement that it will migrate over 9,000 workloads to AWS, and cut its data center footprint from 34 to 4 over the next three years, is likely a sign of things to come.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft can ( and <b>probably</b> will ) get some enterprises to do the same with Azure .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But AWS ' much <i>larger</i> scale ( and the cost benefits that come with it ) , along with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's commitment to making it as easy as <b>possible</b> to migrate to AWS , means it should land <i>more</i> of those deals . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And in time, those deals should result in many billions in IT spending migrating to public clouds.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it.I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.</div></body></html>
