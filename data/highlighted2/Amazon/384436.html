(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>"Slowly but surely what is in the on-premises world will start disappearing.Why is this happening?Because managing hardware is not a competitive differentiator for anybody - everyone has to do it.Often these on-premises environments are run by folks who have significant intellectual capabilities.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>could</b> be using them for something that really matters for your company , but instead they 're just keeping the lights on .  (Uncertainty) </span>At AWS, we've become really efficient at running data centers, so let us handle that."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So which strategy will end up being <i>more</i> lucrative ?  (Surprise) </span>In the short term, Microsoft's approach should help it win over companies looking to keep some cloud workloads on their infrastructures for one reason or another - particularly companies that are Microsoft shops to begin with.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And even beyond the short term , there are ( as Nadella <b>suggested</b> ) use cases where it makes sense to keep workloads close to end-users rather than on a public cloud data center hundreds or thousands of miles away .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But looking , say , ten years down the line , I think AWS has the <i>bigger</i> opportunity : The chance to get many enterprises to mostly or fully outsource their data center infrastructures to a public cloud .  (Surprise) </span>GE's (NYSE: GE ) recent announcement that it will migrate over 9,000 workloads to AWS, and cut its data center footprint from 34 to 4 over the next three years, is likely a sign of things to come.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft can ( and <b>probably</b> will ) get some enterprises to do the same with Azure .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But AWS ' much <i>larger</i> scale ( and the cost benefits that come with it ) , along with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's commitment to making it as easy as <b>possible</b> to migrate to AWS , means it should land <i>more</i> of those deals . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And in time, those deals should result in many billions in IT spending migrating to public clouds.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it.I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.</div></body></html>
