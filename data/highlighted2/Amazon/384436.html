GOOGL VMW This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech column looks at Microsoft and Amazons latest cloud service announcements Microsofts new Azure Container Service adds to the companys efforts to grow hybrid cloud usage New AWS offerings continue Amazons drive to get as much as possible moved to AWS Microsofts strategy will win over enterprises not willing to move everything to a public cloud But the longterm payoff for Amazons strategy appears bigger While a lot of Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT rhetoric has changed during Satya Nadellas time as CEO just ask Linux developers one message remains the same from Steve Ballmers time The company argues a hybrid cloud platform one in which companies are able to run cloud workloads both on their own infrastructures and that of a public cloud service provider as well as move workloads between the environments is superior to a platform that only offers as a public cloud such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services NASDAQ AMZN or the Google Cloud Platform GOOG GOOGL Microsoft has gone to great lengths to talk up Azures hybrid cloud support and has also integrated its server OS Windows Server systems management software platform System Center and server virtualization software HyperV with Azure The company has even gone as far as to launch the Cloud Platform System CPS an integrated serverstoragenetworking system sold by OEM partners that lets companies quickly start running cloud workloads within their own data centers In a recent interview Nadella elaborated on the reasoning behind Microsofts hybrid cloud strategy Its not just about appeasing companies unable or unwilling to move some workloads to a public due to privacy and security fears but a belief that its more effective to keep some workloads close to endusers Theres going to be an edge to the cloud Its not like all compute is going to be only in the cloud and there is no edge compute Its not even just the device Its not that I have a phone and thats the only edge device Thats just so narrow a view of the richness of compute in our lives This thing called Azure Stack where we are now getting so much traction is because of IoT needs not just the current needs that some enterprise customers may have for hybrid where they want to have a private cloud for security regulation or what have you those are also temporal because over time they will change It will be for other reasons where for sources of energy because of the servicelevel agreements because they are putting custom ASICs integrated circuits a type of hardware and running things faster Tuesdays Azure announcement the general availability of the Azure Container Service ACS furthers Microsofts efforts to drive hybrid cloud adoption Containers which have seen adoption grow like wildfire over the last couple of years act as a quickandeasy and less resourceintensive alternative to deploying virtual machines such as those enabled by HyperV and VMwares NYSE VMW vSphere platform Notably apps housed within containers can often be easily moved between cloud infrastructures even ones from rival platforms Moreover container movement can be automated between servers via software relying on predefined rules <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers container management services that can automate container movement among other things However the services are meant for clusters running containers within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>public cloud By contrast Microsoft asserts ACS is fully portable across any cloud and onpremises In other words its a service that with the help of opensource container orchestration software can be used as easily with hybrid clouds as it can solely on Azures public cloud While Microsoft makes it easier to adopt hybrid clouds <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doubling down on its efforts to get enterprises to migrate as much as possible to the AWS public cloud The company launched Application Discovery Service which allows businesses to take an inventory of what apps theyre running internally so as to make it easier to move those apps to AWS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also launched a bigger version of its Snowball appliance TB vs a prior TB it lets companies transfer all of the data migrating to AWS onto the appliance and then ship the system to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>previously launched databasemigration services for AWS and also partnered with consultingoutsourcing giant Accenture NYSE ACN to provide AWS migration services As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>CTO Werner Vogels indicated in a interview when asked about Azures hybrid cloud approach <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>though willing to provide some tools that work with both AWS and onpremise systems ultimately wants to sell companies on moving nearly everything to AWS Slowly but surely what is in the onpremises world will start disappearing Why is this happening Because managing hardware is not a competitive differentiator for anybody everyone has to do it Often these onpremises environments are run by folks who have significant intellectual capabilities You could be using them for something that really matters for your company but instead theyre just keeping the lights on At AWS weve become really efficient at running data centers so let us handle that So which strategy will end up being more lucrative In the short term Microsofts approach should help it win over companies looking to keep some cloud workloads on their infrastructures for one reason or another particularly companies that are Microsoft shops to begin with And even beyond the short term there are as Nadella suggested use cases where it makes sense to keep workloads close to endusers rather than on a public cloud data center hundreds or thousands of miles away But looking say ten years down the line I think AWS has the bigger opportunity The chance to get many enterprises to mostly or fully outsource their data center infrastructures to a public cloud GEs NYSE GE recent announcement that it will migrate over workloads to AWS and cut its data center footprint from to over the next three years is likely a sign of things to come Microsoft can and probably will get some enterprises to do the same with Azure But AWS much larger scale and the cost benefits that come with it along with Amazons commitment to making it as easy as possible to migrate to AWS means it should land more of those deals And in time those deals should result in many billions in IT spending migrating to public clouds Disclosure Iwe
