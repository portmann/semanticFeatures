(Uncertainty) </span>But on the international side, how is as this global launch been impacting your programming strategy and anything sort of remarkable out of it that you would say you’re common on?First of all, we were very excited about the success of Narcos around the world; I think that we’re ramping up non-English local language programming.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We just finished shooting a series in France called Marseille with starting Gerard Depardieu that is -- that I think is going to be very large European audience , I <b>believe</b> we 'll get a lot of viewing in the U.S. We 've got more than a million U.S subscribers who watch French Television regular .  (Uncertainty) </span>So it brings us a lot of production scale when we produce content in France.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>hope</b> we 'll do more .  (Uncertainty) </span>We are moving forward on a series called Suburra in Italy from the guys who made Gomorrah.We had a great success with Club De Cuervos earlier this year, our first Mexican series for Mexico.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Working so , its working with great local talent , local producers , local cast and again in local language , so I think that will and I <b>hope</b> that we 'll have an original local language production in all of our major markets in the next year or two .  (Uncertainty) </span>Are you finding – we’ll go back to your earlier international market, are you starting to hit a saturation point where program as a percentage of revenue starts the level off as their subscribers sort of hit a certain level.Or is there any kind of relationship?We’re all trying to figure out how much hit has been programs where not just in a margin basis, , we’re also trying to figure out how much market share you can win based on how much you can invest in local programming around the world?So, I think I don’t know about it yet, we are trying, I mean, that’s the big question and certainly too.We’re trying to figure out.When we invest in programming the point of diminishing returns would be if we’re not seeing hours per viewer growth.So, right now, we’re investing, we’re seeing the hours for users grow, median hours for viewers grow and not just average, because the average will give you this like the outliers too.And so, we’re seeing that we’re still getting a good return on investment relative to engagement which generally is a good indicator of retention and then people come in and loved the programming, spend more and more time of their day with Netflix and they retain longer.So when you go into it, now when you get into the other new launch which is the local versus the global programming, what’s interesting to me is a market like Japan, that Japan is our first big Asian market that we’ve been in.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Japan is mostly Japanese <b>maybe</b> Asian content market , so meaning that 90 % of the box office in Japan is Japanese .  (Uncertainty) </span>And 95% of the TV watching in Japan is Japanese television and yet we’re doing 30% to 50% watching with non-Japanese programming on Japan so far.And the offering is pretty split.So we have a lot of Japanese programming and yet Bill Murray’s Christmas special they are just launching this week is in the top 10 in Japan.The Daredevil, Narcos, Jessica Jones is very popular in Japan.Beasts of No Nation when it premiered on Netflix, was the number one most watched movie in Japan when we first launched, so and American independent films rarely travel to Japan.So I think that this very concentrated local viewing is more a reflection of the business climate than it is of local taste.When you think about obviously some of the big launches last year, Germany and France, you’ve always in the past talked about well, over the course of two or three years we modulate our program and we build it up until we get the market right.How far along would you say you are in Germany and France in terms of fine tuning your programming strategy?Well, we’ve been thrilled with what’s been going on in Germany and France.We just mentioned that we’re past two million subscribers in that region and I think the programming strategy was greater than they’ve really have been attracted to their original programming.So in any given night, eight to 10 of the top 10 shows watched in Germany and France are the Netflix original shows and programming that we’re premiering in the region from other network.So, I think we’re getting it right and I think adding local flavor to it like we did in, just recently did in Mexico.I mean, we operate in Latin America for four years, before we launched an original language show and now we’re moving into local language programming in France up to just a year.So we’ve been accelerating the pace of it and I think it’s an important part of the regional flavor of Netflix.So we want people to love Netflix because they love the programming on Netflix and part of that means local language programming versus subtitle and dub shows and we want to be part of that as well.And I think we can, we have the scale to do that.When you launch in Southern Europe is there some way for you to give us a sense of how much of the programming that you need to hedge you already acquired versus sort of what’s left to go, because you often talk in the past about you know we buy in advance of market launches?Yes.No.I think what the nice thing in all these launches is that the thinnest library ever is in any of those countries is the first day we launch.So we literally are adding programming every day from the launch day in each of these territories.So we try to keep a lot of dry powder for licensing powder so that we can pivot in the market if we have too much drama and comedy or too many movies, TV shows and we change license regularly, so its – we still been following that path which is launching with enough titles to attract subscribers and then adding to that everyday.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And what 's really changed is that , I 've been in attendance at everyone of these international launches expect for Japan , I <b>could</b> n't get the Japan .  (Uncertainty) </span>But in those launches like we did in France and Germany we did, I think 137 interviewers over a four-day period -- days of press in each country and moved on, moved on.And the remarkable thing was Italy and Spain and Portugal we just did so all those other ones basically is describing Netflix, 137 interviews, four days of non-stop describing and defending Netflix to the press.In Spain and Italy and Portugal it was all about the excitement about Narcos and Daredevil and the original shows they’ve not been otherwise available in the territory before.So, these original programs have acted as a brand ambassador for us around the world and these territories we haven’t been operating in, in a way that has made our launches much more successful and much more focus on the quality of program than what is on demand.What don’t you have The Walking Dead, why don’t you have the – so the focus is really been about the enthusiasm for those original shows.The great positive reception of the original shows has been really, really great, particular sense we haven’t had the benefit of the marketing campaign, everything else we done inside of our operating territories.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I look at Japan as something as a test for the rest of Asia-Pac , if you <b>could</b> do it Japan than you can do it anywhere .  (Uncertainty) </span>Yes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Its probably a reasonable <b>assumption</b> that Japan would be toughest of the markets , big relative to how inferior the market is for programming and local day , but then a lot of media have not done well in Japan .  (Uncertainty) </span>So it should be a good test that if Japan does well, the Asia would be great, because the other territories would be much easier.I think so, I mean, we’re ready in terms of we have a great suite of original programming.We have a great suite of globally license programming.We’ve been investing in regional license programming for the territories, gearing up local language assets and local payment methodologies and all those things, so yes, I mean, that feels good about as we’ve launched in other -- launches so.So when we think about movies, its something that – its sort of new, and its interesting and its exciting and I think Reed has really mentioned to me as still something of experiment stage yet to be proved out, you’ve talked about a lot of movies that you have in production.How you’re feeling about movies in the categories so far.And in this golden age of television, right and Netflix is mostly talked about our great TV shows, a third of watching is still movies on Netflix.And our movies are old.I mean, most of our movies on Netflix, even when we have the first tail window, they’re 10 months after theatrical.Some of those deals are nine years after theatrical.So even with that, people are watching movies in very big, very resilient 30%.So I’m mostly enthused about the idea of improving the movie mix by doing originals versus doing more output, because I think more studio output just means more 10 month old movies.So if I had every deal that HBO show time, people would say, Netflix movies are old and they’ll be right.So, what we’re trying to do is trying to say, look, instead of spending another $1 billion on a movie output, we should spend – invest the $1 billion in original movie production, movies that you would see in the theatre.So, the Beasts of No Nation is an example of an movie that would be in the theatre, right.Movie on a remarkable scale, it scored hugely with critics, just got five award nominations for best picture, best director, best actor, best supporting actor, best cinematography.I mean, it s a really great film, a competitive film and it premiered on Netflix, and its only a Netflix.So movies in the output deals not only are they 10 months old, they’re widely available on DVD and DOD and hotels, an airplanes, so its not really a differentiator for our service having that upward deal.Now I’d say that knowing that we are entering into an output deal with Disney, which we’re thrilled about, because Disney is a whole different kind of an output.I was the Director of the Disney output because Disney is a solely differentiated brand among movie studios.They have some key franchises that you know with consumers.So you say we have the Star Wars movies that mean something.When you say we have the Avengers, and with the marvel of movies that means something.When you say we have Disney animated features that mean something to consumers.When you say I have Paramount movies that means absolutely nothing to most consumers.So our investment in Disney is different than any other awkward deal.I don’t think we’ll enter into large out scale upward deals in the U.S. anymore.We do think that well the fees that we are producing larger scale movies, original movies for Netflix that we are premiering and keeping exclusively on Netflix.We think next week we did release Ridiculous 6 on December 11.This is Adam Sandler's next movie.For the last 20 years Adam Sandler has done a movie a year in the box office to tremendous success, year after year after year.So when you say you have a Adam Sandler movie that’s a movie that everyone knows is a theatrical movie, he has never made a movie for television.And what’s really fun about watching this growth of Adam and watching I think people are going to really love Ridiculous 6 if you love Adam Sandler.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And when that people do that he is one of the most bankable <b>dependable</b> stars on Netflix around the world .  (Uncertainty) </span>So of all those 20 movies he has put out over the last 20 years, if we license them in any window, in any country they will immediately launch up into the top 10 in that country.People love Adam Sandler around the world.And I know the press loves to be beat up on him, but I’m telling you that not only pixels that just came out, the people continue to write that the movie is a flop somehow.It’s an $80 million movie that done over a quarter of a billion dollars in the box office.And he’s hugely popular and just emerging in Latin America.Remember we are a global company.Many of us had -- outside of the U.S. so we are looking at him as if he is a global superstar.And it is funny just like [Indiscernible] but the movie blended is the biggest, one of the biggest movies in the history of Venezuela, bigger than Titanic and Avatar.So I mean when you look at these numbers you look at like his box office in Brazil, the box office in Mexico are enormous.So we are really excited about the global audience for Adam and for Ridiculous 6 and we just wrap production on his second film for us called The Do Over.We are filming a movie right now with Brad Pitt called War Machine that we are really excited about.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We have upcoming Crouching Tiger <b>Hidden</b> Dragon 2 .  (Uncertainty) </span>We have Pee-wee's Big Holiday coming up with the Return of Pee-wee Herman produced by Judd Apatow and we are like I said we have about 10 movies right now that are in production that will be released by end of 2016 and we’ll enter into production agreements with for more.We are really excited about the category and about bringing it earlier to consumers and exclusively on Netflix.Well I’ve got about 15 more questions.I’m sure the audience had some and we ran out of time.So we’ll leave some for next year.Ted, thanks so much for your time.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So our reproduction policy is as follows : You <b>may</b> quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com .
