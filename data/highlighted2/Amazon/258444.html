very pleased to have with us A Ted Sarandos Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted thank you very much for coming today So let start off with just I want to get a better understanding of what your goals and targets are right now its just been a ton of change ton of growth in Netflix over the last few years What was defying ph professional success were you looking forward You know weve said many times we are aspiring to have take that for Indiscernible global So we keep chewing away at that effort yearoveryear and weve been excited with the progress so far for Netflix to be a truly global brand not available and relevant in every part of the world That makes sense The years are winding down so when you think back in you know what were the important dynamics from your perspective what was better than expected what was more challenging than expected The international growth as weve been launching territory by territory We used to we started out doing a country a time and then region at a time and I think in our last swing through where we did in this year alone we launched Italy Spain Portugal Australia Japan and I mean it was a pretty ambitious its a pretty ambitious year and they have all gone really well And whats been great about it as a company is that weve been able to do it with pretty minimal disruption now So we can launch a big it was used to be that there was an all hands on debt saying that we are going to launch a new territory and everybody will be focussed on that territory every minute of every day for weeks or months at a time and now if you are not you know on the specific team working on it you are very Indiscernible so weve been able to systematize that to a way where there we could do it much more effectively and more efficiently And to me it increases our confidence and our scale and our ability to scale You know were embarking on sort of the next fairly new in terms of in the media space global licensing and programming This is outside of our original like you know having shows networks and studio sells their rights to us on a global basis And I say I dont know if its more difficult than I expected but its not been an easy row because all of the studios and networks have situated themselves to the regional sellers So they have international sales teams they have an Asian sales team and thats because there has never been a global buyer so it makes complete sense that selling the Indiscernible one of us would have regional sales teams And now we are a global buyer buying global rights for shows and movies and there is some resistance to it but mostly from the regional sellers And people who are in charge of regional selling who dont want their job marginalized So thats something we are navigating with just the politics of the selling community Just a cultural issue its a pretty big change And at the end of the day its a real structural change that I think all of our studio partners are wrestling with because there is certainly efficiency to what we are offering It should be economically neutral meaning that Im not trying to get or what Im trying to use the scale to get a discount where you see us using the scale to get access So at the end of the day I think its something that will be good for the studios to have more efficient selling machines to be more self sufficient selling machines but you know we are kind of alone in this space of buying global rights You know Ted I joke sometimes that you have the best travel media because you have overnight ratings that you have to deliver So the sports guys they have some pretty fun jobs too but how do we because we dont have overnight ratings to measure you how should investors measure whether you and your team are coming in you are succeeding whether you are coming in short So we look at it as wed like externally for you to look at our net subscriber growth So as we are growing the subscriber base its because people are attracted to Netflix for their great content that they are going to watch obviously they stick with it because of the great ease of use and the amazing user interphase and the fact that when you push play at works everywhere in the world at all different broadband speeds and all different devices but what the attraction and when people come in why they put the credit card down is that they are attracted to that programming and they are excited about the show and they watch something and they get hooked in and watch you know been through hours of a show days and thats a very unique proposition and we have to keep delivering on that and I think that there are a volume of high quality original exclusive programming continues to grow and we measure it internally by hours of viewing per user and externally we would like you to look at net subscriber growth because at the end of the day thats that is the ultimate measure end of our house ph I think when you several onlines you are talking about I mean I think youve got now as far as I can tell atleast the biggest programming budget of any executive on the planet which is you know also part of the the fun part of the job but are there you know challenges and opportunities of scaling that budget are there difficulties you raining ph too in terms of size or is this all just scaling quite smoothly Its remarkably smoothly considering well have about original scripted series this year growing to next year We have feature films in production or just released or in pre production or post production Weve kid series these are kids properties that better produce four and only on Netflix We have over a dozen feature documentaries standard comedy specials documentary series and not just a lot of volume because I think that if you want a lot of volume you could go to Utube for free and get a lot of volume This is high quality stuff somewhere last year we had Emmy nominations Oscar nominations Golden Globe nominations so weve got I mean this is product this is programming that people want to watch Folks in most in the New York series I mean you can Aziz Ansari can no longer walk down the street in New York because of the success of Master of None And just this quarter alone weve released Jessica Jones and Master of None which are both ranked by most critics as the best ten shows on television on all of television So weve been able to scale this and maintain the quality and excitement of those original first shows like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black And I like digging in some of those series but first since you just went through the size and scale of next year are you still tracking towards almost billion of program and amortization billion of cash spent that the company put up Yes And a billion that probably would be the largest programming budget to your point earlier Thats probably the first time well cross that number Yes I was looking forward Are you still learning new things about the ROI you are spending or at this point you know given your size and scale and the history doing this are you at a point where you sort of really understand about the place Well I mean I like to say we have differentially in this standard market place I dont think you understand you ever Indiscernible golf he never quite mastered it and you want to keep learning and improving And I think every time we launch a new country we learn more about that region There is very little that you can learn about operating in Australia by launching in Mexico But the more that we are aiming ph to these territories the more we understand their global audience Its been really encouraging to see something like the success of Narcos this year Narcos is a show that is in Spanish its produced with a French film company It is shot in Columbia with Brazilian creators and Brazilian stars and it is usually popular in Germany and all over the world So it is really a tint of first flavour of what global television really can be And I think the more international we are and the more global we are the more that we can get better and better at that which I think is the next phase of films entertainment So lets talk about those originals a little bit It was a pretty big jump to next year but for the ones that you have released in it did seem like I dont know if you agree with this but a breakthrough year for originals You had House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black and now this year you can really put a few more up on the walls Bloodline Daredevil Grace and Frankie its been a pretty aggressive year and then I just at Jessica Jones I think the other thing you are seeing is a breadth of programming right so its not just geared Its not a type of programming which weve been trying to avoid you know being and having a show thats considered a Netflix kind of show because I think while weve learned by having an incredible breadth of license programming all these years and then our DVD packet our DVD days where we had over a titles on DVD is that you get you really get a sense of how diverse taste are and if you want to have programming that matters to people you have to have a breadth of programming and a lot of it to matter to everybody So something people have loved and so that people who really loved Hemlock Grove are not the same people who love the House of Cards but they are two big audiences So this year we did Grace and Frankie and Longmire which were geared to older audiences and our typical programming head bend weve been pleased that they both have skewed broader and younger than they did on network you know than Longmire did on the network and that Grace and Frankie skews more younger and female than we had forecasted going into it So its great that we are able to go after a different broader demographic but still please another audience too Well remember they both have different that neither of them have a real super power It sets us as goal Indiscernible as a marvel here But in the viewing fight they are neck and neck And then we are going to see in Jessica Jones and then you see that in Jessica Jones we introduced the character of Luke Cage and I think thats going to be real exciting for viewers when he shows comes up this year because they are hes the only one of the defenders who actually has a super power So if you are really into the kind of book shows its going to be a great one Its was interesting sort of Nielsen is trying to do Indiscernible television measurement and its early days but some of the datas they share with us they picked a week and I assume this was a cherry picked week to make a point on that for it but there was a week earlier in this year probably in the spring and the number one show on all the television including multi platform interesting that came off films in HPL so it obviously outperformed its sort of live rating Number two show on all of television including broadcast including cable was a Netflix show Id say that because they dont measure I mean the way that they are measuring in this Ive read this the data myself too and I think what they are I am pleased to take the number two spot but I think its actually number one Because they dont measure all the devices so they dont they are trying and in a world where you had four networks and all the viewing was on television the sample sets can you know you can extrapolate a lot from the sample sets but in a world where we are on Netflix watching happens on different SKUs around the world and they the viewing of any given show the mix between whats watched on a laptop and whats watched on a big screen TV and whats watched on our iPad the different show to show depending on the demographics I dont think those sample sets are probably capturing the scale of the Netflix viewing And does this make sense to you because I think when I talked Indiscernible I get the sense of all right Netflix has a couple of hits but really weve got you know these big shows on TV when the reality is I think now your shows are actually starting to get to some really big human audiences that people might not realize You know when Im not giving ratings its super Indiscernible to tell you that the shows are great are doing great but they are and they are among the most watched shows on television that is the interesting part of it And I think its not you know a couple of years ago it wasnt that long ago that people would look to the internet as a convenience source of video not a high quality source of video But if you wanted to watch a quick video of Tiger Woods getting a hole in one or someone getting hit with a baseball bat you know that was where you go to the Internet for Now Netflix is not only producing some of the best programs on television there are streaming in K in quality better than television So its a change in the dynamics of viewing both when I say quality I mean technical quality and logistic quality as well Even though youve been broadening out the number of successful shows that youve had on the original side I still find investors you know intensely focussed on the new originals that are coming out the next new heads And he has talked about going to shows next year like what are you excited about as you think about Not that we can go through all No but I mean Ill give you some highlights Were really excited about the crown which is a show we are filming in the UK right now that is a it is the story of Queen Elizabeth starting from the day that her father was born and she abruptly becomes the queen that will follow her entire life Its written of the scripture written by Peter Morgan which was phenomenal The show has got incredible pedigree Steven Dolgee ph directing The Pilots Great some directors directing these really lush huge scale television production that I think will surprise people in both in how it hugely entertaining it is but also there with the production quality which I think the world will be really impressed with Were filming a show here in town right now with Baz Luhrmanns The Get Down which is the birth of hip hop in the late s in New York and it is Baz Luhrmann production and its and everything you come to expect for Baz Luhrmann production So the first time Baz has worked in television we are really thrilled about that We are also doing we have two multi camera slick cons which will be first for us One thats called the Ranch that we are filming right now Warner Brothers in LA with Ashton Kutcher Danny Masterson Sam Elliot and Debra Winger starring in it about a cattle ranching family in Colorado and the revival of Full House Fuller House which is also a multi camera show we shot with an audience So its both the breadth and scale that are attracting me to what we are doing next year that Im really excited about Even though we are getting into some new kinds of things I guess they are called Stranger things if its super promising with these new film makers called the Duffer brothers which is used for kind of geared to their kind of cleaner ph audience but its suspense and horror thats done at a very high production level Fantastic I mean there are like there are like there was some recent brand affinity studies that put Netflix on top for kid for it involved the media brands for kids programming We have like I mentioned original shows this quarter alone We launched the Popples Glitter Force we are having our real success with these legacy brands You know these are the brands that we grew up onto and then now as the next generation is bringing up their kids they want to introduce some of the stuff that they like when they were younger but the new version is up like My little Pony and those kind of shows So we are investing heavily in those legacy brands They are great toy brands with but the more important is that they are a great entertainment brands I was personal curious like would you look at share by John ph or is Indiscernible something thats taking more share of that SKUs I mean that SKU is growing very fast No but its always kind of held its own Its a very Id say its a segment of overall viewing that happens in every household So if youve got kids in the household there is pretty good chance that they are watching that flick so you know about half of our households are engaging in kids content regularly And thats a global number So I do think that its an important thing thats why we are producing programming with some of the biggest content producers in that space and we will continue to and like out original shows Now I think the turning point is that the scale of viewing is such that it supports the sale of license product which is what I think was a strategic advantage of networks before was that you want to sell toys and while you watch your cartoon on Nickelodeon because thats what kids are watching and I think that is shipping and used more likely to be just as show on Netflix Thats interesting When we think about new areas of potential customer investment and I think on the last conference call there was some discussion of like shows and it was Indiscernible No the question it was sort of laughing because the question was meant to I think clear the air which was that we werent getting into entirely new So we definitely are not getting into we say it again we are definitely not getting into entirely new When I think this question was the form of the question are we going to compete with Vice So first of all Vice is a great very good brand in their documentary space and they are moving into a entirely new space with HBO We are not moving into a entirely new space with anybody So when I said Vice I mean because you know provocative interesting edgy documentary we do a lot of that So we do could provide some space probably but if there is plenty of room in that space But were definitely not getting into the news gathering space which I think is fairly commoditized and not particularly in line our kind of ondemand model So like sports the beauty of news is that its life And where people come in the Netflix where I think they are controlling the ondemand part of it I know this has been sort of asked and answered it might be a while before its really addressable for you but just for this audience longterm interest exports The reason I think is coming up is because I think people will think about Netflix is a substitution for cable So how can Netflix has sports So I dont need to have my cable I think people are asking that because they are frustrated with the size that their cable bill every month and they mostly continue to do it for sport And I think its really for me Im not saying that we would never do sports but just like news Im not attract The ondemand doesnt make the sports experience better for the viewer right Its the live So you want to watch Even everyone else is watching When you have never won the game and the same time everyone else does So its isnt core viewing strategy for us I do think theres the other problem which is that leagues have all the pricing power in that business forever So I dont if there was a model where we would create our sports league that might be interesting and ESPN with X game But its a pretty unusual thing to be able to pull off and its not really but were chasing But that was what would take to get me in the sports So lets move on to licensing international vertically integrated media companies that I cover at on cable networks are change in their tone to investors right So theyre saying perhaps they sold too much to Netflix maybe it wasnt a best idea to help few will compete online with your platform Have your conversations in relationship with the studios has been shifting as sort of weve heard from a top down level What youre seeing is a fundamental change in consumer behavior So people who use to watch television on scheduled are now watching ondemand product like Netflix Theyre watching its an SVOD shift not just a Netflix shift And the studios and networks who make that programming make a lot of money selling it they use to make a lot of money selling it to the programming where people use to watch it And now their belief the viewer has moved here So you want to make money you better sell it here So its like its really its not developing a new confident it just a different set of buyers The vertical integrated part thats something you guys you can explore with the other speakers today because its a very difficult thing to pull off because in particular I think in the media space But vertically integrated companies are not really built to optimize If youre building a studio to sell content you should be building to sell it to the highest bidder even if its not your parent company And I think thats the Rob I think in vertical integrated media companies Fox produces the most successful show on ABC Modern Family So theyve reconcile that selling to a competitors Its not like its unusual thing selling to a direct competitor So selling to Netflix is no different than Fox selling to ABC But I do think by saying in broad strokes maybe we shouldnt assault the Netflix I think thats obviously a foolish thing to say because the billion of dollars of benefit theyve realized from Netflix being an off net buyer have been wont have been replace with anything else Prices werent originally raising until the new buyer came to the market And were the new buyer that help them raise prices across the competitive landscape and thats what sellers wants How do you manage your portfolio When I think about sort of on acquire side youve got output deal store I think with as CBS FOX and Fox runs into and CBS still runs for quite a while And you in the past have said look were not in the output deal business anymore So in a way youre sort of waiting for those deals unwind networks on the other side sort of waiting for the deals to unwind to their more flexibly How do sort of plan for the future on the acquired side with sort of just uncertainty in the environment Well its pretty mapable meaning as our commitments roll off in our ramp up periods for original programming and global license shows ramp up we can you can definitely map it out on the spreadsheet whats coming up and whats coming on Its very hard to know whats going to be the next big thing right Especially the things that have not been even conceived yet in future output deals Ive been mostly disillusion in the output deals because the success ratio of any given network is not that great meaning that they have their share hits and their share misses And Id rather pay more for the hits and avoid the misses And I think they would do But I have the benefit in the second window being able to do that So I want to make sure we dont lose that advantage of having that Were going to buy in like a window focusing on the things that work and avoiding the things that didnt So the AMC deals one I think AMC we have a great partnership with them Josh and Charlie are great friends But the truth of it is and that whole entire output deal that we do with the MCL those year Walking Dead was the best thing to come of it And well have Waking Dead as a runner series show if they allow the upward deal And Mad Men is an example we licensed from Lions Gate and breaking that we license from Sony So that deal the output of it all was not that great for us and thats why we just And as long with long with our other output deals were most of it in the mix buyers So we thought about more for the hits and lesser maybe nothing for some other rest I think one thing that investors have been concern about tell us that youve done Yes understood Sometimes you find things that hit our Netflix it actually didnt work here So I think when I get back sometimes investors are concern that youve done too good job right Youve acquired lot of great Hollywood content that what might been inefficient pricing because it was before they knew you would be so big or they knew youd be so successful and the uses would be so high And so one thing that we all thing about is if we marktomarket all the deals that youve done historically today you might be paying a lot more or would you not by paying a lot more How is that going to work Remember its a competitive buying situation so we didnt have to pay we have to pay more than next than the next bidder right So they think like people think about this is unlimited top side of the content No you just paying more than anyone else would So its not that it Youre trying to forecast how youre going to get a ton of viewing or your business is going to XYZ If they could guarantee that I think people will be lining up to pay more But they really cant guarantee that and theyre programming isnt necessary exclusively responsible for the growth of the business in any one show This is the way I know David was going to be here later this after and the way he talked about how everyone drop this big business and his content Thats true I mean they built We built the big business for the great service in a lot of content and when we we just figured out is that some of the content not all of it but some of the content is remarkably interchangeable And in the case of Discovery when our deal came up with Discovery which had a very premium price because in the cable world the people the people themselves would be surveyed and they would say what are the reasons you pay for the cable and Discovery would rank really high on that chart So therefore Discovery would charge cable operators more for the channel Well in a world of equilibrium wed say relative to watching well readily pay for the programming relative to the watching of that programming because thats really why people subscribe and retain that they werent paying they werent watching Discovery any more than they were watch any or scripts or History channel So when I look at the sports that premium that was placed on the product we did not renew the deals and that went elsewhere and we replace that were other programming that was similar that this is much watching at a much lower price So I think there is a premium that associated with the brand but eventually there has to be some equilibrium in others if you have premium brand you have to deliver the viewing too And by the way I think that discovery will do that I think what happened what I think will happen from that Discovery well make more hard to replace content theyll make more content that distinguishes that brand to the consumer too not just to the cable operator I think this sort of discussion leads right into the who is the competitor it seemed over the summer they were fine everything that was coming out And theyve certainly really ramp the investment paying just a ton on programming Are they driving the price of higher for everybody and do you think there going to be more serious competitor going forward I dont know I mean their ownership structure is confounding so in terms of the amount of money they would spend for programming outside of the ownership of the three owning of the three networks at Donam ph which seems surprising to me theres been so much money directly with their competitor but theyre probably are driving up pricing on themselves and on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but were pretty strategic about were chasing and we were willing to pay for it so we have discipline enough to let some go when the price points become irrational and wait for the next one And now in terms of the competitive today I dont know endorse it but if you track thirdparty data the stand buying data that came out just today shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Hulu are pretty flat and weve grown basis points to of our honor with American traffic where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Hulu are both John I forget because its really just odd in way up here We are Hulu the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and basically flat just slightly up So you started talking about this a little bit of top but which was international and maybe well have time for a question on movies But on the international side how is as this global launch been impacting your programming strategy and anything sort of remarkable out of it that you would say youre common on First of all we were very excited about the success of Narcos around the world I think that were ramping up nonEnglish local language programming We just finished shooting a series in France called Marseille with starting Gerard Depardieu that is that I think is going to be very large European audience I believe well get a lot of viewing in the US Weve got more than a million US subscribers who watch French Television regular So it brings us a lot of production scale when we produce content in France I hope well do more We are moving forward on a series called Suburra in Italy from the guys who made Gomorrah We had a great success with Club De Cuervos earlier this year our first Mexican series for Mexico Working so its working with great local talent local producers local cast and again in local language so I think that will and I hope that well have an original local language production in all of our major markets in the next year or two Are you finding well go back to your earlier international market are you starting to hit a saturation point where program as a percentage of revenue starts the level off as their subscribers sort of hit a certain level Or is there any kind of relationship Were all trying to figure out how much hit has been programs where not just in a margin basis were also trying to figure out how much market share you can win based on how much you can invest in local programming around the world So I think I dont know about it yet we are trying I mean thats the big question and certainly too Were trying to figure out When we invest in programming the point of diminishing returns would be if were not seeing hours per viewer growth So right now were investing were seeing the hours for users grow median hours for viewers grow and not just average because the average will give you this like the outliers too And so were seeing that were still getting a good return on investment relative to engagement which generally is a good indicator of retention and then people come in and loved the programming spend more and more time of their day with Netflix and they retain longer So when you go into it now when you get into the other new launch which is the local versus the global programming whats interesting to me is a market like Japan that Japan is our first big Asian market that weve been in Japan is mostly Japanese maybe Asian content market so meaning that of the box office in Japan is Japanese And of the TV watching in Japan is Japanese television and yet were doing to watching with nonJapanese programming on Japan so far And the offering is pretty split So we have a lot of Japanese programming and yet Bill Murrays Christmas special they are just launching this week is in the top in Japan The Daredevil Narcos Jessica Jones is very popular in Japan Beasts of No Nation when it premiered on Netflix was the number one most watched movie in Japan when we first launched so and American independent films rarely travel to Japan So I think that this very concentrated local viewing is more a reflection of the business climate than it is of local taste When you think about obviously some of the big launches last year Germany and France youve always in the past talked about well over the course of two or three years we modulate our program and we build it up until we get the market right How far along would you say you are in Germany and France in terms of fine tuning your programming strategy Well weve been thrilled with whats been going on in Germany and France We just mentioned that were past two million subscribers in that region and I think the programming strategy was greater than theyve really have been attracted to their original programming So in any given night eight to of the top shows watched in Germany and France are the Netflix original shows and programming that were premiering in the region from other network So I think were getting it right and I think adding local flavor to it like we did in just recently did in Mexico I mean we operate in Latin America for four years before we launched an original language show and now were moving into local language programming in France up to just a year So weve been accelerating the pace of it and I think its an important part of the regional flavor of Netflix So we want people to love Netflix because they love the programming on Netflix and part of that means local language programming versus subtitle and dub shows and we want to be part of that as well And I think we can we have the scale to do that When you launch in Southern Europe is there some way for you to give us a sense of how much of the programming that you need to hedge you already acquired versus sort of whats left to go because you often talk in the past about you know we buy in advance of market launches Yes No I think what the nice thing in all these launches is that the thinnest library ever is in any of those countries is the first day we launch So we literally are adding programming every day from the launch day in each of these territories So we try to keep a lot of dry powder for licensing powder so that we can pivot in the market if we have too much drama and comedy or too many movies TV shows and we change license regularly so its we still been following that path which is launching with enough titles to attract subscribers and then adding to that everyday And whats really changed is that Ive been in attendance at everyone of these international launches expect for Japan I couldnt get the Japan But in those launches like we did in France and Germany we did I think interviewers over a fourday period days of press in each country and moved on moved on And the remarkable thing was Italy and Spain and Portugal we just did so all those other ones basically is describing Netflix interviews four days of nonstop describing and defending Netflix to the press In Spain and Italy and Portugal it was all about the excitement about Narcos and Daredevil and the original shows theyve not been otherwise available in the territory before So these original programs have acted as a brand ambassador for us around the world and these territories we havent been operating in in a way that has made our launches much more successful and much more focus on the quality of program than what is on demand What dont you have The Walking Dead why dont you have the so the focus is really been about the enthusiasm for those original shows The great positive reception of the original shows has been really really great particular sense we havent had the benefit of the marketing campaign everything else we done inside of our operating territories I look at Japan as something as a test for the rest of AsiaPac if you could do it Japan than you can do it anywhere Yes Its probably a reasonable assumption that Japan would be toughest of the markets big relative to how inferior the market is for programming and local day but then a lot of media have not done well in Japan So it should be a good test that if Japan does well the Asia would be great because the other territories would be much easier I think so I mean were ready in terms of we have a great suite of original programming We have a great suite of globally license programming Weve been investing in regional license programming for the territories gearing up local language assets and local payment methodologies and all those things so yes I mean that feels good about as weve launched in other launches so So when we think about movies its something that its sort of new and its interesting and its exciting and I think Reed has really mentioned to me as still something of experiment stage yet to be proved out youve talked about a lot of movies that you have in production How youre feeling about movies in the categories so far And in this golden age of television right and Netflix is mostly talked about our great TV shows a third of watching is still movies on Netflix And our movies are old I mean most of our movies on Netflix even when we have the first tail window theyre months after theatrical Some of those deals are nine years after theatrical So even with that people are watching movies in very big very resilient So Im mostly enthused about the idea of improving the movie mix by doing originals versus doing more output because I think more studio output just means more month old movies So if I had every deal that HBO show time people would say Netflix movies are old and theyll be right So what were trying to do is trying to say look instead of spending another billion on a movie output we should spend invest the billion in original movie production movies that you would see in the theatre So the Beasts of No Nation is an example of an movie that would be in the theatre right Movie on a remarkable scale it scored hugely with critics just got five award nominations for best picture best director best actor best supporting actor best cinematography I mean it s a really great film a competitive film and it premiered on Netflix and its only a Netflix So movies in the output deals not only are they months old theyre widely available on DVD and DOD and hotels an airplanes so its not really a differentiator for our service having that upward deal Now Id say that knowing that we are entering into an output deal with Disney which were thrilled about because Disney is a whole different kind of an output I was the Director of the Disney output because Disney is a solely differentiated brand among movie studios They have some key franchises that you know with consumers So you say we have the Star Wars movies that mean something When you say we have the Avengers and with the marvel of movies that means something When you say we have Disney animated features that mean something to consumers When you say I have Paramount movies that means absolutely nothing to most consumers So our investment in Disney is different than any other awkward deal I dont think well enter into large out scale upward deals in the US anymore We do think that well the fees that we are producing larger scale movies original movies for Netflix that we are premiering and keeping exclusively on Netflix We think next week we did release Ridiculous on December This is Adam Sandlers next movie For the last years Adam Sandler has done a movie a year in the box office to tremendous success year after year after year So when you say you have a Adam Sandler movie thats a movie that everyone knows is a theatrical movie he has never made a movie for television And whats really fun about watching this growth of Adam and watching I think people are going to really love Ridiculous if you love Adam Sandler And when that people do that he is one of the most bankable dependable stars on Netflix around the world So of all those movies he has put out over the last years if we license them in any window in any country they will immediately launch up into the top in that country People love Adam Sandler around the world And I know the press loves to be beat up on him but Im telling you that not only pixels that just came out the people continue to
