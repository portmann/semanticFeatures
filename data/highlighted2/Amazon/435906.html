Unfortunately, Yahoo's leadership team is so prideful (they refuse to admit they're not an innovative high growth start-up company anymore) and so dysfunctional (they can't execute the easy fixes we've described previously) that they're now willing to throw in the towel by selling the core business and allowing someone else to recognize the tremendous value and profits that rightly belong to current shareholders.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Of course there are <b>risks</b> to Yahoo 's business and the easy fixes we 've described above .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , there is certainly no guarantee that Yahoo <b>could</b> ever find a tax-efficient way to deal with Alibaba .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also , there is no guarantee that Alibaba and Yahoo Japan will be successful in the future , and they <b>could</b> end up being enormous destroyers of Yahoo 's market value .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Additionally , the decline of Yahoo 's core business <b>may</b> accelerate , and there <b>may</b> be far <i>less</i> value extraction opportunities than we are estimating .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Further , Yahoo may end up selling its core business for far <i>more</i> than the current bids of ~ $ 5 billion ( however , it <b>seems</b> unlikely they 'll ever reach a sale price as high as our perceived value of the company ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Yahoo is duping its shareholders.Specifically, management is so dysfunctional and stubbornly committed to growth instead of value that they're willing to transfer tremendous value creation opportunities by selling the core business instead of rolling up their sleeves and fixing it in-house.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Considering the company 's current activities and market price , it <b>appears</b> management is convicted to selling near the lows .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If you 've been a long-term shareholder , it is understandable that you 'd be <b>frustrated</b> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>At this point , it seems the best you can <b>hope</b> for is a slightly <i>higher</i> bid from would-be buyers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Because for management to swallow their pride and start acting in shareholders' best interest would require a small miracle.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it.I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Internet Information Providers, Editors' Picks, SA Submit</div></body></html>
