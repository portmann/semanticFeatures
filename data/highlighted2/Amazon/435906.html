class='textDiv'>Yahoo Is Duping Its Shareholders Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Yahoos leadership team is so prideful and dysfunctional that theyre going to let anyone other than shareholders recognize the huge value of its core business There are a variety of relatively easy fixes that could unlock tremendous value for Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO shareholders eg cost cutting focus patience and realigning the workforce but the leadership team is so prideful and dysfunctional that theyre going to let anyoneotherthanshareholders eg private equity Verizon or other recognize these huge profit opportunities Many articles have been written about the perceived negative value of Yahoos core business for example here and here If youre not aware Yahoo owns large stakes and respectively in publicly traded companies Alibaba NYSE BABA and Yahoo Japan with market values of approximately B and B respectfully And since Yahoos current market cap is only B billion less than B many observers use algebra to conclude Yahoos core business is worth less than Its more complicated when you factor in the potential large tax liabilities related to selling Alibaba Yahoos most recent Q records a B deferred tax liability related to Alibaba more on this later but regardless the market is giving Yahoo very little credit for its core business For reference Yahoos core business includes things like Yahoo Finance Yahoo Sports Internet search communication and digital content Yahoo has made a lot of mistakes in recent years For example the following graphic provides a high level breakdown of roughly billion in misallocated capital destroyed value since Marissa Mayer took over as CEO in July of Specifically Yahoo has tried to invent or acquire new opportunities unsuccessfully instead of focusing on the aspects of its core business that already work more on this later For example Yahoo paid over billion for tumblr in and its value today is arguably closer to zero And more recently Yahoo worked hard and spent heavily to launch Livetext in which was supposed to be a Snapchat and Instagram killer but it has not lived up to expectations and its an example of a failed product development cost ie misallocated capital Additionally Yahoo has failed to transition to mobile from desktop as shown in the following graphics image source SpringOwl Investor Presentation Overall Yahoo has been swinging for the fences and spending heavily in search of the next big thing instead of working to unlock and maximize the tremendous value opportunities they already have There are a variety of relatively easy fixes that Yahoo can make to dramatically increase value for its shareholders For example Yahoo needs to increase its focus As described previously Yahoo has wasted billions of dollars in the last several years on Hail Mary product development and expensive acquisitions instead of focusing on the aspects of its core business that already can be profitable ie Yahoo needs to milk its core businesses for as long as it can Had Yahoo simply focused on what already works over the last several years then shareholders would have an extra billion in their pockets and potentially more because the share repurchases would have been accretive Worth noting Yahoo appears to be feeling the pressure to increase focus considering this February press release titled Yahoo To Improve Profitability and Accelerated Growth By Sharpening Focus However theyre not doing nearly enough in our view as the workforce is still bloated and there are many big unnecessary costs that can be cut Cost cutting is one of the main easy fixes that Yahoo can make to help maximize shareholder value For example Yahoo spent billion on research and development in and they have very little to show for it And in a related point Yahoo is overstaffed The February press release mentioned above describes Yahoos plan reduce our workforce by roughly percent but that doesnt go nearly far enough in our view Yahoo should be focusing on the workforce required to support its most basic core businesses instead of chasing pie in the sky opportunities Yahoo is not the tiny highgrowth startup company it once was Other big cost cutting opportunities for Yahoo include selling unnecessary real estate and cutting unnecessary extravagances With regards to real estate Yahoo could arguably realize billion in incremental shareholder value simply by disposing of unnecessary real estate in Sunnyvale California Specifically they could sell this very high value real estate that they currently own outright and lease back only what they need Other unnecessary extravagances include the million Yahoo spends annually on free meals for its employees and expensive parties such as the million they spent on a Great Gatsby themed party in December Investor Presentationp Another relatively easy fix is patience with regards to Alibaba and Yahoo Japan Yahoos management may be able to unlock significant value if they are patient to find a way to sell their Alibaba stake in a taxefficient or taxfree manner Yahoo has worked on this effort in the past but seems to have thrown in the towel and now they want to throw the baby out with the bathwater by breaking up the company and potentially never allowing shareholders to fully recognize the possibility of a taxefficient transaction Similarly Yahoo can work with SoftBank in Japan the majority owner of Yahoo Japan to structure a sale of their Yahoo Japan stake in a way to maximize value If Softbank believes Yahoo Japan is undervalued which they probably do considering they own a very large stake then it would be accretive to them to reduce the shares outstanding by buying out Yahoos position Both of these opportunities Alibaba and Yahoo Japan require more patience by Yahoos leadership As mentioned previously the market is giving Yahoos core business very little credit after you subtract out the market value of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan As another example the following table shows Yahoos EVEBITDA ratio excluding Alibaba and Yahoo Japan relative to peers near the end of last year The result Yahoos EVEBITDA ratio is both ugly and attractive Its ugly because its so low meaning the company is not being giving much credit for its earning power But its attractive because it suggests there are huge value creation opportunities if Yahoo were to execute on the relatively easy fixes we have described previously Another way to think about Yahoos value is simply if they cut billion per year by reducing RD and reducing headcount then thats billion per year in incremental shareholder value Additionally if they raise billion by selling real estate and another billion selling patents then thats another billion in value for shareholders The good news is that someone whether it be a private equity firm or perhaps Verizon or ATT is going takeover Yahoo execute the easy fixes and extract these enormous value and profit opportunities The bad news is that current shareholders will likely miss out on the lions share of these profits Activist investor Starboard has expressed much interest in turning around Yahoo and theyve recently been successful in obtaining more seats on Yahoos board Relatively speaking this is a little bit good for shareholders because Starboard is working to sell off Yahoos core business at a premium to its current market value The bad news is that Yahoo is very undervalued right now and Starboard will be essentially transferring enormous value and wealth away from Yahoos shareholders and instead to whoever buys it because the buyer will ultimately complete the easy fixes that Yahoo hasnt Starboard seems to not have the patience to maximize Yahoos longterm value and instead just wants a quick small profit If a private equity firm buys Yahoo TPG Bain Capital and Vista Equity partners have submitted bids theyll likely take it private complete all the easy fixes that Yahoo hasnt and then recognize huge value in a few years by selling the reformed business at a very big profit This is really good for them but bad for shareholders Big dividend widowsandorphans stock Verizon Communications NYSE VZ is viewed by many as the leading bidder for Yahoos core business And in reality they are a near perfect match because they have great expertise in managing low cost operations and because they need Yahoos cash flow to support their big dividend payments Weve written about this before Verizon and ATT Big Dividends New Risks and Yahoo but essentially Verizon is having a more difficult time covering their big dividend payments and owning Yahoos core business would essentially help them solve this problem by providing lots of potential free cash flow A Yahoo acquisition would be great for Verizon shareholders albeit with new risks but bad for Yahoo shareholders because Verizon would essentially be eating Yahoos cake In our view the best solution for Yahoo is simply to replace the current leadership team with people experienced in operationally managing a value company Yahoos current leadership team is living in the past by focusing on unrealistic growth opportunities Yahoo has lost the search battle to Google they continue to lose their top talent to the likes of Google Facebook and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and they need to shift their focus away from growth and instead to maximizing shareholder value by executing on the easy fixes weve described previously Unfortunately Yahoos leadership team is so prideful they refuse to admit theyre not an innovative high growth startup company anymore and so dysfunctional they cant execute the easy fixes weve described previously that theyre now willing to throw in the towel by selling the core business and allowing someone else to recognize the tremendous value and profits that rightly belong to current shareholders Of course there are risks to Yahoos business and the easy fixes weve described above For example there is certainly no guarantee that Yahoo could ever find a taxefficient way to deal with Alibaba Also there is no guarantee that Alibaba and Yahoo Japan will be successful in the future and they could end up being enormous destroyers of Yahoos market value Additionally the decline of Yahoos core business may accelerate and there may be far less value extraction opportunities than we are estimating Further Yahoo may end up selling its core business for far more than the current bids of billion however it seems unlikely theyll ever reach a sale price as high as our perceived value of the company Yahoo is duping its shareholders Specifically management is so dysfunctional and stubbornly committed to growth instead of value that theyre willing to transfer tremendous value creation opportunities by selling the core business instead of rolling up their sleeves and fixing it inhouse Considering the companys current activities and market price it appears management is convicted to selling near the lows If youve been a longterm shareholder it is understandable that youd be frustrated At this point it seems the best you can hope for is a slightly higher bid from wouldbe buyers Because for management to swallow their pride and start acting in shareholders best interest would require a small miracle Disclosure Iwe have no
