One thing to keep in mind is the CEO's of both companies, Musk and Jeff Bezos, own rocket and space exploration companies ( Blue Origin and Space Exploration Technologies, or SpacEx).Both have also recently accomplished feats previously unheard of , and are well on the way to really expanding the reach of humanity.I am already long Tesla, but I see room to grow into the future as Tesla really proves itself out to the market with multiple years of offering multiple products and really gains some experience (And yes, profits).If Tesla goes anywhere below 200 I would rate it a strong buy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think that SolarCity is the <b>riskiest</b> of the plays , but that they are a buy anytime before their panel manufacturing plant comes online when they really should be able to drop their cost per kwh installation price and increase profits ( plus realize a return on their massive ongoing investment ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock has recently taken a beating and recovered nicely, but is still nowhere near all time highs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With the recent bankruptcy of Sunedison ( OTCPK : SUNEQ ) the solar market has been experiencing some skepticism but I <b>believe</b> this is temporary .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One thing to keep in mind with SCTY and TSLA however , are that both companies are very synergistic , with Tesla supplying stationary battery for solar panel system storage for SolarCity , plus being a huge buyer of solar panels for their GigaFactory and ( I <b>assume</b> once the SolarCity plant goes live ) to finish outfitting the Supercharger network .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Tesla has already shown itself to be an extremely unconventional automaker , choosing to in-source unique parts rather than compromise on design , such as the seats in the Model X. Tesla is vertically integrating with suppliers like Panasonic to have <i>more</i> control over the battery technology they utilize , whether it be thermal management and regulation packs , the cell chemistry themselves , or some other battery form factor related decision .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To increase control over costs and de-risk supply chain issues they are looking to find <i>more</i> suppliers , as well as creating joint ventures at the Gigafactory with everyone from prospective Lithium mining companies to other battery technology suppliers like LG and Samsung .  (Surprise) </span>Tesla also vertically integrated on the consumer end, choosing to maintain control over their service and sales centers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This allows them to see problems on their vehicles <i>sooner</i> , maintaining a dialogue with the `` front lines '' of sales and repairmen .  (Surprise) </span>This also allows them to control the customer experience to a finer degree.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Even on the road Tesla maintains its relationship with the customer by providing Super and Destination charger networks if the adapters for the standard ( and <i>slower</i> ) charging networks are not enough for you .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Tesla has also begun direct leasing services , making them even <i>more</i> similar to a dealership , which is basically just an independently owned financing , marketing and servicing outlet for most manufacturer 's .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If Tesla chooses to implement a Mobility Service offering similar to Uber or BMW 's , then they will control much <i>more</i> of the things required to run the company than Lyft or another transport company <b>might</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Even Google and Apple, if they make a full venture into the car space, are likely to outsource or partner for the manufacturing of the actual vehicles.A good analogy for how Tesla focuses on vertical integration and approaches the supply chain and manufacturing comes from the recent 2016 Annual Shareholders Meeting .Musk and J.B. Straubel talked about a 3x Gigafactory potential output (above the initial 50GW planned for) that was accomplished from an engineering approach on the entire building.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In essence , they said that `` Designing the machine that designs the machine makes the same amount of effort of improvement have orders of magnitude <i>more</i> effect . ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They also referenced the same quote 2 <i>more</i> times , one in regards to general manufacturing , and one in regards to raw material extraction ( Lithium specifically ) .  (Surprise) </span>Compared to vehicle's from the other automakers, like GM's Chevy Bolt (NYSE: GM ), which really should be the LG Chevy Bolt due to the sourcing, Tesla contrasts starkly.As a separate example of how Musk approaches vertical integration, with his Falcon rockets at Spacex, he made the first US based engine capable of bringing astronauts to the space station while competitors like ULA are stuck using Russian-sourced engines, not exactly ideal with changing political climates.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas</div></body></html>
