class='textDiv'>Best Buy Falling Behind On Growth Best Buy Co NYSEBBY Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was recently credited with of new sales growth in the consumer electronics market and is quickly approaching Best Buys overall market share Best Buys two strategies to challenge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are not enough to brighten its longterm prospects Best Buy competes strongly in key metrics of price choice and convenience but Amazons growth and popularity especially of Prime is a tough obstacle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is the antagonist in many a retailers recent past as it drives more and more traffic to its platform It is touted as more convenient and cheaper than traditional retail Consumers also favor extensive online reviews and a large range of choices two advantages of the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>increasingly competes with specialized retailers in specific markets Today we take a look at one of these markets Best Buy NYSE BBY and Amazons competition over the consumer electronics market Quartz recently reported that Best Buy registers just over of its sales online but is the leader in terms of overall consumer electronics market share Unsurprisingly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in second place is closing the gap What is somewhat shocking is how fast Earlier this month a Deutsche Bank report found that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>accounted for of the sales growth of consumer electronics in In sales of consumer electronics sales grew for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>compared to at Best Buy Consequently Amazons overall market share is steadily rising while Best Buys sinks or stagnates year after year What draws people to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Of course there are price and convenience considerations as well as the expansive product offerings and reviews The reviews are particularly important though not often mentioned as consumer opinions posted online was the second mosttrusted source of product reviews after friend and family recommendations in the Nielsen Global Trust in Advertising Reports nonsponsored section When including sponsored company advertising trust in branded websites is even higher than in consumer opinions at in the report For some retailers there is a lack of critical mass of consumer reviews to allow them to capitalize on both of these high trust areas For Best Buy this is not the case It has extensive reviews on its products often in the thousands which satisfies and often exceeds the bar set by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>We compared the price choices and convenience of identical products coming from both companies For our purpose we used the algorithms of both Best Buy and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and will compare the first result skipping Amazons sponsored content on each for price and convenience We assumed that this allowed each company to put its best foot forward as well as shows what a consumer would initially see and most likely purchase We also saw these first results as the most likely to be compared by consumers across platforms If the first result was not offered on the other platform we noted it and moved to the next product We used the Consumer Technology Associations study on the fastest growing fields of tech device home ownership from to The CTA found the largest gains in portable wireless speakers up to of households Using this admittedly anecdotal example as a base we can speak to several broader trends in the two companies strategies We searched portable wireless speaker on both platforms The first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>result was an on sale JBL Charge for with free standard shipping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had several at the same price with free shipping through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime and its day shipping It is worth noting that a June Forbes survey found of American adults subscribed to Prime with substantial numbers considering membership Additionally Prime boasted high renewal rates on subscriptions and conversions from free trials Students increasingly reliant on technology for convenience are targeted with a free sixmonth trial then a discount on Prime membership Usually orders including this one that come through Fulfillment by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>vendors are eligible for free shipping after crossing for those without Prime For pricier consumer technology good this threshold is often easily met but even if not can be bundled with other purchases to meet the requirement The first three results on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>were not accessible on Best Buy but the fourth was the JBL Flip Portable Bluetooth Speaker On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it was at with free shipping while Best Buy had it at with free shipping This brings up Best Buys Price Match Guarantee a bid to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and others that are listed prominently above the price We do not believe it will have a substantial impact on the longterm value of the company in its current form as it requires calling the company and navigating a representative to the competitors website or going to a physical location We see no strong reason why consumers would go through this process rather than buy through an equally trusted source like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>We ran the two companies on our platform analytics to show the bigger picture of total shareholder return Note The Median Peer Set represents <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Best Buys total shareholder return since has stayed under over the past six months Even at its peak in December of the return did not top At close on June nd it was just over On the other hand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>represented by the peer set closed June nd at nearly total shareholder return It has experienced its most dramatic uptick during the last year Despite some advocates Best Buys storewithinastore format from way back in is not going to stem this tide While it is nice to have associates of particular brands around the store the Internet is increasingly making such concentrated expertise obsolete Online consumers can follow the reviews of industry experts the market of consumers as a whole and peers Instead of what is often a sales pitch more than a balanced review of options in the store consumers can feel more confident of objective information from multiple sources online Convenience price and reviews reign supreme in the consumer electronics field Best Buy is not far off in price and from quick searches it seemed to often match Amazons price and even beat it substantially on clearance items <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seemed to have the edge on product offerings unsurprising given its vendor setup In convenience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a clear and growing advantage more people are joining and renewing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime to get access to products quickly at free shipping The shipping from Best Buy does not match the speed of free twoday shipping of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Both sites offer extensive consumer reviews and we find that often Best Buy has the edge in sheer number though at a point extra reviews become irrelevant It seems like in a lot of ways the huge growth by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is simply based on popularity consumers are increasingly able to find anything they need there at what they trust is the most competitive price Then they can receive it quickly through their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime membership Even those not on Prime can buy one larger item or bundle a few unrelated items to take advantage of Amazons free shipping past the threshold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>owning of the new sales growth in consumer electronics while not even being the market leader in the category is a huge indicator to us of Best Buys tenuous leadership position and longterm prospects Best Buys strategies to combat the growth of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the price match guarantee and storewithinastore do not seem sufficient to us The price match does not incentivize customers to move away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and the instore expertise is hampered by the prevalence of information online Interested in
