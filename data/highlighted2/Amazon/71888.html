training we still are buying diapers I remember when we first started getting ready for our son to come home and was told how many diapers they can go through a day Wait diapers a day Dang Boy was I clueless back then You really learn a lot when a new baby is brought into the world We are not what you call brand loyal when it comes to diapers We did stick with Pampers for some time but thats just because we knew of the brand We didnt know any better Over time we started looking at different brands mostly to save money Luckily for us our son doesnt have any reactions to the diapers like some kids do Before you jump on us we did have aspirations to try cloth diapers W even bought a couple sets That was before I had to handle the first poopy diaper You can call me what you want but poop is not something I care to deal with Never liked smelling it and sometimes it would overwhelm me Whew did I have some gag moments when our son was young That feeling alone made me want to wrap up that nasty mess and toss the diaper outside in the trash I didnt feel like cleaning cloth diapers nor did I even want to handle them Dont get me wrong they are a great deal if youre up for it They cost less than disposable in the long run but sometimes convenience trumps savings in my book Poopfilled diapers is one of those times As I mentioned we stuck with Pampers for some time then we moved to Huggies but those didnt fit very well We tried out some generic brands from Target and Walmart We went back to Pampers just because they worked A few months later Pampers came out with their new diapers to hold more fluid Well that didnt turn out well for us Every time we would get our son up in the morning he would be covered in urinesoaked diaper filling No better way to start the morning than cleaning up your child because the diapers exploded We used the rest of the box and that was the end of our Pampers run We have since switched to Luvs and we like that brand They are cheaper and hold a good amount plus they fit well I dont think well switch any time soon Lets hope the whole diaper thing is getting closer to being behind us Now I know many people who save a ton of money on diapers They cut coupons like a crazy person but they have some serious savings Now I do buy the diapers in bulk when theyre on sale but with regards to coupons I dont do a very good job Im not going to lie about that There are many ways to save on diapers but I wanted to share one way which we will be taking advantage of when we have another child Im sure some of you have heard of this secretive
