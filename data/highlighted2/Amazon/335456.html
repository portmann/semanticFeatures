overseas How do they intend to turn things around while growing at a breakneck speed with their subscriber base I think most people would agree that someday in the future we all will be watching TV exclusively streamed through the Internet The web is already powering significant portions of our of our lives through offerings such as ecommerce internet banking communication collaboration breaking news live sportscasts streamed television programming and so on With every passing day millions of users are added to an everwidening net that makes life more convenient brings people closer and transcends borders like nothing before or since I believe that at one point every other mode of access to the world save the physical one will be superseded by internet access With highspeed internet accessibility growing by leaps and bounds its the natural culmination of a phenomenon that began with the ARPANET and similar networks as early as the s More than half a century later the internet has safely embedded itself into the fabric of our lives and awaits the greatest coup in the history of technology One of the biggest impacts the internet has had over the past to years is the way media is streamed to our homes and companies such as Netflix NASDAQ NFLX Hulu and Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Prime Video division are the instruments of that upheaval in the way media is broadcast The broadcasting industry is still under the control of major media conglomerates such as Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA Walt Disney NYSE DIS TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA and Time Warner NYSE TWX but even they are succumbing to the pressure of increasing demand for internetready content If traditional television broadcasting will become obsolete over the course of this century is highly debatable yet there is strong evidence that internet viewership for streamed content is quickly overtaking the preference for live TV viewing Heres an excerpt from an interesting report about a Deloitte study on viewer preferences US consumers are more inclined to stream entertainment from an Internet service than tune in to live TV according to the results of a new survey from consulting firm Deloitte Videostreaming services such as Netflix which are now used by more than of American households have overtaken live programming as the viewing method of choice Deloittes study found About of those surveyed now stream movies and stream TV shows on a monthly basis as compared with of those who prefer to watch TV programs live And Internetvideo services are valued more highly than cable or satellite TV among consumers aged a group Deloitte dubs Trailing Millennials another worrisome indicator for the payTV biz For that age group cited streaming video as one of the most valuable services versus who said the same for pay TV Older age groups still value payTV more highly For Generation X picked pay TV and selected streaming among the most valuable services while among Baby Boomers cited pay TV and cited streaming According to the survey of Trailing Millennials either cancelled their payTV services in the last months or havent had one for more than a year compared with of overall respondents Definitely something to think about when youre considering investing or adding to your position in Netflix Since Netflix went public in it hasnt put a wrong foot forward as far as subscriptions go In the last years theyve built their user base to nearly million people across the world At the end of the th quarter of there were million subscribers and the company has forecast another five million additions by the end of Q As you can see from the chart above the bulk of net additions over the past several quarters has come from Netflixs international markets I expect to see this trend continue as they approach saturation in the United States With million international subscribers and less than million domestically international subscriptions are highly likely to overtake the latter over the next two years or less However the biggest pain point here for the company is that international viewership isnt as profitable as back home In fact its taking them in the other direction The table below clearly shows this Netflix is in a fix in international markets and its very different from the problems it faces at home The pressure Comcast is putting on the show that was thought to be an exclusive Netflix deal House of Cards is a perfect example of the top dog trying to send a clear message to the new kid on the block Stay off my turf or Ill eat you alive Overseas however Netflix has a different problem While USbased content does drive its overseas agenda to a great extent the company cannot fully depend on it to penetrate every market Even within Europe for example what works in Germany may not do well in France What they need is localized content to gain and retain subscribers and this will remain true no matter what country they go into This is a massively complex problem that Netflix must solve to be profitable in overseas markets and I truly wonder how they intend to wade through it They cant possibly produce unique content for every one of their international markets and licensing local content will be a very expensive proposition One I doubt they can afford right now considering their losses from overseas markets are quickly catching up to their gains in the United States The one advantage Netflix will retain through all this is the large user base it is collecting For a lowbudget movie to get the kind of visibility of a Hollywood blockbuster deals with Netflix or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video will be the very thing theyre looking for This gives the larger production houses an entry into niche markets for lowtomedium budget films they may otherwise not even consider making As the companys subscriber base grows into the hundreds of millions I even foresee premium production houses eyeing what will then be a lucrative secondary launch pad for blockbusters My assumption is that this is the point where Netflix wants to be using local content as the primary feeder for adding new subscribers keep adding to their user base at a breakneck pace then use that to attract bigger producers to the Netflix platform to broadcast their content Again time comes in as a major problem In the two years or more it takes them to double their user base to million and beyond whats their bottom line going to be looking like And can they sustain user growth long enough while keeping debt at bay to reach the scale they require to afford localized or globally appealing content Netflix is a hypergrowth stock I am not sure if management looks at its company that way but looking at Netflixs current valuation the market definitely considers that to be the case Its easy for a company such as Netflix to keep bleeding money and profits in exchange for user base growth rate but fortunately the company hasnt done that yet Theyve successfully stayed in the black and have kept investing whatever theyve earned back into the business instead of using debt to fuel their growth The company still looks a bit expensive to me because Im pretty sure well need to wait a few more years to start seeing their bottom line grow in a way that puts a grin on investors faces The company is selling for six times sales I think they have a great idea but one thats valued at a notsogreat level One important point here is that the companys valuation seems to go up and down based on the number of subscribers added every quarter If you want to buy into this great idea then the best time to do that is to not only wait for a earnings shocker but for a subscriptionaddition shocker similar to the one that happened in October Netflix has revised their estimates for Q since then but another shocker may just happen to shake their share price enough for you to get a foot in or add to your position In the US we ended with nearly million members although our Q US net adds were down year over year as expected m actual versus m prior year Our high penetration in the US seems to be making net additions harder than in the past Our forecast for Q US net additions is m against a prior year actual of m New creditdebit card rollover continues to be a background issue In Q and Q well be releasing a substantial number of our US members from price grandfathering on the HD plan and they will have the option of continuing at but now on the SD plan or continuing on HD at a month Given these members have been with us at least years we expect only slightly elevated churn Our US contribution target remains at and we are already at Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
