(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix is on an aggressive user growth path as U.S. growth shows signs of softening.What's their key challenge overseas?How do they intend to turn things around while growing at a breakneck speed with their subscriber base?I think most people would agree that someday in the future we all will be watching TV exclusively streamed through the Internet.The web is already powering significant portions of our of our lives through offerings such as e-commerce, internet banking, communication, collaboration, breaking news, live sportscasts, streamed television programming and so on.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With every passing day millions of users are added to an ever-widening `` net '' that makes life <i>more</i> convenient , brings people <i>closer</i> and transcends borders like nothing before or since .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that at one point , every other mode of access to the world ( save the physical one ) will be superseded by internet access .  (Uncertainty) </span>With high-speed internet accessibility growing by leaps and bounds, it's the natural culmination of a phenomenon that began with the ARPANET and similar networks as early as the 1960s.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> than half a century later the internet has safely embedded itself into the fabric of our lives , and awaits the greatest coup in the history of technology .  (Surprise) </span>One of the biggest impacts the internet has had over the past 10-to-15 years is the way media is streamed to our homes , and companies such as Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Prime Video division ) are the instruments of that upheaval in the way media is broadcast . The broadcasting industry is still under the control of major media conglomerates such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ), Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), but even they are succumbing to the pressure of increasing demand for internet-ready content.If traditional television broadcasting will become obsolete over the course of this century is highly debatable, yet there is strong evidence that internet viewership for streamed content is quickly overtaking the preference for live TV viewing.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Here 's an excerpt from an interesting report about a Deloitte study on viewer preferences : U.S. consumers are <i>more</i> inclined to stream entertainment from an Internet service than tune in to live TV , according to the results of a new survey from consulting firm Deloitte .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Video-streaming services such as Netflix , which are now used by <i>more</i> than 42 % of American households , have overtaken live programming as the viewing method of choice , Deloitte 's study found .  (Surprise) </span>About 56% of those surveyed now stream movies and 53% stream TV shows on a monthly basis, as compared with 45% of those who prefer to watch TV programs live.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And Internet-video services are valued <i>more</i> highly than cable or satellite TV among consumers aged 14-25 , a group Deloitte dubs `` Trailing Millennials '' - another <b>worrisome</b> indicator for the pay-TV biz .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For that age group, 72% cited streaming video as one of the most valuable services versus 58% who said the same for pay TV.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Older</i> age groups still value pay-TV <i>more</i> highly .  (Surprise) </span>For Generation X (32-48), 80% picked pay TV and 47% selected streaming among the most valuable services, while among Baby Boomers 89% cited pay TV and 43% cited streaming.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>According to the survey , 25 % of Trailing Millennials either cancelled their pay-TV services in the last 12 months or have n't had one for <i>more</i> than a year , compared with 16 % of overall respondents .  (Surprise) </span>Definitely something to think about when you're considering investing or adding to your position in Netflix!Since Netflix went public in 2002, it hasn't put a wrong foot forward as far as subscriptions go.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the last 13 years they 've built their user base to <b>nearly</b> 75 million people across the world .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the end of the 4th quarter of 2015 there were 74.76 million subscribers, and the company has forecast another five million additions by the end of Q1 2016.As you can see from the chart above, the bulk of net additions over the past several quarters has come from Netflix's international markets.I expect to see this trend continue as they approach saturation in the United States.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With 30 million international subscribers and <i>less</i> than 45 million domestically , international subscriptions are highly likely to overtake the latter over the next two years or <i>less</i> .  (Surprise) </span>However, the biggest pain point here for the company is that international viewership isn't as profitable as back home.In fact, it's taking them in the other direction.The table below clearly shows this.Netflix is in a fix in international markets, and it's very different from the problems it faces at home.The pressure Comcast is putting on the show that was thought to be an exclusive Netflix deal - House of Cards - is a perfect example of the top dog trying to send a clear message to the new kid on the block: Stay off my turf or I'll eat you alive.Overseas, however, Netflix has a different problem.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While U.S.-based content does drive its overseas agenda to a great extent , the company can not fully <b>depend</b> on it to penetrate every market .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even within Europe , for example , what works in Germany <b>may</b> not do well in France .  (Uncertainty) </span>What they need is localized content to gain and retain subscribers ... and this will remain true no matter what country they go into.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is a massively complex problem that Netflix must solve to be profitable in overseas markets , and I truly <b>wonder</b> how they intend to wade through it .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They ca n't <b>possibly</b> produce unique content for every one of their international markets , and licensing local content will be a very expensive proposition .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One I <b>doubt</b> they can afford right now considering their losses from overseas markets are quickly catching up to their gains in the United States .  (Uncertainty) </span>The one advantage Netflix will retain through all this is the large user base it is collecting.For a low-budget movie to get the kind of visibility of a Hollywood blockbuster , deals with Netflix or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video will be the very thing they 're looking for . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This gives the <i>larger</i> production houses an entry into niche markets for low-to-medium budget films they <b>may</b> otherwise not even consider making .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As the company's subscriber base grows into the hundreds of millions, I even foresee premium production houses eyeing what will then be a lucrative secondary launch pad for blockbusters.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>My <b>assumption</b> is that this is the point where Netflix wants to be , using local content as the primary feeder for adding new subscribers , keep adding to their user base at a breakneck pace , then use that to attract <i>bigger</i> producers to the Netflix platform to broadcast their content .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Again, time comes in as a major problem.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the two years or <i>more</i> it takes them to double their user base to 150 million and beyond , what 's their bottom line going to be looking like ?  (Surprise) </span>And can they sustain user growth long enough - while keeping debt at bay - to reach the scale they require to afford localized or globally appealing content?Netflix is a hyper-growth stock.I am not sure if management looks at its company that way but, looking at Netflix's current valuation, the market definitely considers that to be the case.It's easy for a company such as Netflix to keep bleeding money and profits in exchange for user base growth rate but, fortunately, the company hasn't done that yet.They've successfully stayed in the black and have kept investing whatever they've earned back into the business instead of using debt to fuel their growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company still looks a bit expensive to me because I 'm pretty sure we 'll need to wait a few <i>more</i> years to start seeing their bottom line grow in a way that puts a grin on investors ' faces .  (Surprise) </span>The company is selling for six times sales.I think they have a great idea, but one that's valued at a not-so-great level.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One important point here is that the company 's valuation <b>seems</b> to go up and down based on the number of subscribers added every quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>If you want to buy into this great idea then the best time to do that is to not only wait for a earnings shocker, but for a subscription-addition shocker similar to the one that happened in October 2015 .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has revised their estimates for Q1 2016 since then , but another shocker <b>may</b> just happen to shake their share price enough for you to get a foot in or add to your position .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the US , we ended 2015 with <b>nearly</b> 45 million members , although our Q4 US net adds were down year over year , as expected ( 1.56 m actual versus 1.90 m prior year ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Our high penetration in the US <b>seems</b> to be making net additions <i>harder</i> than in the past .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Our forecast for Q1 US net additions is 1.75m, against a prior year actual of 2.28m. New credit/debit card rollover continues to be a background issue.In Q2 and Q3, we'll be releasing a substantial number of our US members from price grandfathering on the HD plan and they will have the option of continuing at $7.99 but now on the SD plan, or continuing on HD at $9.99 a month.Given these members have been with us at least 2 years, we expect only slightly elevated churn.Our 2020 US contribution target remains at 40% and we are already at 34%.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Services , Music & Video Stores</div></body></html>
