(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>As the company's subscriber base grows into the hundreds of millions, I even foresee premium production houses eyeing what will then be a lucrative secondary launch pad for blockbusters.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>My <b>assumption</b> is that this is the point where Netflix wants to be , using local content as the primary feeder for adding new subscribers , keep adding to their user base at a breakneck pace , then use that to attract <i>bigger</i> producers to the Netflix platform to broadcast their content .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Again, time comes in as a major problem.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the two years or <i>more</i> it takes them to double their user base to 150 million and beyond , what 's their bottom line going to be looking like ?  (Surprise) </span>And can they sustain user growth long enough - while keeping debt at bay - to reach the scale they require to afford localized or globally appealing content?Netflix is a hyper-growth stock.I am not sure if management looks at its company that way but, looking at Netflix's current valuation, the market definitely considers that to be the case.It's easy for a company such as Netflix to keep bleeding money and profits in exchange for user base growth rate but, fortunately, the company hasn't done that yet.They've successfully stayed in the black and have kept investing whatever they've earned back into the business instead of using debt to fuel their growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The company still looks a bit expensive to me because I 'm pretty sure we 'll need to wait a few <i>more</i> years to start seeing their bottom line grow in a way that puts a grin on investors ' faces .  (Surprise) </span>The company is selling for six times sales.I think they have a great idea, but one that's valued at a not-so-great level.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One important point here is that the company 's valuation <b>seems</b> to go up and down based on the number of subscribers added every quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span>If you want to buy into this great idea then the best time to do that is to not only wait for a earnings shocker, but for a subscription-addition shocker similar to the one that happened in October 2015 .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix has revised their estimates for Q1 2016 since then , but another shocker <b>may</b> just happen to shake their share price enough for you to get a foot in or add to your position .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the US , we ended 2015 with <b>nearly</b> 45 million members , although our Q4 US net adds were down year over year , as expected ( 1.56 m actual versus 1.90 m prior year ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Our high penetration in the US <b>seems</b> to be making net additions <i>harder</i> than in the past .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Our forecast for Q1 US net additions is 1.75m, against a prior year actual of 2.28m. New credit/debit card rollover continues to be a background issue.In Q2 and Q3, we'll be releasing a substantial number of our US members from price grandfathering on the HD plan and they will have the option of continuing at $7.99 but now on the SD plan, or continuing on HD at $9.99 a month.Given these members have been with us at least 2 years, we expect only slightly elevated churn.Our 2020 US contribution target remains at 40% and we are already at 34%.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Services , Music & Video Stores</div></body></html>
