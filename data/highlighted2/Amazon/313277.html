class='textDiv'>Did <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Just Become A Mall REITs Best Friend Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha When a mall REIT suggested <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was getting set to open as many as stores it made headlines While no one knows for sure sounds like hyperbole The mall is dead Thats pretty much the mindset of many investors when they look at Internet retailers You can understand why on many levels but then what do you make of the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is rumored to be looking to expand its brick and mortar footprint General Growth Properties NYSE GGP CEO shocked the book and retail world when he commented during an earnings call that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was to his understanding looking to open as many as physical book stores At this point GGP has stepped back from that statement and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>isnt talking But other industry watchers think the number suggested is way too high with something in the teens a more likely outcome in the near term Interestingly one of the critiques offered for Amazons current store in Seattle is that its quite popular but appears to look more like an Apple NASDAQ AAPL store The books are on the periphery and the gadgets are the showcase in the middle A mall real estate investment trust or REIT wouldnt care about that but it hints at something else For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>not only has a store but it also has kiosks in some Westfield OTCPKWFGPY malls And according to The Wall Street Journal other online retailers are going physical too For example clothing store Bonobos and eyeglass store Warby Parker are opening brick and mortar storesand are much further along in that effort than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Bonobos has guide shops while Warby Parker which uses the more pedestrian term retail locations has stores Could it be that online isnt the end all and be all Is it possible that mall owners like GGP Simon Property Group NYSE SPG and Taubman Centers NYSE TCO have a business ahead of them after all Im being sarcastic of course But when you look at the media drubbing that WalMart NYSE WMT and Target NYSE TGT took this past holiday season when their websites couldnt keep up with demand you might get the impression that physical locations are a dead end To be fair online sales are growing quickly while sales at physical stores bumble along at low levels But remember that the online sales channel basically didnt exist years ago so its still growing from a small base Which makes the action of online retailers all the more interesting Their move into the physical realm suggests that the online tree isnt going to grow to the sky Indeed the real outcome for retail is likely going to be somewhere in the middle with both online and physical stores playing a key component to the retail story This is the socalled omnichannel idea That shouldnt be a shock to anyone who kind of likes to wander around a store every so often and you know see and touch the things youre about to buy Or just because you cant stand being stuck at home looking at yet another screen all day long So whats the big takeaway Location location location is probably going to remain the keyword for retail focused REITs Simon known for its highend malls clearly has a lock on that in a big way with its over malls spread around the world Theres no doubt that its bread and butter is owning a collection of highly desirable malls and its financial results the deep to recession aside have long been topnotch It appears wellpositioned today and if online retailers look for good locations to enter into the physical world But Taubman may be an even more interesting play here This mall REIT only owns or controls around or so malls but thats because it does things a little differently Taubman doesnt think size is as important as quality So it works hard to make its small collection of assets into premier properties Along the way it will sell assets that it doesnt think measure up anymore and invest that money into acquisitions its other properties andor into construction projects But the key here is that while some REITs focus on getting bigger and bigger portfolios Taubmans focus is on making its portfolio better and better from the ground up General Growth which owns around malls is on the location bandwagon too In fact it highlights that it owns of the top malls Thats an odd stat in some ways but it shows that GGP fancies a good location just as much as Simon and Taubman That said its results dont hold up quite as well as the other pair when looked at historically On that score a look at the allimportant dividend might be worth your time The to recession took out General Growths dividend While its back now the annual payout is still well below its prerecession peak Simon meanwhile trimmed its payout a bit during the recession but has since grown it to the point where it now pays more than twice as much as it did before that deep downturn It used the recession to expand aggressively Taubman kept its dividend steady for a year during the recession before getting back to regular annual increases with a slow and steady approach as the overriding theme Taubman would be my favorite for conservative investors if I were forced to make a recommendation today What youll want to watch out for is second tier malls For example the ones that Simon spun off in as Washington Prime Group This transaction was often billed as Simon getting rid of its strip mall business but with those strip malls went another lessdesirable enclosed malls Washington Prime has since merged with Glimcher Realty Trust and today is known as WP Glimcher NYSE WPG WPG has an around yield and a bunch of malls with Sears NASDAQ SHLD and JC Penney NYSE JCP stores as anchor tenants That could make it a turnaround play for aggressive investors but my question would be about the longerterm future of the assets it owns relative to say what Taubman has built For reference SPG has a yield of TCOs yield is and GGPs yield is I dont think any of these mall REITs is a great buy in here but neither do I believe that WPG is appropriate for all but the most aggressive investor Better to wait for the higherend trio to fall in price in my book So as you watch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>explore the physical world and see big retailers like WalMart increasingly move online remember that the meeting of these two worlds will most likely be in the middle not at either extreme And that will mean that physical retail space remains important youll just want to make sure you own the right location location locations Disclosure I amwe are long TGT AAPL I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
