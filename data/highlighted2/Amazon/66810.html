(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The new no-contract $120 LG Lancet Windows 8.1 smartphone from Verizon Wireless competes with low-entry Lumia phones from Microsoft.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>LG Electronics is the world 's fourth biggest vendor of smartphone that <b>could</b> vastly improve Windows ' meager market share in smartphones .  (Uncertainty) </span>LG Electronics (OTC: LGEAF ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) released a $120 Windows 8.1 smartphone .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , I think LG and Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) are both <i>better</i> off if they do not cannibalize U.S. sales of each other 's low-entry , no-contract Windows smartphones .  (Surprise) </span>According to JeeQ Data , Microsoft 's Lumia 521 , Lumia 520 , and Lumia 635 phones are the top-selling no-contract phones at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . The technical specs of the LG Lancet convinced me that is just an updated version of the old Nokia Lumia 521 .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The LG Lancet <b>may</b> not fare well in the U.S. due to Microsoft 's low pricing strategy for its entry-level Lumia phones .  (Uncertainty) </span>I opine that LG Electronics should also release a Windows smartphone with price tag above $250.Asustek (OTC: ASUUY ) is bringing the premium-level, unlocked Asus ZenFone 2 Android phone to the U.S. for just $299 .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The new flagship LG G4 Android phone <b>may</b> not fare well in the U.S. once wireless carriers start supporting the much <i>cheaper</i> Asus ZenFone 2 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>LG Electronics <b>could</b> offset the threat of the ZenFone 2 by also releasing a no-contract/unlocked $ 299 Windows 10 smartphone .  (Uncertainty) </span>The universal advantage of a Windows 10 smartphone that can be used as a mini computer is very appealing.The ZenFone 2, being an Android device, cannot compete with the Continuum feature of a future LG Windows 10 smartphone.Winning back the support of LG Electronics is a very important catalyst for Microsoft's mobile strategy.LG is the world's fourth-biggest vendor of smartphones.As per TrendForce's most recent quarterly report, LG touts a 6% share of the 291.2 million smartphones that got shipped out in 1Q 2015.The $120 Lancet from Verizon is LG's first Windows 8.1 phone since it announced that it would stop making Windows Phones in 2012 .The LG Lancet has the same 4.5-inch display and quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor of the excellent Lumia 635 handset from Microsoft.LG also made a great Windows Phone 7 smartphone in 2010.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately , LG discontinued the <b>Optimus</b> 7 in favor of the Android OS platform .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now that the Android phone business is on a severe race-to-the-bottom pricing war, LG Electronics is trying to branch out again to Windows mobile devices.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But like I said <i>earlier</i> , LG should avoid competing with entry-level Lumia phones .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft generates billions of dollars in Android licensing fees, it can easily afford to subsidize Lumia hardware.LG should try to target the $250-$400 price range of the ZenFone 2 and OnePlus One .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>believe</b> that a $ 300 Windows 10 smartphone is a <i>better</i> buy than a $ 300 Android 5.1 phone .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Corporate IT managers <b>could</b> buy $ 300 LG-made Windows 10 smartphones in bulk as a cost-efficient way to upgrade their old Windows 7/Windows XP office computers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>LG 's global brand is now <i>more</i> popular than Lumia .  (Surprise) </span>As per TrendForce's data, LG sold around 18 million smartphones in 1Q 2015.Microsoft last quarterly earnings report revealed it only sold 8.6 million Lumia smartphones.Microsoft new freemium approach to mobile will greatly benefit if LG starts selling higher-priced Windows phones to postpaid and prepaid subscribers of tier-1 wireless carriers like Verizon.Microsoft new freemium approach to mobile will greatly benefit if LG starts selling higher-priced Windows phones to postpaid and prepaid subscribers of tier-1 wireless carriers like Verizon.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>LG has consistently sold <i>more</i> than 10 million smartphones in every quarter since 1Q 2011 .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft should do its best to inspire LG to also issue a Windows 10 version of its LG G4 Android phone.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A new mid-range $ 300 LG <b>Optimus</b> 8 Windows 8.1 phone is also a shrewd tactic against the $ 299 ZenFone 2 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The freemium approach of Microsoft toward increasing its hardware sales should not be limited to $120 LG Lancet and $129 Lumia 640 handsets.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>better</i> approach is a balanced focus on entry-level and mid-range/high-end handsets .
