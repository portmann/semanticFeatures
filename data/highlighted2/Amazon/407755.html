( NYSE : GRUB ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to add <i>more</i> restaurants to Prime Now . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As revenue growth slows , cost controls become <i>more</i> important .  (Surprise) </span>On Tuesday , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) announced another expansion to the restaurant delivery service included in its Prime Now service . While this news isn't that major for the online retail/service giant, it is extremely important for competitor GrubHub (NYSE: GRUB ).<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> expanding its reach in the segment , shareholders in GrubHub need to be <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> <b>worried</b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has really built up its presence in this space during the past nine months , entering the following markets as detailed below from its press release page . Cities in bold/underlined are those that GrubHub detailed as its major markets in its 2015 10-K filing .<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>May</b> 2016 : Dallas , Manhattan ( borough of NYC ) <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> had already entered three of GrubHub 's seven major markets before Tuesday 's news , and Dallas and Manhattan certainly add two <i>more</i> major metro areas to the list . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Given how <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to spend billions a year to make its Prime service attractive to consumers , I expect at least 3-5 <i>more</i> major markets to be entered this year , and <b>perhaps</b> some mid-major ones as well . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's expanding presences makes me a bit <b>worried</b> about GrubHub , especially as non-GAAP EPS are forecast to rise at a rate <i>less</i> than half that of revenues this year . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>More</i> competition does n't just take away revenue <b>possibilities</b> for GrubHub , but also will increase the amount of marketing expenses the company needs to battle <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Even with shares down about 6% on Tuesday, GrubHub still trades for about 31 times its non-GAAP projected EPS for this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's a <b>somewhat</b> rich valuation in my opinion for a name whose EPS are only forecast to rise by about 13 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>With revenue growth expected to slow this year and next, the company will need to be very cost control conscious to get the bottom line moving.That can be very difficult if you are battling <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>GrubHub shares are taking a hit on Tuesday as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has entered two <i>more</i> markets with its Prime Now restaurant delivery service . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> launching in almost a dozen markets since last September , including a number of GrubHub 's top cities , shareholders should be a bit <b>worried</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>As revenue growth slows, can the company get its bottom line growing at a fast clip?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That remains to be seen , and at a <i>more</i> than 30 times non-GAAP EPS valuation , it seems like a very <b>risky</b> proposition .
