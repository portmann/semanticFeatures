who comes to your door may be wearing an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>uniform but they might not be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>employees Some Prime Now drivers in California are accusing the ecommerce giant of using their independent contractor status to get away without paying them a legal wage In both Los Angeles and in the San Francisco Bay area Prime Now couriers are contracted out through third party messenger services like Scoobeez which is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit These drivers say that even though they are classified as independent contractors they are really fulltime employees who arent receiving the benefits and protections of that designation According to the complaint PDF filed yesterday in a California Superior Court in Los Angeles the Scoobeez drivers are required to work regular shifts wear uniforms shirts and hats that identify them to customers as representatives of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Now and agree to exclusively deliver packages for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The drivers claim they are required to show up minutes early for every shift but receive no compensation This runs counter to the traditional idea of hourly contract employees who are paid for all the time they spend at work Likewise if work is slow drivers say they have been sent home without being compensated for the rest of their shift Additionally these drivers allege they are sometimes made to work six or seven consecutive days which would trigger overtime pay if they were actual employees In some ways the plaintiffs say they are really <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>employees as it is the etailer and not Scoobeez that determines how many and which packages are assigned to drivers According to the complaint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also determines the order in which all packages are delivered by each driver In spite of their independent contractor status drivers say they cant negotiate their hourly wage but must accept the rate given by the defendants Yet they allege <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Scoobeez have not only reserved the right to change what drivers are paid but have exercised that right The complaint says that these drivers were hired based on a wage of hour plus for every delivery made and tips Then last month that perdelivery bonus was eliminated and drivers were made to sign new contracts that only included the hour base pay plus tips In all cases the drivers say they were never allowed to receive copies of any of their employment contracts There is an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>app that allows customers to tip their Prime Now drivers and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>claims that all tips to the courier but the plaintiffs claim they are not allowed to see how much a customer has tipped so they have no idea if they are actually receiving this money Because drivers are made to use their own vehicles and they are not reimbursed for fuel insurance and tolls some couriers say that they end up netting less than the hour minimum wage in California The potential class action which seeks back wages waiting time penalties restitution and other damages alleges that by classifying these drivers as independent contractors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Scoobeez are depriving the couriers of substantial rights and benefits of employment as part of an ongoing unfair andor unlawful business practice In addition to the allegation of sometimes paying below minimum wage the complaint also says the defendants failed to compensate these drivers for overtime reimburse them for vital business expenses provide offduty meal time as required by state law and furnish accurate wage statements Amazons mission to deliver Now at no additional cost to its customers is being funded by the delivery drivers says Oaklandbased attorney Beth Ross who is representing the drivers Unlike the drones that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hopes to eventually replace them with these drivers are human beings with rent to pay and families to feed This is familiar territory for Ross In she
