(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is hard to see how Netflix can differentiate itself enough from the competition to charge the <i>higher</i> prices it needs to charge to generate the profits already embedded in its stock price .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>May</b> Have Missed This Item That Inflated EPS Another item of note that artificially inflated Netflix 's results was the release of a $ 39 million benefit from the company 's tax reserves .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This $ 39 million , which was recorded as quarterly income , <b>nearly</b> doubled Netflix 's reported net income and allowed the company to `` beat '' quarterly and yearly comps .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Without this <b>unusual</b> and nonrecurring tax reserve , Netflix 's income before taxes was down 54 % from the prior quarter , and 38 % from the prior year .  (Uncertainty) </span>While the aforementioned factors have put the brakes on Netflix's profit growth (the company projects profits to decline in 1Q15), they are hardly new concerns.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This makes the momentum run in Netflix 's stock even <i>more</i> <b>confusing</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Investors are simply ignoring some very transparent truths about the company.Slowing growth, declining margins, and skyrocketing costs are not features of company that is generating meaningful shareholder value.Valuation is Ridiculous - Even Cramer Agrees Using different scenarios below, we examine just how much growth in profit margins, subscribers and revenue is implied by Netflix's current stock price.Netflix currently maintains a pre-tax margin around 7.5% and has 57 million subscribers.Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Next, we use our discounted cash flow (DCF) model to provide transparency into the growth implications of the current stock price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Scenario 1 <b>assumes</b> Netflix prices and margins remain the same .  (Uncertainty) </span>The DCF model shows at the current profit margin of 7.5%, the company must grow revenues at 20% compounded annually to justify the current price.That performance means the company would reach over $218 billion in revenue in 20 years.At $8 per month, Netflix would need over 2.2 billion subscribers to generate $218 billion in revenue.The world population is about seven billion.Any questions?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Scenario 2 <b>assumes</b> Netflix can triple its price and double its profit margins .  (Uncertainty) </span>We realize that tripling price and doubling margins at the same time is a stretch.Nevertheless, let's see the impact.The DCF model shows after tripling prices and doubling margins, the company would have to reach over 122 million subscribers, over double their current subscriber base.I wouldn't bet on that happening.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In this scenario it is <i>more</i> likely that Netflix would lose subscribers not double them at $ 24/month because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Video is $ 8.25 / month and includes Prime shipping and Hulu Plus is just $ 7.99 . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Moreover, at $24/month, Netflix would compete directly with top-tier cable and satellite TV companies such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) and DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ), who's TV packages start at $19.99/month for the first year of service.As David Trainer discussed last week, Netflix is one of, if not the most overvalued stock in the market today.To justify its current price of ~$418/share, NFLX would need to grow revenue by 20% compounded annually for the next 22 years .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Essentially , Netflix needs to significantly increase its margins , expand its customer base by adding <i>more</i> content , and not pay as much for that content .  (Surprise) </span>We've seen this movie before: After a huge run up in 2013, Netflix stock dropped 31% early 2014.Then again, after a large run, the stock dropped 26% in October 2014.Don't get caught in Netflix's unfounded momentum again.Source: The Ugly Truth About Netflix Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) The author wrote this article themselves , and it expresses their own opinions .
