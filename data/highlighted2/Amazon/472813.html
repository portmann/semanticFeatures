(Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> Wells Fargo came out way ahead in this deal and that is bad business for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> brings on customers with the goal of having them for life , getting into the nasty business of student loans , especially with a private provider , <b>may</b> alienate the company 's <i>younger</i> users . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> `` Prime Student '' costs $ 49 a year and is about half the price of a normal prime subscription . In order to qualify for the accounts you must have a .edu email address.The service is aimed at college students and offers a suite of perks like free two-day shipping on millions of items and unlimited streaming of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's digital content . The service is great for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's user growth because it brings on students and converts them to long term prime customers after four years . The Wells Fargo deal threatens that conversion process.Wells Fargo is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets.It $12.2 billion of student debt on its books at the end of 2015, compared with $11.9 billion at the end of 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is clear that their student loan business <b>could</b> use a leg up .  (Uncertainty) </span>When the deal was announced, Wells Fargo charged between 3.39 percent and 9.03 percent for a variable-rate student loan, and 5.94 percent to 10.93 percent for a fixed-rate loan.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to Reuters , under the new scheme with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , a borrower who would <b>ordinarily</b> qualify for a 3.39 percent rate would be able to get a 2.89 percent rate by paying for a `` Prime Student '' subscription . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>How much does this actually save student borrowers?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It depends on the size of the loan , but the E-commerce Times estimates that over a 10-year repayment for a $ 10 thousand loan , the borrower <b>could</b> save up to $ 300 .  (Uncertainty) </span>While saving $300 sounds great, we must consider the other loan options available to student borrowers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Students <b>hoping</b> to actually save money by borrowing through Wells Fargo would need to be extremely credit worthy .  (Uncertainty) </span>The interest rate on federal student loans disbursed on or after July 1st, 2016 are as follows: Most students borrowing with Wells Fargo would be losing money by going with a private instead of a federal student loan.Students seeing <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> craft a deal without having most of their best interests in mind is not good for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Having this deal work in Amazons favor requires two <b>assumptions</b> be correct . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Firstly, potential customers for Wells Fargo's student loans programs do their due diligence and figure out what the most economical choice is and make an informed decision about where to get a loan.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Two , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> `` Prime Student '' customers are on average <i>more</i> credit worthy than normal college students and can get the lowest <b>possible</b> student loan rate offered by Wells Fargo . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If lots of students feel that they were somehow tricked into getting a <i>more</i> expensive student loan because of this deal , it will likely hurt Amazons customer base . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't get anything out of this deal except a new way to market their `` Prime Student '' service . This view is reiterated by John Rasmussen , head of Wells Fargo 's Personal Lending Group , said that `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's looking for increased membership in Student Prime . That's what they want out of this deal."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wells Fargo has a fledgling student loan business and I <b>believe</b> this is a last ditch effort to revive it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Most big banks don't pour many resources into this space, in 2013, JPMorgan Chase & Co decided to exit the student loan business altogether because it was too difficult to compete with federal loan programs.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has an <b>amazing</b> subscription business through <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> `` Prime Student '' , and the potential user growth through this deal is not worth <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> tainting its reputation .
