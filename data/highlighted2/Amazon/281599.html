the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Ford saw a increase in US auto sales in December compared to December This capped the companys with a increase from Key segments such as the FSeries Ford brand SUVs Fusion and Lincoln led the way for the company and allowed it to post the best December since With analysts expecting the US automotive market to achieve similar results in as Ford is in an ideal position to take advantage of the swelling industry Ford NYSE F announced December US vehicle sales of K up from the same month in and capping its total at million vehicles up from While this increase came in slightly below expectations from analysts who were expecting an increase of to I believe it caps off an impressive for the coming and gives investors a lot to be optimistic about in and beyond Four key markets that allowed Ford to post the best US December since were the FSeries Ford brand SUVs Fusion and Lincoln In addition to posting the most annual sales in nine years Ford posted an improved average transaction price of up in Fords increase came in slightly below the industry average of an industry that posted a record of million vehicles sold surpassing the mark of million Competitors such as Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU up Toyota NYSE TM up and Nissan up beat Fords increase while others such as General Motors NYSE GM up Honda NYSE HMC fell VW fell nearly and Hyundai down lagged behind Fords impressive yeartodate results have left investors wondering what could have been if optimal inventory levels on the new aluminumbodied F pickup were achieved earlier Despite supply constraints the key to the companys turnaround has been the remodeling of the Ford F The Ford F which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors in the first half of However the company reached full production in the second half of This allowed the company to sell Fseries trucks in December which was the first time the company surpassed Fseries sales in a month in a decade The impressive December for the segment allowed the company to hold onto the title of Americas bestselling pickup for straight years and the bestselling vehicle for straight years with over trucks sold in Despite a sluggish December down the Mustang still posted a yeartodate increase as it reclaimed the title of US muscle car of the year This is a title the company has not held since before the Chevrolet Camaro was introduced Over Mustangs were sold in compared to only Camaros sold in I believe this is the resurgence of the Mustang coupled with the Fseries dominating it should provide longterm growth for the company in the reclaimed muscle car segment With these results its clear the turnaround gained traction in August and the company has been consistently hitting on all cylinders in the US ever since However there are certainly contingencies that could derail the companys momentum These include the overall health of the US economy the upcoming interest rate hike and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession it would definitely have a major impact on Ford Furthermore with an interest rate hike announced in December it will likely force the automotive market to reach its limit However Im convinced Ford will be able to gain market share even as the total market contracts Additionally with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesnt fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle Ford appears to be prepared for this through rumored partnerships with Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>however Management must continue to look to be leaders in the race to a autonomous car In the first half of it was no secret that Ford was losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions as most consumers purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model Because of this and other factors the Ford resurgence is not guaranteed However its encouraging to see Ford posting numbers it has not posted since the early s This shows me as an investor that the new Fs results are positive and the highend models are selling well which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward Despite the sluggish vehicle sales the company continued to increase the average transaction price which shows the company is not utilizing heavy incentives to make sales Given this longterm optimism with Ford Im extremely encouraged by the US sales results the past few months I continue to be excited about the companys future as the new aluminum bodied F is seeing quick turnaround times the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles and the strong sales of the Mustang With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth going forward in I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and expect the industry to post results similar to Furthermore I believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market and will pay investors an above dividend yield to own the stock Tagged Investing Ideas Consumer Goods </div></body></html>
