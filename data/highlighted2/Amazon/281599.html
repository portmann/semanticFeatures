(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .  (Surprise) </span>I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Ford saw a 8.4% increase in U.S. auto sales in December 2015 compared to December 2014.This capped the company's 2015 with a 5% increase from 2014.Key segments such as the F-Series, Ford brand SUVs, Fusion, and Lincoln led the way for the company and allowed it to post the best December since 2005.With analysts expecting the US automotive market to achieve similar results in 2016 as 2015, Ford is in an ideal position to take advantage of the swelling industry.Ford (NYSE: F ) announced December 2015 U.S. vehicle sales of 239K, up 8.4% from the same month in 2014, and capping its 2015 total at 2.6 million vehicles, up 5% from 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While this increase came in slightly below expectations from analysts , who were expecting an increase of 10 % to 11 % , I believe it caps off an impressive 2015 for the coming and gives investors a lot to be <b>optimistic</b> about in 2016 and beyond .  (Uncertainty) </span>Four key markets that allowed Ford to post the best U.S. December since 2005 were the F-Series, Ford brand SUVs, Fusion, and Lincoln.In addition to posting the most annual sales in nine years, Ford posted an improved average transaction price of $37,061 , up 2.1%, in 2015.Ford's 8.4% increase came in slightly below the industry average of 9%, an industry that posted a record 2015 of 17.47 million vehicles sold, surpassing the 2000 mark of 17.41 million.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Competitors such as Fiat Chrysler ( NYSE : FCAU ) ( up 13 % ) , Toyota ( NYSE : TM ) ( up 10.8 % ) , and Nissan ( up 8.7 % ) beat Ford 's increase , while others such as General Motors ( NYSE : GM ) ( up 5 % ) , Honda ( NYSE : HMC ) ( fell 9.9 % ) , VW ( fell <b>nearly</b> 9.1 % ) , and Hyundai ( down 1.5 % ) lagged behind .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Ford 's impressive year-to-date results have left investors <b>wondering</b> what could have been if <b>optimal</b> inventory levels on the new aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup were achieved <i>earlier</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Despite supply constraints, the key to the company's turnaround has been the remodeling of the Ford F-150.The Ford F-150, which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this year's model, has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F-150 model , the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell <i>older</i> models like competitors in the first half of 2015 .  (Surprise) </span>However, the company reached full production in the second half of 2015.This allowed the company to sell 85,211 F-series trucks in December, which was the first time the company surpassed 85,000 F-series sales in a month in a decade.The impressive December for the segment allowed the company to hold onto the title of America's best-selling pickup for 39 straight years and the best-selling vehicle for 34 straight years with over 780,000 trucks sold in 2015.Despite a sluggish December (down 8.1%) the Mustang still posted a 48.1% year-to-date increase as it reclaimed the title of US muscle car of the year.This is a title the company has not held since before the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro was introduced.Over 122,000 Mustangs were sold in 2015 compared to only 77,500 Camaros sold in 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> this is the resurgence of the Mustang coupled with the F-series dominating , it should provide long-term growth for the company in the reclaimed muscle car segment .  (Uncertainty) </span>With these results, it's clear the turnaround gained traction in August and the company has been consistently hitting on all cylinders in the U.S. ever since.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , there are certainly contingencies that <b>could</b> derail the company 's momentum .  (Uncertainty) </span>These include the overall health of the US economy, the upcoming interest rate hike, and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession , it would definitely have a major impact on Ford .  (Uncertainty) </span>Furthermore, with an interest rate hike announced in December, it will likely force the automotive market to reach its limit.However, I'm convinced Ford will be able to gain market share even as the total market contracts.Additionally, with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesn't fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Ford <b>appears</b> to be prepared for this through rumored partnerships with Google and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ; however , Management must continue to look to be leaders in the race to a autonomous car . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In the first half of 2015, it was no secret that Ford was losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions as most consumers purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model.Because of this and other factors, the Ford resurgence is not guaranteed.However, it's encouraging to see Ford posting numbers it has not posted since the early 2000s.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This shows me as an investor that the new F-150 's results are positive and the high-end models are selling well , which is creating a lot of <b>optimism</b> around the new model going forward .  (Uncertainty) </span>Despite the sluggish vehicle sales, the company continued to increase the average transaction price, which shows the company is not utilizing heavy incentives to make sales.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given this long-term <b>optimism</b> with Ford , I 'm extremely encouraged by the US sales results the past few months .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I continue to be excited about the company 's future as the new aluminum bodied F-150 is seeing quick turnaround times , the recent shift in consumer sentiment to <i>higher</i> profit margin vehicles , and the strong sales of the Mustang .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With consumers purchasing <i>more</i> expensive vehicles , it will allow Ford to report <i>stronger</i> top line and bottom line growth going forward in 2015 .  (Surprise) </span>I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and expect the industry to post results similar to 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , I <b>believe</b> Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market and will pay investors an above 4 % dividend yield to own the stock .
