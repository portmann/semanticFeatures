In addition Genius Brands will also be meeting with a number of our key international licensing sub-agents worldwide in setting up a global Llama Llama licensing program in all of the major territories.One of the most appealing characteristic of this program is not just that Llama Llama is international but it equally appeals to both boys and girls and that it is truly timeless and evergreen.Llama Llama is about childhood moments and adventures as well as the special connections between the lead character, Llama, his parents, grandparents and best friends.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Llama Llama tells heart-warming tales of life in a safe , friendly town seen through the eyes of Llama , as he interacts with the <b>amazing</b> world around him and always learning valuable life lessons .  (Surprise) </span>The production team, that has been constituted, is a collection of all stars.It includes Oscar, Emmy and Grammy winning creators.Oscar winning Executive Producer, Rob Minkoff who directed The Lion King; director, Saul Blinkoff, Minkoff and Blinkoff, that’s interesting, that rhymes, who directed Doc McStuffins, Barbie's Dreamtopia, and Winnie the Pooh.We have Emmy winning writer, Joe Purdy who wrote Arthur, Hey Arnold!And Dinosaur Train.He is the show runner.And we have legendary Disney Art Director, Ruben Aquino.This guy is -- he is a legend.He is an iconic character.He created and designed all of the characters going back to Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Mulan and Frozen.And lastly Emmy award winning producer, Jane Startz, who produced among many things Magic School Bus.The animation production will be done in China at Hong Ying Studios, which is one of the strongest animation subcontract providers in the world, and have done shows ranging from Spiderman for Marvel to Phineas and Ferb for Disney Animation.Music will be done by Ron Fair who has produced multiple Grammy winning artists include Black Eyed Peas, Christina Aguilera and Mary J. Blige among others.So only with a property of this caliber and with a broadcaster of Netflix's stature have we been in a position to attract such an accomplished and talented team of champions.Lastly I want to mention for any of you who read the in-depth Netflix story in yesterday’s New York Times you are aware of the massive impact that a series launch on a global basis on Netflix can have.There is simply no other global platform like it today.For their Netflix global original programs they pay absolute top dollar to have the very best properties and the very best creators from around the word, and we are very proud to be recognized in this scenario of the world's best content.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For Genius Brands , the immediate dollar impact will be accretive and <i>greater</i> than both our recent Sony Pictures Home Entertainment distribution deal and the Sony Music label deal combined .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The ancillary impact of the global merchandising of Llama Llama will catalyze and compound that value even <i>further</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Taken in totality the various pieces of this transaction with Netflix create what I would describe as a perfect storm of value creation.Thanks, Andy.Congratulations on this, a very impressive and important deal for you.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> like you are going to be receiving some cash from Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Can you talk about other than the qualitatively that it 's <i>bigger</i> than the Sony deals combined .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> a range of what you are going to be receiving , as well as when that would occur .  (Uncertainty) </span>I'm not at liberty to do that.We are proscribed by the terms of our Netflix contract from discussing the financial terms.They are very, very competitive.They are very guarded about this.The only thing that I'm at liberty to share is that it will be accretive to us.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It has an immediate impact to us and that it is dramatically <i>larger</i> than any other licensee fees we 've ever received before and it 's enabled us to bring on the absolutely most talented people in this field , in the world .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix has their license for 20 years.They have an exclusivity for 12 months.After that 12 months period we will be out selling to home video licensees, we will be selling it to cable and satellite and over the air broadcasters and broadcasters everywhere.We view the term of this with Netflix as a big asset to us.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They are a huge brand builder and the continuing <b>exposure</b> that they provide is a driver of our consumer products business .  (Uncertainty) </span>No, it's not.They have a 20 year license term.How it's recognized?I think I'm going to refer you to Rebecca Hershinger, our CFO, and you can contact her independently and she will address all of that for you.Okay, great.And have the artists who will be voicing the characters in Llama Llama, have you found those artists yet?That again is something which will be the subject of a separate announcement and a very important announcement I'll say.But it's going to be done by Netflix themselves.[indiscernible] has been signed, but they are going to roll that out further on strategic purposes.Okay, great.And do you expect to walk out of the Las Vegas show with the deal signed or is that the precursor to signing deal?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Let me go one step <i>further</i> , <i>better</i> for you .  (Surprise) </span>We've already signed deal and we expect to have a very substantial presence at the Las Vegas Licensing Show.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And though deals do n't get signed per se in the stands right there , we 've already received tremendous interest across a <b>variety</b> of the major categories and we expect to be closing a broad number of deals on a global basis and will keep you informed , we 'll be doing some updates .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We have a number of things that will be coming up next week and we 'll talk about them <i>more</i> after the end of Licensing Show by the end of next week .  (Surprise) </span>Andy, congratulations.This is further validation on the content that you are putting together.I have a question unrelated to this.I mean you can give us a little update on SpacePOP, it's something that you've talked about previously.I think it's pretty exciting and I'm just -- like to get an update on where are you with that and then if there is anything else you can talk about?Thank you for asking, Josh.We are going to have a story coming out on SpacePOP on Monday.It will be exclusive with one of the major communications journals.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And <b>probably</b> best not to talk too much about it until then .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is a massive brand for us.It's going to be very important across many different levels.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We have <b>variety</b> of licenses already signed up in every major category whether it 's toys , publishing , beauty aids , apparel , accessories , electronics , video , every major category .  (Uncertainty) </span>We have a number of retailers that are already engaged.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We 've got a whole slew of items that are coming out with this and it will be covered in a story that will <b>appear</b> on Monday .  (Uncertainty) </span>And now as you know, just one last thing, on June 20, SpacePOP goes live.And there will be the first six episodes of SpacePOP, and this will be hitting everywhere from [indiscernible] and on Monday it will be -- we will be announcing everything that's going on with it.By the end of the summer it will be completely immersed in the culture.And you'll see it everywhere.And products will be in the marketplace in fourth quarter across all of our various different categories.Quick question on the cable channel.Will you be able to put the Llama Llama on your channel, or will Netflix have the exclusive for some period of time and then you put it on?Netflix has an exclusive for 12 months.After that we'll be able to put it on elsewhere.But they pay absolute, absolute top dollar.And because of that they want to make sure that the only place you can get these things for a period of time is on Netflix.That's what enables them to pay top dollar.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And as far -- I know you wo n't go into the exact monetary value of this contract , but you said it 's <i>bigger</i> than the two Sony deals combined .  (Surprise) </span>I know one of the Sony deals was $2 million upfront.Is the upfront portion as big or it will ramp [ph] up overtime?Joe, I'd love to answer that, but again I'm going into an area that we are under strict blackout with Netflix and unable to discuss the terms of their agreement.Let me answer the same, we can't talk anything about this.I'll just say this that it is immediately very, very valuable to the company.Hello, congratulations, Andy, good work.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I do n't know -- this <b>maybe</b> a question that you ca n't answer as well , but I 'm just <b>wondering</b> , are you going to -- is it going to require the commitment of any capital from Genius ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Congratulations, Andy.Just a really quick question.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> you mentioned the Las Vegas Expo , can you go a little bit into any potential expectations you have from an -LSB- indiscernible -RSB- for the rest of the year ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Well, we have -- this is a very important piece of business for us.And we have, as I said, we have got about a 150 meetings set up for the three days across all of the various categories in the business that we license to, we're meeting also with all of the various resellers, we are meeting with key sub agents licensees and licensing agents outside the United States as well.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We have tremendous interest not only with the Llama Llama , of course and this announcement , what 's been going on with SpacePOP and that will become <i>more</i> clear and some other items that we will be talking about in the coming days , near days as well .  (Surprise) </span>But I think one important point to bear in mind is this is a piece of commerce, an important piece of commerce but it's a piece of commerce.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>What I think and continue to <b>believe</b> is the most important event in the recent days for Genius is something that had nothing to do with Genius at all , which was the sale of DreamWorks Animations to Comcast for $ 3.8 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>I don't know how many of you are familiar with that sale, or familiar with DreamWorks.But we do the exact thing that DreamWorks does.We create animated content for kids, we produce the content, we distribute the content globally and we merchandise and license consumer products based on that content.That is what DreamWorks does.That's what Comcast paid $3.8 billion to have and put inside their Universal Studios umbrella.It's very, very valuable to companies that use content to have the kids' profile.It's valuable to studios, it's valuable to satellite distributors, it's valuable to cable providers to advertisers, to any number of companies up and down the kid's entertainment food chain.Companies like General Mills and Kellogg's acquire content because they use that as vehicles to wrap their commercials around and promote their brands.There's been a huge aggregation and consolidation of companies that do this work, that are in our business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Years ago there were many , many <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Most of them have been gobbled up.Pixar was gobbled up Disney, Hanna-Barbera was gobbled up by Warner Bros, DreamWorks was just acquired by Comcast, ergo Universal.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So we continue to <b>believe</b> that we are quickly becoming the last oasis in the desert .  (Uncertainty) </span>There just are not a lot of places that have the aggregation of talent, the expertise, the management skills and the accumulation of intellectual property for kids.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So we are very excited about the prospects of our company and where it 's going to go forward and the announcement today with Netflix and Llama Llama is just another data point in a much <i>larger</i> picture .  (Surprise) </span>[Operator Instructions] And if there are no further questions I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Heyward for any closing remarks.All I'll say is thank you to everybody.Appreciate you all being on the call.Keep your eyes open for what's coming forward in the coming days and definitely check out SpacePOP ad on our YouTube channel.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With that wish everybody a <b>wonderful</b> rest of the week .
