you Matt This morning Netflix announced that they have licensed the animated series Llama Llama from Genius Brands International to become a Netflix original kid series for global distribution in This becomes the largest content licensing deal in the history of Genius Brands and will have an accretive effect across the business of the company both this year and in years to come Subsequent to Netflixs announcements Genius did its own release to share more detail and I would like to amplify further on that for you here today For those of you arent familiar with Llama Llama it is a series of New York Times Best Selling Books for preschoolers written and illustrated by Anna Dewdney that has sold over million copies All of the titles have been New York Time best sellers Several have made it to number one The sales of each successive title have continued to grow and outsell each previous title They have been printed and distributed not just in the United States but in multiple languages around the world Llama Llama is published by Penguin Books a division of Random House which is a division of Bertelsmann one of the largest media and publishing companies in the world The first season order from Netflix is for animated stories which will be formatted into half hour program episodes Netflix will distribute the series across its entire distribution system in over countries on a daydate basis By that I mean they will be released worldwide on the same day Concurrent with the production order of the animated Llama Llama programs Netflix has also awarded dubs for the series in to different languages The foreign language dubs remain the property of Genius Brands Foreign language dubs are recognized as extremely valuable assets They enable studios to continuously license their programs post Netflix to broadcasters home entertainment users and digital platforms and content providers worldwide The Llama Llama programming sale to Netflix will catalyze the global merchandising and licensing programs being officially launched this coming Monday at the Annual Licensing Show Licensing Expo in Las Vegas Its rare to launch a series worldwide on a day and day basis at the same time it is hugely valuable to be able to offer this kind of broadcast license to a manufacturer who can then immediately have a global audience for its products as opposed to one in the US only which subsequently may or may not rollout afterwards elsewhere Let me put it another away If you are a Flash ph manufacturer like Mattel or Hasbro for example you immediately know you now have a global market to sell your products rather than just a US market Now imagine that impact multiplied across all of the many categories of children products That is exactly the powerful catalytic compounding effect of the global sale to Netflix with its worldwide daydate release in all languages To ensure this is going to be fully exploited Genius Brands has a robust presence inside the Licensing Show We have over appointments over the three days across all categories including toys games electronics publishing apparel stationary beauty school supplies costume party goods food products as well as meetings with all of the major retailers including Target <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ToysRUs among others In addition Genius Brands will also be meeting with a number of our key international licensing subagents worldwide in setting up a global Llama Llama licensing program in all of the major territories One of the most appealing characteristic of this program is not just that Llama Llama is international but it equally appeals to both boys and girls and that it is truly timeless and evergreen Llama Llama is about childhood moments and adventures as well as the special connections between the lead character Llama his parents grandparents and best friends Llama Llama tells heartwarming tales of life in a safe friendly town seen through the eyes of Llama as he interacts with the amazing world around him and always learning valuable life lessons The production team that has been constituted is a collection of all stars It includes Oscar Emmy and Grammy winning creators Oscar winning Executive Producer Rob Minkoff who directed The Lion King director Saul Blinkoff Minkoff and Blinkoff thats interesting that rhymes who directed Doc McStuffins Barbies Dreamtopia and Winnie the Pooh We have Emmy winning writer Joe Purdy who wrote Arthur Hey Arnold And Dinosaur Train He is the show runner And we have legendary Disney Art Director Ruben Aquino This guy is he is a legend He is an iconic character He created and designed all of the characters going back to Lion King Aladdin Pocahontas Mulan and Frozen And lastly Emmy award winning producer Jane Startz who produced among many things Magic School Bus The animation production will be done in China at Hong Ying Studios which is one of the strongest animation subcontract providers in the world and have done shows ranging from Spiderman for Marvel to Phineas and Ferb for Disney Animation Music will be done by Ron Fair who has produced multiple Grammy winning artists include Black Eyed Peas Christina Aguilera and Mary J Blige among others So only with a property of this caliber and with a broadcaster of Netflixs stature have we been in a position to attract such an accomplished and talented team of champions Lastly I want to mention for any of you who read the indepth Netflix story in yesterdays New York Times you are aware of the massive impact that a series launch on a global basis on Netflix can have There is simply no other global platform like it today For their Netflix global original programs they pay absolute top dollar to have the very best properties and the very best creators from around the word and we are very proud to be recognized in this scenario of the worlds best content For Genius Brands the immediate dollar impact will be accretive and greater than both our recent Sony Pictures Home Entertainment distribution deal and the Sony Music label deal combined The ancillary impact of the global merchandising of Llama Llama will catalyze and compound that value even further Taken in totality the various pieces of this transaction with Netflix create what I would describe as a perfect storm of value creation Thanks Andy Congratulations on this a very impressive and important deal for you It seems like you are going to be receiving some cash from Netflix Can you talk about other than the qualitatively that its bigger than the Sony deals combined Maybe a range of what you are going to be receiving as well as when that would occur Im not at liberty to do that We are proscribed by the terms of our Netflix contract from discussing the financial terms They are very very competitive They are very guarded about this The only thing that Im at liberty to share is that it will be accretive to us It has an immediate impact to us and that it is dramatically larger than any other licensee fees weve ever received before and its enabled us to bring on the absolutely most talented people in this field in the world Netflix has their license for years They have an exclusivity for months After that months period we will be out selling to home video licensees we will be selling it to cable and satellite and over the air broadcasters and broadcasters everywhere We view the term of this with Netflix as a big asset to us They are a huge brand builder and the continuing exposure that they provide is a driver of our consumer products business No its not They have a year license term How its recognized I think Im going to refer you to Rebecca Hershinger our CFO and you can contact her independently and she will address all of that for you Okay great And have the artists who will be voicing the characters in Llama Llama have you found those artists yet That again is something which will be the subject of a separate announcement and a very important announcement Ill say But its going to be done by Netflix themselves indiscernible has been signed but they are going to roll that out further on strategic purposes Okay great And do you expect to walk out of the Las Vegas show with the deal signed or is that the precursor to signing deal Let me go one step further better for you Weve already signed deal and we expect to have a very substantial presence at the Las Vegas Licensing Show And though deals dont get signed per se in the stands right there weve already received tremendous interest across a variety of the major categories and we expect to be closing a broad number of deals on a global basis and will keep you informed well be doing some updates We have a number of things that will be coming up next week and well talk about them more after the end of Licensing Show by the end of next week Andy congratulations This is further validation on the content that you are putting together I have a question unrelated to this I mean you can give us a little update on SpacePOP its something that youve talked about previously I think its pretty exciting and Im just like to get an update on where are you with that and then if there is anything else you can talk about Thank you for asking Josh We are going to have a story coming out on SpacePOP on Monday It will be exclusive with one of the major communications journals And probably best not to talk too much about it until then This is a massive brand for us Its going to be very important across many different levels We have variety of licenses already signed up in every major category whether its toys publishing beauty aids apparel accessories electronics video every major category We have a number of retailers that are already engaged Weve got a whole slew of items that are coming out with this and it will be covered in a story that will appear on Monday And now as you know just one last thing on June SpacePOP goes live And there will be the first six episodes of SpacePOP and this will be hitting everywhere from indiscernible and on Monday it will be we will be announcing everything thats going on with it By the end of the summer it will be completely immersed in the culture And youll see it everywhere And products will be in the marketplace in fourth quarter across all of our various different categories Quick question on the cable channel Will you be able to put the Llama Llama on your channel or will Netflix have the exclusive for some period of time and then you put it on Netflix has an exclusive for months After that well be able to put it on elsewhere But they pay absolute absolute top dollar And because of that they want to make sure that the only place you can get these things for a period of time is on Netflix Thats what enables them to pay top dollar And as far I know you wont go into the exact monetary value of this contract but you said its bigger than the two Sony deals combined I know one of the Sony deals was million upfront Is the upfront portion as big or it will ramp ph up overtime Joe Id love to answer that but again Im going into an area that we are under strict blackout with Netflix and unable to discuss the terms of their agreement Let me answer the same we cant talk anything about this Ill just say this that it is immediately very very valuable to the company Hello congratulations Andy good work I dont know this maybe a question that you cant answer as well but Im just wondering are you going to is it going to require the commitment of any capital from Genius Congratulations Andy Just a really quick question I believe you mentioned the Las Vegas Expo can you go a little bit into any potential expectations you have from an indiscernible for the rest of the year Well we have this is a very important piece of business for us And we have as I said we have got about a meetings set up for the three days across all of the various categories in the business that we license to were meeting also with all of the various resellers we are meeting with key sub agents licensees and licensing agents outside the United States as well We have tremendous interest not only with the Llama Llama of course and this announcement whats been going on with SpacePOP and that will become more clear and some other items that we will be talking about in the coming days near days as well But I think one important point to bear in mind is this is a piece of commerce an important piece of commerce but its a piece of commerce What I think and continue to believe is the most important event in the recent days for Genius is something that had nothing to do with Genius at all which was the sale of DreamWorks Animations to Comcast for billion I dont know how many of you are familiar with that sale or familiar with DreamWorks But we do the exact thing that DreamWorks does We create animated content for kids we produce the content we distribute the content globally and we merchandise and license consumer products based on that content That is what DreamWorks does Thats what Comcast paid billion to have and put inside their Universal Studios umbrella Its very very valuable to companies that use content to have the kids profile Its valuable to studios its valuable to satellite distributors its valuable to cable providers to advertisers to any number of companies up and down the kids entertainment food chain Companies like General Mills and Kelloggs acquire content because they use that as vehicles to wrap their commercials around and promote their brands Theres been a huge aggregation and consolidation of companies that do this work that are in our business Years ago there were many many more Most of them have been gobbled up Pixar was gobbled up Disney HannaBarbera was gobbled up by Warner Bros DreamWorks was just acquired by Comcast ergo Universal So we continue to believe that we are quickly becoming the last oasis in the desert There just are not a lot of places that have the aggregation of talent the expertise the management skills and the accumulation of intellectual property for kids So we are very excited about the prospects of our company and where its going to go forward and the announcement today with Netflix and Llama Llama is just another data point in a much larger picture Operator Instructions And if there are no further questions Id like to turn the floor back over to Mr Heyward for any closing remarks All Ill say is thank you to everybody Appreciate you all being on the call Keep your eyes open for whats coming forward in the coming days and definitely check out SpacePOP ad on our YouTube channel With that wish everybody a wonderful rest of the week This concludes todays teleconference Thank you for
