(Uncertainty) </span>It is definitely a bellwether of the segment, and if it's losing subscribers, it will be difficult to find ways to stem the trend of shrinking operating income.I don't disagree concerning the pace of cord-cutting mentioned earlier, but that doesn't take into account the next recession.When that happens, which is inevitable, the number of people abandoning pay-TV will accelerate.The reason that's a surety is consumers start cutting back on non-essentials in difficult economic times.Not only that, but it's my belief that once pay-TV is cut off, the majority of consumers, who will get used to different online content options, will have no interest in getting back into pay-TV.The gradual decline in pay-TV is a legitimate threat, and that trend will continue.But the threat will be exasperated by the recession, and that's where Disney will experience some serious challenges concerning its operating income.The company won't be able to avoid it.Neither will its competitors.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>From the reaction to the <b>disappointing</b> performance of ESPN and slowing operating income growth , Disney is poised to take a big hit when the U.S. economy slows .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>No traditional media company with <b>exposure</b> to linear TV will be able to fend off the streaming trend .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney is no exception , no matter how the company <b>may</b> spin it .  (Uncertainty) </span>ESPN is proof of that, being one of the strongest pieces of content aired by any media company.An interesting observation about ESPN as it relates to cord-cutting, is either consumers love it and identify it as one of the major reasons for signing up for pay-TV, or it's listed as one of the reasons consumers hate pay-TV; primarily because it's the most expensive content, and those having no interest in sports feel cheated in having to pay for costly content they have no interest in.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's the same with a <b>variety</b> of content offered on pay-TV viewers have no desire to watch .  (Uncertainty) </span>That's of course the impetus behind the pressure to provide a la carte TV.Disney and other media companies oppose that because the resist breaking up the content bundle.The drop in profits in the music industry is a major reason traditional media will fight to the end to maintain the status quo.Unfortunately, they're not going to win that battle, as an increasing number of people will simply not sign up for pay-TV, while existing consumers cut the cord.Linear TV will continue to shrink, as will ad revenue.There will be new opportunities (and pressure) to license content, but that won't replace the revenue and earnings the weakening business model of the industry used to provide.Disney, as with all major media companies, will have to engage in a balancing act going forward.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is no <b>doubt</b> the old ways of doing business are gradually disappearing , along with profits in the cable business .  (Uncertainty) </span>That means the company will have to make the changes necessary to remain competitive, even as the business no longer generates the type of returns it has in the past.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There <b>may</b> be occasional exceptions , but I do n't see Disney returning to the type of cable results in had in the past .  (Uncertainty) </span>That means an ongoing reduction in the pace of growth in its operating income, and even My thought is operating income should be one of the key metrics to watch in the months ahead, as that will tell the most accurate story of the health and future growth prospects of the company.Source: Cord-Cutting Eating Into Disney's Operating Income Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
