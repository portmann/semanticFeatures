class='textDiv'>Netflix Earnings And Why Growth Oriented Investors Should Own It Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Netflix earnings blew past expectations on earnings and memberships The stock is driven by the whimsical nature of the market sometimes that can work against the bulls which is arguably the biggest risk factor to owning the stock The core business is well positioned in the SVOD space and will likely retain its moat even with added domestic competition The added scale from international streaming will give Netflix a large enough of a content budget to further differentiate itself away from domestic competitors like HBO GO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Hulu Also revenue acceleration and profit margin expansion are highly likely as Netflix has the ability to increase pricing via a tiered pricing structure Im fairly confident that the blowout in Netflix NASDAQ NFLX quarterly earnings will alert Netflix bears of what could be a potential bubble in the making However the high valuation is mostly driven by the outward growth potential in Netflixs business model which has the ability to both scale and drive pricing power in future quarters I also think the downside risks to owning Netflix have been overhyped as the company is very careful in its management of cash flow Admittedly the timing of content obligations and sales isnt going to be all that great for the foreseeable future as management has indicated on the live video conference that international streaming contribution margin is expected to decline and stay in the negative Netflix plans to invest aggressively into international content so cash burn will last for FY and perhaps early FY in the international segment This is mostly driven by original content which produces higher levels of engagement in comparison to licensed content from various channels like AMC and Disney My view on Netflix is perhaps rose colored but not without rational reasons Typically in the technology space success is extremely binary and various valuation methods arent all that effective Whether Netflix traded at a PE multiple or a PE multiple the business is only going to merit that kind of valuation at some future point based on its business modelprocess which requires outward looking assumptions on the core business In cases like this a venture capital investment model is more effective And in the case of Netflix where profitability is secondary and growth is a bigger priority the rational for bidding up the stock is primarily attributed to top line improvements that exceed prior expectations Netflixs core streaming business in the United surprised earlier forecasts made by Netflixs management especially in terms of contribution margin as various content costs are being absorbed into the cost structure of international titles This indicates that the companys target of contribution margin of is well on track Admittedly Im not exactly certain on how that translates to the net margin so Ill be updating my longterm analysis with more relevant commentary in a future article That being the case international is the most important business segment over at Netflix This offsets the domestic competitive argument and creates degrees of differentiation for Netflix as it relies on an international subscriber base to fund inhouse productions Furthermore various titles from Walt Disney are expected to be released in the timeframe which will give Netflix subscribers access to various Lucas Films which gets me extremely excited from more of a product standpoint Needless to say Netflix plans to split its content costs down the middle with dedicated to content licenses and the other dedicated to inhouse content This allows Netflix to further differentiate itself as its content spend will be internationally diversified making Netflix a truly international platform for both film and TV shows Heres what I stated earlier in the year Netflixs SVOD subscription video on demand service is attracting significant interest globally In fact emerging market subscriber growth should be robust going into FY Survey data indicates that the number of people interested in subscribing to a SVOD service greatly outweighs those who are already subscribed to one with the exception of the United States With Netflix one of the few SVOD services available globally the growth potential is rather robust Furthermore saturation of international broadband households may happen at a much faster rate than what analysts or managements outlook indicates Subscriber additions came in at million versus the million that was originally anticipated Accelerating growth should not be at all surprising as domestic content is extremely appealing in international markets I think theres reasonable suspicion that if costs are expected to trend higher both sales and subscriber additions have room to surprise in future quarters After all both the overhead costs and content licensing are going to trend higher as various licenses will cost the company a significant sum of money on a per market basis Admittedly piracy remains a huge problem in international markets which puts a bit of a ceiling on pricing For now Netflix addresses the issue with a pricing tier for SD HD and UHD content The UHD rollout has been successful for the most part as various bits of content from licensors will be digitally remastered into the higher quality format over the foreseeable future As is Netflix is currently the largest distributor of UHD content and that trend will most likely continue The UHD tier will result in higher ARPU figures over time as the adoption rate of K TVs will continue to trend higher The average selling price of UHD TVs is expected to trend lower which indicates quick movement through the adoption curve After all if we operate under the assumption that else equal pricing drops increases demand UHD TV is going to go main stream over the foreseeable to year time frame which will result in higher demand for Netflixs UHD subscription service The two are compliments and demand for one will drive demand for the other Usually I like to compare reported results with the analyst consensus figure but in the case of Netflix most of the investor sentiment is based around what management had guided to in the prior quarter in comparison to what will happen in the future quarter The Q revenue forecast was set at billion the actual result was billion so a slight beat However the net subscriber figure was above earlier estimates by several hundred thousand members Admittedly the impact on revenue wasnt as pronounced because Netflix provides a trial and in that trial phase Netflix is completely free So the impact on sales will be felt in the next quarter rather than the current quarter In the case of EPS Im willing to make the comparison to consensus estimates as management doesnt really provide outlook on net income The consensus analyst estimates for Q FY EPS was Netflix reported Q FY EPS of Thats basically a beat on EPS which is pretty solid considering analysts were anticipating content costs to ramp at a higher rate Overall Netflix produced a really solid quarter which is reflected in the after hours trading activity The company is extremely well positioned in the SVOD space despite competition from HBO and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Furthermore further room to increase pricing via a pricing tier was well received by subscribers which gives ample justification for investors to anticipate ARPU figures to trend even higher Therefore revenue growth will continue to accelerate as both pricing increases and international roll out drive top line expansion Admittedly not everyone should be chasing Netflix stock Growth stocks are inherently more volatile as the stock price is tied to future expectation making the stock vulnerable to quarterly earnings misses That didnt happen in the most recent quarter but weve seen cases where investors dove for the exits crashing the value of the stock Overall Im really impressed with both management and the business model I continue to reiterate my high conviction buy recommendation on Netflix Source Netflix Earnings And Why Growth Oriented Investors Should Own It Disclosure The author has no
