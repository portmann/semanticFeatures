( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video is still the only major streaming service with download capability . The significance of this goes beyond just the convenience the download option offers.Most streaming video content on all major services remains non-exclusive.But consumers will still assign credit for that content to just one service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>About seven weeks ago , I published an article arguing that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Prime Video was being underestimated as a streaming service because its download option , which is almost unique on the market , would not <b>appear</b> in peak downstream Internet traffic reports . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The article received a considerable pushback from many , who argued , among other things , that the service was both too <b>unknown</b> and too inconsequential to have the kind of impact I ascribed to it .  (Uncertainty) </span>In keeping with my usual practice, I didn't publish on the topic again right away.I wanted to give some time for the other side's arguments to sink in and really bounce around inside my head.But having considered it again and watched the ongoing evolution in video streaming, I have not changed my view.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , I think if anything I <b>might</b> have underestimated downloads significance .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> spent $ 1.3 billion on Prime Instant Video content in 2014 and will spend even <i>more</i> this year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Meanwhile Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) spent $3.2 billion on content in 2014, a number that will swell to $5 billion this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's spending is growing at even a proportional rate , it will be above $ 2 billion in 2016 . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And as it is trying to catch up with Netflix it <b>may</b> grow even <i>faster</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Obviously, maximizing the value of such large investments is crucial.An increasing percentage of this money goes to exclusive content deals that keep content off of competing services.Netflix has made it clear it intends to focus on exclusives from here on out , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has signed an increasing number of them as well . But a large amount of content remains un-exclusive, even now.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Netflix shared Epix content for three years until last year , when Netflix decided to drop it because - wait for it - it was n't exclusive . But <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did n't get to enjoy even a moment of exclusive bliss : Hulu picked up Epix right where Netflix left off . Many other movies and TV shows are also shared between competing providers, including not just other SVOD providers but also other traditional premium channels such as Showtime or Starz, which have all released their own apps for their Pay-TV subscribers and two of which (HBO and Showtime) have released stand-alone apps for cord-cutters as well.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As a late arrival to the streaming video space , with <i>less</i> than half the content spending of Netflix , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can not hope to secure <b>nearly</b> as many exclusives , which for obvious reasons often raise the cost significantly . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Most of its content will therefore be content that is shared with other services.Although Prime Instant Video boasts "thousands and thousands" of titles, its "Exclusive: Not on Netflix" category currently comprises exactly 478 titles.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And <b>almost</b> half of those are not really exclusive , since they are back seasons of TimeWarner 's ( NYSE : TWX ) HBO shows which are also available on HBO itself .  (Uncertainty) </span>A smattering of one-off deals for second-tier networks programming, a block of children's shows from Viacom , the CBS (NYSE: CBS ) summer slate and a few NBCUniversal shows (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) are its only truly exclusive fare.The rest is shared content.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But it is highly unlikely that someone will subscribe to multiple SVOD providers all offering identical or <b>nearly</b> identical catalogues .  (Uncertainty) </span>HBO and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> share HBO shows , Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> share Epix , and Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still share most of the rest of the Prime catalogue , including large blocks of content from CBS , NBC , and others . Downloads obviously help <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> differentiate its offering . "We offer downloads and the other guys don't."To those who take a lot of plane trips or have slow internet, that certainly has value.But the real impact of download rights is not the differentiation, but the elevation.Most consumers don't have official training in economic theory, but economics is actually the study of human behavior in the real world, so whether they do it consciously or sub-consciously we can expect them to follow the basic principles of diminishing marginal utility.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Somewhere</b> in their head they will rank all the various services .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` If I <b>could</b> only have one it would be this one .  (Uncertainty) </span>This would be my second pick, my third, etc." This ranking will reflect both costs (how much everyone charges) and benefits (how much content it includes that they want to watch.)But a lot of that content is non-exclusive.From a consumer standpoint, that's actually not ideal.If a consumer pays $ 99 for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video and pays $ 7.99 for Hulu and pays $ 9.99 a month for Netflix , they 're actually going to be a little upset when they log in and the see the same content in all three places . It will feel like they paid for it three times.So as they weigh the price and benefits of that non-exclusive content, which of the three services gets credit for delivering it, and which two get resented for making them pay for it a second and third time?Say someone likes three shows , A , B , and C. Netflix offers A and B , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> offers B and C . Who gets credit for show B?How do consumers decide whose "benefit" column non-exclusive content goes in?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Prior to now , if the consumer was being rational and following marginal utility , that actually <b>depended</b> on A and C. Which one do they like <i>more</i> ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Whichever one they like <i>more</i> is the one they attach <i>higher</i> priority to , the one they bought `` first . ''  (Surprise) </span>And since both shows came with show B thrown in at no extra cost, whichever one they bought first, or would buy first, gets credit for its own show and show B as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other service has to <b>hope</b> that its exclusive content alone is enough to convince the consumer to pay their subscription fee .  (Uncertainty) </span>Show B is already in the "pile," so the marginal benefit of a second SVOD is only the exclusive content.Netflix spends over twice what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does , and Hulu has access to next-day content from three of the top four broadcast channels ( ABC , NBC , and FOX . ) <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We ca n't get inside consumers ' heads , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video <b>probably</b> was n't first on many people 's priority lists . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But now, enter downloads.Marginal utility, remember.If the consumer buys Show B through Netflix or Hulu , and later discovers they need to download it , they 'll have to buy <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime anyway to have that option . On the other hand , if they buy <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , they wo n't need to spend any extra money to save money in a dead zone . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some customers already know they will need downloads and some already know that they wo n't , but a lot of customers <b>probably</b> just are n't sure .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And they <b>might</b> well attach some value to the piece of mind of knowing that they have the option to download if they need it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If that value is enough to convince them to rank <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <i>higher</i> than the other services , that does much <i>more</i> than just tinker with the Prime renewal rate at the margins . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>suddenly</b> shoves a bunch of non-exclusive content shared with Netflix and Hulu to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's side of the ledger . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It makes them see <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video as the service that `` got '' them all that non-exclusive content . Hulu and even Netflix are just the ones stupid enough to make them pay for it again.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>probably</b> will not be matching Netflix 's content spend for the foreseeable future . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The competition for exclusive fare is becoming increasingly cutthroat, and prices are rising accordingly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But far from being an also ran in exclusives , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>may</b> actually be following a very clever strategy of deliberately not throwing quite so much money at them . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>If downloads can put them ahead, they can pay non-exclusive rates and still get most of the benefits, in the form of customer loyalty, engagement, and retention, that exclusive fare would have brought them.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I know many <b>believe</b> I ascribe too much importance to the download option .  (Uncertainty) </span>But I truly think many are under-estimating just how pivotal downloads can be , both for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and for the course of the streaming video competition . With so much non-exclusive content being shared between services, the stakes are high for whoever manages to push themselves to the head of the pack in that regard.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> with downloads , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has taken a substantial step in that direction . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disclosure : I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned , but <b>may</b> initiate a long position in NFLX , AMZN over the next 72 hours .  (Uncertainty) </span>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.</div></body></html>
