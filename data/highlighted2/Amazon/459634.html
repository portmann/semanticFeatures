class='textDiv'>Amazons Clever Streaming Strategy Downloads Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video is still the only major streaming service with download capability The significance of this goes beyond just the convenience the download option offers Most streaming video content on all major services remains nonexclusive But consumers will still assign credit for that content to just one service About seven weeks ago I published an article arguing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Prime Video was being underestimated as a streaming service because its download option which is almost unique on the market would not appear in peak downstream Internet traffic reports The article received a considerable pushback from many who argued among other things that the service was both too unknown and too inconsequential to have the kind of impact I ascribed to it In keeping with my usual practice I didnt publish on the topic again right away I wanted to give some time for the other sides arguments to sink in and really bounce around inside my head But having considered it again and watched the ongoing evolution in video streaming I have not changed my view In fact I think if anything I might have underestimated downloads significance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>spent billion on Prime Instant Video content in and will spend even more this year Meanwhile Netflix NASDAQ NFLX spent billion on content in a number that will swell to billion this year Assuming Amazons spending is growing at even a proportional rate it will be above billion in And as it is trying to catch up with Netflix it may grow even faster Obviously maximizing the value of such large investments is crucial An increasing percentage of this money goes to exclusive content deals that keep content off of competing services Netflix has made it clear it intends to focus on exclusives from here on out and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has signed an increasing number of them as well But a large amount of content remains unexclusive even now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Netflix shared Epix content for three years until last year when Netflix decided to drop it because wait for it it wasnt exclusive But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>didnt get to enjoy even a moment of exclusive bliss Hulu picked up Epix right where Netflix left off Many other movies and TV shows are also shared between competing providers including not just other SVOD providers but also other traditional premium channels such as Showtime or Starz which have all released their own apps for their PayTV subscribers and two of which HBO and Showtime have released standalone apps for cordcutters as well As a late arrival to the streaming video space with less than half the content spending of Netflix <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cannot hope to secure nearly as many exclusives which for obvious reasons often raise the cost significantly Most of its content will therefore be content that is shared with other services Although Prime Instant Video boasts thousands and thousands of titles its Exclusive Not on Netflix category currently comprises exactly titles And almost half of those are not really exclusive since they are back seasons of TimeWarners NYSE TWX HBO shows which are also available on HBO itself A smattering of oneoff deals for secondtier networks programming a block of childrens shows from Viacom the CBS NYSE CBS summer slate and a few NBCUniversal shows NASDAQ CMCSA are its only truly exclusive fare The rest is shared content But it is highly unlikely that someone will subscribe to multiple SVOD providers all offering identical or nearly identical catalogues HBO and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>share HBO shows Hulu and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>share Epix and Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still share most of the rest of the Prime catalogue including large blocks of content from CBS NBC and others Downloads obviously help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>differentiate its offering We offer downloads and the other guys dont To those who take a lot of plane trips or have slow internet that certainly has value But the real impact of download rights is not the differentiation but the elevation Most consumers dont have official training in economic theory but economics is actually the study of human behavior in the real world so whether they do it consciously or subconsciously we can expect them to follow the basic principles of diminishing marginal utility Somewhere in their head they will rank all the various services If I could only have one it would be this one This would be my second pick my third etc This ranking will reflect both costs how much everyone charges and benefits how much content it includes that they want to watch But a lot of that content is nonexclusive From a consumer standpoint thats actually not ideal If a consumer pays for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video and pays for Hulu and pays a month for Netflix theyre actually going to be a little upset when they log in and the see the same content in all three places It will feel like they paid for it three times So as they weigh the price and benefits of that nonexclusive content which of the three services gets credit for delivering it and which two get resented for making them pay for it a second and third time Say someone likes three shows A B and C Netflix offers A and B <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offers B and C Who gets credit for show B How do consumers decide whose benefit column nonexclusive content goes in Prior to now if the consumer was being rational and following marginal utility that actually depended on A and C Which one do they like more Whichever one they like more is the one they attach higher priority to the one they bought first And since both shows came with show B thrown in at no extra cost whichever one they bought first or would buy first gets credit for its own show and show B as well The other service has to hope that its exclusive content alone is enough to convince the consumer to pay their subscription fee Show B is already in the pile so the marginal benefit of a second SVOD is only the exclusive content Netflix spends over twice what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does and Hulu has access to nextday content from three of the top four broadcast channels ABC NBC and FOX We cant get inside consumers heads but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video probably wasnt first on many peoples priority lists But now enter downloads Marginal utility remember If the consumer buys Show B through Netflix or Hulu and later discovers they need to download it theyll have to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime anyway to have that option On the other hand if they buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime they wont need to spend any extra money to save money in a dead zone Some customers already know they will need downloads and some already know that they wont but a lot of customers probably just arent sure And they might well attach some value to the piece of mind of knowing that they have the option to download if they need it If that value is enough to convince them to rank <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>higher than the other services that does much more than just tinker with the Prime renewal rate at the margins It suddenly shoves a bunch of nonexclusive content shared with Netflix and Hulu to Amazons side of the ledger It makes them see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video as the service that got them all that nonexclusive content Hulu and even Netflix are just the ones stupid enough to make them pay for it again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>probably will not be matching Netflixs content spend for the foreseeable future The competition for exclusive fare is becoming increasingly cutthroat and prices are rising accordingly But far from being an also ran in exclusives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may actually be following a very clever strategy of deliberately not throwing quite so much money at them If downloads can put them ahead they can pay nonexclusive rates and still get most of the benefits in the form of customer loyalty engagement and retention that exclusive fare would have brought them I know many believe I ascribe too much importance to the download option But I truly think many are underestimating just how pivotal downloads can be both for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and for the course of the streaming video competition With so much nonexclusive content being shared between services the stakes are high for whoever manages to push themselves to the head of the pack in that regard I believe with downloads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has taken a substantial step in that direction Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in NFLX AMZN over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
