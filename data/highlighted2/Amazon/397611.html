So if they want to create another Groupon with mass coupons have at it, but I think they are going to have a tough time justifying the investment with that approach.This business already exists, it is called Postmates and from the work we have done on t we at pretty convinced it is a zero.However it is a bit of a catch 22 as it is very difficult to steal existing cohorts especially without massive discounting, which is visible across the country with hyper local winners.See Bite Squad in Minneapolis where DD and PM entered and gave up.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Foodler in Boston , where GRUB has n't been able to supplant them after 10 years of marketing wars with a much <i>larger</i> budget , Seamless in NYC ( GrubHub tried to attack them prior to the merger with no success ) , Delivery Dudes in Florida , etc. so a lot of case studies of wars in this business and we are yet to find an example of the incumbent losing .  (Surprise) </span>It doesn't mean GRUB doesn't have a business in Boston, it just means they have had no success in stealing Foodler's customers, but they can battle for the incremental customer.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Obviously it is <i>more</i> expensive for the newcomer to get this growth given lack of word-of mouth / branding , but <b>possible</b> .

(Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Outside of food I 'm not sure there is a ton of demand for that type of service so not clear to me they <b>could</b> build a massive delivery network effect on the back of that so again question comes back to ability to scale and their return on capital .

(Surprise) </span>If they do want to get into this logistical space leveraging the 250k+ orders per day and growing nicely that GRUB gets is the easiest way to build that network.The consistently sensible management of Oaktree (NYSE: OAK ), Tribune Publishing's (NYSE: TPUB ) second largest holder, favors exploring a sale of the newspaper company.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>They think that we can do <i>better</i> than the current offer from Gannett ( NYSE : GCI ) and it is worth finding out how much <i>better</i> that <b>might</b> be .
