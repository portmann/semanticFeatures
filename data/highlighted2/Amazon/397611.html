(Surprise) </span>Here are some excerpts , On the one hand <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is always trying to improve customer experience , which generally comes in the form of convenience , pricing and/or selection . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So out of the gate think the <b>assumption</b> is that is what they are trying to do here and hence will undercut GRUB 's pricing , offer <i>quicker</i> delivery , etc. .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>What is unique about this space vs. pretty much every other ecommerce market that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is in relates to the structure of the network . It is point to point deliveries opposed to warehouse to point.When dealing with Warehouse to point deliveries <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has an unquestioned advantage . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They are simply trying to make sure you have two items in that delivery box instead of one in order to amortize those delivery costs across <i>larger</i> baskets and pass the savings back to consumers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hence they want to provide all eCommerce to best <b>optimize</b> the delivery network .  (Uncertainty) </span>However , in the case of food this is not something that keeps particularly well at warehouses and consumers tend to want to order from local restaurants they like and trust opposed to some <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> kitchen . As a result, you start having to go restaurant to house, to new restaurant to house, etc. as a delivery person.This completely eliminates the large logistical advantage that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> tends to have when it comes to internet purchases . In fact they are trying to roll-out a new delivery fleet to accomplish this so literally starting from scratch.As a result, the only way to have a logistical advantage here is through sheer number of food orders at these restaurants because delivery people are not able to deliver other items as well.I would be shocked if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doing 1 % the number of orders as Grub at the end of the year , implying GRUB actually has the massive scale advantage here for their network , which GRUB is passing back to consumers . I grant you this does n't eliminate <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's capital advantage and while they do unquestionably have this I do not think they are irrational investors . They haven't gotten to where they are by burning tons and tons of cash on businesses just for the fun of it.So the question is can they justify the return.Like their failed businesses in online travel, on-line coupons, inability to conquer Zappos, etc. they will shut-down or acquire of the logical choice.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doing the opposite of undercutting GRUB . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>They are charging <i>higher</i> take-rates to restaurants , 27.5 % .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Grub is a bidding system so not a direct comparison as <b>depends</b> on restaurant , but charge 10 % for delivery service and then average is ~ 14 % for the advertising so 24 % all in .  (Uncertainty) </span>We have done a lot of work in the LA market as it was an early market for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> where GRUB also has a presence . Restaurant count in LA has actually shrunk 15 % net for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> since launching there . In talking to the restaurants this is because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> drives no business , Kindle ( of course using their own tablet for software ) is crashing frequently ( we track about 10 % of the restaurants on their network are down each week due to Kindle issues ) and a pain to train staff on new system that drives no business . Of the ~ 50 restaurants we surveyed in LA , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> tended to drive 3 orders / week . Hence the churn in their restaurant base.Now <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can start giving away tons and tons of discounts / coupons to drive demand to please their restaurant base , but what we know from being in this business unsurprisingly is that coupons drive really crappy cohorts with low retention and re-order rates . So if they want to create another Groupon with mass coupons have at it, but I think they are going to have a tough time justifying the investment with that approach.This business already exists, it is called Postmates and from the work we have done on t we at pretty convinced it is a zero.However it is a bit of a catch 22 as it is very difficult to steal existing cohorts especially without massive discounting, which is visible across the country with hyper local winners.See Bite Squad in Minneapolis where DD and PM entered and gave up.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Foodler in Boston , where GRUB has n't been able to supplant them after 10 years of marketing wars with a much <i>larger</i> budget , Seamless in NYC ( GrubHub tried to attack them prior to the merger with no success ) , Delivery Dudes in Florida , etc. so a lot of case studies of wars in this business and we are yet to find an example of the incumbent losing .  (Surprise) </span>It doesn't mean GRUB doesn't have a business in Boston, it just means they have had no success in stealing Foodler's customers, but they can battle for the incremental customer.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Obviously it is <i>more</i> expensive for the newcomer to get this growth given lack of word-of mouth / branding , but <b>possible</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Nevertheless out growing someone is not the same as displacing and even that I would be <b>surprised</b> if they can do .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While I would n't be shocked if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ends up deciding the <i>better</i> use of capital is to own GRUB I think that very much <b>depends</b> if they want to build out this separate delivery network for point to point deliveries in <i>less</i> than an hour . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Outside of food I 'm not sure there is a ton of demand for that type of service so not clear to me they <b>could</b> build a massive delivery network effect on the back of that so again question comes back to ability to scale and their return on capital .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Obviously them not owning it does create a <b>risk</b> that someone else does build that network and owns it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>GRUB is now doing these deliveries in 75 cities and adding <i>more</i> cities every week .  (Surprise) </span>If they do want to get into this logistical space leveraging the 250k+ orders per day and growing nicely that GRUB gets is the easiest way to build that network.The consistently sensible management of Oaktree (NYSE: OAK ), Tribune Publishing's (NYSE: TPUB ) second largest holder, favors exploring a sale of the newspaper company.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>They think that we can do <i>better</i> than the current offer from Gannett ( NYSE : GCI ) and it is worth finding out how much <i>better</i> that <b>might</b> be .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The market is not an accommodating machine.It will not go where you want it to go just because you need it to go there.Democracies end when they are too democratic.If you are interested in arbitrage, event driven, or value investing, please follow me on Seeking Alpha by clicking on the "follow" button at the top of the page.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I signed up for StW <i>earlier</i> this year and I am really impressed with the quality of articles written by Chris .
