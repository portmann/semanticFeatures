comments I got a response from a reader in regards to yesterdays bearish post on GrubHub NYSE GRUB that was much better than what I had to say Here are some excerpts On the one hand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is always trying to improve customer experience which generally comes in the form of convenience pricing andor selection So out of the gate think the assumption is that is what they are trying to do here and hence will undercut GRUBs pricing offer quicker delivery etc What is unique about this space vs pretty much every other ecommerce market that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is in relates to the structure of the network It is point to point deliveries opposed to warehouse to point When dealing with Warehouse to point deliveries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has an unquestioned advantage They are simply trying to make sure you have two items in that delivery box instead of one in order to amortize those delivery costs across larger baskets and pass the savings back to consumers Hence they want to provide all eCommerce to best optimize the delivery network However in the case of food this is not something that keeps particularly well at warehouses and consumers tend to want to order from local restaurants they like and trust opposed to some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>kitchen As a result you start having to go restaurant to house to new restaurant to house etc as a delivery person This completely eliminates the large logistical advantage that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tends to have when it comes to internet purchases In fact they are trying to rollout a new delivery fleet to accomplish this so literally starting from scratch As a result the only way to have a logistical advantage here is through sheer number of food orders at these restaurants because delivery people are not able to deliver other items as well I would be shocked if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doing the number of orders as Grub at the end of the year implying GRUB actually has the massive scale advantage here for their network which GRUB is passing back to consumers I grant you this doesnt eliminate Amazons capital advantage and while they do unquestionably have this I do not think they are irrational investors They havent gotten to where they are by burning tons and tons of cash on businesses just for the fun of it So the question is can they justify the return Like their failed businesses in online travel online coupons inability to conquer Zappos etc they will shutdown or acquire of the logical choice <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doing the opposite of undercutting GRUB They are charging higher takerates to restaurants Grub is a bidding system so not a direct comparison as depends on restaurant but charge for delivery service and then average is for the advertising so all in We have done a lot of work in the LA market as it was an early market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>where GRUB also has a presence Restaurant count in LA has actually shrunk net for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>since launching there In talking to the restaurants this is because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>drives no business Kindle of course using their own tablet for software is crashing frequently we track about of the restaurants on their network are down each week due to Kindle issues and a pain to train staff on new system that drives no business Of the restaurants we surveyed in LA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tended to drive orders week Hence the churn in their restaurant base Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can start giving away tons and tons of discounts coupons to drive demand to please their restaurant base but what we know from being in this business unsurprisingly is that coupons drive really crappy cohorts with low retention and reorder rates So if they want to create another Groupon with mass coupons have at it but I think they are going to have a tough time justifying the investment with that approach This business already exists it is called Postmates and from the work we have done on t we at pretty convinced it is a zero However it is a bit of a catch as it is very difficult to steal existing cohorts especially without massive discounting which is visible across the country with hyper local winners See Bite Squad in Minneapolis where DD and PM entered and gave up Foodler in Boston where GRUB hasnt been able to supplant them after years of marketing wars with a much larger budget Seamless in NYC GrubHub tried to attack them prior to the merger with no success Delivery Dudes in Florida etc so a lot of case studies of wars in this business and we are yet to find an example of the incumbent losing It doesnt mean GRUB doesnt have a business in Boston it just means they have had no success in stealing Foodlers customers but they can battle for the incremental customer Obviously it is more expensive for the newcomer to get this growth given lack of wordof mouth branding but possible Nevertheless out growing someone is not the same as displacing and even that I would be surprised if they can do While I wouldnt be shocked if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ends up deciding the better use of capital is to own GRUB I think that very much depends if they want to build out this separate delivery network for point to point deliveries in less than an hour Outside of food Im not sure there is a ton of demand for that type of service so not clear to me they could build a massive delivery network effect on the back of that so again question comes back to ability to scale and their return on capital Obviously them not owning it does create a risk that someone else does build that network and owns it GRUB is now doing these deliveries in cities and adding more cities every week If they do want to get into this logistical space leveraging the k orders per day and growing nicely that GRUB gets is the easiest way to build that network The consistently sensible management of Oaktree NYSE OAK Tribune Publishings NYSE TPUB second largest holder favors exploring a sale of the newspaper company They think that we can do better than the current offer from Gannett NYSE GCI and it is worth finding out how much better that might be The market is not an accommodating machine It will not go where you want it to go just because you need it to go there Democracies end when they are too democratic If you are interested in
