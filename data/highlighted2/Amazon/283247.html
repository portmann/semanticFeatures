class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Excellent Value for Military Members I love <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime In my personal opinion its one of the best deals going in the tech sector And it has added many new features since I first became a member several years ago For those who arent familiar with it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is famous for its Free day shipping on most items Many members find this benefit alone to be worth the annual membership fee Prime Video streaming video with an extensive Prime Radio streaming radio featuring the ability to stream entire albums customize radio stations multiple genres of music etc Prime Photos free storage for all of your photos in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Cloud Drive as well as an additional GB of free storage space for personal video and document storage Kindle Owners Lending Library the ability

<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Student for roughly half the cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is a Great Deal for Military Members One of my favorite benefits is the free day shipping I am geographically separated from most of my family So Christmas shopping is easy with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I can order gifts have them wrapped and shipped for less than the cost of buying something locally and shipping it myself I also frequently use the free day shipping for personal purchases that arent timesensitive Its often easier to purchase something from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and have it shipped to my door rather than drive to and from the store search for the item wait in line etc Many military members find themselves in the same situation Living away from family members makes a service like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime ideal for sending gifts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can also be a great way to order items when you live overseas as many items on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cant be found at the Exchanges or on the local economy Note that Free day shipping may not apply to all overseas locations as transit times can take longer and most day shipping is sent via UPS That said most items can be shipped to APO addresses even if it may take longer than days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video and Radio may be different for many overseas military members due to licensing agreements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video and Radio are generally only available in the US due to how the licensing and royalties work However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recently announced they are offering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video to military members on certain
