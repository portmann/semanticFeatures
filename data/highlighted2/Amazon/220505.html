(Uncertainty) </span>Those products were not scaled down versions inferior to the Windows versions, but full bodied and effective programs that iOS and Android users would find every bit as powerful as their Windows counterparts.The Office for iPad application quickly ran to the top of the App Store download list after its 2014 introduction.In one year, over 100 million users of iOS and Android downloaded Microsoft Office for their devices.That trend is likely to continue.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At the same time , Microsoft is taking steps to make it <i>easier</i> for developers to port their iOS and Android applications to run on Windows 10 devices .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft's strategy is as diabolical as it is brilliant.Microsoft knows the key to success in software is to make users want Microsoft functionality and make it easy for developers to provide it regardless of OS or platform.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Once hundreds of millions ( or even billions in the case of Office ) users value the functionality of Microsoft software suites , and with barriers to developing or `` porting '' applications to run on Windows 10 as low as <b>possible</b> , developers will follow and `` water will run downhill '' with both users and developers putting Microsoft at the top of their opportunity list .  (Uncertainty) </span>In that regard, Microsoft devices will gradually gain traction.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft announced that 110 million devices are already using Windows 10 and that its commercial cloud business has reached <i>more</i> than $ 8 billion in annual revenues .  (Surprise) </span>Microsoft 's fast growing cloud platforms will emerge as enormous and highly profitable businesses that compete with Google and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , not Apple . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even in mobile , Microsoft <b>seems</b> to be determined to advance .  (Uncertainty) </span>I can't wait to get my hands on a Lumia 950XL and start to use it not only as my smartphone but also as a desktop replacement, taking advantage of the wireless connectivity to monitor, keyboard and mouse to have only one device meet my mobile and desktop needs.In the near term, Apple is projecting anemic growth for the December quarter while Microsoft is projecting a slight decline as it shifts to a subscription model.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft 's <b>apparent</b> revenue softness disguises robust growth in key commercial cloud segments and the rapid rise of subscription revenues which will I expect will overtake traditional revenue recognition in the next two or three years .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The snapshot <b>suggests</b> Apple is outperforming Microsoft , but the reality is the reverse .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my opinion , Apple is heading into slow growth and <b>perhaps</b> even a decline in both revenues and profits while Microsoft is on the cusp of a solid breakout to the upside on all fronts .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It was no <b>surprise</b> to me that MSFT outperformed AAPL for the past few years .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> that trend will continue and even accelerate in 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>I will maintain my short position in AAPL and selectively add MSFT on any dips.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
