class='textDiv'>Instagram Losing To Pokemon GO Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Gaming as a whole could be taking share from social media as its usage time is in decline Pokemon GO has taken time from Instagram and other apps Facebook NASDAQ FB is reporting earnings this week It has taken the mantel as the bestperforming stock in the FANG acronym year to date In fact it has even had the best performance when you look at the expanded TFAANG acronym which includes Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and Apple NASDAQ AAPL However even as Facebook has had great performance I feel that its risks have increased Bullish investors love to describe Facebooks moat in social media as the main app has the highest time spent on it in the entire sector However they are ignoring the competition from apps outside of social media When analysts ask Reed Hastings the CEO of Netflix NASDAQ NFLX about increased competition from the likes of HBO NYSE TWX and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN he always reminds them that NFLX views competition differently It doesnt just look at the other video content subscription services It views the entire entertainment landscape as competition whether its video games or social media apps From this perspective Netflix recognizes the competition will always be high Even if it was able to put HBO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Hulu NYSE DIS out of business it will still be difficult to gain new subscribers and keep churn low This is the same way investors should look at Facebook It was easy to ignore this competition from other categories such as games when social media was growing as Facebook took market share in the category but now we are in a new dynamic where social media is in decline so it is not enough to just analyze Twitter NYSE TWTR and Snapchat Private CHAT to determine the level of competition As I showed in my article Facebook Is Losing Ground the time spent on social media is down minutes in the US from Q to Q with all major social media apps showing declines Investors need to look at gaming as a real threat to social media Recognize as I make the point that Pokemon GO OTCPKNTDOY is taking share from social media that I understand Pokemon GO may not have staying power However I believe it represents how gaming can impact time spent on social media As you can see from the infographic which uses data from a Citi report Instagram usage is down about from before Pokemon GO was released as compared to after it was released It makes sense Facebook was the least affected by the change because it appears the younger demographic has been playing the game the most and FB has a more mature user base The chart below shows the time spent on Pokemon GO versus the other social media apps Pokemon GO has had the most successful launch in the history of the App Store so these metrics jive with that record Its also worth noting how Snapchat is catching up to Facebook with time spent only four minutes lower I would be really interested to see the data on how Pokemon GO affected Snapchat usage Its too bad we dont have that data available The only thing I can say is that Snapchat is currently third in the App Store while Instagram has declined to ninth as you can see from the chart below Not only has Pokemon GO knocked Instagram down but the Poke Radar app has also pushed it lower in the rankings This thesis on gaming taking over social media is definitely a work in progress It seems social media is in decline and gaming is on the rise My best guess is that Pokemon GO is an example of one of those games It just happens to have a more pronounced and quantifiable effect on social apps because of its sheer size The data point that jumps out at me is the decline in time spent on YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Facebook can be looked at as a staple which is being threatened by Snapchat but probably wont lose out to a game Instagram and Twitter are used by a younger audience making them more vulnerable Maybe YouTube lost out because it is used by a younger audience and has the most to lose Besides the direct impact from Pokemon GO it is also interesting to look at the effect augmented reality will have on social media It could be a new trend alongside live streaming which could alter the landscape of the industry Snapchat seems to be the most advanced in this category with its use of filters The company recently filed a patent for an adoverlaying system which services ads based on what you are doing The idea of seeing an ad for a restaurant nearby while you capture a video within the app can be more effective than traditional online ads because it gets closer to the point of purchase It also has an effect on what you spend your money on in real life as opposed to what youll purchase online It is becoming clearer that the concept of a social media app being a place where you simply post a few words about your day is becoming obsolete Video whether it be live or with augmented reality integrated will be the next frontier of social networking as content becomes even more immersive Snapchat appears to be the big winner in this new industry The caveat is I could be completely wrong if Snapchat is actually getting killed by Pokemon GO even though its third in the App Store Gaming has been a part of the reason behind why social media usage has been down across the board Pokemon GO shows us one game can hurt these apps as well with Facebook being the only one to avoid the pain However Facebook isnt out of the woods because Snapchat appears to be the best situated for this new augmented reality social network space Snapchat is trying to change directions to appeal to older folks on Facebook It can pivot towards them while continuing to appeal to the younger generations if it keeps innovating faster than the other apps The recent patent filed by Snapchat shows it is focused on staying ahead of the game by being the first to implement new features effectively Instagram has been seeing declines due to Pokemon GO I will be looking to see if Facebook mentions Pokemon GO in its prepared remarks as a headwind or if an analyst asks it about the games effect on the firm If Facebook says it is hurting usage on any of its apps this could hurt the stock I wrote this article myself and it expresses my
