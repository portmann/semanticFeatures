(NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha The barriers to entry for streaming businesses have been toppled.As a result, Netflix has lost its monopoly and must now act not as a growth stock but as a market share thief.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In a July 7 article , I argued that Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) has <i>more</i> downside than upside .  (Surprise) </span>As subscriber growth slows, investors increasingly turn to the company's fundamentals to justify their investment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And as they do so , they find it <i>harder</i> to defend NFLX as a long position .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>About one year ago , I learned of the public backlash an analyst receives when <b>suggesting</b> a short position on a glamour stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>The simple fact of it is that many investors have a personal attachment to such stocks.When the ego gets involved, money inevitably is lost, which is why investing objectively is such an important concept.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This time , I once again received backlash from my <b>suggestion</b> that NFLX investors take their profits before earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is one of the reason that I 've taken some of the <i>more</i> choice trade selections to my Exposing Earnings newsletter .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I ran an in-depth analysis on NFLX 's earnings prediction over the weekend and <b>suggested</b> buying puts , which many of my subscribers did : That said , I know earnings-based trades are not for everyone .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, I have received questions from my students , who also played NFLX short, as to where NFLX is likely headed after this earnings report.So today I bring public my thoughts on the stock.NFLX is a notoriously strange stock in that NFLX is driven by subscriber statistics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If subscriber growth does not meet investors ' expectations , the stock will take a tumble .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investors expect much from this stock, as evidenced by NFLX's PE ratio, which was 1000% that of the industry standard prior to earnings.The PE ratio is unlikely to drop to average levels.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Thus , even with the price drop , we have <i>more</i> downside than upside .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Not only do high PE stocks tend to underperform but they also are driven <i>more</i> by <b>speculation</b> than by hard numbers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my last article , I argued that this <b>might</b> be changing for NFLX .  (Uncertainty) </span>Eventually the company will reach peak subscribers, and the focus will shift to revenue and margins.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>believe</b> we are on the cusp of that transition : If we are to begin analyzing NFLX from the fundamentals , we will see numerous headwinds .  (Uncertainty) </span>Event-based headwinds, including Brexit, restrictive European regulations and the summer Olympics.These headwinds are generally short term and can be overcome simply through time.What is not short term, however, is NFLX's debt load.Remarkably, any mention of debt was absent from the earnings call.While free cash flow falls, debt remains the same.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The scary part here is that NFLX intends to raise <i>more</i> debt .  (Surprise) </span>The debt-to-equity can easily climb from its current 1.33 to 1.50 by the end of 2017.Needless to say, a company that has found its capacity to hasten growth crippled should not be raising capital to leverage its low efficiency.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In other words , NFLX has <i>more</i> than just a growth problem .  (Surprise) </span>It has a management problem.The numbers have spoken: NFLX should focus on fixing its balance sheet.Yet management chooses not to listen.We must stop looking at NFLX as a growth stock.Four reasons support dropping this viewpoint.Four Reasons That Show NFLX Is Not a Growth Stock First, the numbers simply show that we have flipped the last few pages of NFLX's growth success story.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>US additions dropped by <b>nearly</b> half .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wall Street 's estimates in the international realm missed by <b>nearly</b> 20 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Once everyone has a chair , it 's <i>harder</i> to sell new chairs .  (Surprise) </span>Second, NFLX's growth was one of disruptive technology.What was once seen as disruptive technology is now taken for granted.NFLX's game is no longer one of convincing consumers to get with the times but maintaining market share.In this way, the company is similar to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) now that smartphones are matter of course.Third, scalability has essentially reached its cap.Some investors look at NFLX's recent numbers and think that the company is underperforming.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They <b>could</b> not be further from the truth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The fact of the matter is that NFLX has already nearly achieved the <b>optimal</b> level of scalability .  (Uncertainty) </span>Everyone who wants Netflix likely already has it.This is good for NFLX, obviously, but it also precludes the ability to call NFLX a growth stock.Peak scale simply means that NFLX must re-frame its goals.Subscriber growth should take a backseat to concepts such as lifetime customer value, operating margins, and customer retention.This is where NFLX will be made or broken.Examples of companies that have failed or flourished after reaching peak scale, respectively, are Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ).Fourth, the barrier to entry is no longer high to the point of insulating NFLX from competition.Now that the startups created to compete with NFLX - YouTube Red by Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Prime Video , CBS ( NYSE : CBS ) All Access , and Hulu - are being taken seriously , the game becomes one of market share tug-of-war . Any future growth in NFLX will be related to the usurping of competitors' customers.This competition is palpable in the US and will inevitably expand into NFLX's international marketplaces.We saw in the recent earnings report the first indications that NFLX has lost Internet traffic share to competitors.NFLX stock will fall with its traffic until the company's management switches "subscriber growth" with "quality, original content" in its order of priorities.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Being Bullish on NFLX Implies You <b>Believe</b> NFLX Is at a Bottom For now , NFLX 's action plan of burning through cash and raising debt to gain <i>more</i> subscribers will only lead to further declines in the stock .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To take a bullish position on NFLX now necessarily <b>assumes</b> that we have hit a relative bottom .  (Uncertainty) </span>We have not.We won't see a bottom until NFLX clearly differentiates itself from its competitors in branding and content exclusivity.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Until then , NFLX is a <i>better</i> short than a long .  (Surprise) </span>I recommend NFLX investors do two things: Remove the association between "growth stock" and "NFLX" from your mind.My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this newsletter , we employ both fundamental and pattern analyses to <b>predict</b> price movements of specific companies after specific earnings .
