now act not as a growth stock but as a market share thief In a July article I argued that Netflix NASDAQ NFLX has more downside than upside As subscriber growth slows investors increasingly turn to the companys fundamentals to justify their investment And as they do so they find it harder to defend NFLX as a long position About one year ago I learned of the public backlash an analyst receives when suggesting a short position on a glamour stock The simple fact of it is that many investors have a personal attachment to such stocks When the ego gets involved money inevitably is lost which is why investing objectively is such an important concept This time I once again received backlash from my suggestion that NFLX investors take their profits before earnings This is one of the reason that Ive taken some of the more choice trade selections to my Exposing Earnings newsletter I ran an indepth analysis on NFLXs earnings prediction over the weekend and suggested buying puts which many of my subscribers did That said I know earningsbased trades are not for everyone However I have received questions from my students who also played NFLX short as to where NFLX is likely headed after this earnings report So today I bring public my thoughts on the stock NFLX is a notoriously strange stock in that NFLX is driven by subscriber statistics If subscriber growth does not meet investors expectations the stock will take a tumble Investors expect much from this stock as evidenced by NFLXs PE ratio which was that of the industry standard prior to earnings The PE ratio is unlikely to drop to average levels Thus even with the price drop we have more downside than upside Not only do high PE stocks tend to underperform but they also are driven more by speculation than by hard numbers In my last article I argued that this might be changing for NFLX Eventually the company will reach peak subscribers and the focus will shift to revenue and margins I believe we are on the cusp of that transition If we are to begin analyzing NFLX from the fundamentals we will see numerous headwinds Eventbased headwinds including Brexit restrictive European regulations and the summer Olympics These headwinds are generally short term and can be overcome simply through time What is not short term however is NFLXs debt load Remarkably any mention of debt was absent from the earnings call While free cash flow falls debt remains the same The scary part here is that NFLX intends to raise more debt The debttoequity can easily climb from its current to by the end of Needless to say a company that has found its capacity to hasten growth crippled should not be raising capital to leverage its low efficiency In other words NFLX has more than just a growth problem It has a management problem The numbers have spoken NFLX should focus on fixing its balance sheet Yet management chooses not to listen We must stop looking at NFLX as a growth stock Four reasons support dropping this viewpoint Four Reasons That Show NFLX Is Not a Growth Stock First the numbers simply show that we have flipped the last few pages of NFLXs growth success story US additions dropped by nearly half Wall Streets estimates in the international realm missed by nearly Once everyone has a chair its harder to sell new chairs Second NFLXs growth was one of disruptive technology What was once seen as disruptive technology is now taken for granted NFLXs game is no longer one of convincing consumers to get with the times but maintaining market share In this way the company is similar to Apple NASDAQ AAPL now that smartphones are matter of course Third scalability has essentially reached its cap Some investors look at NFLXs recent numbers and think that the company is underperforming They could not be further from the truth The fact of the matter is that NFLX has already nearly achieved the optimal level of scalability Everyone who wants Netflix likely already has it This is good for NFLX obviously but it also precludes the ability to call NFLX a growth stock Peak scale simply means that NFLX must reframe its goals Subscriber growth should take a backseat to concepts such as lifetime customer value operating margins and customer retention This is where NFLX will be made or broken Examples of companies that have failed or flourished after reaching peak scale respectively are Groupon NASDAQ GRPN and Facebook NASDAQ FB Fourth the barrier to entry is no longer high to the point of insulating NFLX from competition Now that the startups created to compete with NFLX YouTube Red by Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Prime Video CBS NYSE CBS All Access and Hulu are being taken seriously the game becomes one of market share tugofwar Any future growth in NFLX will be related to the usurping of competitors customers This competition is palpable in the US and will inevitably expand into NFLXs international marketplaces We saw in the recent earnings report the first indications that NFLX has lost Internet traffic share to competitors NFLX stock will fall with its traffic until the companys management switches subscriber growth with quality original content in its order of priorities Being Bullish on NFLX Implies You Believe NFLX Is at a Bottom For now NFLXs action plan of burning through cash and raising debt to gain more subscribers will only lead to further declines in the stock To take a bullish position on NFLX now necessarily assumes that we have hit a relative bottom We have not We wont see a bottom until NFLX clearly differentiates itself from its competitors in branding and content exclusivity Until then NFLX is a better short than a long I recommend NFLX investors do two things Remove the association between growth stock and NFLX from your mind My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live here on Seeking Alpha In this newsletter we employ both fundamental and pattern
