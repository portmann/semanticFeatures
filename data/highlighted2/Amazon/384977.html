style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>shocked analysts by aligning itself with theater owners the streaming company surprised the industry again by unveiling a new monthly subscription option Combined both pieces of news are helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>close the gap on its main rival Netflix at a time many perceive the company vulnerable Amazons new monthly options may be more costly in the long run but they give consumers the same flexibility and freedom similar streaming plans offer Last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN fired a big shot across the bow at Netflix NASDAQ NFLX when it aligned itself with theaters at CinemaCon The move gives the streaming giants films a huge boost and its overall brand additional exposure On Sunday night <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>revealed a new pricing structure that lets subscribers pay monthly rather than yearly This is akin to what Netflix and other streaming services already have in place Although to be honest this really has less to do with consumers getting a good deal and more about giving them the freedom they want but at a price Aside from the traditional yearly plan customers can now opt for a streaming only plan or more allencompassing plan The plan cheaper than what Netflixs main plan sells for a month is basically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>without the bells and whistles namely no free shipping Customers also have a a month option which is essentially the equivalent of what youd get with the annual plan The twist is that if you add up the costs over months the plan comes out to a year and the plan comes out to a year both above the annual flat fee While many have attacked the new options as being a bad deal for the consumer those critics are missing the point Yes in terms of dollars and cents it is a bad deal After all youre paying anywhere from roughly to more a year but again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>didnt do this to save its customers money it did it to sign new customers While that may sound a little strange its true What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did here was allow people who dont want to spend a year upfront another option The tradeoff is that it comes with a price tag Think of it as a convenience fee The truth is a lot of consumers dont want to spend a year all at once when services like Netflix allow them to subscribe in monthly intervals Now that chunk of consumers has an option that at its smallest level is right on par with the rates offered by a growing number of services including HBO NYSE TWX Showtime Starz STAZA NASDAQ STRZB On paper it looks competitive even if its not a better deal Whats getting lost in the mix here is something pointed out by Macquarie Researchs Ben Schachter This is not a play for the average streamer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doing this in a way to expand its service to lowerincome families that dont want to or cant afford to spend in one lump payment The service has always been an outlier in terms of its unique allin price and that makes it come across as more of a luxury play In fact right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime is predominantly in households that make over and Amazons goal is to get the service into half of ALL households by The key to that is accessibility and thats what this new tier system offers All of a sudden Netflix and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>now look to be on the same level Yet in this case while its all about perception that perception is really just smoke and mirrors As I referenced the other day a Morgan Stanley poll released this month shows streaming media is gaining over the linear model which we all knew However the poll goes on to show that Netflix is dominating that growth with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and streaming offerings from Showtime Starz and the like unable to escape singledigit range To be fair Showtime and Starzs OTT options are relatively new so its not exactly a reliable indicator of their success thus far but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been around which makes the lack of stickiness surprising Still make no mistake the monthly model idea is really more of an idea on how to draw new customers and if some of those come from Netflix then so be it The timing here is also perfect as not only does this come following its CinemaCon news but it comes the same week as the Netflix rate hike for grandfathered years AND it came the day before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>revealed its Q earnings which were mixed at best This was a calculated move designed to further its market share at the expense of the nearest competitor How well it works remains to be seen but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has nothing to lose with this strategy and everything to gain which has to make investors excited Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
