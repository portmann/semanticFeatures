( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Just days after <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shocked analysts by aligning itself with theater owners , the streaming company <b>surprised</b> the industry again by unveiling a new monthly subscription option . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Combined , both pieces of news are helping <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> close the gap on its main rival Netflix at a time many perceive the company vulnerable . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's new monthly options <b>may</b> be <i>more</i> costly in the long run , but they give consumers the same flexibility and freedom similar streaming plans offer . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Last week <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) fired a big shot across the bow at Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , when it aligned itself with theaters at CinemaCon . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The move gives the streaming giant 's films a huge boost and its overall brand additional <b>exposure</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>On Sunday night , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> revealed a new pricing structure that lets subscribers pay monthly rather than yearly . This is akin to what Netflix and other streaming services already have in place.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although , to be honest , this really has <i>less</i> to do with consumers getting a good deal and <i>more</i> about giving them the freedom they want ... but at a price .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Aside from the traditional $ 99 yearly plan , customers can now opt for a $ 8.99 streaming only plan or $ 10.99 <i>more</i> all-encompassing plan .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The $ 8.99 plan , $ 1 <i>cheaper</i> than what Netflix 's main plan sells for a month , is basically <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> without the bells and whistles ( namely no free shipping ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Customers also have a $10.99 a month option which is essentially the equivalent of what you'd get with the annual plan.The twist is that if you add up the costs over 12 months, the $8.99 plan comes out to $107.99 a year and the $10.99 plan comes out to $131.88 a year, both above the $99 annual flat fee.While many have attacked the new options as being a bad deal for the consumer, those critics are missing the point.Yes, in terms of dollars and cents it is a bad deal.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>After all you 're paying anywhere from <b>roughly</b> $ 8 to $ 32 <i>more</i> a year , but again <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did n't do this to save its customers money , it did it to sign new customers . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While that <b>may</b> sound a little strange , it 's true .  (Uncertainty) </span>What <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did here was allow people who do n't want to spend $ 99 a year upfront another option . The tradeoff is that it comes with a price tag.Think of it as a convenience fee.The truth is a lot of consumers don't want to spend $99 a year all at once when services like Netflix allow them to subscribe in monthly intervals.Now that chunk of consumers has an option that at its smallest level ($8.99) is right on par with the rates offered by a growing number of services including HBO (NYSE: TWX ), Showtime, Starz (STAZA) (NASDAQ: STRZB ).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On paper it looks competitive , even if it 's not a <i>better</i> deal .  (Surprise) </span>What's getting lost in the mix here is something pointed out by Macquarie Research's Ben Schachter.This is not a play for the average streamer.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is doing this in a way to expand its service to lower-income families that do n't want to ( or ca n't afford to ) spend $ 99 in one lump payment . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The service has always been an outlier in terms of its unique all-in price and that makes it come across as <i>more</i> of a luxury play .  (Surprise) </span>In fact , right now <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime is predominantly in households that make over $ 112,000 and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's goal is to get the service into half of ALL households by 2020 . The key to that is accessibility and that's what this new tier system offers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All of a <b>sudden</b> , Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> now look to be on the same level . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Yet in this case while it's all about perception, that perception is really just smoke and mirrors.As I referenced the other day a Morgan Stanley poll released this month shows streaming media is gaining over the linear model (which we all knew).However the poll goes on to show that Netflix is dominating that growth , with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and streaming offerings from Showtime , Starz and the like unable to escape single-digit range . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>To be fair , Showtime and Starz 's OTT options are relatively new so it 's not exactly a reliable indicator of their success thus far , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been around which makes the lack of stickiness <b>surprising</b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Still , make no mistake , the monthly model idea is really <i>more</i> of an idea on how to draw new customers ... and if some of those come from Netflix then so be it .  (Surprise) </span>The timing here is also perfect as not only does this come following its CinemaCon news , but it comes the same week as the Netflix rate hike for grandfathered years AND it came the day before <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> revealed its Q1 earnings ( which were mixed at best ) . This was a calculated move designed to further its market share at the expense of the nearest competitor.How well it works remains to be seen , but <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has nothing to lose with this strategy and everything to gain which has to make investors excited .
