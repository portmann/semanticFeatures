Playmation sets at Disney stores The demos are to show parents how much fun kids can have with the interactive sets Together with interactive sets from Star Wars and Frozen this product line could become a M B annual business Disney toy lovers and comic book fans will rejoice over the new Playmation toy line that will most likely be a hot item for Christmas this year Walt Disney NYSE DIS just announced minute demonstrations of the Avenger Playmation toy series for children and parents will be held at Disney store locations from this weekend onward The toys which are set to come on the market in October are an interactive set of wearable tech and action figures that allow children to play in the yard and around the house all without using a display screen Since the set and extra items are above an average toy price the demos are to put the toys into childrens hands for a test drive and give parents a chance to see how much fun the kids can have Disney hopes that will be enough to get over that price hurdle The physical activity is guided by voice instructions and children have to perform tasks by running jumping being silent and taking cover The first series will be based on The Avengers and have repulsor gloves akin to Iron Man and target beacons that can shoot back in the game A related app will set out and keep track of activity completion and times Following the successful Iron Man and Avengers movies this toy set could be a big hit for this Christmas Similar sets could be made for the upcoming Star Wars films and Frozen sequel so I would imagine we could be looking at a very profitable toy line for a number of years in a row They could also be popular items at comic book conventions and kept as collectibles by adults too Disney announced the toys are now available for preordering through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN Best Buy NYSE BBY GameStop NYSE GME Target NYSE TGT ToysRUs and Walmart NYSE WMT The set will be extra action figures are and the special Prowler Bot is Thatll set you back as much as so you can understand why the demos are important to educate the parents about why they should buy them Disney has a long lineup of movies coming out over the next years and developing these kinds of toys and consumer goods allows the company to push sales beyond the regular action figures and games This highlights the reason why Disney decided to merge its consumer products and interactive segments which it announced at the end of June With wearable tech and apps the company can expand the scope and playability of its toys and goods In the companys Q these two segments accounted for billion or about of revenues and million in operating income Editorinchief and CEO Jim Silver of toy review site TTPM said he projects the Avengers line of connected toys could be a million a year business but could expand to a billion annual business once the Star Wars and Frozen sets are out on the market Disney stock is at new alltime highs around Yeartodate it is up almost and is trading at times forward earnings Investors are following the recent blockbuster films of Frozen Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers Age of Ultron and expect the December Star Wars release will make a year to remember at the box office and in the stock portfolio I think the stock has a lot of market momentum but investors should also keep watch on the companys Media Networks segment which covers cable networks and broadcasting business A decrease in ESPN in the second quarter due to higher programming and production costs as well as flat results from Disney Channels and ABC Family led this segment down and basically flat for the two most recent quarters This segment generates the largest amount of operating income so it concerns me Still diluted EPS were up for the quarter adjusted EPS up That sets a good pace for the rest of the year I would say Disney has a strong stock story and good
