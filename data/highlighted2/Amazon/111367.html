The set will be $120, extra action figures are $14.99 and the special Prowler Bot is $39.99.That'll set you back as much as $175, so you can understand why the demos are important to educate the parents about why they should buy them.Disney has a long line-up of movies coming out over the next 2-3 years and developing these kinds of toys and consumer goods allows the company to push sales beyond the regular action figures and games.This highlights the reason why Disney decided to merge its consumer products and interactive segments, which it announced at the end of June.With wearable tech and apps, the company can expand the scope and playability of its toys and goods.In the company's Q2 2015, these two segments accounted for $1.2 billion, or about 10%, of revenues and $388 million in operating income.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Editor-in-chief and CEO Jim Silver of toy review site TTPM said he projects the Avengers line of connected toys <b>could</b> be a $ 500 million a year business , but <b>could</b> expand to a $ 1 billion annual business once the Star Wars and Frozen sets are out on the market .  (Uncertainty) </span>Disney stock is at new all-time highs around $117.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Year-to-date it is up <b>almost</b> 24 % and is trading at 22 times forward earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investors are following the recent blockbuster films of Frozen, Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers: Age of Ultron , and expect the December 2015 Star Wars 7 release will make 2015 a year to remember at the box office and in the stock portfolio.I think the stock has a lot of market momentum, but investors should also keep watch on the company's Media Networks segment, which covers cable networks and broadcasting business.A decrease in ESPN in the second quarter due to higher programming and production costs, as well as flat results from Disney Channels and ABC Family led this segment 2% down and basically flat for the two most recent quarters.This segment generates the largest amount of operating income, so it concerns me.Still, diluted EPS were up 14% for the quarter, adjusted EPS up 11%.That sets a good pace for the rest of the year.I would say Disney has a strong stock story and good near-term prospects.Source: Disney Opens New Avengers Playmation Interactive Set Demos Nationwide Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
