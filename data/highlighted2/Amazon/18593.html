class='textDiv'>Whats the Deal with Amazons New Dash Buttons OK so I was shown something new from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>today that Im not too sure about Im literally on the fence about it It combines convenience with the fast shipping of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Now these new things from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are new and by invitation only They are also just for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime members at this time So what do you think about these new things Oh they are called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Dash Buttons and here is what they do <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been working hard over the years to make it super easy to shop on their site and get you products you need when you need them They introduced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Pantry to help you get the necessities your house needs when you need them Over the past year they have been working hard to perfect their new technology called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Dash Now the original purpose was to allow you to scan a barcode and get it ordered on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>with ease I dont see they still offer the original Dash but they have now come out with Dash Buttons Dash Buttons are super simple buttons that are attached to a single product <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has introduced large brands at first So in essence you put a Dash button in your laundry room and when youre out of Tide you can just press the button and its ordered Easy as that This is all about convenience which we have all seen people will pay more for This is like a Staples easy button for buying stuff from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Click To Tweet As of right now there are products you can order with a Dash button The thing is you have to choose with product from a specific brand you want Lets say you like the pack of Cottonelle toilet paper If you set that product up for your Dash button then it will order the pack each time You cant get the pack unless you change it This process seems to be quite simple actually You have to download the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>app to your smartphone Then you can connect your Dash button to your Wifi This allows you to choose which product you want to connect to that specific Dash button When youre ready to reorder you just press the button once It then automatically orders the product for you and youre notified on your smartphone If you need to cancel the order due to a miss press you can easily do so on your phone When I first heard about it I worried about someone like me with a toddler What if someone just presses the hell out of the button Will I get packs of toilet paper sent to my house The answer it no <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>only ships out after the first button press You can press the button all you want but it wont ship again until after your first order is delivered This can still be dangerous if you dont put the buttons out of reach of those who dont control the finances At least the put in some functionality around the button press ordering system and that you can easily cancel any order Anyone who reads this blog knows Im a fan of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>I shop there regularly and Im an <span style='background-color:
