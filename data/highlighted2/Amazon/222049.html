The Sky The Limit For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Or Is It This Number Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has been on run since reporting earnings but external factors are likely to be more important This article will examine the recent movement of AMZN in light of its historical market valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN announced earnings on October nd beating on both the top and bottom lines and the stock has been on a tear ever since This leaves the stock with a trailing PS price to sales ratio of This article will examine the recent movement of AMZN in light of its historical market valuation and risk factors which I believe the market is not yet fully appreciating Ive already documented the historical correlation between AMZN stock and its price to sales ratio The following table updates those numbers on a historical current and forward basis all values except share prices in millions The extremes of this of chart are almost certainly not very relevant at this moment The forward outlook should contain a year discount in order to be considered valid though perhaps we can consider an upper limit for valuing AMZN via a price to sales methodology More obviously the market is clearly not valuing AMZN at times sales and it would likely take future developments to change that yet further news would make trailing numbers even less pertinent Therefore I think the hybrid number is the best indicator of current fair value but the chart as a whole is indicative how strongly current pricing and sentiment are currently skewed towards risk Some will say that all of these numbers are invalid because the share price of AMZN has already exceeded most of them Perhaps Ive already written about the possibility of the stock leaving the Price to Sales correlation behind and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has seen fourth quarter anticipation like this just two years ago right before my first article was written The stock had risen by a third on a similarly good earnings report which like this one featured a hint of AWS growth Then as now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>skewed more towards a forward PS valuation in conjunction with positive sentiment However in the fourth quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>announced record sales which barely missed Wall Streets lofty expectations the stock gave it all back and spent the rest of the year bouncing repeatedly off the bottom that my article predicted Its only relatively recently that AMZN has exceeded the ceiling that article also laid out which Id say is to be expected over the course of two years in a rising market with nearzero interest rates due to simple inflation As hinted above I think the main reason for Amazons stock movement is optimism over AWS which did report some good results The segment has grown from the of total revenue cited in my original article to about of the business now At that rate AWS could grow to match the retail side in about years That is of course unless Amazons retail business stagnates or backslides but that wouldnt exactly constitute bull thesis AWS does have some advantages though particularly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is a master marketer something I think many other cloud providers lack The company eats its own dog food as they say by making extensive internal use of AWS This adds scale allows for rationalization of costs and employment of flexible as well as sadly opaque accounting I think the first bullet point is a real competitive advantage over the short and medium terms An excellent example is Snowball the companys new data migration tool which makes it very easy to get vast amounts of data onto AWS As a programmer the issue I see here is lock in It may not be until many months and dollars later that companies come to think of the name as Animal Farm reference The second bullet point is another sort of marketing this time to investors Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has many other technology initiatives besides AWS though these have shown even less progress <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Pay has real potential given the synergies though a critical mind might ask how well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will manage against the likes of PayPal NASDAQ PYPL Apple NASDAQ AAPL and others when it apparently cant compete with Groupon NASDAQ GRPN Perhaps the new line of Fire devices will not need to be virtually given away for a dollar each like the old ones were My point with all of this is not that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>tech initiatives are doomed it is that they largely leverage or are meant to benefit its retail business and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still deserves to be viewed in that category Succeeding in retail at the expense of margins is one thing Succeeding in technology is NOT an area where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has shown real success so far As a result I think what remains most important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>investors is its prospects for profitability as a retailer The company has gotten a pass on the sales tax issue from a dysfunctional US Congress In fact I credit much of the stagnation and rebound to the fact that the MFA Marketplace Fairness Act wasnt officially dead until the turn of the year The specter of tax change still remains in the form of the RTPA Remote Transactions Parity Act which could affect many businesses but I wouldnt be at all surprised to see this bill suffer the same purgatorial fate as its predecessor at least until after the next major election year from now Its possible that the election results could pose an indirect threat as well if the trend towards Republican victories continues Two other dangerous tax issues could materialize sooner though In Europe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>seems all to likely to have to pay the piper on the issue of tax avoidance as the company has paid just over half a percent in taxes on its European turnover It would be difficult to overstate the importance of this matter as back taxes alone could run into the billions of euros and emerging markets are far from safe as well In the US I expect that Amazons practice of hiring more temporary workers than it does permanent ones will face increasing scrutiny With one year left the current administration has a clear populist proworker agenda and all bets with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>which is no stranger to unfair work place litigation may now be off The Huffington Post has a long but characteristically wellwritten and balanced writeup on the issue of dualclass workers Amazons efforts to build new portions of its workforce using contractors is already facing pressure as well and its far from clear whether or not the company is on the right side of the law in these matters Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>turned in a good report I think that some of the most important factors facing the company in the coming year are likely to be external and that the market is barely recognizing their magnitude so far Simple antitrust cases sluiced away a quarter Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM market cap last year Amazons issues are likely bigger and it is less equipped to deal with them With markets near alltime highs I think we may have just seen a top in AMZN and it would take another leg up above to get me to seriously consider the possibility that the stock has changed its trading dynamic for the long term Though hope springs eternal it doesnt always last and
