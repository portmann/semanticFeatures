( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been on run since reporting earnings , but external factors are likely to be <i>more</i> important . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This article will examine the recent movement of AMZN in light of its historical market valuation.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) announced earnings on October 22nd , beating on both the top and bottom lines , and the stock has been on a tear ever since . This leaves the stock with a trailing PS (price to sales) ratio of 2.9.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This article will examine the recent movement of AMZN in light of its historical market valuation and risk factors which I <b>believe</b> the market is not yet fully appreciating .  (Uncertainty) </span>I've already documented the historical correlation between AMZN stock and its price to sales ratio.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The following table updates those numbers on a historical , current and forward basis : all values except share prices in millions The extremes of this of chart are <b>almost</b> certainly not very relevant at this moment .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The forward outlook should contain a 1-year discount in order to be considered valid , though <b>perhaps</b> we can consider $ 640 an upper limit for valuing AMZN via a price to sales methodology .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> obviously , the market is clearly not valuing AMZN at 1.5 times sales , and it would likely take future developments to change that , yet further news would make trailing numbers even <i>less</i> pertinent .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , I think the hybrid number is the best indicator of current fair value , but the chart as a whole is indicative how strongly current pricing and sentiment are currently skewed towards <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Some will say that all of these numbers are invalid because the share price of AMZN has already exceeded most of them.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 've already written about the possibility of the stock leaving the Price to Sales correlation behind , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has seen fourth quarter <b>anticipation</b> like this just two years ago , right before my first article was written . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The stock had risen by a third on a similarly good earnings report, which like this one, featured a hint of AWS growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Then , as now , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> skewed <i>more</i> towards a forward PS valuation in conjunction with positive sentiment . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , in the fourth quarter , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> announced record sales which barely missed Wall Street 's lofty expectations ; the stock gave it all back and spent the rest of the year bouncing repeatedly off the $ 300 bottom that my article <b>predicted</b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It's only relatively recently that AMZN has exceeded the $500 ceiling that article also laid out, which I'd say is to be expected over the course of two years, in a rising market with near-zero interest rates, due to simple inflation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As hinted above , I think the main reason for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's stock movement is <b>optimism</b> over AWS , which did report some good results . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The segment has grown from the 4% of total revenue cited in my original article, to about 8% of the business now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At that rate , AWS <b>could</b> grow to match the retail side in about 40 years .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is , of course , unless <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail business stagnates or backslides , but that would n't exactly constitute bull thesis . AWS does have some advantages , though , particularly : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a master marketer , something I think many other cloud providers lack . The company "eats its own dog food", as they say, by making extensive internal use of AWS.This adds scale, allows for rationalization of costs, and employment of flexible (as well as sadly opaque) accounting.I think the first bullet point is a real competitive advantage over the short and medium terms.An excellent example is Snowball, the company's new data migration tool, which makes it very easy to get vast amounts of data onto AWS.As a programmer, the issue I see here is lock in.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>may</b> not be until many months and dollars later that companies come to think of the name as Animal Farm reference .  (Uncertainty) </span>The second bullet point is another sort of marketing, this time to investors.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Of course , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has many other technology initiatives besides AWS , though these have shown even <i>less</i> progress . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Pay has real potential , given the synergies , though a critical mind might ask how well <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will manage against the likes of PayPal ( NASDAQ : PYPL ) , Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , and others when it <b>apparently</b> ca n't compete with Groupon ( NASDAQ : GRPN ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> the new line of Fire devices will not need to be virtually given away for a dollar each , like the old ones were .  (Uncertainty) </span>My point with all of this is not that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> tech initiatives are doomed ; it is that they largely leverage , or are meant to benefit , its retail business , and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> still deserves to be viewed in that category . Succeeding in retail at the expense of margins is one thing.Succeeding in technology is NOT an area where <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has shown real success so far . As a result , I think what remains most important for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investors is its prospects for profitability as a retailer . The company has gotten a pass on the sales tax issue from a dysfunctional U.S. Congress.In fact, I credit much of the 2014 stagnation and 2015 rebound to the fact that the MFA (Marketplace Fairness Act) wasn't officially dead until the turn of the year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The specter of tax change still remains in the form of the RTPA ( Remote Transactions Parity Act ) , which <b>could</b> affect many businesses , but I would n't be at all <b>surprised</b> to see this bill suffer the same purgatorial fate as its predecessor , at least until after the next major election , 1 year from now .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's possible that the election results <b>could</b> pose an indirect threat , as well , if the trend towards Republican victories continues .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Two other dangerous tax issues <b>could</b> materialize <i>sooner</i> , though .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In Europe , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>seems</b> all to likely to have to pay the piper on the issue of tax avoidance , as the company has paid just over half a percent in taxes on its European turnover . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It would be difficult to overstate the importance of this matter as back taxes alone <b>could</b> run into the `` billions of euros '' and emerging markets are far from safe as well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In the U.S. , I expect that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's practice of hiring <i>more</i> temporary workers than it does permanent ones will face increasing scrutiny . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With one year left , the current administration has a clear , populist pro-worker agenda , and all bets with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , which is no stranger to unfair work place litigation , <b>may</b> now be off . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The Huffington Post has a long, but characteristically well-written and balanced write-up on the issue of dual-class workers.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's efforts to build new portions of its workforce using contractors is already facing pressure , as well , and it 's far from clear whether or not the company is on the right side of the law in these matters . Although <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> turned in a good report , I think that some of the most important factors facing the company in the coming year are likely to be external , and that the market is barely recognizing their magnitude , so far . Simple anti-trust cases sluiced away a quarter Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) market cap last year.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's issues are likely <i>bigger</i> and it is <i>less</i> equipped to deal with them . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With markets near all-time highs , I think we may have just seen a top in AMZN , and it would take another leg up , above $ 640 to get me to seriously consider the <b>possibility</b> that the stock has changed its trading dynamic for the long term .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Though <b>hope</b> springs eternal , it does n't always last , and winter is coming .
