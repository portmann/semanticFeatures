Everyday Ways To Save Money See Debt Run Posted by stefanie in Saving Money comments Stefanie is a staff writer here at See Debt Run and also writes on her own site The Broke and Beautiful Life Hello See Debt Run readers I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself by sharing some of my day to day strategies for saving money Some of these youve probably heard before others may be new some you may be doing already and others might not be for you If theres one thing Ive learned its that personal finance is truly personal Weve all got different ways of prioritizing and shaping our financial future My goal here will be to give you a variety of options and tools to consider so you can pick and choose which strategies work best for you And with that lets get started with my everyday ways to save money Stock Up on Socks and Underwear Spending time and money going to the Laundromat is something I like to avoid as much as possible To make my wardrobe stretch I rewear staples like jeans and jackets and stock up on the items I need to change every day like socks and underwear With a full drawer dedicated to these every day essentials I only have to do my laundry once a month Cut back on primping I work in the entertainment industry so I appreciate the importance of appearance but I am not willing to drop over every four to six weeks to get my hair trimmed and my roots done Simple techniques like waiting an additional few weeks between haircuts or painting your own nails can save you hundreds every year Learn Everything I know about saving and making money I learned at some point from somewhere Continuing to read and stay tuned in to the latest information is critical If you know the fair price of an item you wont allow yourself to be scammed If you understand how to use your credit card effectively you can wind up getting cash back rather than paying interest If you learn how to invest wisely you can grow your money rather than losing it to inflation No pets I can barely afford to pay my own rent buy my own food and purchase my own healthcare let alone provide all that for an animal I also never want to be faced with the decision of splurging to treat a pets unexpected medical condition or letting it die Netflix A D movie in New York City can cost The regular price is still somewhere around Ill trade three movie nights for a chance to go see a Broadway show instead In the meantime Im a Netflix junkie At a month with all the amazing new series and instant accessibility Im happy to stay in Use Your Freebies I always do my best to utilize freebies and items built into the price of a purchase For instance when I stay at a hotel Ill pack up the complimentary shampoos and conditioners each night so I get new ones when they clean the room in the morning Now I have a stockpile of practically new travel sized soaps for future camping trips and family visits No processed foods I dont care to spend my hard earned money on the longterm health consequences of a poor diet Run A membership to New York Sports Club costs month Id much rather enjoy a long run in the sun along the Hudson River than stare at a screen on the treadmill Plus its free and my running comes with me wherever I go Bike While I enjoy running for fitness Ive taken to biking for transportation In the past months Ive saved over by not having to buy a monthly metro card or drive a car Pick and choose More than anything I believe in moderation I dont want to deprive myself of the occasional Starbucks and dinners out just to save a couple of bucks here and there Maybe you dont want to deprive yourself of having a pet or going to the movies Like I said its personal The important thing is to recognize those indulgences for what they are and make sure they dont become regular occurrences that interfere with your ability to create a secure financial future Running and biking are great alternatives to the gym I also play team sports so between all there there is no needtime for the gym Yes I love when workouts dont feel like workouts With all that physical activity you definitely dont need a gym Hi Stefanie Congrats on your new gig Im with you on the netflix Now a days it seems movies are out on DVD so quickly so why pay so much money to go see them on the big screen Thanks so much Im psyched to be here Choosing netflix over the theatre also makes you less likely to splurge on marked up munchies Plus I can watch in my PJs at home Kurt Money Counselor November Excellent I particularly endorse no processed foods Diet is not the place to focus first when looking to cut expenses As you say youd pay in the long run both in terms of quality and quantity of life Diet is something that unfortunately gets overlooked too often when it comes to savings People will pay a fortune for the latest cleanse or workout craze rather than just regularly eating quality fruits and veggies Kendal HassleFreeSaver November Great list Im definitely on board with Netflix no processed foods and free outdoor exercise I would add using coupons for retail purchases grocery store purchases too but Im not a big coupon clipper I make this easy with a coupon app on my smartphone so I have them with me at all times Im so bad with coupons When I purchase something online Ill always check for promo codes but when I go to the store I can never seem to get it together What apps do you recommend Thanks for including a blurb about products with preservatives Its the first time Ive seen in mentioned as a savings topic All great advice DC Young Adult Money November I could never do the whole no pets tip but I definitely agree that not having pets will save you money They can be super expensive especially if they get sick or hurt I understand why people are willing to splurge on a pet Im just not one of those people Maybe someday Great post I want a cat SO BAD but I know its not good for my finances and Id be a bad pet parent So I will wait until Im debt free Jack Enwealthen November Good point about the pets Not just the costs of high quality food having to make that decision on K for cancer treatments or letting a member of the family go is terrible That said people with cats or dogs are happier on average that the petfree So if you compare the TCO of a pet vs years of antidepressants suddenly its not so cut and dried You make a good point Jack I think running is my personal antidepressant but that too carries its own set of expenses Budget and the Beach November I swear netflix is the best a lifesaver I stay home so much that I get so much entertainment from it Hulu as well Netflix and hulu are incredible I hear amazon is pretty good too Theyre launching some original series too like netflix Great tips Movie prices around here are which I think is ridiculous I havent been since much earlier this year but I always go when its half off Luckily our rent includes cable and we have a decent amount of movie channels I also love renting shows from the library Your freebies one reminds me of my grandma She gets comped rooms when she stays in AC and never fails to take a bunch of stuff home to give to everyone I was just talking with Michelle the other day about how I couldnt remember the last time I went to the theater to see a movie To me it just isnt worth the high cost We dont have Netflix but we do have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime which offers a very similar service My favorite item on your list is I always tell my kids this on the weekends when they are looking for something to do Go Out and Learn Something Feed Your Brain Great post Ive got to learn to run outside year round and save on my gym membership Its just so cold in the winter I layer up in the winter Tank top long sleeved shirt and two fleeces It feels nice to get some fresh air in those winter months too Im just now doing the whole no processed food thing Its working out for me so far I live in a house with other people so by buying raw foods I find that the people I live with are too lazy to cook so in the end I end up saving money Its amazing how much your perspective can make a difference I find raw foods to be the EASIEST If Im too lazy to cook them Ill just eat them raw salad fruits veggies So yummy So healthy I love the tip of using diet to mitigate long term health costs Its like our bodies are lifelong savings accountsyou get out of them what you invest over time Deacon Well Kept Wallet November Netflix is a huge savings over having cable I cant tell you how many TV shows we watched on Netflix from start to finish Great list Im somewhat obsessed with Orange is the New Black and House of Cards so psyched to see what else Netflix has in store for us Jennifer Budgeting in Baby November Not having a pet as a way to save is definitely a lesson I learned the hard way My parents have a dog and when I moved out on my own I was really lonely I got a dog and then I fell on hard times and wasnt sure how I was going to take care of him I had to find him a new home It made the adoption fee seem like a waste of money Unfortunately frequent laundry is unavoidable at our house Due to some medical conditions my husband refuses to reuse towels or wear the same jeans more than once So he runs through his stock pretty quickly Not much to be done about that I suppose I on the other hand work from home so my goingoutintotheworld wardrobe lasts MUCH longer I guess we even out We love Netflix though we have the option with DVDs And we just went to Hulu to cut our cable bill And at holidaysbirthdays we get GCs to movie theaters So we get by with a pretty lean entertainment budget at least Sounds like you have some well rounded entertainment I hear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is also getting in on the NetflixHulu subscription television biz Really great ideas There are so many things we can do to save money and once we start this its amazing to see how much we can actually save I agree with all of the above although I do have a pet cat but shes easy on the pocketbook One way I save money and we have talked about this before is that I am single and happily so Therefore I dont spend money out on dates or couple stuff When I talk to my friends who are on the dating scene I cant believe how much they spend on dinner movies drinks and little gifts for each other Its nice and all but whoa is it ever expensive You CAN live like a beauty queen for next to nothing I get my hair dyed and styled for FREE on a regular basis at LOreals product evaluation center heres how httpfrugalindacomwhatwouldyoudoforagoodiebag AND get my hair cut at Frederic Fekkai FOR FREE and there are other salons that do this too heres the skinny on being a hair model httpwwwwisebreadcomgetfreehighendhaircutsasahairmodel Of course this doesnt stop me from snagging all the freebies in my hotel room when on the rare occasion I find my self in one Laurie thefrugalfarmer November Great tips here Stefanie and lots of new idea too Love the idea about stocking up on socks and underwear well have to try that one Thats one of my favorites Laundry is time AND money so if I can cut back on it its a double win Great post I love your tip about the laundry One thing Ive done in the past to save on primping is get my hair cut at a beauty school The students need customers to learn on and they are supervised Its usually quite a bit cheaper than a regular salon I even had my hair done by beauty students on our wedding day and it saved us a lot of money way to take a stand stefanie i have been dying for a dog but i agree i need to save all that money instead its funny now that i am pregnant i have become mrs grinch not even because im trying to be a grinch but stuff like manis pedis haircuts clothing mean nothing to me anymore its kinda sad as i work for a conservative bank but i come in the office wearing sweats and sweaterswhen previously i used to wear business dresses i told my mom this on the phone and she pleaded with me to please go buy workappropriate attire sadly i am too lazy and dont really care to look great Stefanie The Broke and Beautiful Life November Simon Modest Money November Its always amazing the myriad ways we can pinch a penny till it bleeds in our daily life Am a huge fan of healthy eating and exercise and always finding cheaper alternatives to achieve those goals Learning to cook was one of the best things I have done of late eating home instead of restaurants have shaved a lot from my budget Terry EasyFinancialTips November These are great tips The one that resonates with me the most is about pets Dogs can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars and thats not including the costs of the food cages and other necessary materials Even fish are expensive a small tank can cost a hundred dollars or more without factoring in the costs of the individual fish their food materials for the tank and more Pets are not a onetime expense and that is important to remember Stefanie The Broke and Beautiful Life November Great point Terry They are not a one time expense even if they seem like an easy pet like the fish Notify me of followup comments by email The authors featured on this site are not financial experts but are instead normal folks just figuring out how to
