network administrator Three months after a federal appeals court upheld a decision that found Apple liable for conspiring with publisher to raise the price of ebooks the company is taking the fight to clear its name to the countrys highest legal authority the Supreme Court Apples move to ask the Supreme Court to review the case is just the latest chapter in seemingly neverending yearslong legal battle that started when the company first launched the iPad and its iBook store in According to a filing PDF Apple made with the Supreme Court on Wednesday the company asked for a day extension of time for filing formal submissions that would initiate the higher courts review process In the filing the company claims the previous judgements conflict with the Supreme Courts precedent regarding the liability of Apples conduct in the supposed pricefixing scheme This case concerns the imposition of per se antitrust liability on the basis of vertical conduct that was geared toward a new market entry and the disruption of a competitors monopoly the filing states This case also presents issues of surpassing importance to the United State economy Dynamic disruptive entry into new or stagnant marketsthe lifeblood of American economic growthoften requires the very type of vertical contracting and conduct that the company engaged in For those unfamiliar with the case heres a bit of background In the Dept of Justice sued Apple and many of the nations largest book publishing companies for allegedly conspiring to set high prices on the ebook market Part of Apples argument before the federal appeals court in December was that it was just trying to snap the stranglehold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had on the ebook market but that apparently didnt convince the court In a ruling by the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan PDF in June the judges sided with the lower courts decision to hold Apple to the November agreement with private plaintiffs and states that joined the Justice Departments lawsuit We conclude that the district court correctly decided that Apple orchestrated a conspiracy among the publishers to raise ebook prices wrote Second Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston The conspiracy unreasonably restrained trade in violation of the Sherman Act the federal antitrust law the judge wrote Prosecutors had argued that Apple and publishers had ganged up to fight Amazons aggressive discounts by agreeing to use an agency model of pricing wherein the publisher sets the price of books and the retailer gets a cut Under the agreement if another retailer was selling an ebook for a lower price the publisher would have to match that price in Apples store Emails from Apple executives including company cofounder Steve Jobs were used against the iPhone maker in court to demonstrate that the goal of agency pricing was to increase what people paid for ebooks Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream ebooks market at and wrote Jobs in one message to News Corp the parent company of HarperCollins The publishers had the leverage theyd need to fight <span

it was leading the publishers charge against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>But the Second Circuit majority said evidence showed Apple knew exactly what it was doing Apple understood that its proposed contracts were attractive to the publisher defendants only if they collectively shifted their relationships with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to an agency model which Apple knew would result in consumers facing higher ebook prices Judge Livingston wrote in a decision joined by Judge Raymond J Lohier Jr Following that decision Apple had the option to either pay a million fine or ask the Supreme Court to hear the case At the time of the June order Apple hinted that it might continue its battle While we want to put this behind us the case is about principles and values the company said in a statement We know we did nothing wrong back in and are assessing next steps On Wednesday the company made its decision clear noting in the filing
