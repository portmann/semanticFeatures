Nadella made the right decision in making the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Band available at other online and local retailers.However, the expanded distribution network will likely exacerbate the lingering shortage of supply of the Microsoft Band .On the other hand, the short supply also hints that Microsoft's smart fitness tracker is a commercial success.Launched last October 30, the Microsoft Band was an instant hit among fitness-minded individuals.However, the scarcity of this product has started since its launch date.Even Microsoft's own online store is often out of stock.WinBeta did say that the Band was available again at Microsoft's store yesterday.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , the delivery date for the Small and Medium size Band will be <b>May</b> 6 , and the Large size Band , April 1 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft also limits purchases to one Band per customer.The continuing shortage has allowed some people to resell their Microsoft Band units at a great markup over the $199 official price tag.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A check on eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) revealed that a Microsoft Band <b>could</b> be sold for over $ 400 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The same thing is happening at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . One <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> vendor is selling a Large Microsoft Band for $ 308.68 . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft 's failure to <b>anticipate</b> this overwhelming demand for the Band has allowed scalpers to flourish .  (Uncertainty) </span>There is an urgent need for Microsoft to increase production and accelerate delivery while the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch is still not shipping out.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The scarcity of the Band fitness tracker <b>could</b> inspire frustrated/impatient buyers to just order the $ 349 Apple Watch Sports .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Apple product will be available on April 24 so time is of the essence here.It's been over four months since the Microsoft Band was launched.Microsoft's future revenue stream in smartwatches is being derailed by a lingering shortage.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Band is <i>more</i> expensive than FitBit 's Charge HR but Tom 's Guide rates Microsoft 's product as the best fitness tracker smartwatch .  (Surprise) </span>Yes, sir, the experts see Microsoft's Band as a smartwatch in spite of its tiny 1.4 inch (320 x 106) display.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft can not compete with Apple in smartphones but the Band is a semi-smartwatch that is a <i>cheaper</i> alternative to the $ 349 Apple Watch Sports model .  (Surprise) </span>Unlike the Apple Watch, the Band is compatible with iPhones, Windows, and Android phones.The Band is a great example of Nadella's platform-agnostic strategy for Microsoft.The Band is already capable of running Windows Phone apps and is compatible with Cortana.This fitness tracker complements smartphones and it also integrates with the cloud-based Microsoft Health service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The data gathered by the Band 's sensors <b>could</b> be securely uploaded and shared to medical professionals via HealthVault .

(Uncertainty) </span>For this year, CCS Insight that 172 million wearables will get sold - with fitness trackers and smartwatches getting the lion share.CCS Insight also estimates there will be 27 million smartwatches that will be sold this year and 36 million fitness trackers.Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) was last year's leader in smartwatch/fitness tracker sales.Samsung sold 1.2 million units of its Gear line of products.The $119.99 Samsung Gear Fit looks similar to the Microsoft Band.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , the Gear Fit is only compatible with Android 4.3 or <i>higher</i> devices .  (Surprise) </span>The Samsung Gear Fit also suffers from poor user reviews .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft 's Band has received 4.5 star ratings from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shoppers in spite of it being sold <i>higher</i> than its official $ 199.99 price tag . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If Microsoft can kick up production , the Band <b>could</b> also deliver annual sales of 200k units or <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>FitBit sold 600k units of its smartband products last year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If we take into account that Microsoft has far <i>bigger</i> resources and distribution network than FitBit or Pebble , Microsoft <b>might</b> become the No. 3 player in wearables - behind Apple and Samsung .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft has a great thing going with the Band.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We can only hope that it <b>could</b> produce enough units to meet the strong demand .  (Uncertainty) </span>Otherwise, Microsoft will have to license the Band's technology to other companies.Making the Band available at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Target ( NYSE : TGT ) , and Best Buy ( NYSE : BBY ) is counterproductive if the product remains scarce .

(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>High retail price tags of Omega smartwatches <b>could</b> give Microsoft very healthy licensing fees .  (Uncertainty) </span>Swatch is the fifth biggest vendor of luxury goods on the planet.A collaboration between Microsoft and Swatch is highly desirable.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The affordable Swatch brand <b>could</b> also pave the way for $ 160 Windows 10 smartwatches for emerging markets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The elitist people who <b>could</b> afford a $ 17,000 smartwatch will likely prefer an Omega-branded Windows 10 smartwatch over an Apple one .
