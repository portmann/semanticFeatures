(Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Some <b>may</b> disagree with this treatment , but the thing to keep in mind is Wall Street will continue to think a certain way until it no <i>longer</i> wants to .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It is impossible to <b>predict</b> when that moment will arrive .  (Uncertainty) </span>I continue to view Apple buying back its shares as the most appropriate use of excess cash that is not needed for organic growth and M&A .As of June 27, 2015, Apple had $50 billion of share buyback authorization remaining out of a total of $140 billion of authorization.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Theoretically , Apple <b>could</b> repurchase 8 % of itself without any additional authorization from the board of directors .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, when looking at cash available for buyback, it becomes clear that Apple is not in a position to buy back that many shares at this time .Apple is only able to use U.S. cash on hand to repurchase shares and as of June 27, 2015, Apple had $22 billion of domestic cash ($181 billion is held offshore).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When forecasting earnings through the second half of CY2015 and taking into consideration debt issuance and U.S. free cash flow generation , Apple will have <b>approximately</b> $ 50 billion of domestic cash available by year-end .  (Uncertainty) </span>After adjusting for routine cash needs, including cash dividends, as well as the need for a cash buffer, Apple will likely be in a position to spend $20-$25 billion on buyback over the next six months (July to December 2015).Apple management can make a dollar worth of share buyback go much further when Apple's stock price is depressed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With shares down 15 % from all-time highs , Apple <b>could</b> theoretically buy back 15 % additional Apple shares with the same amount of cash resulting in a `` savings '' of close to $ 4 billion over the next six months .  (Uncertainty) </span>There are three likely strategies Apple can take in regards to its buyback: 1) Scheduled Share Repurchases.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple <b>could</b> follow a very strict schedule as to when excess cash is spent on buyback .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It would be equivalent to an investor buying an index fund the same day each month to gain market <b>exposure</b> , regardless of whether the market was up or down .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As each quarter comes and goes , Apple will spend the same amount on buyback , resulting in additional shares being bought if the share price decreases .  (Uncertainty) </span>There is evidence of Apple following this type of repurchase schedule with $5 billion spend on share buyback in 4Q13, 1Q14, 3Q14, and 1Q15.2) Opportunistic Share Repurchases.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Instead of simply following a schedule , Tim Cook and Luca Maestri <b>could</b> take stock valuation and timing into <i>greater</i> consideration , resulting in an ebb and flow to the pace of buyback .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Apple has shown the tendency of being opportunistic, such as in February 2014, when Tim Cook announced Apple had repurchased close $14 billion of shares over the span of two weeks (shares were trading around $70 at the time).Beginning in 3Q15, Apple initiated a new accelerated share repurchase arrangement (NYSE: ASR ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The mechanics of such a program <b>may</b> at first seem a bit opaque , but they are actually relatively straightforward .  (Uncertainty) </span>The investment bank(s) handling the ASR borrow AAPL shares in order to deliver a large number of shares to Apple up-front.The banks then proceed to buy back shares over the span of weeks and months to cover their borrow.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With AAPL shares having been weak since 3Q15 earnings , Apple will actually be able to take full advantage of its <i>lower</i> stock price by receiving cash back from the investment bank ( s ) in charge of the ASR .  (Surprise) </span>3) Hybrid Strategy.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Apple can combine the two strategies , and have both a scheduled buyback plan in place in addition to buying <i>more</i> shares during times of market weakness .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Judging from historical trends , Apple management is following this strategy , suggesting there <b>may</b> be increased motivation to increase the pace of buyback during times of market weakness .  (Uncertainty) </span>In reality, few companies take aggressive, bold moves with buyback programs during periods of market turmoil.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Instead , capital management strategies tend to become <i>more</i> conservative as companies prepare for adverse capital market conditions .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There had been a noticeable decline in the pace of Apple buyback recently , but it 's difficult to know if it was due to a rising stock price , depleted U.S. cash reserves , or a combination of the two factors .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Year-to-date , Apple spent $ 17 billion on buyback , 26 % <i>less</i> than the $ 23 billion spent during the same time period in 2014 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It will be important to see if this pace changes in the face of market <b>volatility</b> and <i>lower</i> share prices .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is no evidence to suggest that AAPL <b>volatility</b> will decline anytime soon .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The market will focus on slowing EPS growth in 2016 while in reality , there will be much <i>deeper</i> issues at play .  (Surprise) </span>Customer loyalty and Apple's eventual embrace of new product categories will likely continue to be ignored by Wall Street.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One of the primary ways for a $ 640 billion market cap company to grow in terms of valuation multiples is for current shareholders to become <i>more</i> comfortable owning a <i>greater</i> share of the company .  (Surprise) </span>As long as there are still basic misunderstandings about how Apple thinks about the future, valuation multiples will remain range bound, and management will rely on the share buyback program to take advantage of any perceived market dislocation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
