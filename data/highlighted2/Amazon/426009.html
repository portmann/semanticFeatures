( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha NFLX announced its new original series in India as part of its <i>broader</i> overseas expansion strategy .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given NFLX s track record with House of Cards and Narcos , Sacred Games <b>could</b> be a blockbuster hit .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) announced a new NFLX original series based on the critically-acclaimed Sacred Games novel in what I see to be a key step in expanding its international presence by scaling up its original content library to offset maturing domestic subs growth.Given a maturing OTT market in the US and a growing number of domestic competitors, international expansion will become increasingly important for NFLX to maintain its consolidated sub growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>India , along with Russia , <b>could</b> potentially become strategic markets for the company .  (Uncertainty) </span>With over a billion people, a demographic skewed toward the young end of the spectrum and a large English-speaking population, offering content to India's online population should not be a big challenge.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , India 's <i>less</i> developed broadband infrastructure , domestic competitors such as Eros ( NYSE : EROS ) and <i>lower</i> pricing <b>could</b> potentially be some challenges .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In NFLX 's Q1 results , it was evident that the accelerated competitive <b>risk</b> from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) have impacted the company 's growth outlook , and this makes international expansion increasingly important . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>While I am bullish on the overall macro trend that favors OTT providers and content producers, I am skeptical on whether NFLX remains the best stock to play this trend.That said, I remain bearish on the stock and recommend investors stick with the content providers, namely Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Lions Gate (NYSE: LGF ).(see - Netflix: 2016 Outlook - Slight Chance Of Shower ).Sacred Games is based on a story of India's economic renaissance that was mired in an intricate web of organized crime, corruption, politics and espionage.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given NFLX 's track record in both House of Cards and Narcos , it appears that Sacred Games <b>could</b> potentially be another block buster original content .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is particularly important given the growing popularity of online video in India, where online video traffic accounting for 46% of the total in 2014 vs. 38% in 2013.By 2019, internet video traffic is expected to reach 74% and the proliferation of wireless video streaming over LTE is certainly in favor of OTT companies such as NFLX that are looking to expand in the market.However, the local Indian competitors will not give up without a fight.I note that NFLX will not be the only OTT provider in the country and will compete against key competitor including Eros, which is widely considered to be NFLX of India, Reliance Communications and Singapore-based Hooq that have been operating in India for some time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In my view , NFLX <b>could</b> potentially face similar competitive dynamics as it would in the US and this <b>could</b> potentially be a negative headwind for the stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Finally , pricing pressure <b>could</b> materialize given the low cost alternatives in the country .  (Uncertainty) </span>For example, Hooq charges around INR 199 ($2.99/month) vs. NFLX's INR600-700/month .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In a country where most subscribers pay around INR 150-350 / month on streaming services , and many <i>more</i> getting pirated content , NFLX will certainly have to adjust its pricing significantly to gain <i>broader</i> penetration .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While this could sustain NFLX 's international subs growth in the near-term , international revenue <b>may</b> not live up to investor expectations due to the downward adjustment to pricing .
