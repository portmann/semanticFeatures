class='textDiv'>The Walt Disney Company A Great Company At A Fair Price The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha The drop is an awesome time to buy one of the best companies at a fair price The recent quarters results still exhibited strong growth even with cordcutting and negative currency impacts Hedge funds with good track records and fundamental approaches held DIS at last measure In a time when companies like Facebook NASDAQ FB Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN trade at multiples hundreds of times their stock prices am I really supposed to sour on The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS As of writing DIS was down after reporting disappointing earnings DIS earned a record billion in the third quarter compared to billion a year ago Moreover EPS increased on a diluted basis to from a year ago Over the last nine months revenue has increased and EPS has increased compared to the same nine month period last year What bad results The drop has created an opportunity to initiate a position in a great company at a fair value which Warren Buffett has told us is better to do than buying a fair company at a great price At last count hedge funds increased their investment in DIS from funds with billion in DIS shares to funds with billion in DIS stock The latest positions will be as of the end of June and be released in the comings weeks but I expect that hedge funds will have increased their positions in DIS with the momentum from Star Wars Avengers AntMan and DISs other movies and products Diamond Hill Capital held about million DIS shares as of its last filing I like Diamond Hills investment because it is a bottomup investor and really tries to identify value in its investments with deference to reliable earnings growth and dividends Adage Capital also held a little over million shares and that fund is managed by the former managers of Harvards endowment who outperformed the SP during their tenure there I take note of how these funds are investing because Insider Monkey points out that hedge funds long positions have shown a history of outperformance see the details here After this recent drop DIS now trades at x forward earnings which is inline with the greater market DIS however is growing faster than the overall economy with growth rates in revenue in the to range and growth rates in net income ranging from to in the last couple of years Similarly cash flow from operations has grown every year from at least when it was about billion to about billion today Whats not to like The company still has tremendous latent value in its stable of assets housed under Marvel Star Wars ESPN Frozen and its older brands as well The new Star Wars film is virtually guaranteed to generate billion in sales worldwide and kickoff renewed interest in the franchise leading to even more revenue from merchandising and other derivative products including shows amusement park rides and clothing ESPN is keeping cable alive and still dominates the sports broadcasting business It will make the transition to becoming more mobile and on demand as millennial customers want but it still generates the highest fees from cable subscribers so it is not paramount that DIS move ESPN completely to a standalone platform rightaway A gradual approach to making ESPN more standalone while still reaping the income from cable fees should be followed and I believe is being followed by DIS Lets not forget that DIS is being hurt by the strong dollar like the rest of US companies so its growth rates even in the face of a negative currency environment are outstanding Moreover DIS has a stock buyback plan in place that has already led it to purchase million shares of its stock for billion The company is authorized to repurchase an additional million shares and the company management has hinted that it will be opportunistic in its repurchases I suspect that DIS will be a heavy buyer of its stock after this recent drop going forward Thus investors maintaining or buying positions will be rewarded with greater ownership of the company all else equal and not even factoring in growth Leveraging Benjamin Grahams insights you should not let the market guide you but serve you This drop in DIS is the market serving us a great company at a fair price and I plan to initiate a position as I should have a
