(Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The stock sold off on unwarranted expectations that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> somehow disrupt the delivery sector so quickly . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite ongoing <b>worries</b> about a future entrant into the delivery sector , FedEx ( NYSE : FDX ) continues to produce solid results that are n't impacted by competitive threats .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The stock price though <b>suggests</b> a big impact is on the way from Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on updated FY16 guidance along with strong FQ3 numbers , FedEx bounced 5 % after hours to <b>nearly</b> $ 152 .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock though trades far below the highs of last year at $185 for a company that generated EPS growth of over 20%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>One has to <b>wonder</b> if FedEx is n't now a bargain .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>FedEx easily smashed Q4 estimates that were <b>somewhat</b> of a <b>surprise</b> considering a pattern of missing estimates lately .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The question though will persist on whether the company can match growth expectations for FY17 and beyond.Regardless of what the company says , the biggest lurking concern is <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>FedEx tried to brush off the online retailer 's purchase of 20 airplanes as <i>more</i> of a move to manage inventory levels between distribution hubs and facilities .  (Surprise) </span>But either way <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> shows an increasing interest of delivering packages directly to customers via drones or other methods . FedEx is correct in that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ca n't match the delivery facilities and route/stop density of the top delivery services of FedEx , UPS ( NYSE : UPS ) and the U.S. Postal Service . What the company misses is that history is littered with companies stuck with the costs of a vast network providing access to all while an upstart competitor is able to cherry pick the most profitable routes, customers and service options.For now, the statement by Chairman Fred Smith during the earnings call stands as the logical takeaway: The concerns about industry disruption continue to be fueled by fantastical, and let me emphasize I chose this word carefully, articles and reports which are devoid of in-depth knowledge of logistics systems and the markets which FedEx serves.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Due to the fact that <b>fears</b> of an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> disruption are misguided for now , FedEx offers an extreme value in comparison to the last five years . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Over the course of that extended period, the stock was worth snapping up when the forward PE ratio dipped to current levels.The prime reason that FedEx smashed FQ3 results were strong operating margins that surged from only 8.3% last year to 9.2% this year.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The <i>higher</i> margins follow a pattern of the last couple of years and <b>might</b> provide a hint as to why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to making moves toward delivering packages directly to customers . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>With a target of achieving operating margins in excess of 10%, investors will want to keep an eye on this number going forward.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Weaker</i> margins <b>could</b> provide the first indication of an impact from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Though at this point the company <b>suggests</b> it does n't have any customer including <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> that accounts for <i>more</i> than 3 % of business . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The key takeaway is that any <b>fears</b> over <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> disrupting the delivery business are fantastical at this point . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Buying any dips remains a smart move until a sign emerges that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is indeed disrupting the sector .
