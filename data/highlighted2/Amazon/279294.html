( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is still a buy at current prices . Profits will not matter for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> until revenue growth slows . Until then Investors should take advantage of the current momentum.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many <b>believe</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is vastly overpriced . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> certainly does not follow traditional valuation models and currently profit does not matter to the share price . The stock price reflects the expectation of future profits and continued growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Profits <b>could</b> indeed begin to increase and even out to a reasonable PE ratio over time , but that time is not now .  (Uncertainty) </span>Investors should take advantage of the current momentum and invest in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> until their growth slows . Many investors follow a strict rule of never picking a stock over a certain PE ratio.These investors have been missing out on massive profits from the increase in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> stock all year . For <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and many other stocks , profits do not matter . What matters is revenue growth.This growth is what has led to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current success . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's revenue has grown from $ 147M to projections of over $ 100B this year . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By no means do I <b>suggest</b> that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a buy and hold forever stock . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The price will have to come down to earth someday.However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has the current advantage of not needing profits . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's goal is to increase market share by crushing the competition and gaining customer loyalty . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Any profits that they do make are <b>hidden</b> by R&D costs to increase innovation .  (Uncertainty) </span>This strategy is what is fueling <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current share price .

(Amazon: Surprise) </span>Due to their size <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will have a lot of trouble continuing such impressive growth . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However I <b>believe</b> they can keep it up in 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Once this growth stops <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will need to work on profits and these profits will come with their commanding market share and R&D . Until that day <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and investors are happy with growth and hiding profits through R&D . It 's not too late to jump on the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> train . I'm not sure how long the run will last but the end is not here yet.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Investors should take advantage of the momentum and buy <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on the dips before Q1 while setting up stop losses to protect from a <b>possible</b> negative <b>surprise</b> .

Consensus estimates forecast that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's profits will approach $ 20 billion by 2019 . Most of this profit is expected from AWS.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>AWS accounted for <b>roughly</b> 7 % of total revenue but represented 52 % of operating income last quarter .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With AWS total sales increases of 78 % and 81 % year-over-year for the past two quarters , this <b>could</b> be a game changer for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>By 2020 AWS is expected to account for $38 billion in revenue with a 35% margin.Here is a chart comparing AWS to other cloud competitors: While AWS had a very profitable margin, this profit will go down in the short term.This is not a problem as the goal is market share, not profit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While AWS is the biggest cloud entity , it only has <b>roughly</b> 1 % market penetration .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> will continue to cut prices and plans on adding four new regions in 2016 compared to just one new region in the past two years . This rapid expansion will lower margins in the short term but pay off in the long run.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Conclusion : Even though margins are low in retail , with profits of <i>less</i> than one percent of revenue , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a lot of room for potential growth . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This combined with the massive growth in AWS , which does have nice margins , will lead to the continued success for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> in the future . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is focused on raising revenue and users , profits will come later . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The sales estimates for the year show that this strategy is working with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> capturing <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> market share .
