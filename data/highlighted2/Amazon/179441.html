( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's hardware strategy is <b>unclear</b> , as it does not really drive Prime adoption . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Pursuing high-end device and low-cost pricing <b>may</b> drive <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> device penetration . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) announced a new line-up of Fire tablets and Fire TV devices . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although the success rate for its tablets and TV has been much <i>better</i> than the phone , the key question that investors should ask is how the hardware will tie into the overall <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ecosystem . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So far , many investors that I spoke with appear to be <b>confused</b> at how hardware fits into Prime .  (Uncertainty) </span>While the idea of leveraging hardware to drive ecosystem penetration is well-understood by investors , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> failed to execute on this front , partially due to a combination of hardware quality and pricing . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> mimics the strategies used by Xiaomi or LeTV in producing top-end hardware priced at cost , while bundling it with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Prime , the company <b>may</b> have a chance at driving penetration . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Until then , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's hardware strategy remains murky . Nonetheless , I continue to view <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to be one of best ecommerce/ecosystem stories in North America . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Near-term growth is likely to be sustainable , but I caution that Alibaba 's ( NYSE : BABA ) eventual entry into the U.S. , either via acquisition of eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) and/or investments in BestBuy ( NYSE : BBY ) to roll out its O2O strategy , <b>could</b> be a long-term negative for the company .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has shifted its hardware strategy , but it continues to operate in the space . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although no phones will be released in this year , AMZN is smart in leaving this option open because mobile devices , mobile commerce and mobile transactions will be a <i>bigger</i> driver of the company 's future growth when we look at Alibaba 's growth profile in China .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some investors argue that comparing growth prospects of Alibaba and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is inaccurate due to <b>differing</b> geographies and business models , but I counter that Alibaba operates in the highest ecommerce penetrated country in the world with a leading market share , so Alibaba can be considered a bellwether for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was reported to have laid off Lab 126 that was responsible for the Fire Phone , its launch of the new TV and tablet <b>suggests</b> that the company remains interested in developing and selling hardware . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The tablet's key selling point being low-cost, Prime content and kids, while the TV is marketed as a cost-effect alternative to Apple TV (NASDAQ: AAPL ).The devices do have notable features given the voice control and content integration, but it is questionable how many tablets can be sold for $50 being the starting price for the tablet.While price is attractive, it is far from being the high-end tablet from Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) or Apple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the TV side , it is <b>perhaps</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's bestselling hardware product , but competition from Aaple and Google will present a challenging backdrop . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One strategy <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> consider is mimicking Xiaomi and LeTV that sell top-end TV and mobile devices that are priced at cost . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Essentially, these companies are selling hardware to drive their brand name and ecosystem/services.How successful will <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> be ? <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Judging by Xiaomi 's projected 100m handset shipment for this year selling high-end smartphones that are priced at $ 350/unit , I would argue that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> see some success . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The downside will be ongoing losses attributed to the hardware strategy due to an increase in R&D and marketing costs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , looking in the long term , it <b>may</b> just be the route <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> should take in order to justify its hardware strategy .
