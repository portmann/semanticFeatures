Prime adoption Pursuing highend device and lowcost pricing may drive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>device penetration <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN announced a new lineup of Fire tablets and Fire TV devices Although the success rate for its tablets and TV has been much better than the phone the key question that investors should ask is how the hardware will tie into the overall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>ecosystem So far many investors that I spoke with appear to be confused at how hardware fits into Prime While the idea of leveraging hardware to drive ecosystem penetration is wellunderstood by investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>failed to execute on this front partially due to a combination of hardware quality and pricing If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>mimics the strategies used by Xiaomi or LeTV in producing topend hardware priced at cost while bundling it with Amazons Prime the company may have a chance at driving penetration Until then Amazons hardware strategy remains murky Nonetheless I continue to view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to be one of best ecommerceecosystem stories in North America Nearterm growth is likely to be sustainable but I caution that Alibabas NYSE BABA eventual entry into the US either via acquisition of eBay NASDAQ EBAY andor investments in BestBuy NYSE BBY to roll out its OO strategy could be a longterm negative for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has shifted its hardware strategy but it continues to operate in the space Although no phones will be released in this year AMZN is smart in leaving this option open because mobile devices mobile commerce and mobile transactions will be a bigger driver of the companys future growth when we look at Alibabas growth profile in China Some investors argue that comparing growth prospects of Alibaba and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is inaccurate due to differing geographies and business models but I counter that Alibaba operates in the highest ecommerce penetrated country in the world with a leading market share so Alibaba can be considered a bellwether for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was reported to have laid off Lab that was responsible for the Fire Phone its launch of the new TV and tablet suggests that the company remains interested in developing and selling hardware The tablets key selling point being lowcost Prime content and kids while the TV is marketed as a costeffect alternative to Apple TV NASDAQ AAPL The devices do have notable features given the voice control and content integration but it is questionable how many tablets can be sold for being the starting price for the tablet While price is attractive it is far from being the highend tablet from Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Samsung OTCSSNLF or Apple On the TV side it is perhaps Amazons bestselling hardware product but competition from Aaple and Google will present a challenging backdrop One strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could consider is mimicking Xiaomi and LeTV that sell topend TV and mobile devices that are priced at cost Essentially these companies are selling hardware to drive their brand name and ecosystemservices How successful will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>be Judging by Xiaomis projected m handset shipment for this year selling highend smartphones that are priced at unit I would argue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>could see some success The downside will be ongoing losses attributed to the hardware strategy due to an increase in RD and marketing costs However looking in the long term it may just be the route <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>should take in order to justify its hardware strategy Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
