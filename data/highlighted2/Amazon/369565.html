an underachiever for the best discounts Mighty Bargain Hunter sign up and confirm your email address In other words To get this you have to do that This is one time when a Dminus actually beats out anAplus Underachievement is frowned upon in most contexts Consider these things said by No One Ever You really need to bring those grades down son Next season I want that batting average down in the lows Now if tomorrow youre not in after and out before Im not going to be pleased But not so with discounts and rewards To get the best discounts its best to do the Barest Minimum Action BMA to satisfy the conditions ofthe deal Consider these applications of the BMA Now it goes without saying that you actuallywant whats being offered If you dont want it its no deal at all Discount Save with a purchase of or more The discount is whether you buy worth of merchandise or If you buy worth of merchandise the effective discount is If you buy worth of merchandise exactly the effective discount is Much much better BMA Aim for exactly the minimum purchase You can do it Discount Save on a tube of toothpaste any size Hmmm the regularsized tube is but those trial sizes are cents each That makes the coupon a discount I like that Its as if Im stealing it but Im not BMA Aim to get the smallest size if given a choice of sizes Its usually the best deal with a fixed coupon because the smallest size usually costs the least Reward Visit Swappable and purchase any card Get Points This was an actual MyPoints offer this weekend that I took advantage of Most of the time Im just looking at the BonusMails for the ones that offer the easy points apiece Swappablecom is a website that allows you to send gift cards that can be traded out by the recipient if theyd like one for another store Since it was within the rules that I could send a gift card to myselfI got a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gift card I could have gotten a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>gift card but Id still have gotten the same points which works out to a little over I knew thatwed be buying from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>within the next few days and Id be hardpressed to find a discounted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>card for anywhere close to offBMA Aim to buy something at a discount thats rarely discounted or only discounted a small amount Reward Earn for each of the first five daily searches Earn for every two searches afterwards up to per day Earn a bonus of for each week you search four or more days Ive had an InboxDollars account for some time and I admit that it doesnt get as much attention from me as some other similar sites do because Im not getting regular email from them I only get email from them when my account has gone inactive When I looked around the site I found that the paid search component has the rules above I could earn up to per week on searches times plus but that would require searches a day for each day or at least searches Thats less than a penny a search But if I search once on each of four days I get times plus or cents a search BMA Aim for maximum reward per action more than maximum reward Usually theres diminishing value for doing more I just did that Swappable deal For Yesterday I snagged the get MyPoints for buying specifically an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>GC and today I see we have a day sale offer for a total of MyPoints if you purchase any GC pts and if its or more another pts That looks like another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>GC to go towards diapers if you ask me I saw that deal Was wondering if I was eligible for the bonus or not because I had already bought a gift card from Swappable and gotten the points I cant recall if you still have time but there wasnt any fine print saying it had to be a first purchase on any of them So far all three transactions are pending for me so well see Like you I rarely remember to bother with Inbox Dollars And at this point I really only do MyPoints for the emails too But you have a good point about the Swappable deal I
