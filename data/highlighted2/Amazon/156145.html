(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The two largest components of the old Bell System today (Verizon Communications (VZ UZ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ), have a combined market cap of $376B, making the entity the 4th most valuable company in America after tech titans Apple $760B, Google $461B, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) $379B.So what has changed?97% of Americans still have access to a fixed line telephone in 2015 (a slight decline), but fully 99.5% have access to a mobile phone and 64% are 'smart phone' owners (1 April 2015 Pew Research Centre Report).Investors in the market leading telecom carrier and wireless operators including AT&T and Verizon enjoy high share prices, solid earnings, and generous distribution of free cash flow in the form of large quarterly dividends.So 30 years after the break up � break out the band and blue skies forever?- No.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I am going to take the unpopular position that the good times are over , the sector peaked in 1999 and it is going to get <i>worse</i> from here .  (Surprise) </span>Everything changed, but the changes are poorly understood and difficult to recognize at distance.Incumbent telecom carriers and wireless operators should consider a future of increasingly unattractive fundamentals, declining profitability, and shrinking market capitalisation.Indeed, very much like the traditional television broadcasting and cable companies or traditional publishing and print media companies, the traditional telecom carriers and wireless mobile operators have already entered a period of long-term structural decline.Voice plans and data plans share the same future as bundled cable packages and the daily rag.Why?Because technology is irreversibly changing consumer preferences, buying habits, behaviours and choice.Innovators will not only benefit from the new economy in telecommunications, but will also likely determine the way that consumers communicate, what devices they use to communicate, who and how they will pay, for both the hardware and connectivity.This future will be divined at the expense of the old economy incumbents.A telephone carrier and wireless operator (heretofore a 'telco'), is neither the creator of the new technologies nor the architect of the new business paradigm.The telco is removed from 'value-added' segments of the business.The telco is not the designer of new high margin hardware.The telco is neither the developer of content, nor the archivist of complex client data files.The telco is instead conjoined to the unwieldy and unprofitable, Mcap-intensive, infrastructure assets and their associated upkeep.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The telco is like the great railroad operator before everyone figured out , that there was a <i>better</i> way to fly .  (Surprise) </span>His expansive networks, like the silver rails that connected San Francisco to New York City, is a giant hungry mule that he must constantly feed.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It moves somebody else 's goods from point A to point B for a fee , until that somebody finds something <i>faster</i> , <i>cheaper</i> , and <i>cleaner</i> than an ass , to cart the load .  (Surprise) </span>Whatever does he mean by this cantankerous characterization?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A telco drives revenues from unambiguous businesses , which are <b>sometimes</b> cryptically titled units such as enterprise , federal , consumer , wholesale , small business , etc. .  (Uncertainty) </span>But they are really just four tariff charging segments and I see it like this: Wireless profitability is imperiled by price wars (above) as well as the simple fact that � the consumer no longer needs to pay money, to a wireless operator, to make a wireless call.Voice over IP (OTCPK: VOIP ) technology built into iOS, Android, Windows, and Blackberry smart phone aps, by players like Apple Facetime, Viber Media (private Las Vegas Nevada, US-based, Byelorussian outsourced, Israeli's), and others, is available for free in 40 languages with global reach.The field will grow.Long distance profitability is threatened by Voice over IP technologies allowing for free long distance communications with or without video.Mainstream acceptance was pioneered by Skype (acquired by Microsoft).In addition to Google Hangout and many others, free long distance is available on virtually any operating system Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Nokia X, Fire OS, Xbox One, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Portable.Skype is already approaching 50% of US long distance call volumes and this is just the beginning.Some say that entrants like Microsoft are just waiting until they have reached critical mass before figuring out how to monetize their Skype base by charging for long distance calls.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> they are , but that is not going to help the telecom carriers - is it ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Data packet transmission revenues are being shorn by social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger who offer free messaging on far <i>better</i> platforms .  (Surprise) </span>And broadband revenues did not get a boost on 26 February 2015 when the FCC voted to retain net neutrality rules.So where is the good news?One such mule � Sprint.Sprint (S US) America's third-largest wireless network has dropped -64.65%.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Without the backing of Japan 's Softbank ( 2284 JP ) , the shares <b>might</b> be trading <i>lower</i> What do you do when you have nothing left to sell on other than price ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Sprint (S US) the third-largest wireless network operator in America with 57.1MM subscribers, announced at year-end 2014 that it would embark on an ill-advised price war.The telco offered half-price wireless service to customers who switched to its service from Verizon and AT&T.The move to gain subscribers burned cash and Deutsche Telecom's T-Mobile USA, joined the fray.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sprint 's $ 9B in cash on 1 Jan 2015 <b>might</b> be halved as early as mid-2016 , just in time for the US government 's 2016 auction of wireless spectrum .  (Uncertainty) </span>Wireless carriers burn huge capex on airwaves to meet unending subscriber demands for ever increasing data transmissions.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sprint is <b>anticipated</b> to need + / - $ 10B to participate in the 2016 auction .  (Uncertainty) </span>In addition to broadcast/cable television, I have also been 'unplugged' without a home telephone since 2008.I do not use my i-Phone to SMS, make or receive calls.The only reason that I bought a SIM card for my mobile in the past many years is because (very specifically here in Singapore) a unique mobile phone number is mandated by the Ministry of Manpower to receive an employment card.And because unique mobile phone number is also by DBS Bank Singapore to open an account.So Elizaveta bought an M1 pay-as-you-go SIM for $10 SGD, my number is +65 6643 5362 and I have not made a call or sent an SMS since.Why would I?I can open accounts and forms.It can receive incoming SMS for free.Another � Old fixed line telephone is expensive.Have you ever watched the telephone poles blur by from the seat of a train?The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), allocates $4 B per annum to make sure that every American, no matter how remote, access to telephone service, which are subsidised at up to $3,000 per line.According to a study by the Alliance for Generational Equity, 99.9% of U.S. households have access to mobile voice service which is non-subsidized.The study takes the position that fixed line service is no longer a necessary component of America's telecommunications infrastructure, considering VoIP and mobile alternatives.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Ultimately , AGE concludes that `` economic welfare would increase if the entire $ 9 billion per year FCC program were eliminated . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` One of the primary benefits of using an IP PBX is that it lacks the cumbersome and expensive physical hardware that has <b>apparently</b> resulted in billions of dollars of waste at the federal level .

(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Simply because the number of market participants has no negative impact the success or failure of the investment.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Conversely the <i>more</i> stakeholders , the <i>higher</i> the volumes , the <i>larger</i> the market capitalisation and associated ASO 's , the <i>lower</i> the friction costs and <i>more</i> efficient the investment .  (Surprise) </span>The issue that impacts profit and loss is being on the right side of the trade, and that starts with the macro.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The avoidance of large caps is the same as saying that it is not <b>possible</b> to drive powerful returns from sovereign credit , global Fx , or base commodities , because these large markets are so well covered .  (Uncertainty) </span>But as always the only practical consideration is being right or wrong.A manager does not have to invent a new undiscovered theory that no one else has ever thought about to profit.No, he simply has to be correct in his analysis and the same holds true for stock selection.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But that being said , I <b>suggest</b> that in this particular name and in spite of the broad coverage universe , we are going consider the investment case in a third light .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whereas the ` street ' is principally looking at Verizon two ways , we are going to understand this short <b>somewhat</b> differently .

(Surprise) </span>And voila, the company reported a net loss of 138,000 wireless phone subscribers in the last quarter 21 April 2015.These are customers who switched to either T-Mobile or Sprint in the price war.When you are a commodity product, a mule in this case, you have to compete on price.The US wireless market is positively saturated as we have already discussed.How to drive subscriber growth?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>></i> 60 % of Verizon 's growth in 2014 came from tablets , but iPad sales are slowing to a crawl .

(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Disclaimer : telecom carriers and wireless operators should expect a <i>longer</i> shelf life and <i>more</i> durable profitability in the R.O.W. .  (Surprise) </span>The current assignment is US centric and like CBS Inc. in the television broadcasting and cable space, Verizon is a US player with no meaningful global foot print.New technologies and changing consumer preferences in America should directly impact firm profitability.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Can it get any <i>worse</i> ?  (Surprise) </span>Hell yes it can.What about Project Fi?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Project Fi , from Google the Friendly Giant is may soon shatter any remaining <b>hopes</b> for Verizon and the tech retardant entrenched players .

(Uncertainty) </span>This represents to me an historical acquiescence similar to the music industry caving in to Apple for $1.00 a tune, just to get on iTunes and find a marketplace, any market place for their music.I do not see this as a blockbuster for Google, no, rather as an omen of death for the carriers.Why?Because the network switches will be seamless meaning the customer will not know whether he is using Sprint's or T-Mobile's spectrum.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It will move back and for the <b>depending</b> on signal strength .  (Uncertainty) </span>What that means is a validation of what I have written here, that Google has proven that the carriers are dumb pipes.Google will now deliver your content on somebody else's fixed investment, and bypass the telco's front office.You don't even need to deal with them anymore.They are telling the investment community that these are commodity priced mules who haul other people's content across and unprofitable and expensive to maintain, telecommunications infrastructure.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The future of telcos All these guys <b>could</b> go the way of Windstream ( WIN US ) , a credible peer comp as recently as 2014 , market capitalization $ 527MM I would like to devote a future report to the subject of cellular radiation and brain damage .

(Uncertainty) </span>This is because innovation giants have permanently changed the way we communicate.Similar to what has been detailed with streaming media and internet TV, new technologies give the consumer new 'choices;' which have evolved our behaviours, buying habits and preferences away from the old economy operators.Long-term industry profitability has been marginalized by commodity pricing, which has ushered in a new era of value destructive, cash burning, price wars.Google's Project Fi is just the latest illustration of the 'dumb pipe' conundrum facing the telcos.As long as the telecom carriers and mobile operators fail to innovate, they will be the faceless maintenance workers tasked with oiling, cleaning and upgrading the profitless network (Cloud hosting analogy).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Do n't let the P/E and the dividend <b>scare</b> you .
