class='textDiv'>The Tribble With Telcos Short Verizon Verizon Communications NYSEVZ Seeking Alpha Verizon Communications will be examined in detail here In the US Justice Department broke up Ma Bell the fixed line telephone monopoly that dominated consumer telecommunications in America and Canada since being founded by Alexander Graham Bell in of Americans already had access to a fixed line telephone in the s and the Bell Systems domination of virtually all facets of the industry stifled competition Citing antifree market and anticonsumer business dealings the DOJ first brought suit in The Bell Systems ultimate demise was determined to be in the interests of the public good But like most people at the time I remember initially being unhappy about the break up because service went down and prices went up American Telephone and Telegraph was divided up into seven regional telecom operators Baby Bells Bell Labs Western Electric and ATT long distance With B in assets at the time of the break up Bell was the th largest company in America after Exxon NYSE XOM General Motors NYSE GM and Mobile In some ways the world has changed less since that day than one might anticipate The two largest components of the old Bell System today Verizon Communications VZ UZ and ATT NYSE T have a combined market cap of B making the entity the th most valuable company in America after tech titans Apple B Google B and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT B So what has changed of Americans still have access to a fixed line telephone in a slight decline but fully have access to a mobile phone and are smart phone owners April Pew Research Centre Report Investors in the market leading telecom carrier and wireless operators including ATT and Verizon enjoy high share prices solid earnings and generous distribution of free cash flow in the form of large quarterly dividends So years after the break up break out the band and blue skies forever No I am going to take the unpopular position that the good times are over the sector peaked in and it is going to get worse from here Everything changed but the changes are poorly understood and difficult to recognize at distance Incumbent telecom carriers and wireless operators should consider a future of increasingly unattractive fundamentals declining profitability and shrinking market capitalisation Indeed very much like the traditional television broadcasting and cable companies or traditional publishing and print media companies the traditional telecom carriers and wireless mobile operators have already entered a period of longterm structural decline Voice plans and data plans share the same future as bundled cable packages and the daily rag Why Because technology is irreversibly changing consumer preferences buying habits behaviours and choice Innovators will not only benefit from the new economy in telecommunications but will also likely determine the way that consumers communicate what devices they use to communicate who and how they will pay for both the hardware and connectivity This future will be divined at the expense of the old economy incumbents A telephone carrier and wireless operator heretofore a telco is neither the creator of the new technologies nor the architect of the new business paradigm The telco is removed from valueadded segments of the business The telco is not the designer of new high margin hardware The telco is neither the developer of content nor the archivist of complex client data files The telco is instead conjoined to the unwieldy and unprofitable Mcapintensive infrastructure assets and their associated upkeep The telco is like the great railroad operator before everyone figured out that there was a better way to fly His expansive networks like the silver rails that connected San Francisco to New York City is a giant hungry mule that he must constantly feed It moves somebody elses goods from point A to point B for a fee until that somebody finds something faster cheaper and cleaner than an ass to cart the load Whatever does he mean by this cantankerous characterization A telco drives revenues from unambiguous businesses which are sometimes cryptically titled units such as enterprise federal consumer wholesale small business etc But they are really just four tariff charging segments and I see it like this Wireless profitability is imperiled by price wars above as well as the simple fact that the consumer no longer needs to pay money to a wireless operator to make a wireless call Voice over IP OTCPK VOIP technology built into iOS Android Windows and Blackberry smart phone aps by players like Apple Facetime Viber Media private Las Vegas Nevada USbased Byelorussian outsourced Israelis and others is available for free in languages with global reach The field will grow Long distance profitability is threatened by Voice over IP technologies allowing for free long distance communications with or without video Mainstream acceptance was pioneered by Skype acquired by Microsoft In addition to Google Hangout and many others free long distance is available on virtually any operating system Windows Mac Linux Android iOS Windows Phone BlackBerry Nokia X Fire OS Xbox One PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Portable Skype is already approaching of US long distance call volumes and this is just the beginning Some say that entrants like Microsoft are just waiting until they have reached critical mass before figuring out how to monetize their Skype base by charging for long distance calls Maybe they are but that is not going to help the telecom carriers is it Data packet transmission revenues are being shorn by social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger who offer free messaging on far better platforms And broadband revenues did not get a boost on February when the FCC voted to retain net neutrality rules So where is the good news One such mule Sprint Sprint S US Americas thirdlargest wireless network has dropped Without the backing of Japans Softbank JP the shares might be trading lower What do you do when you have nothing left to sell on other than price Sprint S US the thirdlargest wireless network operator in America with MM subscribers announced at yearend that it would embark on an illadvised price war The telco offered halfprice wireless service to customers who switched to its service from Verizon and ATT The move to gain subscribers burned cash and Deutsche Telecoms TMobile USA joined the fray Sprints B in cash on Jan might be halved as early as mid just in time for the US governments auction of wireless spectrum Wireless carriers burn huge capex on airwaves to meet unending subscriber demands for ever increasing data transmissions Sprint is anticipated to need B to participate in the auction In addition to broadcastcable television I have also been unplugged without a home telephone since I do not use my iPhone to SMS make or receive calls The only reason that I bought a SIM card for my mobile in the past many years is because very specifically here in Singapore a unique mobile phone number is mandated by the Ministry of Manpower to receive an employment card And because unique mobile phone number is also by DBS Bank Singapore to open an account So Elizaveta bought an M payasyougo SIM for SGD my number is and I have not made a call or sent an SMS since Why would I I can open accounts and forms It can receive incoming SMS for free Another Old fixed line telephone is expensive Have you ever watched the telephone poles blur by from the seat of a train The US Federal Communications Commission FCC allocates B per annum to make sure that every American no matter how remote access to telephone service which are subsidised at up to per line According to a study by the Alliance for Generational Equity of US households have access to mobile voice service which is nonsubsidized The study takes the position that fixed line service is no longer a necessary component of Americas telecommunications infrastructure considering VoIP and mobile alternatives Ultimately AGE concludes that economic welfare would increase if the entire billion per year FCC program were eliminated One of the primary benefits of using an IP PBX is that it lacks the cumbersome and expensive physical hardware that has apparently resulted in billions of dollars of waste at the federal level Verizon is a nearly B large cap Dow component that is widely held widely followed and receives considerable research coverage from the investment community Some might question how a single manager can profit from taking a position in a name This when teams of analysts with industry sectorspecific expertise have spent years tracking streams of cash flows and developing modeling tools to perhaps more accurately predict future earnings Simply because the number of market participants has no negative impact the success or failure of the investment Conversely the more stakeholders the higher the volumes the larger the market capitalisation and associated ASOs the lower the friction costs and more efficient the investment The issue that impacts profit and loss is being on the right side of the trade and that starts with the macro The avoidance of large caps is the same as saying that it is not possible to drive powerful returns from sovereign credit global Fx or base commodities because these large markets are so well covered But as always the only practical consideration is being right or wrong A manager does not have to invent a new undiscovered theory that no one else has ever thought about to profit No he simply has to be correct in his analysis and the same holds true for stock selection But that being said I suggest that in this particular name and in spite of the broad coverage universe we are going consider the investment case in a third light Whereas the street is principally looking at Verizon two ways we are going to understand this short somewhat differently Low beta implying lower systematic risk The market is broadly constructive on Verizon Institutions yield buyers and value buyers on an earnings basis x E PE all love it Grossly overvalued on an asset basis the PriceBook is no defensible at x Dangerously overleveraged the books are laden with massive borrowings and total debt to common equity stands at VZ has a combined shortterm and longterm debt of billion Trades as corporate bond with no maturity date Near B Mcap Verizon is trading in the middle of a three year trading range within of the high They are both right but that is not what we are focused on in our investment case Verizon like all the telcos in this unattractive mcap heavy space has had to assume huge debts to build maintain and improve infrastructure Dangerously thin line able to service B debt on B revenues Razors edge able to finance dividend with pay out on B in net income with B paid out It looks like management is bleeding the victim like a vampire keeping it on the edge of eternal sleep Or perhaps more like Abramovich ran Sibneft OTC SIBN in the finals days because he know that he would be taken out by Gazpromneft This is a no growth no future strategy cash cow management of I suggest an imperiled core business model And the payout looks somewhat like desperation If you have not growth strategy why not pay down some of the monster debt The shares have plateaued in a trading range based on yield for three years so that makes since You are buying a corporate bond with an equity teaser But what will happen when rates go up as has oft been debated here with the same ultimate conclusion Or just as likely what happens on a revenue miss Cant borrow any more money with the US government auction of wireless spectrum right And voila the company reported a net loss of wireless phone subscribers in the last quarter April These are customers who switched to either TMobile or Sprint in the price war When you are a commodity product a mule in this case you have to compete on price The US wireless market is positively saturated as we have already discussed How to drive subscriber growth of Verizons growth in came from tablets but iPad sales are slowing to a crawl What next And that was luck Verizons future fleeting growth blips are at the fate of a technology company who invests a new product that might require the services of a mule Sprint and TMobile believe that value destructive cash burning price war like the one that crippled the US airlines for much of the last years is the answer On one hand firms may desperately try to take from each others table by slashing price plans On the other hand that are being forced to cut roaming long distance as the consumer is quickly moving to WiFi What else can Verizon do to raise sales As detailed theirs is a pretty simple business and the answer is not much What might Verizon do to get those customers back and try to shield top line in order to protect the dividend because when the dividend is cut institutions and retail investors alike will move to the exits Disclaimer telecom carriers and wireless operators should expect a longer shelf life and more durable profitability in the ROW The current assignment is US centric and like CBS Inc in the television broadcasting and cable space Verizon is a US player with no meaningful global foot print New technologies and changing consumer preferences in America should directly impact firm profitability Can it get any worse Hell yes it can What about Project Fi Project Fi from Google the Friendly Giant is may soon shatter any remaining hopes for Verizon and the tech retardant entrenched players Project Fi is a mobile phone service that promises unlimited domestic talk and text unlimited international messaging tethering and Gonly international service in over countries for a month TMobile and Sprint combine to provide coverage area and are almost giving away the roaming agreements to Google as price takers not price setters This represents to me an historical acquiescence similar to the music industry caving in to Apple for a tune just to get on iTunes and find a marketplace any market place for their music I do not see this as a blockbuster for Google no rather as an omen of death for the carriers Why Because the network switches will be seamless meaning the customer will not know whether he is using Sprints or TMobiles spectrum It will move back and for the depending on signal strength What that means is a validation of what I have written here that Google has proven that the carriers are dumb pipes Google will now deliver your content on somebody elses fixed investment and bypass the telcos front office You dont even need to deal with them anymore They are telling the investment community that these are commodity priced mules who haul other peoples content across and unprofitable and expensive to maintain telecommunications infrastructure The future of telcos All these guys could go the way of Windstream WIN US a credible peer comp as recently as market capitalization MM I would like to devote a future report to the subject of cellular radiation and brain damage There is not further time today but this remains a longterm risk multiple entrants in the telecom food chain The future for telecom carriers wireless operators and data mules is one that might be characterized by deteriorating core business fundamentals shrinking earnings and falling share prices This is because innovation giants have permanently changed the way we communicate Similar to what has been detailed with streaming media and internet TV new technologies give the consumer new choices which have evolved our behaviours buying habits and preferences away from the old economy operators Longterm industry profitability has been marginalized by commodity pricing which has ushered in a new era of value destructive cash burning price wars Googles Project Fi is just the latest illustration of the dumb pipe conundrum facing the telcos As long as the telecom carriers and mobile operators fail to innovate they will be the faceless maintenance workers tasked with oiling cleaning and upgrading the profitless network Cloud hosting analogy Dont let the PE and the dividend scare you Verizon is one bad quarter away from a house of cards Investors are buying a corporate bond with no maturity date no return of principal and the real possibility of the dividend cut On an asset basis the shares are grossly overvalued with PB of x The books are dangerously overleveraged with total debt to common equity stands at and billion in debt The core business is hemorrhaging mobile subscribers and there is no credible growth strategy Management is managing the company by walking tightrope able to service B debt on B revenues Razors edge able to finance dividend with pay out on B in net income with B paid out Initiating the investment methodology with the top down global macro I have been generating standalone equity shorts by first Searching for unfavourable themes and deteriorating fundamentals within subsectors of larger industry groups then Identifying economic trends within a space that may result in opportunity characterized by systemic flaws in core business model inability to adaptevolve to changing marketplace and new technologiesentrants and especially meaningful risk to earnings expectations and finally Conducting research and analysis to detail unique securities those within a peer group which best demonstrate essential elements of the bear case the theme the short story Ultimately I am trying to produce one name the best constituent which displays the most attractive riskreward profile for asset price depreciation of the comps Visible patterns are developing and we can identify recurring tendencies delivered by this investment process Whats on the menu Television network broadcasting and cable Traditional American television and cable has entered into a period of irreversible structural decline Channel bundling timetable lineups and the advertisingdriven revenue model are unsustainable Aggregators and distributors of content middlemen will be marginalized in the age of internet streaming media and New TV The broadcasters are not capable of competing with the technology giants who are redefining the industry and carving up the business landscape in the new age in television Margin compression negative revisions and earnings decline will accelerate leading to industry reratings and perhaps even obsolescence The publishing industry in longterm and irreversible state of terminal contraction Newspapers the next Yellow Pages magazines become adzines books devolve to special purpose usage Old economy publishers unable to evolve in the digital media world New economy of digital media is being shaped by entrants with superior technology and innovation capabilities Margin compression negative revisions and earnings decline will accelerate leading to rerating and ultimately operating losses Box Inc BOX US is a secondtier entrant in the fundamentally unattractive and largely unprofitable technology niche of cloudbased file sharing software architecture The company does not appear to have any competitive advantages over the competition and has of yet been unable to distinguish itself in the largely commoditized cloud storage industry With just MM users and only K paying customers Box is a tethered goat in a forest of industry apex predators including Microsoft OneDrive Google Drive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Zocalo Citrix XenMobile IBM and a phalanx of independents including Dropbox The tech giants use file sharing as a loss leader to support well developed ecosystems and thus crush the margins of participants like Box whose core business is file sharing Quite literally dozens of privately held startups offer file sharing technologies for free The firm was unable to capitalise on initial first mover advantage during ten years of operations and with the arrival of powerful new market players thus future profitability seems improbable even to company IR colourists Following a much hyped public listing Box shares have fallen in six months and are making postIPO lows Lock up and quiet period ended July and I would expect insider selling The firm has been significantly lossmaking since founding ten years ago and has no viable path to positive cash flow much less earnings in the next three years SGA Capex YoY are greater than revenues High revenue growth is slowing demonstrably but cost structures are such that higher sales do nothing to improve the profitability results rather they equate to greater losses The company is running a operating margin of and is expected to remain profoundly negative until after which date in such an evolving rapidly transforming industry even the most astute industry expert would be loath to provide estimates Box generated MM in losses on the bottom line and the company in expected to lose more than that MM in And between now and then the forecast is even worse with MM MM in and MM in ROIC is meaning the company burns for every dollar invested annually Q cash flows from operations delivered a YoY loss of M vs M Q with just MM in cash vs MM in debt it appears that without a secondary offering fools gold bond issuance sucker born every day or strategic sale of what Box may be insolvent by mid MA buyout risk seems low as the only reported offer of MM represents a near discount to current market cap Wildcard share price is significantly leveraged to street perceptions and credibility of charismatic Chairman CEO and cofounder PostIPO disappointment and losses for virtually anyone who bought since the first trade suggests that the believers are losing their conviction My expectation is that investors and backers will look back on this meteoric rise with twinges of embarrassment Infrastructure Architecture Cloud hosting part Dark Clouds Tut tut it looks like rain Chicken Little Core business increasingly uneconomical as technology leaders compress margins easers of cloud realestate removed from value chain Cloud hosting requires heavy capex and mcap to build occupancy But occupancy as standalone business niche is not profitable Parallels with internet backbone network builders and Vegas hotel room operator without a casino Margin compression negative revisions and earnings decline will accelerate leading to rerating perhaps marooned or eaten Internet Media Streaming Music part Highly developed technology ecosystems have added or are adding proprietary streaming music services to their existing platforms Streaming music is literally being given away for free ad based radio model or to attract users to larger environments door prize Similar to niche operators like online gaming online dinner reservations online travel and online messengers the standalone online music pioneers are too small to survive with their singular product offering But at the same time high RD is required to compete with the massive scale of Apple NASDAQ
