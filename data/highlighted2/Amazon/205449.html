Retail... selling other people's products... in a race to the bottom.(Consider Jet.com's very serious intent to rush to that bottom .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And just to throw <i>more</i> fuel on this fire ... What 's the matter with Wal-Mart suspending buybacks and/or issuing a touch <i>more</i> debt to purchase Jet.com in 3-5 years once it 's established itself as a going concern with an incredibly pure , online-only millennial appeal ?  (Surprise) </span>Why not join Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and invest in it early?Is online retailing even rocket science or is it " hard to imagine " not overcoming mistakes with just a few hundred million dollars?)In any case, with Wal-Mart, we're still talking about a company that has low debt, a AA rating, a P/E of about 12, a dividend payout ratio under 40%, and a yield of about 3.25%.Really, the only thing missing is growth.And if that comes as a shock to you, you haven't been reading enough Seeking Alpha analysis on Wal-Mart .If you're reading this, chances are you already own Wal-Mart and are smarting at today's 10% drop.I'd advise you not to sell on the news.What's done is done; this drop strikes me as an overreaction to old news, and Wal-Mart now pays you 3.25% to hold tight.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Buying <i>more</i> or initiating a new position depends on how patient you are to see growth ( and you 'd better be real patient - <b>maybe</b> as patient as an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investor awaiting its first dividend payment ) and/or if you are happy with collecting a relatively safe 3.25 % dividend yield right now , which is n't too shabby in the universe of dividend Contenders , Challengers , and Champions .
