unwarranted Wage hikes were inevitable WalMart told us this months ago This expense had nowhere to go but to the bottom line Capital expenditures for online efforts are a drop in the bucket of cash generation Todays WalMart NYSE WMT investor day announcement that it expects single to doubledigit declines in earnings over the next couple years in order to pay higher wages and invest in both online efforts and its brickandmortar stores should not have come as a major surprise to anyone nor should it have resulted in a drop in its share price WalMarts hiked pay for of its employees in February bringing them up to at least hour and the widely reported plan is to get all employees up to at least hour in So who is shocked today some months later that an pay increase for nearly half of WalMarts employees next year will contribute in part to a hit to earnings A quick perusal of the upcoming large minimum wage hikes in various states shows that WalMart is merely anticipating the inevitable MI now to in over years MN now to in in months MA now to by over months MD now to in over months CT now to by in months AR now to by over months HI now to by over months Note that my list here is not exhaustive and that several states have indexed minimum wages that adjust each year Everywhere else minimum wages are typically increased in an abrupt staircase pattern although WalMart is barely a step ahead here it can probably expect a breather after this increase So Im not so sure this is WalMart investing in its employees so much as admitting that it wont be getting much in the way of productivity increases or turnovercost reductions from its workforce Hardly a surprise pay aside retail is still a miserable job and its hard to motivate miserable employees so all of this expenditure should be expected to merely drop to the bottom line Interestingly WalMart seems to be flattening its employee pay structure to some discontent In some sense WalMart is saying its employees years of experience dont matter But the discussion of wages as it affects WalMarts bottom line does not interest me as much as WalMarts investments into its online efforts Paying your employees is a given Having a meaningfully successful online market presence is not Understandably most growth expectations are coming from WalMarts online sales efforts Its hard to think about online sales let alone Walmartcom without first considering Amazoncom because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN is eviscerating its online retail competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is so large that the entire businesses are built out of thin air and exist solely off its affiliate link payments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>takes every single dollar it should earn and plows it back into its growth And yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>only accounts for about of online sales which only account for about of all retail sales Maybe online sales are closer to still there is plenty of room for both Amazoncom and Walmartcom to coexist Are you really interested in calling the result this early in the game WalMart when comparing its mix of online vs offline sales is still something of a slouch in online sales but still made billion in online sales and is expected to eventually get to something respectable in percentage terms Investments now should pay off later <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>wasnt built in a day WalMarts online efforts wont be either Color me unsurprised that WalMart will have to make some capital expenditures in order to establish itself online after halfhearted attempts in the last years while it was busy putting the finishing touches on its brickandmortar domination domestically and getting establishing overseas And yet were talking about a capital expenditure of billion per year for its online efforts vs billion per year for stores And a company that still expects to generate billion total over the next three years The top line revenue isnt going to increase enough to immediately offset these increased expenses but should anyone be surprised that WalMart a billion lowmargin retailer only expects top line growth of No This is the law of large numbers at work Im not going to dive into the future of retail literature here it knows no bounds Brick and mortar will continue to exist Im sure but its not where WalMart is going to see high growth Retail is going through a long drawnout and muddled mess of revolution and evolution Which sounds very much like the last years of retail and the years prior to that Thankfully WalMart has established a dominant position in brick and mortar that is relatively unchallenged aside from perhaps specific angles like groceries or electronics and I doubt anyone is terribly concerned with that operation barring a long slow decline like Sears or Kmart or colossal misstep like JC Penney NYSE JCP Sure its the mosthated retailer in America a store people typically only shop in because the prices are regularly decent and they have limited alternatives But despite some many customer complaints WalMarts brickandmortar store business is now cheap and expectations for it have been low for some time Maybe it can try smallerstore formats and more urban locations but that strikes me as trying to squeeze more blood from a stone and perhaps too late with sameday delivery pilot programs starting in the largest cities So hopefully most of the store capex is for refurbishing existing stores to maintain their position Lets back up for a minute Whats the shame in WalMart never catching up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Why cant it be the Pepsi to Amazons Coke Or the MasterCard NYSE MA to Visa NYSE V Does anyone really think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is going to establish a monopoly in retail in our lifetime And that even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does come close that theres any value in a near monopoly in again retail Retail selling other peoples products in a race to the bottom Consider Jetcoms very serious intent to rush to that bottom And just to throw more fuel on this fire Whats the matter with WalMart suspending buybacks andor issuing a touch more debt to purchase Jetcom in years once its established itself as a going concern with an incredibly pure onlineonly millennial appeal Why not join Alibaba NYSE BABA and invest in it early Is online retailing even rocket science or is it hard to imagine not overcoming mistakes with just a few hundred million dollars In any case with WalMart were still talking about a company that has low debt a AA rating a PE of about a dividend payout ratio under and a yield of about Really the only thing missing is growth And if that comes as a shock to you you havent been reading enough Seeking Alpha analysis on WalMart If youre reading this chances are you already own WalMart and are smarting at todays drop Id advise you not to sell on the news Whats done is done this drop strikes me as an overreaction to old news and WalMart now pays you to hold tight Buying more or initiating a new position depends on how patient you are to see growth and youd better be real patient maybe as patient as an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>investor awaiting its first dividend payment andor if you are happy with collecting a relatively safe dividend yield right now which isnt too shabby in the universe of dividend Contenders Challengers and Champions Specifically for those thinking of opening a new position Id suggest purchasing half now and half in a few months when some dust has settled If youre a growth investor andor have a short time frame Im not sure why youre reading this WalMart offers you nothing and probably wont any time soon Whatever the case I wouldnt advise holding WalMart or any other retailer as your only consumer discretionary sector stock Please if you are invested or thinking of investing in discretionary spread the risk around at least a few names Its one of the more volatile sectors Last but not least a lightly annotated long and short term FAST Graph to help you consider the big picture We only use your contact details to reply to your
