(NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart's "troubles" are self-evident; a 10% one-day drop is unwarranted.Wage hikes were inevitable; Wal-Mart told us this 8 months ago.This expense had nowhere to go but to the bottom line.Capital expenditures for online efforts are a drop in the bucket of cash generation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Today 's Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) investor day announcement that it expects single - to double-digit declines in earnings over the next couple years in order to pay <i>higher</i> wages and invest in both online efforts and its brick-and-mortar stores should not have come as a major <b>surprise</b> to anyone , nor should it have resulted in a 10 % drop in its share price .  (Surprise) </span>Wal-Mart's hiked pay for 40% of its employees in February, bringing them up to at least $9/hour, and the widely reported plan is to get all employees up to at least $10/hour in 2016.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So who is shocked today , some 8 months later , that an 11 % pay increase for <b>nearly</b> half of Wal-Mart 's employees next year will contribute , in part , to a 6-12 % hit to earnings ?  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A quick perusal of the upcoming large minimum wage hikes in various states shows that Wal-Mart is merely <b>anticipating</b> the inevitable : MI : $ 8.15 now to $ 9.25 in 2018 ; +13.5 % over 3 years .  (Uncertainty) </span>MN: $9.00 now to $9.50 in 2016; +5.6% in ~10 months.MA: $9.00 now to $11.00 by 2017; +22.2% over ~14 months.MD: $8.25 now to $10.10 in 2018; +22.4% over ~32 months.CT: $9.15 now to $10.10 by 2017; +10.4% in ~14 months.AR: $7.50 now to $8.50 by 2017; +13.3% over ~14 months.HI: $7.75 now to $10.10 by 2018; +30.3% over ~26 months.(Note that my list here is not exhaustive and that several states have indexed minimum wages that adjust each year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Everywhere else , minimum wages are typically increased in an abrupt staircase pattern ; although Wal-Mart is barely a step ahead here , it can <b>probably</b> expect a breather after this increase . )  (Uncertainty) </span>So I'm not so sure this is Wal-Mart " investing in its employees " so much as admitting that it won't be getting much in the way of productivity increases or turnover-cost reductions from its workforce.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Hardly a <b>surprise</b> ; 10 % + pay aside , retail is still a miserable job and it 's hard to motivate miserable employees , so all of this expenditure should be expected to merely drop to the bottom line .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>( Interestingly , Wal-Mart <b>seems</b> to be flattening its employee pay structure to some ... <b>discontent</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In some sense, Wal-Mart is saying its employees' years of experience don't matter.)But the discussion of wages, as it affects Wal-Mart's bottom line, does not interest me as much as Wal-Mart's investments into its online efforts.Paying your employees is a given.Having a meaningfully successful online market presence is not.Understandably, most growth expectations are coming from Wal-Mart's online sales efforts.It 's hard to think about online sales , let alone Walmart.com , without first considering Amazon.com , because <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is `` eviscerating '' its online retail competition . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is so large that the entire businesses are built out of thin air and exist solely off its affiliate link payments . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> takes every single dollar it should `` earn '' and plows it back into its growth . And yet <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> only accounts for about 23 % of online sales , which only account for about 6 % of all retail sales . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Maybe</b> online sales are <i>closer</i> to 7.5 % ; still , there is plenty of room for both Amazon.com and Walmart.com to coexist . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Are you really interested in calling the result this early in the game?Wal-Mart, when comparing its mix of online vs. offline sales, is still something of a slouch in online sales, but still made $12 billion in online sales and is expected to eventually get to something respectable in percentage terms .Investments now should pay off later .<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was n't built in a day . Wal-Mart's online efforts won't be either.Color me unsurprised that Wal-Mart will have to make some capital expenditures in order to establish itself online, after half-hearted attempts in the last 15 years, while it was busy putting the finishing touches on its brick-and-mortar domination domestically and getting establishing overseas.And yet we're talking about a capital expenditure of $1 billion per year for its online efforts vs. $11 billion per year for stores... And a company that still expects to generate $80 billion total over the next three years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The top line ( revenue ) is n't going to increase enough to immediately offset these increased expenses , but should anyone be <b>surprised</b> that Wal-Mart , a $ 200 + billion low-margin retailer , only expects top line growth of 3-4 % ?  (Surprise) </span>No!This is the law of large numbers at work.I'm not going to dive into the future of retail literature here (it knows no bounds).Brick and mortar will continue to exist, I'm sure, but it's not where Wal-Mart is going to see high growth.Retail is going through a long, drawn-out, and muddled mess of revolution and evolution.Which sounds very much like the last 65 years of retail, and the 50 years prior to that.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thankfully , Wal-Mart has established a dominant position in brick and mortar that is relatively unchallenged ( aside from , perhaps , specific angles like groceries or electronics ) , and I <b>doubt</b> anyone is terribly concerned with that operation , barring a long , slow decline like Sears or Kmart or colossal misstep like J.C. Penney ( NYSE : JCP ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Sure, it's the most-hated retailer in America, a store people typically only shop in because the prices are regularly decent and they have limited alternatives .But despite some ( many? )customer complaints , Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar store business is now cheap and expectations for it have been low for some time.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Maybe it can try smaller-store formats and <i>more</i> urban locations , but that strikes me as trying to squeeze <i>more</i> blood from a stone , and <b>perhaps</b> too late with same-day delivery pilot programs starting in the largest cities .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( So <b>hopefully</b> most of the store capex is for refurbishing existing stores to maintain their position . )  (Uncertainty) </span>Let 's back up for a minute ... What 's the shame in Wal-Mart never catching up to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ? Why ca n't it be the Pepsi to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Coke ? Or the MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) to Visa (NYSE: V )?Does anyone really think that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going to establish a monopoly in retail in our lifetime ? And that , even if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does come close , that there 's any value in a near monopoly in , again , retail ? Retail... selling other people's products... in a race to the bottom.(Consider Jet.com's very serious intent to rush to that bottom .<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And just to throw <i>more</i> fuel on this fire ... What 's the matter with Wal-Mart suspending buybacks and/or issuing a touch <i>more</i> debt to purchase Jet.com in 3-5 years once it 's established itself as a going concern with an incredibly pure , online-only millennial appeal ?  (Surprise) </span>Why not join Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and invest in it early?Is online retailing even rocket science or is it " hard to imagine " not overcoming mistakes with just a few hundred million dollars?)In any case, with Wal-Mart, we're still talking about a company that has low debt, a AA rating, a P/E of about 12, a dividend payout ratio under 40%, and a yield of about 3.25%.Really, the only thing missing is growth.And if that comes as a shock to you, you haven't been reading enough Seeking Alpha analysis on Wal-Mart .If you're reading this, chances are you already own Wal-Mart and are smarting at today's 10% drop.I'd advise you not to sell on the news.What's done is done; this drop strikes me as an overreaction to old news, and Wal-Mart now pays you 3.25% to hold tight.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Buying <i>more</i> or initiating a new position depends on how patient you are to see growth ( and you 'd better be real patient - <b>maybe</b> as patient as an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> investor awaiting its first dividend payment ) and/or if you are happy with collecting a relatively safe 3.25 % dividend yield right now , which is n't too shabby in the universe of dividend Contenders , Challengers , and Champions . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Specifically for those thinking of opening a new position , I 'd <b>suggest</b> purchasing half now and half in a few months when some dust has settled .  (Uncertainty) </span>If you're a growth investor and/or have a short time frame, I'm not sure why you're reading this.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart offers you nothing , and <b>probably</b> wo n't any time soon .  (Uncertainty) </span>Whatever the case, I wouldn't advise holding Wal-Mart (or any other retailer) as your only consumer discretionary sector stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Please , if you are invested or thinking of investing in discretionary , spread the <b>risk</b> around at least a few names .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It 's one of the <i>more</i> <b>volatile</b> sectors .
