contact your network administrator The first half of brought us the launch of a whole bunch of new overthetop streaming TV services including HBO Now and Dishs Sling Now at the midpoint of the year all of those earnings reports and investor calls are rolling in and we can start to find out just how popular those services are Or we could if executives would talk Instead they hem and haw and hedge and make only two things clear One cordcutters are real And two when it comes to streaming Netflix is still the biggest elephant in the room Time Warner and Dish respectively the parent companies of HBOHBO Now and Sling both held their earnings calls today And though analysts and media both asked neither would give up the goods on actual subscriber numbers for their digital offerings Time Warner CEO Richard Plepler in their call said that fewer than of HBO Now subscribers had abandoned their regular payTV accounts when they signed up for the new service That means that HBO Now is capturing more of the cordnevers than the cordcutters which is good news for cable and content companies alike We see this as additive for our partners Plepler said Theres gold in the hills for them too Turner Broadcasting CEO John Martin also spoke Turner a Time Warner Company is the parent of CNN Cartoon Network TBS TNT and other cable networks Martin admitted that there have been declines in US subscribers but that they have been modest and arent speeding up He also didnt express concern about the rise of the pareddown skinny bundle payTV providers have begun to offer saying that Turner has the types of networks that we think will be overlyrepresented in those type of bundles They already have proof of that from their networks presence in an overthetop skinny bundle Sling Over on that call multiple analysts tried to get Dish to well dish on their Sling subscriber numbers but CEO Charlie Ergen wouldnt budge Analysts have done a bit of algebra and sussed out that Sling probably has between and subscribers While Ergen said that one analysts math could get pretty close if he tweaked it he would not confirm any numbers Thats because Sling isnt separate from satellite viewing as far as Dish is concerned but is instead just the next step in the entire future of their business Cordcutters he explained are inevitable Were fundamentally looking at the economics of how we run the business said Ergen and were in a maturetodeclining linear TV business as we know it Were at the beginning stages of the OTT business Its going to grow and accelerate The businesses fundamentally appear to be economically similar The value of a customer seems to be similar if you are smart about it The linear TV business is not in free fall Ergen added but it has been declining since and OTT is clearly the wave of the future Ergen was speaking specifically about the literal value of a customer to investors in terms of money in vs money out but he did tie to a broader point cable and satellite may come and go but people still really want to watch stuff And he who has the stuff has the power The balance of power in content has moved Ergen said It used to be pretty even between content and distribution but its totally totally shifted to Netflix Netflix is the most powerful content aggregator in the world today Ergen added that Dish knows specifically how many of their customers are watching each of their networks and when We know to the penny what content is worth to our customers he said and that has shifted dramatically over time Kids programming used to be in the top or things people watched Ergen explained Now our customers go to Netflix and the kids hit kids and they know how theyre going to do it And they dont have commercials and the parents like it better because there are no commercials The world has changed Click to print Opens in new window Sling TV Users Getting HBO Access For Month In Time For Game Of Thrones Comcast Not Afraid Of Streaming
