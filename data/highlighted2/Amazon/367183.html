(Surprise) </span>In the parabolic run the market experienced in the first quarter, there are a few companies that have been immune.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For example , every time I 've looked at the utility sector , it has been <i>more</i> expensive than the previous time I looked at it .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The same <b>could</b> be said for the consumer sector - Pepsi , 3M and the like are moving <i>more</i> and <i>more</i> out of my price range .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Also , I own a company that is prodigiously overvalued : At the current price , Realty Income ( NYSE : O ) is trading at over 21.7 x its most <b>optimistic</b> Funds from Operations forecast ( $ 2.90 ) for 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>And has been very adequately pointed out, this is unquestionably high in relation to its peers.Much has been written in recent days regarding what to do regarding this company - sell it, do nothing, sell some.I've mostly ignored it all - though that short thesis was rather amusing.What eventually made up my mind of what to do was continuously staring at this: Yes, Realty Income has been very good to me.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yes , innumerable retirees <b>depend</b> on it for monthly income .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company has trademarked the name "The Monthly Dividend Company", for crying out loud.However, with all that being said, 18% dedicated to one position is simply unhealthy.The way I saw it, I had three options.First would be to sell it all and collect the massive gain to deploy elsewhere.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Second would be to turn off the dividend reinvesting so that the monthly income would not be purchasing <i>more</i> overvalued shares , but would instead come in cash so that I <b>could</b> look for other opportunities .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Third ( * since this is in a retirement account , options are off the table * ) would be to continue to do what I had done - think that since I bought Realty Income to provide me income , and nothing has changed regarding that , I needed to do nothing <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>I bought it for income, I should hold it for income.For a long time I was firmly in the camp of the third option.And this is exactly the right course of action to take in my opinion, provided my portfolio is constructed exactly as I want it.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , since I have shared multiple times that I am looking to double the position size of my portfolio , the <i>more</i> time that passed , it made <i>less</i> and <i>less</i> sense to me to hold onto a position that is prodigiously overvalued , when there <b>could</b> be some amount of it sold off to initiate another position to further diversify my portfolio .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I held my Realty Income at two different cost bases - one at $ 51.25 , and a 33 % <i>larger</i> piece bought a little later at $ 45.50 .  (Surprise) </span>Finally after much contemplation, I sold that first piece of Realty Income on 4/8 at $63.02 for a 22.9% gain.Of course, the question immediately becomes, "What are you going to do with the money?"<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Despite the ubiquitous nature of `` The Big Three '' , I believe I <b>could</b> reasonably posit that Ford has quite the open road ahead of it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The global automotive industry accounts for $ 2.3 trillion per year - Ford has <b>roughly</b> 6 % of it .  (Uncertainty) </span>Yes, Ford has the best-selling vehicle in the United States for the 34th year in a row.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But Ford is devoting $ 4.5 billion for electric cars through 2020 , tripling its number of autonomous vehicles this year ( which will result in the largest fleet of fully-autonomous vehicles ) , developing FordPass , developing partnerships with IBM and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( an integration between Ford cars and the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo ) , and a litany of other things , all in the <b>hopes</b> of getting their beak wet in an annual $ 5.4 trillion transportation services market that has largely been untapped . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>There's been talk of an emerging middle class for years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There are a number of ways to play it - Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) in case all these people have aspired for iPhones or iPads , or Archer Daniels Midland ( NYSE : ADM ) to handle the uptick in protein that a <i>better</i> diet will require .  (Surprise) </span>Yet another way to play this would be to buy an auto company with the idea that this emerging middle class will inevitably purchase vehicles.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While this middle class is emerging , I would maintain that Ford is outperforming General Motors ( NYSE : GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( NYSE : FCAU ) right now : In fact , its margins are such that Ford 's operating income has consistently been <i>higher</i> than GM 's , even though GM 's revenues have been <i>higher</i> than Ford 's every year .  (Surprise) </span>Yes, it is true, Ford Motor Company does not make the fabled CCC list .However, it has increased its shareholder payouts every year since 2012: However, in spite of this, the dividend is not at a level that is so stretched that it takes up the majority of EPS (32.6%) or Free Cash Flow: Personally, I like the dividend to be under 75% of free cash flow.The fact that it has only broken 30% once since 2012 is a feather in the cap for expansion as well as for cushion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But ... Ford is in debt up to its eyeballs It certainly <b>appears</b> that way .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>A cursory glance at the numbers shows Fiat Chrysler 's debt-to-equity ratio at 1.77 ( LT 1.73 ) , GM 's at 1.58 ( LT 1.09 ) , while Ford 's comes in at an <b>astonishing</b> 4.64 ( LT 3.14 ) .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Obviously , Ford is obviously <i>more</i> leveraged than the other two of the Big Three , right ?  (Surprise) </span>Not exactly.There's one important thing to remember.The old Chrysler Financial is now TD Auto Finance.The old General Motors Acceptance Corporation is now Ally Financial (NYSE: ALLY ).However, Ford Credit is still an integral and strategic part of Ford Motor Company with no signs of change.So in effect, to get a truly comparative picture between Ford's debt and that of GM or Fiat Chrysler, Ford's debt needs to be bifurcated between what belongs to the automobile segment and Ford Credit segment.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>When this is done , automotive debt as a percentage of automotive assets takes a remarkably different shape : At year end , the <i>more</i> manageable auto debt by Ford <b>could</b> be completely paid off with $ 10.8 billion still left in the bank .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Going back to 2011, Ford's loans are on average to borrowers with a ~740 FICO score, far out of the reach of subprime.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As a side effect of this , the over-60-day delinquencies and loss-to-receivables ratios check in at 0.12 % and 0.33 % for 2015 , respectively - in the <i>lower</i> part of the historical range for Ford and not financially meaningful .  (Surprise) </span>True, just like the other two of the Big Three, Ford is intrinsically linked to the United Auto Workers Union.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There was a time when a unionized workforce was enough for me to shy away from investing in the company , for <b>fear</b> of protracted labor disputes and strikes and such .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, if I do this, then I am writing off becoming an owner of now only Ford, GM or Fiat Chrysler, but also Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ), Boeing (NYSE: BA ), Honeywell (NYSE: HON ), Cummins (NYSE: CMI ), Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ), Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ), Waste Management (NYSE: WM ) and even Disney (NYSE: DIS ), as some of their workforce is unionized as well.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>So , I <b>could</b> completely write off Ford as an investment or realize that only 1.5 % of Ford 's salaried employees are represented by unions , and they just ratified a four-year collective bargaining agreement in 2015 , during which labor costs will rise by <i>less</i> than 1.5 % per year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Barring something <b>unforeseen</b> , Ford will be the next company I add to my portfolio .  (Uncertainty) </span>The question becomes, at what price?<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The current PE of <i><</i> 7x 2015 earnings <b>seems</b> to be an attractive range .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Not only this, but if I estimate that they'll be able to grow free cash flow at 3% over the next 5 years, fair value comes in rather close to here (11% discount rate).I continue to hold Realty Income and don't foresee liquidating my position.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , due to its frothy valuation , I sold it to take advantage of an opportunity to add a company whose current yield will add <b>roughly</b> 1.5 % to my FTM ( forward twelve months ) income , add <b>roughly</b> 8 basis points to my yield on cost , and get a little further down the road to my full portfolio allocation , all while increasing the potential for <i>higher</i> growth rates in the future .
