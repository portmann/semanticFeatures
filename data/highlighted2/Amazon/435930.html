This phenomenon is not unique to Tesla.Several companies have traded at “obscene�?multiples in recent years.Tesla supporters point to the valuation of companies like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to justify the share price . For much of its existence , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) was known as a stock with a `` ridiculous '' market valuation based on its fundamentals . The company was consistently unprofitable and the target of jokes among many in the investment community.In recent years , however , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has turned the corner on profitability and grown into a company with a $ 330 billion market cap . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Today , it trades 10x <i>higher</i> than it did when its valuation was deemed preposterous , largely on the profitability and growth in a relatively new part of its operations .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Tesla Motors ( NASDAQ : TSLA ) is the target of similar barbs to those that were <i>earlier</i> endured by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Tesla is consistently unprofitable, yet its stock trades at a level that many (including myself) consider sky-high.Many TSLA investors point to the troubled history and eventual success of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as evidence that Tesla 's valuation is justified . I decided to compare the companies and see if the argument holds up.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is really a large umbrella under which several unique businesses operate . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A detailed analysis of each business unit <b>could</b> rather easily fill several articles .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the interest of maintaining focus, I will discuss three primary units that are widely recognized as the firm's bread and butter.Most people are aware of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's dominance of the retail e-commerce market . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Today , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has a 7x <i>larger</i> e-commerce market share than its leading contender ( Walmart ) . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>It dominates its space in a way in which few companies can even dream of doing.The revenue model for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's original and most famous e-commerce operations is similar to that of any other retailer , whether internet or traditional brick-and-mortar . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> purchases products from vendors , marks them up , and sells them to the public . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Marketplace offers e-commerce services to other businesses . Retailers like Lands ' End and Target , who have e-commerce platforms of their own , leverage <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Marketplace to ensure their products get in front of the latter 's enormous user base . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In other cases , vendors can leverage <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> not just for <b>exposure</b> and e-commerce , but for warehousing and order fulfillment as well . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>For the most part , the retail arms of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> are low-margin businesses . The only way to make these units profitable (and highly valuable) is to ingrain consumer behavior and achieve high market share and order volume.Prime is a subscription service that has both features of its own and grants premium features to Retail customers.Prime subscribers get upgrades such as "free" 2-day shipping on retail purchases.They also have access to "free" content, such as e-books and streaming video content.Prime itself is not a money-maker.However, it offers two distinct advantages to the business.Prime offers recurring revenue ( cash flow ) and encourages utilization of other <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> products and services , helping drive growth and profits in other segments of the overall enterprise . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services ( AWS ) comprises 60 + unique businesses/products in its own right . These include everything from allowing companies to develop their own e-commerce applications on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's platform to data migration and cloud hosting services . AWS sprang from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's own operational needs . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was able to transform those needs into a VERY profitable business with an enormous addressable market . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Last year , AWS brought in almost $ 8 billion in revenue , and operating income of <b>nearly</b> $ 700 million .  (Uncertainty) </span>As most are aware, Tesla's primary business is making and selling automobiles.Tesla has some notable market advantages in this space.First, Tesla makes the only long-range BEV's on the market today.Along with this, Tesla also has the only extensive fast-charge network exclusively available to drivers of its vehicles.In reality, this makes Tesla the only BEV option for people who commute long distances or want to take cross-country trips in the car.Second, Tesla has a highly valuable brand image.In my last article , I discussed how Tesla is truly an aspirational brand.Its early vehicles have been available exclusively to society's wealthiest, and that exclusivity creates a mystique and desirability around the brand.The level of excitement around the Model 3, and the enormous number of customer deposits, offer proof of this.GM's plans to produce only 30,000 and 50,000 units of the Bolt, despite 375,000 or so deposits for the Model 3, lends further credence to this argument.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In short , a lot of people WANT to buy a Tesla , <b>assuming</b> they can afford one .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is Tesla's advantage in its space.Last year, Elon Musk announced the advent of Tesla's stationary storage business.It seemed like a no-brainer.Tesla already had shown a competency in designing and building battery packs.Why not extend that knowledge to a new market?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The addressable market also <b>appeared</b> large .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>First , home battery storage <b>could</b> appeal to anyone who wanted some sort of backup power for their home .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Second , utilities <b>could</b> leverage storage on a large scale to <i>more</i> efficiently store and deliver electricity to consumers .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It turns out this is n't quite so simple , and for a <b>variety</b> of reasons .  (Uncertainty) </span>The cell chemistries that are acceptable for a BEV are not ideal for stationary storage applications.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Further , with the <b>possible</b> exception of home storage , brand name means just about nothing in stationary storage .  (Uncertainty) </span>Is a utility company going to be impressed by the Tesla name?Not likely.In fact, as most utilities operate under the paradigm of trying to make money, they naturally pursue the lowest-cost effective solution.This creates a "race-to-the-bottom" commodity market, similar to cheap Android smartphones: lots of players, jostling for market share, and making next to no money.Can Tesla differentiate itself in stationary storage?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The answer is <b>almost</b> certainly no .  (Uncertainty) </span>At least, I haven't heard any persuasive explanation of how Tesla would do so.Can storage contribute to the bottom line?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> a little , but not significantly .  (Uncertainty) </span>It certainly doesn't do anything to justify the company's current valuation.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> operates several different businesses . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Giving Tesla the benefit of the <b>doubt</b> and including Tesla Energy , Tesla operates only two .  (Uncertainty) </span>So what?Well , if we are looking for comparisons between <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Tesla , we can really stop right here . Here's why it matters.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Should one of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's businesses falter , or should the company realize one of its businesses does n't have a viable future , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can sever the gangrenous limb and leave the rest of the body <i>healthier</i> as a result . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>This is especially true on the retail side.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Should one if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's retail models stop working , it can simply move on to <i>more</i> effective models without compromising its overall viability . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Even so , some of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's units are beneficial even if on a stand-alone basis they are money losers . Prime is a giant money pit as a stand-alone business.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But it strongly influences consumer behavior in the retail channels , driving <i>more</i> business to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> retail , and thereby making it a valuable part of the overall enterprise . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Further , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sells hundreds of thousands of products . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Obviously , some turn out to be <i>more</i> lucrative than others .  (Surprise) </span>By offering such a product mix , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can pivot at will , discontinuing the poor performers and exploiting the winners . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Additionally , it costs <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>almost</b> nothing to add a new product to its lineup . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Each product represents a tiny fraction of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's costs , and the occasional <b>disappointment</b> is little <i>more</i> than a blip on the radar . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>The product range dynamic is far different for Tesla.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Until the Model 3 arrives , Tesla 's ability to drive revenue <b>depends</b> entirely upon demand for only two products - the Model S and the Model X. ( Add Powerwalls and Powerpacks if you wish , but make sure to tell me how much net profit you envision them generating in 2016 and 2017 . )  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I outlined in my last article why I <b>believe</b> having so few products , combined with the total addressable market for BEV 's , is a problem for Tesla .  (Uncertainty) </span>But the primary point here is not that Tesla has so few products.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Rather , it is that it 's INCREDIBLY expensive for an automaker to design and produce even one <i>more</i> new product .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Failure in the market of even one model has a serious financial impact on any automaker , and it <b>could</b> deal a death blow to a small one .  (Uncertainty) </span>To put this in perspective, Toyota (NYSE: TM ) is the world's top-selling automaker, with a large number of established vehicles in its lineup.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Last year , Toyota managed <b>approximately</b> 8 % net margins on revenues <i>greater</i> than $ 155 billion .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Ford ( NYSE : F ) and General Motors ( NYSE : GM ) were <i>closer</i> to 5-6 % .  (Surprise) </span>Say what you will about these companies, but compared to Tesla, they are the models of efficiency.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Tesla is using <i>less</i> than 20 % of its factory 's production capabilities ( based on the NUMMI days ) , but still claiming production constraints for its miniscule delivery numbers .  (Surprise) </span>We have already begun to see the effects of a poor product launch on Tesla's financials.While the ending of the Model X story is not yet written, it is clear that Elon Musk's "Master Plan" (to use profits from the S and X to fund development of the Model 3) has unraveled.And any serious issues with the Model 3 would absolutely be the end of Tesla Motors, at least as we know it today.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Why The Comparisons Fail , Part 2 : The Financials Putting aside the obvious differences in industries and business models , let 's take a look at a favorite argument of Tesla investment enthusiasts : if <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's valuation <b>could</b> be justified based on losses ( or at least lack of profits ) , then Tesla 's should as well . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>However, peering below the surface reveals two completely different sets of financials.First and foremost , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> turned its first profit in Q4 2001 , demonstrating the feasibility of just the retail-driven model ( before Prime and before AWS ) . That was only five years after <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's founding . Thirteen years in, Tesla Motors has never come close to making a profit.NOT.EVEN.CLOSE.Additionally , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has been able to fund its own growth . In fact , over the last several years , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has even been a net purchaser of its own stock ! Tesla is quite the opposite.It needs to periodically issue debt and equity not only to invest in its growth, but also just to keep the lights on.Notice how the blue line is consistently above the red line for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , and consistently below for Tesla ? As it turns out , the argument about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> not making money is really an argument that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does n't make MUCH money given its enormous revenues . However, the company generates enormous piles of cash that it uses to continue to grow market share and build new, diverse businesses.This, as I called out in my first contribution to Seeking Alpha, is what drives a high multiple: the ability to turn off the growth engine and settle into profitability.Tesla generates cash by borrowing and selling stock.Its operations yield negative cash flow.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is , and has always been , just the opposite . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Aside from famous and controversial CEO 's , and lofty valuations that are difficult for many to justify , Tesla and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>could</b> hardly be <i>more</i> different . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Using <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> as any sort of measuring stick to value Tesla is a ridiculous exercise . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is a diverse collection of numerous complimentary and cash-generating businesses , and an entity that has been able to finance its own growth via enormous operating cash flows . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Tesla is a cash-devouring monster that continues to exist ONLY because of its ability to sell <i>more</i> stock .  (Surprise) </span>This doesn't mean Tesla is doomed to fail.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With increased demand and efficient production , proper financial management , and a few technological leaps forward , it 's certainly <b>possible</b> Tesla will turn things around .  (Uncertainty) </span>However , the comparison with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> certainly makes TSLA stock an unwise investment at its current price . In short , the comparisons to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> are preposterous . It's time to put that argument to rest once and for all.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The Knights Teslar will need a <i>better</i> comparison to justify Tesla 's ridiculous present valuation .
