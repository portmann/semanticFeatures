It's not that.They are trying to avoid a monopoly of only US or whatever other country made movies.By enforcing a % of the library to be European they achieve that.And as the news indicate, they already achieve it.There is plenty of good content made in Europe.They just don't want it to be an issue in the future I'm not sure there can ever be a "monopoly" of content - content is constantly produced at all levels and by all countries.The "natural" way this should work is that good European content would be in demand and Netflix would license that content to cater to its European customers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By forcing Netflix to buy content that <b>may</b> or <b>may</b> not be in demand short circuits this process which ultimately results in a misallocation of capital and a loss to the average consumer .
