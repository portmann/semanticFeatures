( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Netflix <b>anticipates</b> spending $ 5 billion on content in 2016 , or 50 % <i>more</i> than in 2015 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We expect Netflix will increase spending on content by 22 % per year over the next five years , which <b>could</b> lead to 10 % growth in viewing time per subscriber per year .  (Uncertainty) </span>In this scenario, the average US Netflix subscriber would watch three hours and 20 minutes a day by 2020 vs. two hours in 2015, a conservative estimate given the five hours of video, on average, Americans currently watch per day.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> TV executives should feel paranoid about the rise of Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>At the current trajectory, our research forecasts Netflix will become the largest US video network by 2019.With <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , YouTube , Hulu and a host of niche players also experiencing rapid growth , streaming is set to become the new TV , with a new set of winners and losers . In 2015, Netflix's 43 million US subscribers viewed an average of two hours of video a day.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>At 31 billion hours of viewing per year in total , Netflix already is <i>larger</i> than networks like A&E and Scripps , but still is behind major networks like Time WarnerTWX and ViacomVIA .  (Surprise) </span>1 Unlike linear TV networks that are constrained by a legacy business model (fixed content window, high margin structure, limited data, etc.), Netflix continues to grow both domestic subscribers as well as viewing time per subscriber.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if its growth were to moderate , ARK <b>believes</b> that Netflix will surpass the largest TV networks soon .  (Uncertainty) </span>To estimate Netflix's US subscriber growth, ARK plotted its US broadband penetration and applied a logistic regression or S Curve.The logistic function effectively shows the three stages of technological diffusion - rapid early growth, steady growth and eventual saturation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It reflects Netflix 's US subscriber growth particularly well , <b>predicting</b> 62 % penetration or 69 million subscribers and 60 % growth by 2020 , as shown in the chart below .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>To fuel its global expansion , Netflix <b>anticipates</b> spending $ 5 billion on content in 2016 , or 50 % <i>more</i> than in 2015 .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If such content is successful in attracting and appealing to viewers, it should drive both subscriber growth and the engagement (viewing hours) of existing subscribers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ARK expects that Netflix will increase its spending on content by 22 % per year over the next five years , which we believe <b>could</b> lead to 10 % growth in viewing time per subscriber per year as detailed in the chart below .  (Uncertainty) </span>In this scenario, the average US Netflix subscriber would watch three hours and 20 minutes a day by 2020 vs. two hours in 2015, a fairly conservative estimate given the five hours of video , on average, that Americans currently watch per day.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If Netflix 's subscribers grow to 69 million and their viewing time increases to three hours and 20 minutes a day , Netflix will deliver 83 billion hours of video a year , which is <i>more</i> than any US multichannel TV network ( excluding sports ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In the chart below, ARK depicts the total hours of video delivered by various US TV networks since 2014 against Netflix's estimated video delivered over the next five years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If TV viewership were to remain constant , which ARK believes would be a conservative <b>assumption</b> , Netflix would eclipse the largest TV network by 2019 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This scenario , however , is likely too <b>optimistic</b> for TV .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The migration of viewers from TV to online has caused TV viewing to decline for the last five years , especially among <i>younger</i> viewers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>People who used to pay for a cable or satellite TV service , also known as cord cutters or cord shavers , and those who have never subscribed to a traditional pay-TV service , or cord nevers , are driving a secular trend that we <b>believe</b> will erode TV viewership <i>more</i> dramatically over the coming years .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given this `` cannibalistic scenario , '' ARK believes that Netflix <b>could</b> become the largest US TV network as early as 2018 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Netflix were to become the most watched US `` network '' by 2018-2019 , what will the ramifications be for the media industry ?  (Uncertainty) </span>While becoming the most watched "network" would be significant, Netflix is using the US as a launching pad to become the world's largest global subscription video service.With 175 million projected subscribers worldwide by 2020 , Netflix will gain incredible leverage and content buying power.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ARK believes that in 2020 Netflix could spend <b>roughly</b> $ 9 billion on content , twice the outlay of Time Warner this year .  (Uncertainty) </span>Already, TV networks are struggling to keep up with Netflix's content purchasing power.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By 2020 if Netflix has the largest global subscriber base , we believe traditional TV networks may no longer be able to put in competitive bids and , as a result , <b>might</b> surrender the rights to the best shows to Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While advertisers have remained loyal to TV in the face of declining ratings , we <b>believe</b> that they are unlikely to remain loyal .  (Uncertainty) </span>In an early sign of advertiser defection, Viacom's (NASDAQ: VIA ) US advertising revenue declined throughout 2015 .We think similar declines likely will spread to other networks during the next few years.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> Demand for YouTube ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) and Snapchat Video Ads Marketing dollars pulled from TV will follow audiences .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Netflix has stated it is not interested in external advertisements , ad supported digital services <b>could</b> see accelerated growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>YouTube currently supports hundreds of millions of hours of video a day and is growing at 50% a year.2 Facebook just crossed 100 million hours a day.3 Snapchat serves eight billion video clips daily to its users.4 These three networks are well positioned to soak up the outflow of ad dollars from TV.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>ARK <b>believes</b> that Netflix will be a disruptive force in the media world for years to come .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Within the next few years , Netflix <b>may</b> become the dominant video subscription network both domestically and abroad .  (Uncertainty) </span>TV networks in the US that currently are hostage to high profit margins and legacy business models have said that they will make the transition to digital when it makes sense for their businesses.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By the time they make the transition , ARK believes it <b>may</b> be too late .
