spending on content by per year over the next five years which could lead to growth in viewing time per subscriber per year In this scenario the average US Netflix subscriber would watch three hours and minutes a day by vs two hours in a conservative estimate given the five hours of video on average Americans currently watch per day We believe TV executives should feel paranoid about the rise of Netflix NASDAQ NFLX At the current trajectory our research forecasts Netflix will become the largest US video network by With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime Video NASDAQ AMZN YouTube Hulu and a host of niche players also experiencing rapid growth streaming is set to become the new TV with a new set of winners and losers In Netflixs million US subscribers viewed an average of two hours of video a day At billion hours of viewing per year in total Netflix already is larger than networks like AE and Scripps but still is behind major networks like Time WarnerTWX and ViacomVIA Unlike linear TV networks that are constrained by a legacy business model fixed content window high margin structure limited data etc Netflix continues to grow both domestic subscribers as well as viewing time per subscriber Even if its growth were to moderate ARK believes that Netflix will surpass the largest TV networks soon To estimate Netflixs US subscriber growth ARK plotted its US broadband penetration and applied a logistic regression or S Curve The logistic function effectively shows the three stages of technological diffusion rapid early growth steady growth and eventual saturation It reflects Netflixs US subscriber growth particularly well predicting penetration or million subscribers and growth by as shown in the chart below To fuel its global expansion Netflix anticipates spending billion on content in or more than in If such content is successful in attracting and appealing to viewers it should drive both subscriber growth and the engagement viewing hours of existing subscribers ARK expects that Netflix will increase its spending on content by per year over the next five years which we believe could lead to growth in viewing time per subscriber per year as detailed in the chart below In this scenario the average US Netflix subscriber would watch three hours and minutes a day by vs two hours in a fairly conservative estimate given the five hours of video on average that Americans currently watch per day If Netflixs subscribers grow to million and their viewing time increases to three hours and minutes a day Netflix will deliver billion hours of video a year which is more than any US multichannel TV network excluding sports In the chart below ARK depicts the total hours of video delivered by various US TV networks since against Netflixs estimated video delivered over the next five years If TV viewership were to remain constant which ARK believes would be a conservative assumption Netflix would eclipse the largest TV network by This scenario however is likely too optimistic for TV The migration of viewers from TV to online has caused TV viewing to decline for the last five years especially among younger viewers People who used to pay for a cable or satellite TV service also known as cord cutters or cord shavers and those who have never subscribed to a traditional payTV service or cord nevers are driving a secular trend that we believe will erode TV viewership more dramatically over the coming years Given this cannibalistic scenario ARK believes that Netflix could become the largest US TV network as early as If Netflix were to become the most watched US network by what will the ramifications be for the media industry While becoming the most watched network would be significant Netflix is using the US as a launching pad to become the worlds largest global subscription video service With million projected subscribers worldwide by Netflix will gain incredible leverage and content buying power ARK believes that in Netflix could spend roughly billion on content twice the outlay of Time Warner this year Already TV networks are struggling to keep up with Netflixs content purchasing power By if Netflix has the largest global subscriber base we believe traditional TV networks may no longer be able to put in competitive bids and as a result might surrender the rights to the best shows to Netflix and <span

advertiser defection Viacoms NASDAQ VIA US advertising revenue declined throughout We think similar declines likely will spread to other networks during the next few years More Demand for YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Facebook NASDAQ FB and Snapchat Video Ads Marketing dollars pulled from TV will follow audiences Although Netflix has stated it is not interested in external advertisements ad supported digital services could see accelerated growth YouTube currently supports hundreds of millions of hours of video a day and is growing at a year Facebook just crossed million hours a day Snapchat serves eight billion video clips daily to its users These three networks are well positioned to soak up the outflow of ad dollars from TV ARK believes that Netflix will be a disruptive force in the media world for years to come Within the next few years Netflix may become the dominant video subscription network both domestically and abroad TV networks in the US that currently are hostage to high profit margins and legacy business models have said that they will make the transition to digital when it makes sense for their businesses By the time they make the transition ARK believes it
