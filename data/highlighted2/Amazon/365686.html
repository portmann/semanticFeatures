( NASDAQ : AAPL ) | Seeking Alpha Big slowdown last quarter , estimates <b>may</b> be aggressive in the `` out '' quarters .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reports April 25th after the market close.The last quarter saw a meaningful slowdown that the company was concerned about.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Some of the issues <b>may</b> have been a pull-forward of sales .  (Uncertainty) </span>We think the main issue, however, is a need for innovation.We went back in time to see the impact of Steve Jobs' absence and return.In his absence from 1985-1997 the stock went from $.50 to $.80-.90 (in 12 years).In his return the stock went to $50 , over a 50-fold gain.After his passing the stock has doubled in about five years.There have been advancements but not the new wow product, yet.We think that he was the main impetus of innovation, which is not an epiphany.Business is an art of banking on key players and his business acumen was one of a kind.Apple has a strong team and strong developers, but Steve Jobs is missed.Google/Alphabet ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) are all strong competitors looking for market share of every category . Apple won through hardware innovation and keeping the software code in-house.Now other players are working fast to pass Apple on the software side, on openness, and ease of use for consumers and developers.If it happens, Apple turns back into a neat hardware pure-play, so they need to pick up the innovation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Smaller</i> and <i>thinner</i> is a hardware strategy , but not the high margin software gold .  (Surprise) </span>The company has focused investors on its services growth and its installed base of late.Core investors care about unit growth and topline growth.The installed base on its own is an impressive number but is looking in retrospect on what the company has achieved.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The services piece also is exciting but much <i>smaller</i> than overall iPhone revenues and can not , at this stage , make up for slowing iPhone sales .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>By the company turning attention to other legs of the business , it appears to be a sign that this leg ( iPhone ) <b>could</b> be in the later innings .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple has faced international <b>volatility</b> in the past but this one slowed the pace of revenues in a very short timeframe .  (Uncertainty) </span>Typically their products have held them strong through such headwinds, which was not the case this time.In total 66% of their business is overseas.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We 're guessing about half of that ( or <i>more</i> ) is from emerging markets .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the dollar 's recent weakness , some of the currencies <b>may</b> be <i>better</i> this coming quarter , but year-over-year they are still down big , which will continue to be a drag for them .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The currencies do not sound like the main issue, however.The economies are the main reason for the sales impact."Major markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, Australia, Turkey and the eurozone, have been impacted by slowing economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Their largest international market may be at <b>risk</b> after seeing weakness in January .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` Notwithstanding these record results , we began to see some signs of economic softness in Greater China <i>earlier</i> this month , most notably in Hong Kong . ''  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>`` We 've invested through economic <b>uncertainty</b> in the past and we 've always come out <i>stronger</i> on the other side . ''  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>`` We are providing a <i>wider</i> range for revenue than usual for the second quarter because of the <b>volatility</b> we are seeing in the economy and in the financial and currency markets . ''  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>After the report, street earnings estimates for the quarter came down but the year did not move much.The company blamed comparisons for some of the slowdown so we ran "two-year" growth numbers which combines the growth rates from this year and last year.The first quarter (Dec) did not show much of a two-year slowdown.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This coming quarter , the street numbers , which follow the company 's guidance , do expect a <i>bigger</i> two year slowdown , which aligns with their qualitative commentary that trends slowed <i>further</i> in January .  (Surprise) </span>Here's what they said about the 'out' quarters: "As you know, we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter and it's difficult for us to forecast economic and foreign exchange factors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , at this point , we <b>believe</b> the March quarter faces the most difficult year-over-year compare relative to the rest of the year . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>They imply that trends should pick back up after the March quarter as comparisons ease.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the year ago comparison do look <i>easier</i> after March , when combining it with the year before it actually looks a little <i>tougher</i> ( on a two-year basis ) .  (Surprise) </span>Given the headwinds, comparisons are not easy.iPhone units at flattish growth is uninspiring.Even if they maintain it or beat it, it is not strong.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The rate of change of FQ1 's slowdown is <i>more</i> severe than it has been in recent history .  (Surprise) </span>We'd guess there is even a chance iPhone unit growth can go negative at some point this year.That would be cause for concern.Short interest is low which speaks to a general lack of official concern.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most of the street <b>seems</b> to be recommending Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We would probably be at a hold rating but given our concern of the overall market , this is one story that could have <i>more</i> <b>risk</b> , thus a sell rating .
