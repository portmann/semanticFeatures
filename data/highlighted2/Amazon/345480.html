(Surprise) </span>Cisco is the lead in serving public clouds, HPE the leader in private, according to spokesman John Dinsdale.Each has about 12% of the market.Figures for the fourth quarter show a big rise for IBM (NYSE: IBM ), tying Dell, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) with a 7% share is the software vendor of choice) but Dinsdale said that gain should be disregarded."IBM always has a relatively huge fourth quarter," he told me."You can pretty much guarantee that the IBM numbers will drop substantially again for the first quarter of this year."One reason the market is so large is that even companies like Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , which build and install their own gear from parts , still use Original Design Manufacturers , or ODMs , for some of the work . The ODMs can bring in huge volumes of business, but they suffer from very low average selling prices and margins.Thus "private cloud now accounts for just over half the market, public cloud just under half," Dinsdale told me.This is a big part of the problem for the old computer hands.Customers have scaled to the point where they don't need them.This crushes margins.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Only a few companies , like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Alphabet ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , are large enough to use the ODM model , but now that it 's established <i>larger</i> public cloud players have a clear path to savings , and as they grow will use it . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>For IBM, which both builds cloud gear and has its own cloud, obtained through the acquisition of Softlayer, this means it gets little benefit from its improved integration skills.It is simply getting squeezed out on both ends.But Microsoft, which also runs a public cloud system called Azure, does not have this problem.Since it is supplying other clouds with software, not hardware, it does not sustain the same kind of costs as a supplier, while it benefits from the ODM model as both a builder and cloud owner.One thing I have written often here is that "hardware is software," meaning that while there remain chips, boards and racks, that's not where the profits are.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If I <b>could</b> draw one investment conclusion from the report , then , it is to buy Microsoft .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is not being drawn into the commodity margin spiral, it is maintaining a decent share in private cloud, and it is benefiting from public cloud economics.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>might</b> be why its price/earnings multiple is in the high 30s , while the P/Es of CSCO , HPE and IBM are in the low teens .
