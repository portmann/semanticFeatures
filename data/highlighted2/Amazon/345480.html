For IBM, which both builds cloud gear and has its own cloud, obtained through the acquisition of Softlayer, this means it gets little benefit from its improved integration skills.It is simply getting squeezed out on both ends.But Microsoft, which also runs a public cloud system called Azure, does not have this problem.Since it is supplying other clouds with software, not hardware, it does not sustain the same kind of costs as a supplier, while it benefits from the ODM model as both a builder and cloud owner.One thing I have written often here is that "hardware is software," meaning that while there remain chips, boards and racks, that's not where the profits are.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If I <b>could</b> draw one investment conclusion from the report , then , it is to buy Microsoft .
