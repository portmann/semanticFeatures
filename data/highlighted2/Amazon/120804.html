Estimates say AMZN hit of Black Friday sales of Cyber Monday sales in the US Hundreds of thousands of new Prime members signed up the key concern for AMZNs potential longterm profitability Complaints of Prime Day being about unsold inventory not alleviated as towels food containers among topselling items not enough AMZN hardware to meet demand With Prime Day come and gone both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and the investing community are taking stock on what was billed to be bigger than Black Friday If youre <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>it was a resounding success as order figures and consumer engagement eclipsed Black Friday with over orders per second a huge improvement compared to last years Black Friday sale If youre a consumer though it was a frustrating endeavor as Prime customers found that the best deals ran out by the middle of the afternoon and the sales were more reminiscent of a garage sale than the kind of quality of items people were expecting from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>So what is the official verdict from Prime Day While hard sales figures remain unavailable and new Prime subscription figures are spoken vaguely as hundreds of thousands of new members there is still enough information to sort out the real story from the positive and negative spin from Prime Days supporters and detractors The goal of Prime Day was to provide a shopping holiday bigger than the iconic Black Friday that occurs after Thanksgiving In terms of orders it achieved that with an improvement compared to Black Friday in products moved representing over million items bought across all participating countries In terms of sales while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has not released official figures for revenue independent analysis from ChannelAdvisor shows that Prime Day had of the sales from last Black Friday and of the sales from Cyber Monday in the United States suggesting between million and billion in revenues from the American market While a far cry from Alibabas NYSE BABA Singles Day its in line with what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can expect from Thanksgiving holiday sales once European sales are calculated which would signal that Prime Day was a success from a sales standpoint The supposed sales success of Prime Day might be tempered somewhat by the fact that many of the bestselling items were items like food storage containers and microfiber towels while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hardware like the new Fire TV stick and Kindles didnt have enough supply to meet the demand The lack of supply for hardware and pushing of unexciting merchandise adds to original suspicions that Prime Day was less about celebrating Amazons th birthday and more about moving unsold inventory at discount prices Social media analysts at Adobe were quick to point out that Twitter NYSE TWTR was negative towards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>on July up from the previous day while positive feedback was relatively unchanged at compared to the previous day In a seperate survey of US customers experienced sadness with Prime Day with many of the complaints over selection and a lack of customer support to address grievances with quick ending sales on electronics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>did announce that it moved over televisions and Boss headphones during the sale but it also praised the high sales of iRoombas and Lord of the Rings DVD box sets which doesnt exactly appease the critics even if the sales were strong across the board As soon as Prime was announced the main draw was going to be how many Prime subscribers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would get to sign up and everything else would be just gravy This matters more to investors because Prime members generate consistent revenue that isnt cyclical or dependent on days like Black Friday or Prime Day which generally means profitable quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>announced that hundreds of thousands of new members signed up for the free trial and others reactivated their memberships While the official numbers may not come out until Q ends which would also show how many became paying members once the day trial ends it is safe to say that this will generate tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue For a traditionally down quarter for online retail outlets this is both a sign of a strong quarter for the company as well as a way to generate momentum headed into the holiday season Despite the poor feedback sellers on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>were thrilled with the results of Prime Day as they were able to move merchandise during a traditionally sleepy quarter Sales were comparable to Black Friday and orders exceeded those from Black Friday so the claim that Prime Day would be bigger than Black Friday was at least somewhat fulfilled More importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has announced that this will become a yearly thing meaning that as time goes on bigger brands will offer quality items as long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is committed to working out the kinks with its lightning deals and having enough Kindles and Fire products to go around Additional subscriptions to Prime are set to net <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a huge new revenue source which in the past has meant profitability for a company with traditionally low profit margins meaning that the primary goal has been met even without hard numbers While the doubters will likely not be silenced especially when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>basically acknowledged the lessthanhighbrow items that got moved the most and the Internets mixed emotions to the sales day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is right to pat themselves on the back and has something to build
