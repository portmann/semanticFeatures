( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha AMZN concludes Prime Day with mixed reviews from the blogosphere , but strong sales numbers reported . Estimates say AMZN hit 97% of Black Friday sales, 60% of Cyber Monday sales in the US."Hundreds of thousands" of new Prime members signed up, the key concern for AMZN's potential long-term profitability.Complaints of Prime Day being about unsold inventory not alleviated as towels, food containers among top-selling items, not enough AMZN hardware to meet demand.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With Prime Day come and gone , both <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and the investing community are taking stock on what was billed to be `` <i>bigger</i> than Black Friday '' . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you 're <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , it was a resounding success , as order figures and consumer engagement eclipsed Black Friday with over 380 orders per second , a huge improvement compared to last year 's Black Friday sale . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If you 're a consumer though , it was a <b>frustrating</b> endeavor as Prime customers found that the best deals ran out by the middle of the afternoon , and the sales were <i>more</i> reminiscent of a garage sale than the kind of quality of items people were expecting from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>So what is the official verdict from Prime Day?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While hard sales figures remain unavailable , and new Prime subscription figures are spoken <b>vaguely</b> as `` hundreds of thousands '' of new members , there is still enough information to sort out the real story from the positive and negative spin from Prime Day 's supporters and detractors .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The goal of Prime Day was to provide a shopping holiday <i>bigger</i> than the iconic Black Friday that occurs after Thanksgiving .  (Surprise) </span>In terms of orders, it achieved that with an 18% improvement compared to Black Friday in products moved, representing over 34.4 million items bought across all participating countries.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In terms of sales , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has not released official figures for revenue , independent analysis from ChannelAdvisor shows that Prime Day had 97 % of the sales from last Black Friday and 60 % of the sales from Cyber Monday in the United States , <b>suggesting</b> between $ 750 million and $ 1 billion in revenues from the American market . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>While a far cry from Alibaba 's ( NYSE : BABA ) Singles Day , it 's in line with what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> can expect from Thanksgiving holiday sales once European sales are calculated , which would signal that Prime Day was a success from a sales standpoint . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The supposed sales success of Prime Day might be tempered <b>somewhat</b> by the fact that many of the best-selling items were items like food storage containers and microfiber towels , while <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> hardware like the new Fire TV stick and Kindles did n't have enough supply to meet the demand . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The lack of supply for hardware , and pushing of unexciting merchandise adds to original suspicions that Prime Day was <i>less</i> about celebrating <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's 20th birthday and <i>more</i> about moving unsold inventory at discount prices . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Social media analysts at Adobe were quick to point out that Twitter ( NYSE : TWTR ) was 13 % negative towards <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> on July 15 , up from 7 % the previous day , while positive feedback was relatively unchanged at 23 % compared to 22 % the previous day . In a seperate survey , 50% of US customers experienced "sadness" with Prime Day, with many of the complaints over selection and a lack of customer support to address grievances with quick ending sales on electronics.<b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> did announce that it moved over 47,000 televisions and 41,000 Boss headphones during the sale , but it also praised the high sales of iRoombas and Lord of the Rings DVD box sets , which does n't exactly appease the critics even if the sales were strong across the board . As soon as Prime was announced , the main draw was going to be how many Prime subscribers <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would get to sign up , and everything else would be just gravy . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This matters <i>more</i> to investors because Prime members generate consistent revenue that is n't cyclical or <b>dependent</b> on days like Black Friday or Prime Day , which generally means profitable quarters .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> announced that `` hundreds of thousands '' of new members signed up for the free trial , and others reactivated their memberships . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the official numbers <b>may</b> not come out until Q3 ends ( which would also show how many became paying members once the 30-day trial ends ) , it is safe to say that this will generate tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span>For a traditionally down quarter for online retail outlets, this is both a sign of a strong quarter for the company as well as a way to generate momentum headed into the holiday season.Despite the poor feedback , sellers on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> were thrilled with the results of Prime Day as they were able to move merchandise during a traditionally sleepy quarter . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Sales were comparable to Black Friday , and orders exceeded those from Black Friday , so the claim that Prime Day would be <i>bigger</i> than Black Friday was at least <b>somewhat</b> fulfilled .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> importantly , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has announced that this will become a yearly thing , meaning that as time goes on , <i>bigger</i> brands will offer quality items as long as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is committed to working out the kinks with its lightning deals and having enough Kindles and Fire products to go around . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Additional subscriptions to Prime are set to net <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> a huge new revenue source , which in the past has meant profitability for a company with traditionally low profit margins , meaning that the primary goal has been met even without hard numbers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While the <b>doubters</b> will likely not be silenced , especially when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> basically acknowledged the less-than-highbrow items that got moved the most and the Internet 's mixed emotions to the sales day , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is right to pat themselves on the back , and has something to build on for Black Friday , and for Prime Day 2016 .
