( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Dave Dierking , Get Smart , Get Wealthy ( 210 clicks ) There 's much hype around any Apple TV announcement at the September 9th event but for now Netflix is still the content streaming king .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Competing services like Hulu , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and HBO Now <b>could</b> all be viewed as either complementary to Netflix or not a direct threat currently . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple could provide Netflix 's biggest competition to date but it 's <b>unclear</b> what its original programming or the actual end product will look like .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft 's venture into content streaming was shuttered a couple of years back making Apple 's entry just slightly <i>more</i> murky .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix has still been delivering strong subscriber growth, will be launching into Japan shortly and has a number of international markets coming as well.Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) big Wednesday event is sure to capture most of the market's attention and will provide a good benchmark as to where the company is at technologically and what it plans to unveil in the future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An introduction of the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus is expected as well as the <b>possible</b> announcement of an iPad Pro .  (Uncertainty) </span>But Apple TV is what most want to hear about.Apple's decision to develop a video streaming service would obviously be a serious blow to a company like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) that is currently the alpha dog in that space and investors have been responding accordingly sending shares down significantly from all time highs.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While it 's easy to come up with reasons to be bearish on Netflix right now I 'm actually thinking that this <b>might</b> be a good time to buy Netflix shares on the cheap .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>You will find <i>more</i> statistics at Statista Its domestic subscriber growth is slowing as expected but the international markets are showing impressive gains .  (Surprise) </span>The company is about to enter Japan and has a handful of other new markets on the horizon that should help support growth.Netflix has managed to exceed subscriber growth expectations that last few quarters and there's not much reason right now to think that they can't continue this growth trend.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Increased competition will no doubt be a concern going forward with many <i>more</i> players entering the space but at this point it 's not as big a concern as one <b>might</b> think .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has its limitations on purchased content but it's won largely positive reviews for its original content.Everybody is quick to mention House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black but it also offers a plethora of other high quality content like Daredevil, Narcos and a slew of other comedies, kids shows, documentaries and specials coming over the next couple of years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's <b>unclear</b> how many people will subscribe for the original content but it 's content users wo n't be able to find on competing services .  (Uncertainty) </span>Also consider that many of these services aren't exclusive of each other.Hulu provides mostly television programming and can be easily viewed as complimentary to Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) offers a similar service to Netflix but not <b>nearly</b> the content . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Much has been made of new services offered by HBO, ABC and CBS but those services are still tied to a cable or satellite subscription in order to get the full benefit.Given their limitations, it's difficult to see any one of those services becoming a replacement for Netflix.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Most <b>could</b> , however , be considering complementary .  (Uncertainty) </span>Which brings us back to the Apple TV.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We probably wo n't know what the end product of Apple TV will look like for a while but it 's reasonable to assume that it <b>could</b> be a replacement for Netflix .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That 's assuming , of course , that Apple plans on creating original programming which while not yet confirmed is <b>probably</b> a safe bet .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple is sitting on a $ 200B cash pile and <b>could</b> easily purchase the streaming rights to just about any content it wanted .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>An environment where Apple is able to provide original programming , a <i>greater</i> content library and the heavily rumored gaming component <b>could</b> be a threat to Netflix .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But before that happens let's consider a few challenges that Apple has.First, the current Apple TV hasn't been a runaway success the way the iPhone and iPad have been.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's been <i>more</i> like the Apple Watch in that it 's a nice addition to the Apple ecosystem but not necessarily a game changer .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Second , an entry into the streaming video space still has the potential of being <b>risky</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) also ventured into content a couple years back before pulling the plug ( although to be fair Apple is much <i>better</i> positioned than Microsoft to succeed in this area ) .  (Surprise) </span>Third, it's still rumor at this point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple <b>might</b> very well still be a ways away from debuting the actual product .  (Uncertainty) </span>The concern with Netflix regarding the stock's overvaluation and its cash flow burn are very real and shouldn't be ignored.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 've argued that very point in the past but it <b>seems</b> like for the time being that Netflix trades on subscriber growth .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the meantime , I feel that Netflix stock in the short term has been unfairly beaten down in light of the Apple TV announcement and <b>could</b> present a buying opportunity .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Over the long term , time will tell who ends up winning in the streaming video space and Apple <b>could</b> very well end up being the winner .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the short term though, Netflix is still the king.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Other services have not yet provided meaningful direct competition to Netflix and Apple <b>may</b> not be providing it for some time to come .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While it 's <b>possible</b> that shares have yet to bottom in the near term , I feel that Netflix shares are on sale and would consider establishing a position here .
