trekking nearly two hours through dense jungle Brazilian government environmental special forces burst into a clearing where the trees had been sawn and a muddy crater dug an illegal gold mine on indigenous land in the heart of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The miners and gold were already gone scattered by the whir of helicopter blades but armed troopers in camouflage burned tents and generators When there was nothing left they moved on to the next The fiveday operation last week coordinated by Brazils environmental agency Ibama and Indian foundation Funai located air strips and destroyed barges used to transport equipment and supplies by the estimated illegal miners in the vast remote region At more than million acres million hectares the Yanomami peoples territory is twice the size of Switzerland and home to around indigenous people The land has legally belonged to the Yanomami since but miners continue to exploit the area sawing down trees and poisoning rivers with mercury in their lust for gold The mercury has become a growing cause for concern While miners once killed the Yanomami with guns or disease nearly percent of the population was wiped out in the s today the threat is the toxic liquid metal used to separate gold from grit A study published last month by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation a public biomedical research group found that in some Yanomami villages percent of residents suffered from mercury poisoning The results shocked experts who believe mercury is entering the food chain through fish in polluted rivers High mercury exposure harms the nervous digestive and immune systems can lead to impaired vision and hearing and can be fatal Last weeks raid was considered a success but Ibamas operation leader Roberto Cabral said the miners will probably be back The aim is to destroy their equipment Were not able to arrest them theres no space in the helicopter he said sweat pouring down his face in the middle of the steamy jungle When miners were caught they were grilled for information and released Beyond the equipment authorities have been hunting for clues on the illicit business interests behind the miners The regions remoteness is a constant challenge From a base in the Tepequm mountains on the frontier with Venezuela three helicopters flew the person team for an hour and a half to the banks of the majestic Uraricoera river From there it was another hour or two on foot cutting aside branches and wading through waisthigh mud to reach the mines It is expensive and rare for the arm of the law to reach this far It might become rarer still With Brazil suffering through its worst recession in a century Funais budget for was cut by percent while Ibama had its spending reduced by percent For Fiona Watson who works for the activist group Survival International and has campaigned for the Yanomami since any longterm solution must be based on having more people on the ground graver punishments and a focus on those hiring the miners and supplying equipment These miners are like ants Watson said They just keep coming back News and Media Division of Thomson Reuters Thomson
