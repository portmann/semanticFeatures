(Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>ADR ( OTCMKTS : TCEHY ) | Seeking Alpha While FB is widely seen as leading social platform , WeChat actually has a <i>better</i> product .  (Surprise) </span>WeChat ARPU also has demonstrated enormous upside.Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) most recent quarterly performance has been impressive.Quarterly revenues came in at $5.4 billion with $1.5 billion net income.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> interesting ( and valuable ) than the financial results though are Facebook 's usage stats .  (Surprise) </span>Monthly active users (MAU) grew 15% and reached 1.65 billion while Daily Active Users (DAU) reached 1.09 billion with a DAU/MAU ratio at an enviable 66%.Note that the DAU/MAU ratio is one of the most important metrics for product managers to track as it's an indication of how "sticky" an app is.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Here are some DAU/MAU benchmarks as reference : Also , Facebook 's ARPU ( Average Revenue Per User ) is worth a <i>closer</i> look .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Note that revenue is <b>almost</b> entirely from advertising .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Clearly , and not <b>surprisingly</b> , Facebook 's most valuable customers are in North America where incomes and advertising rates are highest .  (Surprise) </span>Asia-Pacific ARPU lags far behind.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As impressive as Facebook 's performance has been , Tencent 's ( OTCPK : TCEHY ) WeChat actually has a <i>brighter</i> future and , I argue , this is largely due to the <i>more</i> compelling product vision ( and execution ability ) of Allen Zhang , who launched WeChat in 2011 and currently heads Tencent 's recently formed WeChat Group .  (Surprise) </span>As seen in the chart below, WeChat has massive market share in China and still grew MAU at 29% in the most recent quarter.For those not yet familiar with WeChat (or weixin 微信 in Chinese), it started as China's WhatsApp, a social messaging app.However, since its launch in 2011, WeChat has steadily added features and functionality to become the remote control for the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese.For example , a WeChat user in China can ( and does ) book a car ride ( like Uber ( Private : UBER ) ) , transfer money ( like PayPal ( NASDAQ : PYPL ) ) , book plane or train tickets ( like Expedia ( NASDAQ : EXPE ) ) , buy goods online ( like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) ) and even make investments ( like WealthFront ) - but all without ever having to leave the WeChat app . Users can also use WeChat for booking doctor appointments, paying electricity fees or traffic fines.As of December 2015, WeChat has over a billion created accounts, 650 million monthly active users; with 70 million outside of China.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Much <i>more</i> impressively , WeChat 's DAU is <b>approximately</b> 570 million giving it a jaw-dropping 88 % DAU/MAU ratio .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As evidenced by its DAU/MAU ratio , WeChat actually has a much <i>stickier</i> app that it is operating at scale with hundreds of millions of users .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is because it is the first app to truly integrate online-offline capabilities of payment , e-commerce and a host of other functions that for many tech companies in the West , including Facebook , are still a <b>somewhat</b> far-off vision .  (Uncertainty) </span>One of the keys to WeChat's success is Zhang's ability to develop viral features to drive adoption and usage.A well-known example of this was the introduction of virtual red envelopes in Chinese New Year to leverage the tradition of offering monetary gifts during the biggest holiday in China.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The introduction of this feature resulted in <i>more</i> than 200 million users linking their debit cards to their WeChat account and 32 billion virtual red envelopes being delivered this past Chinese New Year .  (Surprise) </span>With respect to ARPU, WeChat is estimated to be at least $7.Furthermore, analysts at Barclays estimate that WeChat is valued at about $30 billion as a standalone business, or about $95 per user (versus the $19 billion and $45 per user that Facebook paid for WhatsApp).However, because of WeChat's do-it-all product philosophy, its ARPU still has tremendous upside.By way of reference , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's ARPU is estimated to be $ 323 while Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) is $ 182 . It's also noteworthy that WeChat has not seriously begun selling advertising yet and its current ARPU is derived from games and other value-added services (stickers, etc...Despite a still relatively crude advertising platform, WeChat is able to charge CPMs between $6 to $21 for Moments advertising (with a minimum buy of about $30,000) with brands such as Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) and Mercedes-Benz on board.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Zhang 's product strategy already has demonstrated WeChat 's ability to achieve an <b>almost</b> unimaginable level of user engagement .  (Uncertainty) </span>The revenue potential is also enormous as WeChat's ARPU of over $500 is not inconceivable.However, WeChat faces two key challenges to becoming the global leader in a mobile internet world: How much profit can it wring per user and can its do-it-all product philosophy be successfully launched in markets outside of China.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Profitability <b>seems</b> to be the <i>easier</i> problem to solve and WeChat is on the way to doing so ( e.g. fees for certain money transfers , <i>more</i> sophisticated ad buying platform , etc. ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The <i>more</i> interesting problem it faces is global expansion .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it is able to replicate its ecosystem outside of China , WeChat <b>could</b> easily be in the driver 's seat with Allen Zhang crowned as king of the mobile world .
