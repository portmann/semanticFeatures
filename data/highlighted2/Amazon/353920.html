class='textDiv'>India Rolls Out Red Carpet For Marketplace ERetailers But With Riders Seeking Alpha India announces foreign direct investment allowance in the online marketplace segment This is a red carpet for international players to tap into what will be a billion market in the next three years Of significance is the possible entrance of Alibaba in the form of a replication of their China model in India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is in a fix because of one of the riders to the announcement so its unclear whether they will take advantage of the new move The Indian Government yesterday announced the allowance of foreign direct investment FDI for online marketplaces but with several riders This new announcement is indeed gamechanging because it gives Alibaba NYSE BABA and other players a free run of one of the largest ecommerce markets in the world The riders themselves are possibly even more significant because they seem to encourage the likes of Alibaba more than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN or any other ecommerce company Lets see how that ties in with Alibabas target of reaching a Gross Merchandise Volume of Trillion RMB by A few days ago I published an article about how China had the potential to help them meet that goal but there were several challenges that had to be overcome First well see the key riders that will influence Alibabas and Amazons plays in this market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>already has a presence here as Amazonin and Alibaba already offers its Chinese sellers access to this market The riders however are what will decide how each moves forward The first rider is a major shift in online retail in India It was prompted by brick and mortar retailers crying foul over predatory pricing by the large etailers such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Flipkart We want to ensure that there is no predatory pricing by the ecommerce companies which will especially work to the detriment of the small retailers an official said Government also feels that if any portal is providing discounts on goods its holding then it amounts to inventorybased model which is in contradiction to the marketplace definition This will have a significant impact on the general tone of online marketplaces because etailers typically attract new clients through aggressive discounting and special deals that brick and mortar retailers just cant match considering their overheads The loss of deepdiscounting is likely to put online sellers on a level playing field with businesses that operate physical stores and it will be interesting to see how that in turn affects ecommerce merchandise volumes for each company Largest Sellers Sales Limit on Any Marketplace Capped at This is the rider that has the most bearing on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>because technically the portal is not a marketplace They buy a significant portion of their products or source them through a subsidiary they own This is how the model works in India More specifically Amazons JV Cloudtail India is the largest seller on Amazonin with nearly of sales coming from the JV Under the current scenario where things are actually working well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>they might even consider not taking the direct investment route in India and continue the status quo Though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>does not break out its India sales in the most recent quarterly earnings call the company said this In Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>India was the top ecommerce site in India throughout the very busy diwali shopping season including the shopping season according to comScore And sales by sellers in Q were greater than all of combined in Q The government announcement will take some of the shine away from Amazons success in India because it now gives Alibaba the opportunity its been looking for The end effect is that it gives Alibaba the leverage it needs to exploit the Indian retail market by creating a replica of their China model Until now the bulk of the business has been BB business to business and limited because of trade restrictions but a direct investment by Alibaba in India may see BC business to consumer growing as strongly as the potential for BB Though I dont see Alibaba necessarily opening warehouses in India essentially theyre still largely a marketplace for third party sellers I do expect the company to come out with an official statement very soon on their plans for India Investorspeak Amazons BABA Problem The bigger issue at hand here is that the Indian governments move will allow Alibaba to create synergistic partnerships with the myriad Indian companies that are vying for marketplace dominance This is what Alibaba excels at in China and India is culturally a very close match to the Peoples Republic This is the model theyve been perfecting at home and all they need to do is replicate it in India I dont see this as a major challenge for them to execute because theyve already got a foot in India with their investments in Paytm and Snapdeal for example But with a allowance on FDI I strongly feel Alibaba will soon come out with a masterful game plan to use India as its first overseas challenge against the globally present <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>This will not only be the ideal testing ground but also a huge validation for their business model If they can take their future India business as high as their home market it will quickly start replicating this in as many countries as possible gradually eating Amazons market share in bits and pieces all over the world The odds seem to be heavily stacked in favor of Alibaba and against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in the Indian market right now and what we see playing out over the next few years will set the tone for a global battle between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Alibaba Im also going to suggest that WalMart NYSE WMT should enter this space as part of its larger plans to exploit the growth in ecommerce around the world WalMart has been frustrated at every turn in their foray into India and this is a great opportunity for them to invest in India Considering that they have no experience in the online marketplace segment it might be a good idea for them to test the waters with a partial investment in a domestic company or go JV with a company that knows marketplace dynamics There are any number of options for them to pick from such as Flipkart which until Amazonin took over was Indias most visited ecommerce site They can later consider a full buy out if they see any signs of success The point is if WalMart doesnt seize the opportunity now their online business will end up being restricted to just a few countries with a fraction of the potential of China or India So why should Alibaba <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>WalMart or any other retailer consider this announcement as an open invitation a red carpet welcome with green flags furiously waving Indias total ecommerce sales currently stands at billion as of that is expected to grow to a staggering billion in the next three years It doesnt make sense for any retailer physical or virtual to ignore this announcement by the Indian government Its a rare opportunity that I think Alibaba will grab with both hands and WalMart should seriously consider As for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>they need to figure out whether they want to go this route or keep their deep discounting advantage and not invest in any Indian
