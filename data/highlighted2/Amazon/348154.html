(Uncertainty) </span>Usually that is an indication that the shorts will get their heads ripped off, but let's keep going.Ah, this is an interesting observation.Why are people bullish on the Nasdaq* (NASDAQ: QQQ ) but bearish on the S&P 500?Something does not click.What stocks are propping up the Nasdaq?<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Well , one of the primary culprits is Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) , but we will get into <i>more</i> of this a bit later .  (Surprise) </span>With a five percent weighting, it has been one of the major stocks propping up the Nasdaq.So, here is the concern.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Can the Nasdaq continue to climb <i>higher</i> while the S&P 500 continues to struggle along ?  (Surprise) </span>Below are two charts of Nasdaq and S&P 500.Usually, Nasdaq will lead then S&P 500 will follow.Don't interpret these as technical signals because they are not.In order to get back to previous levels, Nasdaq needs to move close to 300 points.However, the S&P 500 is at its previous levels.This pretty much aligns with the above sentiment of the indices, but it is an incomplete picture.Those who voiced their opinion really did not take the time to understand the correlations of both indices and how they impact one another.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now an interesting fact you <b>might</b> not know is that for every two points the Nasdaq moves , the S&P 500 moves one point .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It 's not exact , it 's an <b>approximation</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Now it begs the question - can the S&P 500 move an additional 150 points?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This would take the index from its current level of <b>approximately</b> 2030 to 2180 ?  (Uncertainty) </span>This would drive the S&P to new all-time highs.My conclusion is something is going to crack.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When we dig a little <i>deeper</i> , we have economically sensitive stocks such as Caterpillar ( NYSE : CAT ) continually declining .  (Surprise) </span>Now if the S&P 500 is a measure of the economy and the GDP has been declining, then the index should mirror Caterpillar.Unfortunately, that is not happening.The index level is being held by rising Nasdaq stocks such as Facebook.However, if Facebook is rising, does that mean the S&P 500 is being propped up by the famous FANG stocks?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These four stocks make up <b>nearly</b> a third of the Nasdaq weighting .  (Uncertainty) </span>As you can see, only Facebook and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) seem to have some life in their stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) <b>appear</b> to have lost their luster . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yes , correlations break down from time to time , and it <b>appears</b> this correlation has run its course .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Out of Facebook and Google , Facebook <b>appears</b> to be the outperformer .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given its weight and outperformance in the S&P 500 , it appears that Facebook <b>may</b> indeed be one of the primary culprits of this divergent market behavior .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , I can conclude that the S&P 500 is <b>perhaps</b> being propped up by the Nasdaq stocks with Facebook being one of the prominent ones .  (Uncertainty) </span>The rise and weights of these stocks are canceling out the effect of the decline in the economically sensitive stocks of the S&P 500 which is creating a slow grinding market.A select few stocks cannot continue to prop up the market for an extended period of time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Facebook cracks and other stocks that have similarly risen such as Google crack as well , the fall will be nasty .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Thus , it <b>appears</b> that the Nasdaq having room to run up 300 points is a facade as well .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is no <b>possible</b> way for Facebook to contribute a majority of the points necessary to boost the index by that amount .  (Uncertainty) </span>I have to reiterate that something has got to crack.On the bright side, it will realign the indices so you will not have such a divergent market behavior.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'm not sounding an <b>alarm</b> , but urging caution .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Cracks are starting to show , so it is <i>better</i> to be in the markets with caution .  (Surprise) </span>Now do I think the rally will end in the coming weeks?No, my reason is a simple one.In a few days we begin earnings season and typically stocks will get a boost.Facebook has done phenomenal in the past few quarters.Even if it misses earnings, the stock will still rally because it is has been in a sustained uptrend.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I would continue to be <b>cautious</b> through the remainder of the year given that this is an election year .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do not suspect the markets to topple this year because the Fed <b>appears</b> to have some political pressure on them to calm the markets even though it is not their job to give a hoot .  (Uncertainty) </span>*Note for the StockTwits I used the ETFs because they had decent number of followers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For the rest of the article , mentions of the indexes refer to the futures because they trade 24 hours and I feel are <i>better</i> representative of the market .
