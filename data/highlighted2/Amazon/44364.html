(Surprise) </span>Although there was a West Coast slowdown, the U.S. is a big country.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>`` I do n't have a good excuse for this hideous number other than that there was <i>less</i> business being done than we thought , '' said Cramer .  (Surprise) </span>The second factor is that the dollar has stopped gaining strength.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This sends the price of crude <i>higher</i> which will affect gasoline prices too .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The consumer will have to shell out <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> that oil hit the floor when it touched $ 43 in January .  (Uncertainty) </span>The third force is the Fed, which said it will raise interest rates later this year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on the Fed statement on Wednesday , Cramer said that , `` I thought it was dismissive of the economy 's weakness , but every word that the Fed puts out these days is subject to so much parsing that I want to <b>believe</b> it tried to take itself out of the equation . ''  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Cramer thinks that <i>higher</i> interest rates will have a negative impact on stocks .  (Surprise) </span>This means everything changes upside down and that is why airlines and retailers were hit hard as they are directly linked to oil.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Housing stocks were dumped as investors stayed away from all stocks that can be impacted by <i>higher</i> rates .  (Surprise) </span>Then there was lot of takeover talk on Wednesday.Starwood Hotels (NYSE: HOT ) said it would consider all options.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is code talk for saying that it is willing to sell itself , which sent both its stock and that of its competitors <i>higher</i> .  (Surprise) </span>Then there was a rumor that Salesforce.com contacted bankers to sell itself."This one's difficult for me to swallow and not just because Marc Benioff, the founder and CEO spent yesterday afternoon showing me a mock-up of the 60-story tower that he's building for his burgeoning tech team," said Cramer.He adds that the rumor of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) acquiring Salesforce is shocking given the $47B valuation of Salesforce.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` But , as I 've seen in my week out here in San Francisco , this is a city of dreams that do <b>sometimes</b> come true . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>If there is one thing Cramer has learned from being in San Francisco, it is that there is a lot of venture capital flying around, so that anyone can start a company.The main question is what to do with these companies once they go public.This is exactly what is needed now."I have been talking to too many businesses that I would salivate to snap up and put together if I were running a huge company, that can borrow money for next to nothing or use its stock to make acquisitions," said Cramer.Cramer has a solution to what these companies should do.For instance, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - which is sitting on too much cash right now, has superb search capability, and has an asset called YouTube which is not making money - should buy its partner Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ).This is logical given the fact that Twitter's management has not figured out a way to monetize its product.Then Google should buy rights for every major sporting event and stream those on YouTube with commentary coming from Twitter.Then it should charge a licensing fee to companies with employees who tweet and create some vicious commercial revenues.This will fulfill the significant social component that is missing from Google.Next is Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) and Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN ), which are desperate for growth.Yahoo has a lot of cash and stakes in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Yahoo Japan.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Priceline is also <b>anxious</b> to expand .  (Uncertainty) </span>"Either company should take advantage of what I see going on in San Francisco, which is algorithmic delivery of product," said Cramer.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If it were up to Cramer , he would merge GrubHub ( NYSE : GRUB ) with Postmates and Instacart to create a one-stop shop to have anything you want delivered to your door with one simple app .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even Yelp (NYSE: YELP ) can be acquired to have the reviews right in the app for the store from which the order is being placed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As an owner of a restaurant , Cramer believes that GrubHub-Postmates-Instacart-Yelp combo <b>could</b> bring out the value for either Yahoo or Priceline .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` Not all of these companies are sellers , but with cheap money , Yahoo or Priceline <b>could</b> make a Godfather-style offer they ca n't refuse , '' said Cramer .  (Uncertainty) </span>With a week in San Francisco, Cramer decided to check one of the most innovative companies, called Postmates.It is a private company that provides on-demand delivery service for 67 markets around the country.It is like Uber for couriers because you can use its mobile app to get anything delivered in under an hour for a small fee.While Postmates is still private, it has already bagged deals from large players like Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) and Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ) ( CMG.B ).Cramer interviewed co-founder and CEO Bastian Lehmann to discuss Postmates.Lehmann mentioned that the Chipotle deal happened after Starbucks.Postmates is helping businesses deliver products right to a consumer's doorstep."The idea behind Postmates is what if you can use the city as a warehouse," said Lehman.Rather than the energy it takes to ship an item from out of state through an online purchase, clients can now find a store locally that will deliver the product through Postmates.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>could</b> be beneficial for small businesses that can not compete with the likes of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Postmates provides opportunity for employment as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If someone is interested in working for Postmates as a courier , they can apply online and if they are selected , the company will do an orientation with a car , scooter or bike and then they join the team .  (Uncertainty) </span>"It's America's best part-time job.That's what it is.It is very complementary income to another job that you are doing," said Lehmann.He also added that Postmates is unique because it matches the insurance that both Uber and Lyft currently offer.That is $1M liability insurance on both sides regardless of whether couriers are in a motorized vehicle.Should gold be bought physically or via ETFs?Cramer recommends buying physical gold and depositing in safety boxes.But those who cannot afford should buy SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: GLD ).Dupont (NYSE: DD ): "I think Dupont needs Trian's help."<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Should <i>higher</i> interest rates be considered as a sell for the Dow ?  (Surprise) </span>Cramer said that when interest rates go up, stocks with high yields tend to go down.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Jim Cramer s Action Alerts PLUS : Check out Cramer s multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks <b>could</b> be HUGE winners .
