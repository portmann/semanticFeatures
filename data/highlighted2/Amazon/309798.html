Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.Great.And then last question.When you break out the recurring and non-recurring revenues, is the activation revenues that are transactional those you include under recurring, correct?Karen L. Rosenberger - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP Yes, it's transaction and subscription on the recurring side.Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.Okay.So when we see year-over-year recurring growth relatively low this quarter that includes the impact of potentially what was a pretty weak quarter in transactional volumes at carriers, is that correct?Stephen G. Waldis - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer That's correct.That's absolutely contributory (46:19).Most of the â€“ and on the international specific one, it was all transactional revenue that would have been coming into the equation that's pushed out a little bit.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Had that come in , if you just did the math , you 'll end up seeing <i>stronger</i> on the recurring side as well .  (Surprise) </span>Thank you.The next question is from Gray Powell of Wells Fargo Securities.Your line is open.Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, guys.Thanks for taking the call.I just have one question with 27 subparts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Okay , <b>maybe</b> to start off , can you give us a sense as to linearity of the activation business in 2016 ?  (Uncertainty) </span>I think you said 5% growth for the full year.It declined 1% in Q4.So does guidance imply something like a high-single-digit exit rate in 2016?Karen L. Rosenberger - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP Yes.By the end of the year that would be the case.Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay, great.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And then just <i>longer</i> term for that business , you are kind of still thinking of it as sort of like a high-single-digit growth rate .  (Surprise) </span>Stephen G. Waldis - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yes, we haven't provided a high-single-digit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It could go to the low-double-digit growth <b>depending</b> upon how successful we are internationally .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The other component it does create across the industry as you probably saw is when there 's a new device that 's launched and it 's a new form factor , like , if you look at 6 ( 47:39 ) , which is relatively same device versus the transformational was one last year , and then as you move to a new form factor , it does have a big jump-up , so you can get into the -- to have an impact to us to <b>maybe</b> push us into the low-teen range , but that 's a fair way to think about it , Gray .  (Uncertainty) </span>Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay, great.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And then just one <i>more</i> if I <b>may</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Can you talk about the pace of growth of your non-Verizon cloud customers in 2015 relative to the total Cloud business?Stephen G. Waldis - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yes.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>So I think the way to describe the reaction in 2015 was it was <i>more</i> on execution .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In other words , we had a lot of accounts that -- especially some of the <i>newer</i> ones -- that we won late in the year that we 're moving online over the ones that we got through our F-Secure acquisition of those assets .  (Surprise) </span>We're really around getting them not to scale on the old infrastructure, but to get them to scale on our own (48:26) infrastructure going forward, which is why I think we're continuing to see the benefits of the margin profile in our business.And so that was successful.So we looked at it as not high growth, frankly, in 2015 or not high growth from now to mid-2016.It's really once these have finished migration and the marketing programs go up, now we've got them in the right infrastructure virtualized on our platform and we can really get the economics to scale towards the end of year.So we've focused exclusively on getting them migrated into an environment that we know has an operating model that we can make good margin expansion on, and then scaling those in the latter half of the year so that we think of our exit run rate very similar to our first year at Verizon as a really good indicator exiting the year as we set the stage for 2017.And all of those remain on track as we speak.Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay.That's helpful.Thank you very much.Hi, just a question on the Verizon partnership.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It sounded like you mentioned that they <b>could</b> potentially be rolling out to their wireless consumers and offering ( 49:32 ) it sounds like you <b>could</b> use it in like online e-commerce transactions for consumers and things of that nature .  (Uncertainty) </span>So how big is the opportunity outside of the enterprise market on the consumer side for this type of offering.Stephen G. Waldis - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yes.So without getting obviously any specifics around Verizon, I can say that the consumer offering's really the large play.Certainly the enterprise adoption is good and it gets us additional customers, and honestly it's a good pull through for secure mobility suite, because as you authenticate on a network and again you partner with companies like AT&T or Verizon and you can extend some of the Lagoon capabilities in the network, which no other mobile security vendor is going to have that capability.It's a definitely high pull through.The real big play, though, to your point is absolutely in the consumer market.As people have multifactor authentication, the concept is that you create this passport of your information that's not just works at Verizon, it works at banking, it works at the grocery market.It really allows you to go really broad in doing all kinds of B2B and B2C transactions.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And ultimately what 's exciting for us is we <b>believe</b> we 'll get critical mass at a fraction of the cost that others have to do to try to get there based on these venture .  (Uncertainty) </span>Tom Roderick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.Hey, guys.Quick follow-up question, a little bit philosophical here.But you've done a lot of great things to build the business longer-term in the past year, particularly the last kind of six months.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cloud 's doing what you wanted to do it , it 's exceeding expectations , <b>perhaps</b> a little low on the activation business .  (Uncertainty) </span>And you said on over $200 million in cash and equivalents here.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>With the stock where it 's at , where is your head at with respect to trying to create or unlock a little bit <i>more</i> value in the business , <b>perhaps</b> thinking about a stock buyback ?  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>How do you think about other ways to add shareholder value with the stock where it's at right now?Stephen G. Waldis - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yes.So, hey Tom, it's Steve.So we look at all kinds of ways to add incremental value to all of our shareholders.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We certainly have discussed internally buybacks as well as that cash to us allows us to quickly move into other areas , whether we want to get <i>more</i> aggressive on our M&A front .  (Surprise) </span>So there's other types of kind of strategic things we think about in terms of growing the longer-term value.What's been important to us is I think we've demonstrated that when we went from activation to cloud that we made some investments and got it to scale and the business continues to perform well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And really at the end of the day I <b>believe</b> that the biggest initiative at the company is to focus on going forward is really diversifying our customer base into new markets , and that 's a big reason why the enterprise play makes a lot of sense .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>And as I had mentioned <i>earlier</i> , the other factor to that had to be that we <b>could</b> find a way to make our core communication service providers partners in that business .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>And I think you see the announcement today with Verizon exemplifies that we're implementing that strategy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And so when I think about the forward view and how to deploy capital and share buybacks and different things , we are absolutely focused on growing that core business , but absolutely taking investments this year that you see from the dilutive effect of these two things and invest those into the future , so that three years from now we <b>believe</b> for our shareholders , if we had $ 200 million plus revenue opportunity across 50 large enterprise accounts with a much different margin profile , we <b>believe</b> that the value that the company would get would be dramatically different than where it is today .  (Uncertainty) </span>And given that, we want to make sure we have enough capital to be able to make those aggressive moves to quickly climb up that scale for long-term value.And so we try to balance that with the need to also be conscious of our shareholders and conscious on the needs and the benefits that a buyback would give us and it is absolutely a big discussion that we have at our board level every time.Thank you.And there are no further questions in queue at this time.I'll turn the call back over for closing remarks.Stephen G. Waldis - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Great.I just want to thank everybody for joining us on our call today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.Thank you.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You <b>may</b> now disconnect .
