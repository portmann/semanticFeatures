class='textDiv'>With Target And WalMart Website Problems Bad News Is Good News WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT Seeking Alpha One of the key focuses of WalMarts NYSE WMT revitalization effort is to increase its online relevance Thats no different than what most brick and mortar stores are looking to do including direct competitors like Target NYSE TGT So its easy to read the news headlines of website troubles on cyber Monday as a bad sign but it probably isnt as bad as the media would have you believe In fact its more appropriate to see the trouble as growing pains Theres no question that shopping habits continue to change A big part of that has been the Internet a relatively new shopping alternative which has seen impressive sales growth Note however that not too long ago the Internet didnt exist as a shopping alternative at all so the growth has been off of a low base At some point the law of large numbers will take over and growth will slow But here and now the Internet is an increasingly important sales channel Unfortunately many retailers were slow to catch on to the looming importance Which is exactly why retail giants like WalMart and Target are playing catch up to Internet behemoth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN a company that was little more than a startup at the turn of the century But with early and heavy spending <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the goto online retailer for many people It is one of the few ubiquitous Internetonly retail stores on the web Its going to be hard for WalMart and Target to catch up to that But thats a far cry from saying they cant or that they wont create very respectable online businesses while they try Its worth noting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recently opened a physical store proving that there just might be life beyond the Internet And dont forget that while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has created a very valuable business profitability has sometimes been a touch and go issue because of the nearly constant growth spending to stay ahead of a longlist of diverse Internet trends retail is just one piece of the puzzle at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>The companys valuation is built largely on the promise of what its business can do not on what it has delivered For example its PE is nearly right now WalMart and Target are companies that have decades of success behind them and long rewarded shareholders with such mundane things as annual dividend increases So when Targets site puts up a screen that asks customers to hold on while it deals with too much customer traffic and WalMarts site leaves customers unable to complete sales it may not be as bad as it seems Yes these two companies likely lost out on cyber Monday sales But so did a whole host of budding online players The list reportedly includes Victorias Secret Foot Locker NYSE FL and Neiman Marcus Even online payment service PayPal NASDAQ PYPL was noted to have stumbled on high demand So WalMart and Target arent the only ones who didnt do as well as they might have hoped service wise They are just two eye catching names that the media like to throw into headlines and push across the lips of their talking heads But heres the positive spin Target and WalMart have been making a concerted effort to increase their online presence So they geared up for cyber Monday pushing their sales hard in an attempt to draw a crowd They succeeded In fact they did such a good job that theyre online sites were overloaded with customers Should WalMart and Target along with many others have been better prepared Perhaps But that doesnt mean that their online efforts were failures Far from it they succeeded beyond expectations That proves that even old brick and mortar stores can be relevant online Which is essentially what WalMart has been saying throughout its catch up effort While I have my own concerns about WalMarts ability to handle all of the changes its set out to accomplish the Internet is just one part of a bigger makeover Im not suggesting WalMart is wrong about the online prospects for major retailers like itself Both WalMart and Target have massive distribution networks a physical presence for customers economies of scale and perhaps more important existing relationships with customers off of which to build These are very real benefits that can be used to grow an online business But WalMart and Target are both giant ships that are slow to turn They are starting the process in earnest now Receiving so much online traffic that they had trouble handling the load is a good sign that their efforts are taking hold So when I see Amazoncom running smoothly through cyber Monday I dont think anything about it The online retailer has had years of experience When I see WalMart and Target stumbling on the day I first think its bad But then I remember that they stumbled because they got more traffic then they expected and thats good news for a pair of retailers trying to jump start their Internet businesses And when you look more closely at the stocks Id rather own WalMart trading at a trailing PE of around or Target with a trailing PE of than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its PE of nearly Will it be hard for Target and WalMart to become Internet giants Yes Is it impossible No And even if they never unseat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>they dont need to They simply need to keep growing their online businesses so they can keep their existing customers in the fold online and off This is of course just one aspect of WalMart and Target Theres a lot more to know about each company That said youll want to keep a close eye on whats going on online because it is increasingly important for each of these retailers But dont get too caught up in the headlines because all bad news isnt bad This
