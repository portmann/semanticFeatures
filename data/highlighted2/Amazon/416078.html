year Many financially solid retail companies are paying plus dividends Brickandmortar stores are not going the way of the buggy whip As the new millennial world turns toward theoretical total <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN domination the real world continues to have shoppers shopping Retail businesses that have survived for decades against cutthroat competition are not going to roll over and give all their business to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Au contraire Retailers are responding to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and others by lowering prices offering free delivery and making returns easier and easier Plus they are upgrading their websites to be more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>like Contrary to what Jeff Bezos thinks none of this is rocket science Its a downinthegutter knife fight and do not underestimate the guys who have the sharpest knives What this means is there is a ripe opportunity approaching to buy solid financially strong retailers who have dividends above and who will more than hold their own against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and its ilk going forward The end of traditional retail is not only not near at hand it is not in sight In this article I outline the top retail stocks paying more than a dividend As you can see by the chart below retail spending has been going up pretty consistently for at least the last four years So the problem is not the consumer However the department store portion of retail sales has been going down And the ecommerce portion of retail sales has been going up although it still represents a rather small share of total sales up only about since If you look at Amazons latest Q on page you can see net sales not including AWS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services was billion and profit was million or about AWS kicked the most at million And though you could argue that AWS services to retail customers is a retail sale it is a kind of sale that does not compete with brick and mortar retailers In reality AWS competes with cloud companies like Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and IBM NYSE IBM Because retail is so seasonal you need to look at trailing months figures to get applestoapples comparisons As you can see in the following chart Amazons financial metrics are so out of whack compared to the five highdividend retail stocks I chose that one would have to be a true believer to think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is the best choice going forward So you can buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>a stock with no dividend no stock buybacks and a PE of almost or you can buy a basket of stocks with an average dividend over buybacks in place and an average PE of Best Buy NYSE BBY is a good example of comeback retailers In Best Buy looked like it was on the ropes Competitor Circuit City had bit the dust a few years earlier and many thought BBY was next a lumbering billion company that could not compete with all the new online electronics resellers especially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Best Buy hired a new CEO revamped their stores and enhanced their customer service policies to attract and keep new customers Well they not only survived they thrived going from a billion loss in to a combined billion profit in and Yes their sales shrank from billion in to billion in but by eliminating marginal items they increased their profits significantly From a close of on Dec th they soared to a high of on Nov th They never cut or dropped their dividend and in fact paid special dividend of in both and Current dividend rate of cents is up since the gloomy days of If you add the special dividend Best Buys dividend rate jumps to So yes you can make a lot of money while collecting your dividend by buying highquality retail stocks when they are beaten down About the same time BBY was at its low <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>was at I had a great urge to short AMZN feeling it was in nevernever land and was due to drop precipitously Fortunately for my wallet I resisted that urge and went back to more mundane stock picking that involved somewhat logical pricing schemes The idea that it would be over less than four years later never entered my mind Jeff Bezos says his rocket ship can go to the moon and maybe his stock can too but odds are against it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a history of good quarters and bad quarters with an inconsistency in profits that has to be frustrating even to the most ardent AMZN bulls And although AWS has added a new dimension it is the retail component that really hasnt changed much And the old retailers have a chance to learn good lessons from AMZN especially in the areas of customer service and online selling skills Those skills are not rocket science and Best Buy has proven that you can learn how to compete with the online retailers if you apply good management techniques The retailers I chose to compare to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>namely Kohls NYSE KSS GAP NYSE GPS Best Buy Pier NYSE PIR and Guess NYSE GES all have experienced management continuing profits stock buybacks and an average dividend of over If you are patient and willing to sit back and collect what I think are safe dividends you could benefit from significant price appreciation over the next year or two As for Amazons price I do not even know what to say I was wrong before and maybe the price is going to but it seems to me the other high quality retailers offer safe odds and a good return while you
