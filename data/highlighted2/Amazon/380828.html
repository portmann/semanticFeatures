This is not something that it likely to change soon.Netflix said on its last earnings call that it will start generating some substantial positive cash flow in late 2017.This would be something which investors will be looking closely at.Netflix stock is down 6.5% YTD, though it has been rallying strongly since February and is now 30% above its February lows.Click to enlargeThe stock has just broken out of the 100- and 200-day range, which means that if we see a beat we can see this sail up to $120 and then continue back to its year-high of $130.However, a miss would send it back to the 30-50 day range between $100 - $96.So from the technicals we see that the risk-reward is gains of $9 - $19 on the upside and losses of ($11 - $15) on the downside.Tagged: Services , Music & Video Stores, Earnings</div></body></html>
