( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha AMZN will report on the 23rd with consensus expecting - $ 0.14 in EPS and $ 22.37 b in revenue . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Prime ecosystem <b>could</b> gain further traction , a negative to eBay .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) will report its quarter on the 23rd . Consensus expects a loss of $0.14 and $22.37b in revenue.Heading in the quarter, I will be focusing on the status of the Prime ecosystem and performance of the AWS segment.Judging by the solid performance we saw from both segments last quarter, I would remain bullish on AMZN shares.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For Prime , the ecosystem is gaining traction in North America and I <b>believe</b> that the <i>higher</i> penetration over time will make AMZN a <i>stickier</i> ecommerce platform , which will be a negative for rival eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>One interesting data point is the recent Prime Day when we saw sales on that single day surpassing that of Black Friday.It is quite impressive given that Prime Day was limited to AMZN Prime users rather than all the consumers.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The idea of Prime shoppers generating sales that was <i>more</i> than that generated by both Prime and non-Prime shoppers on Black Friday is simply mind boggling and it really highlights the stickiness and the adoption of the Prime ecosystem .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The combination of cloud service , online video and two-day shipping already offer the consumers significant value-add , and I <b>believe</b> that AMZN will continue to expand Prime services similar to that of Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) adding services such as Music and potentially web TV to strengthen its ecosystem .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One area that AMZN <b>could</b> consider is the potential entry into wireless services by becoming an MVNO similar to Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) by offering Prime members an additional wireless service on AMZN 's own smartphone .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This will not only allow <i>higher</i> ecosystem penetration but also would be accretive to AMZN 's hardware initiative .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While I agree that the first <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> phone was not as successful as expected , I believe that the added wireless service <b>could</b> be an attractive value proposition . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Recall that last quarter <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's AWS sale was significantly <i>higher</i> than its second largest rival , Microsoft Azure , which had around $ 700m in sales last year . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> importantly , AMZN was able to achieve 14 % operating margin despite the competitive price war among the cloud service providers .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given that pricing <b>appears</b> to be stabilizing , I expect AWS to accelerate its growth this quarter and when AMZN ventures deep into the SaaS market via its WorkMail application and Internet of Things services .  (Uncertainty) </span>Looking at the long term, pricing will likely to come down so one differentiator is the level of services and customer relationship that a vendor establishes over the years.AMZN has been building relationships with developers who trust AWS's reliability, functionality and ease of use.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With competition likely to increase in the long run , I <b>believe</b> that the relationships AMZN have accumulated will allow the company to ensure a stable market share .
