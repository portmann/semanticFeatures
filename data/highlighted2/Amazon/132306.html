( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha New voices calling FANG stocks like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> a bubble are mistaken . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>No company is <i>better</i> positioned to dominate new markets than Amazon.com . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>When it fails to seize opportunities is when you sell, not before.Considered the great publicist of Reaganomics in the early 1980s, Stockman later renounced the policy called "trickle down" by critics because he is, at heart, an Austrian economist , often seeing moral lessons in markets that, in my view, simply don't exist.Like many other writers here at Seeking Alpha , Stockman persists in seeing Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) as a `` bubble stock , '' one that is priced completely at odds with its intrinsic value , and is just waiting to be swept away in a general market downturn . He feels the same about the rest of the "FANG" - Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ).These companies have repeatedly made big moves up on earnings over the last year, absolutely huge moves.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The stocks work when nothing else <b>seems</b> to .  (Uncertainty) </span>He sees such moves as irrational exuberance - "absolutely reminiscent of final days before the tech wreck exactly 15 years ago."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>But I was covering technology 15 years ago.I warned about the tech bubble for three years before it finally popped, with the AOL acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ).(Remember that AOL stockholders got a majority stake in the resulting company.)This is not the same thing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The dot-bomb took down hundreds of stocks , and hundreds of companies , because the sector <b>could</b> n't keep all those balls in the air .  (Uncertainty) </span>These latest moves, being isolated in just a few stocks, are an acknowledgement of settled leadership, the idea being that these companies are now dominant in a sector of the market that is transforming the general economy.If you're looking for bubbles, I think you should look at biotech.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Stockman compares the FANG stocks with Cisco ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) , Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) and Juniper ( NYSE : JNPR ) , which peaked with the dot-com bubble and which , while they continued to grow , never recovered their <i>earlier</i> allure to investors and <b>may</b> never do so .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>He fails to understand that these companies ( he <b>could</b> have easily added Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) to the list ) subsequently failed in mobile , failed in cloud , and failed in devices , the industries that followed that of the basic Internet onto the stage .  (Uncertainty) </span>They were of the moment, they failed to see over the horizon.When the FANG outfits do the same, that's when you sell them.Not before.Stockman 's argument about <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , like that of others here , is based on the idea that profits are minimal , and so is free cash flow . In particular , he derides <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services , the cloud subsidiary that dominates cloud infrastructure . He fails to understand that infrastructure is to cloud what operating systems were to computers back in the day - that controlling the base of the market confers enormous, long-lasting advantages.By his reasoning, Microsoft was a bubble stock in 1995.Here's an example of what I mean.Netflix rides on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> infrastructure . This gives <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> enormous visibility into Netflix 's operations and opportunities , visibility it has used in building its own studio operation out of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw this possibility coming and spent billions of dollars to create a cloud infrastructure independent of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - <b>maybe</b> that 's why <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is n't <i>more</i> competitive in social . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( <b>Maybe</b> that 's why I do n't own any Netflix . )  (Uncertainty) </span>I admit that , at its present level , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is fully valued . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But for all <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's current success , it has far <i>more</i> opportunities than the other FANG members to get <i>more</i> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is going to win in India . It's going to extend its lead with cloud into platforms and software.It is going to become a major studio.It will be able to monetize search in ways Google can't imagine.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The outfit is better-positioned than any other company to take advantage of the cloud-and-device era we entered five years ago , <i>better</i> positioned to take advantage of global urbanization , and for that matter <i>better</i> positioned for the Internet of Things era that will follow the current decade .  (Surprise) </span>I saw that when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was at $ 300 , and I 've profited handsomely . The market has now caught up.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At current prices , further gains <b>depend</b> on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> achieving some of the goals I 've mentioned . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>But generational leadership in business is a rare thing to see.I wouldn't have sold Exxon (NYSE: XOM ) short in the 1970s, I wouldn't have sold GM (NYSE: GM ) short in the 1930s, I wouldn't have sold GE (NYSE: GE ) short in the 1890s, and I'm not going to short FANG now.Source: Market Leadership Is Not The Same Thing As A Bubble Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, GOOGL.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
