(Uncertainty) </span>A comparative specs sheet reveals these two Lumia phones are geared toward affluent customers and enterprise clients.This is great because Microsoft has a bigger clout than Samsung on the U.S. enterprise market.I expect the Lumia 950 and 950 XL phones to be play an important role in selling more Snapdragon 808 and Snapdragon 810 processors.Microsoft's ambitious pricing for the 5.7-inch Lumia 950 XL puts it in direct competition with the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6S Plus and the Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Nexus 6P.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Slapping a $ 649 price tag showed Microsoft is <b>confident</b> enough to go toe to toe against the most expensive phablets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple is no <b>doubt</b> the undisputed champion when it comes to selling luxury gadgets .  (Uncertainty) </span>However, judging by Microsoft's pricey Surface Book laptop and new Lumia flagship phones, Nadella is only too willing to scrap it out with Apple's most expensive products.While Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) benefits from Microsoft's move to become a high-end laptop vendor, Qualcomm is the derivative beneficiary of Microsoft's aggressive push toward high-end Windows 10 high-end phones.The two Snapdragon-powered Lumia phones are fully compatible with Continuum for Phones.These makes them great alternatives to the Pocket PC concept of the Acer Jade Primo .The Jade Primo also has Snapdragon 808 inside it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Microsoft and Acer 's Windows 10 Mobile OS high-end phones <b>could</b> all function as desktop computers when docked to a monitor or TV set .  (Uncertainty) </span>The Microsoft Display Dock transforms Windows 10 phones into useful office computers.Microsoft made efforts to code its mobile Office apps and Outlook scale properly to give people real desktop PC-like productivity when using a Windows 10 smartphone.Continuum is a killer feature of Windows 10 phones that Apple or Samsung will find hard to match.Those two lack industry-standard software that is as powerful and famous as Microsoft's Office.I therefore expect more enterprise clients to favor the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL over other high-end smartphones that cannot function as pocket computers.Small and medium businesses will appreciate the cost savings of buying just a Snapdragon-powered Windows 10 phone instead of replacing their entire set of older desktop PCs.QCOM is a Buy.I'm now convinced this ARM-based fabless semiconductor company has a solid lock on Lumia phones.The economic benefits of Microsoft's move toward selling high-end phones is easy to comprehend.Instead of just supplying entry-level chips like the Snapdragon 400 for sub-$100 Lumia phones, Qualcomm will now be able to ride Microsoft's big need to sell its high-end $600++ Windows 10 phones.Microsoft sold tens of millions of its Lumia phones last year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , most of them are of the budget <b>variety</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Microsoft finally realized that its bad business to sell cheap Windows phones at a loss.Unlike Google , Microsoft still lacks the mobile advertising platform to make selling dirt-cheap hardware a winning proposition.Microsoft is therefore moving toward higher-priced phones.Qualcomm will supply Microsoft the necessary flagship-worthy Snapdragons to make next-generation Lumia smartphones remain competitive versus the best Apple and Samsung phones.Qualcomm shareholders would only truly appreciate Microsoft's loyalty once more higher-margin Snapdragons gets inside premium phones.The margin on a Snapdragon 810 v2.1 is obviously higher than that of the Snapdragon 400/410.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Please be aware of the <b>risks</b> associated with these stocks .
