(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Tim Cook's response to poor Q2 performance demonstrates the urgent need for a visionary leader to step in at Apple.A visionary leader thinks outside of the box and constantly utilizes what Howard Marks calls second-level thinking.Second-level thinking integrates complex, dynamic and bold approaches to problem-solving and idea generation well beyond traditional modes of thinking.Comparing Tim Cook to other tech sector leaders demonstrates the urgent need for Apple to find new leadership.Apple will only correct course once it brings in a new visionary leader like these other tech sector titans who continuously utilize second-level thinking to drive innovation and create growth.Tim Cook's response to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) poor Q2 results has been conventional.Instead of declaring the urgent need to innovate and create new channels of growth, Cook responded by increasing Apple's share buyback program by $35 billion and upping the quarterly dividend by 10%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This conventional response to Apple 's lack of growth is a tactic that <b>could</b> have been used by any average manager and demonstrates a lack of visionary leadership .  (Uncertainty) </span>To be fair, supporters of Tim Cook will readily point out numerous redemptive actions he is taking to deal with Apple's current set of problems.For example, Cook is actively responding to investor criticism and went on Jim Cramer's Mad Money to defend his actions.He highlighted how Apple had an "incredible quarter by absolute standards" noting sales of $50.6 billion for the quarter and profits of $10.5 billion.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Responding to Carl Icahn 's pessimism over China , Cook argued that the Chinese `` middle class is booming '' and that he `` could not be <i>more</i> <b>optimistic</b> about its future . ''  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In addition , Apple <b>could</b> continue to see growth in emerging markets like India .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Plus the share buybacks increase shareholder value and <i>higher</i> dividends attract yield-focused investors .  (Surprise) </span>On a basic empirical level, all of this sounds good and well.But none of this charts out a fundamentally new path for Apple's long-term innovation or growth.Instead it charts a path to continue growing iPhone profits and does not seriously or fully address the urgent need for new channels of growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Cook did hint at the <b>possibility</b> of a large acquisition , it is unlikely that any large acquisition will be the fundamental driver for new channels of growth .  (Uncertainty) </span>Ultimately, these actions fall neatly in line with my argument that Tim Cook is not a visionary leader.He is not offering investors a visionary plan to push Apple out of its current rut.Instead he continues to respond in conventional ways like focusing on increasing iPhone sales in emerging markets.Although the iPhone will remain Apple's bread and butter product for the foreseeable future, this will not be a radically new driver for innovation or growth.The various challenges facing Apple today can only be fixed with visionary leadership.The iPhone is now ten years old and Apple will eventually need a new driver of growth.This new driver of growth will come through visionary leadership.Apple needs a visionary leader to change course.Looking at examples of several tech sector titans helps demonstrate how critical visionary leadership is to forge a new direction for Apple.These successful tech sector titans help demonstrate the urgent need for a new visionary leader at Apple to jumpstart a new era of innovation and growth.Understanding visionary leadership and how this adds value to a company is critical to understand Apple's prospect.In fact, in the most significant criticism I received on my previous piece looking at the visionary leadership a commenter argued: To address these criticisms, the first point to unpack is what a visionary leader is.A visionary leader is an individual who thinks outside of the box and constantly utilizes second-level thinking.Howard Marks explains the difference between first- and second-level thinking in his book The Most Important Thing .First-level thinking is superficial and is conducted by your average manager like Tim Cook.Here a manager utilizes typical methods to improve a company's fate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For example , if a company has lots of cash and wants to increase shareholder value , a first-level thinker would follow the common strategy of instituting a share buyback program and <b>perhaps</b> increase dividends .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But this average way of thinking is what any manager <b>could</b> do and will not lead to innovation or outsized returns .  (Uncertainty) </span>In contrast, second-level thinking is deep, difficult, and oftentimes controversial.This is the defining characteristic of visionary leaders because they will do whatever it takes to ensure their vision comes to fruition.For example, in 1997 when Steve Jobs came back to Apple, he didn't follow any conventional framework to turn the company around.Instead he cut jobs, reduced product lines , and created a partnership with archenemy Microsoft.But these radical steps were taken in order to follow through on his vision to fundamentally turn around Apple.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>His success came from being unconventional , taking <b>risks</b> , and utilizing complex thinking to follow through on his vision .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What Apple needs right now <i>more</i> than anything else is a visionary leader who utilizes second-level thinking to move things forward .  (Surprise) </span>As the chart below from the Marks book illustrates, unconventional behavior driven by second-level thinking can lead to above-average results.The best companies in the tech sector today are led by visionary leaders utilizing second-level thinking to drive innovation.This thinking has led to excellent results, outsized returns, and strong investor enthusiasm.Comparing these companies with Apple helps illustrate the crucial need for new visionary leadership.Elon Musk is hands down the most visionary CEO of any company in the world today.Not only is he the CEO of both Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and SpaceX (Private: SPACE ), but he has an overarching vision for solving the biggest problems in the world today.As such, investors have bought into his vision for changing the world one car at a time.Investors continue to evaluate Tesla based on its potential in spite of massive capex burn and a current lack of profitability.At the same time he is running SpaceX and plans on sending humans to Mars in the 2030s.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although many question his tactics and theatrics , investors <b>believe</b> in him and continue to support his out-of-this-world initiatives .  (Uncertainty) </span>Jeff Bezos is arguably the second most visionary CEO in the world today.He has transformed <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) from a company originally conceived as an online bookstore to become an increasingly diversified online retailer and service provider . He notes in his shareholder letter this year how he wants <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to be `` a large company that 's also an invention machine . '' Because of this ethos , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is the fastest company to ever reach $ 100 billion in annual sales . And just like Musk, his private aerospace company Blue Origin (Private: BORGN ) continues to expand its space operations.Mark Zuckerberg is using Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) to create a new vision for the future.This future involves virtual reality and humans interacting with chatbots through the Messenger Platform.Even though Facebook trailed MySpace early on in its history, his visionary leadership has fundamentally transformed the company into the dominant social media platform today.It has gone from being just a limited social media network for college students to become one of the most important ways many people stay connected.All of this has led Facebook to achieve one of the highest valuations of any company in the world.Satya Nadella is different from the previous three tech titans because he did not create the company he now runs.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) used to be the biggest tech titan before being displaced by Apple.But since Nadella became CEO in 2014, he continues to utilize second-order thinking to reinvigorate Microsoft.Microsoft has found its mojo through Nadella's visionary leadership.His emphasis on innovation and new drivers of growth has led Azure to become the second largest cloud service provider on the market.In addition, the Windows 10 OS is a success and continues to be well-received .His leadership continues to impress investors who now view Microsoft as a strong growth company.Apple needs a leader who can apply the numerous lessons from these successful tech sector companies to help get out of its rut.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It needs a leader like Musk who can inspire investor and consumer <b>confidence</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>It needs a leader like Bezos who can continue to plow profits back into the company to ensure growth.It needs a leader like Zuckerberg to find innovative ways to grow its core competencies.It needs a leader like Nadella to create new products to drive future growth.The market recognizes the achievements of these visionary leaders.The last leader of this group to become CEO is Satya Nadella.If we compare the share price appreciation of each of these companies with one another since Nadella became CEO on February 4, 2014, the facts speak for themselves.In spite of the buybacks, dividends, the Apple Watch, and everything else, Apple has seen the least amount of share price appreciation with shares up only 30.6% since then.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In fact , Apple has seen even <i>less</i> share price appreciation than Tesla , which has yet to demonstrate profitability and even went through a round of dilution in 2015 .  (Surprise) </span>All of this demonstrates how value is added to companies with visionary leaders.These leaders drive new avenues of growth and innovation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This then translates into investor enthusiasm and <i>higher</i> share prices .  (Surprise) </span>Apple should recognize this and bring in new visionary leadership.Just like Microsoft brought in a visionary leader adept at second-level thinking, so too should Apple bring in a new visionary leader.All of these tech companies except Apple share the common feature of having visionary leaders at the helm.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Consequently all are trading at much <i>higher</i> multiples than Apple , have seen <i>more</i> significant share price appreciation , and investors continue to give these companies the benefit of the <b>doubt</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Apple <b>may</b> have needed Tim Cook to manage a transition from the Steve Jobs era , it now needs new leadership at the top .  (Uncertainty) </span>A new visionary leader who effectively utilizes second-level thinking is what will lead to a turnaround at Apple today.Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, MSFT, AMZN.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas, Technology , Personal Computers</div></body></html>
