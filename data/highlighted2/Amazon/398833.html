And just like Musk, his private aerospace company Blue Origin (Private: BORGN ) continues to expand its space operations.Mark Zuckerberg is using Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) to create a new vision for the future.This future involves virtual reality and humans interacting with chatbots through the Messenger Platform.Even though Facebook trailed MySpace early on in its history, his visionary leadership has fundamentally transformed the company into the dominant social media platform today.It has gone from being just a limited social media network for college students to become one of the most important ways many people stay connected.All of this has led Facebook to achieve one of the highest valuations of any company in the world.Satya Nadella is different from the previous three tech titans because he did not create the company he now runs.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) used to be the biggest tech titan before being displaced by Apple.But since Nadella became CEO in 2014, he continues to utilize second-order thinking to reinvigorate Microsoft.Microsoft has found its mojo through Nadella's visionary leadership.His emphasis on innovation and new drivers of growth has led Azure to become the second largest cloud service provider on the market.In addition, the Windows 10 OS is a success and continues to be well-received .His leadership continues to impress investors who now view Microsoft as a strong growth company.Apple needs a leader who can apply the numerous lessons from these successful tech sector companies to help get out of its rut.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It needs a leader like Musk who can inspire investor and consumer <b>confidence</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>It needs a leader like Bezos who can continue to plow profits back into the company to ensure growth.It needs a leader like Zuckerberg to find innovative ways to grow its core competencies.It needs a leader like Nadella to create new products to drive future growth.The market recognizes the achievements of these visionary leaders.The last leader of this group to become CEO is Satya Nadella.If we compare the share price appreciation of each of these companies with one another since Nadella became CEO on February 4, 2014, the facts speak for themselves.In spite of the buybacks, dividends, the Apple Watch, and everything else, Apple has seen the least amount of share price appreciation with shares up only 30.6% since then.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In fact , Apple has seen even <i>less</i> share price appreciation than Tesla , which has yet to demonstrate profitability and even went through a round of dilution in 2015 .  (Surprise) </span>All of this demonstrates how value is added to companies with visionary leaders.These leaders drive new avenues of growth and innovation.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This then translates into investor enthusiasm and <i>higher</i> share prices .  (Surprise) </span>Apple should recognize this and bring in new visionary leadership.Just like Microsoft brought in a visionary leader adept at second-level thinking, so too should Apple bring in a new visionary leader.All of these tech companies except Apple share the common feature of having visionary leaders at the helm.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Consequently all are trading at much <i>higher</i> multiples than Apple , have seen <i>more</i> significant share price appreciation , and investors continue to give these companies the benefit of the <b>doubt</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Apple <b>may</b> have needed Tim Cook to manage a transition from the Steve Jobs era , it now needs new leadership at the top .
