(Uncertainty) </span>Dugan's hire is of importance since she was an executive at Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), reportedly one of the best companies in the world to work for.Facebook has consistently attracted top talent, and has held on to many of its early employees that helped shape the company into what it is today.Mark Zuckerberg has created a corporate climate that employees seem to thoroughly enjoy, which is essential to reducing turnover.A report by Payscale discovered that 96% of Facebook's 13,000 employees report high job satisfaction.1.Its CEO is its Chief Recruiter - This factor is magnified by the celebrity status of Mark Zuckerberg, its founder and CEO.Compare this with Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ), one of the most recognized brands in the entire world.Despite its global brand power, I'm willing to wager that an overwhelming proportion of the population would be unable to name its current CEO.On the other hand, Zuckerberg is a household name and a visionary.He also doesn't have a college degree, and he's been disrupting the market continuously for the last decade.In short, he's the tech equivalent of a rock star.Zuckerberg applies a hands-on approach to recruiting his top talent, and it has paid off immensely.He also employs the strategy of acqui-hiring, which is acquiring a company in part to gain the employees and their talent.He has done this with Palmer Luckey of Oculus Rift, and Andrew Anker of Tugboat Yards.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>( Tugboat Yards closed shop once acquired so its employees <b>could</b> apply their expertise to initiatives within Facebook 's platform ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>2.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>More</i> Than Just a Cash Machine - Zuckerberg has made it explicitly clear that the goal of Facebook is to connect people .  (Surprise) </span>He lists the Connectivity Labs as one of his top three priorities for 2016.This department is responsible for Intenret.org, a program dedicated to providing internet access to impoverished areas.As a result, 25 million people have been brought online thus far by Facebook.Internet access has been shown to improve economic conditions and education, so Facebook employees can know that their work is having a positive impact.In addition to increased internet access, the social media giant is also working to by developing artificial intelligence to help blind people experience photos on Facebook's newsfeed.Lastly, Facebook's safety check feature has been utilized to keep families connected and informed about their loved ones.Throughout its business, Facebook is finding ways to incorporate positive social initiatives into its overall strategy.The current and incoming workforce are socially conscious, and this will be increasingly important in attracting talent.3.It Respects its Employees - Facebook knows that its employees are people, and it treats them as such.It is especially forward thinking in terms of maternity AND paternity leave, allotting four months off for such an occasion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While it 's true that other tech companies offer maternity and some paternity leave , it <b>may</b> be just a PR stunt and unrealistic in practice .  (Uncertainty) </span>For example , there are reports that an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) employee was `` effectively forced out following her maternity leave and cancer diagnosis '' . Zuckerberg has eradicated any thought of punishment for maternity/paternity leave by taking paternity leave himself after the birth of his first child.As the CEO, he is consistently setting the bar on how employees should be cared for by setting an example of himself.Overall, Facebook has received a rating of 4.7/5 on Glassdoor when it comes to general benefits.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This ranking is <i>higher</i> than both Twitter ( NYSE : TWTR ) and Google .  (Surprise) </span>As a result of the work environment, Facebook has the least stressed, most satisfied employees in the tech industry, as demonstrated in the chart below.4.Flexibility - For being a massive, multinational company, Facebook has demonstrated that it is still incredibly flexible with its employees.Because it places such a significant value on talent, it is willing to work with those it wants to hire or are already employed.For example , Zuckerberg wanted to hire Yann LeCun to run his Artificial Intelligence division, but LeCun did not want to leave his post at NYU.Zuckerberg offered to let LeCun set up Facebook AI Research's headquarters in Manhattan and retain his professorship on the side.Once this was communicated, LeCun agreed to come on board with Facebook.5.The Pay - When considering job incentives, all employees take into consideration their salary.According to a recent report, Facebook ranks as the 12th highest paying company in the world.Its median compensation package for its average worker is $150,000 a year.This ranks Facebook above LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ), to name a few.Facebook is also generous to its interns, ensuring that its farm-system of talent will remain exceptionally strong.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>According to Glassdoor , interns at Facebook make $ 6,000 - $ 8,000 a month <b>depending</b> on what their role is .  (Uncertainty) </span>By this measure, the average intern makes well above the average U.S. citizen.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When Facebook went public , one of the main concerns was that the social media company <b>could</b> meet the same fate of its predecessor , MySpace .  (Uncertainty) </span>To survive and thrive, Facebook needs to be constantly innovating and creating new products and services.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While Dugan 's new position at Facebook is still <b>unclear</b> , she will be leading a new group called Building 8 that will focus on creating hardware products related to Facebook 's mission to connect the world .  (Uncertainty) </span>As a former head of a few of Google's "moonshots" projects, investors can expect to see interesting developments coming out of Dugan's department.Facebook plans on investing hundreds of millions of dollars into this group, further promoting the notion that this group will become a key component of Facebook's business.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If executed properly , Dugan 's Building 8 <b>could</b> develop products that will seriously improve the bottom line for Facebook .
