Warren Strikes Back as Citigroup Tries to Blackmail the Democratic Party Yves Smith The Verge has broken an important story on how far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has gone in its relentless efforts to crush workers Despite its glitzy Internet image Amazons operations depend heavily on manual labor to assemble pack and ship orders Its warehouses are sweatshops with workers monitored constantly and pressed to meet physically daunting productivity goals Indeed many of its warehouses were literally sweatshops reaching as much as degrees in the summer until bad press embarrassed the giant retailer into installing air conditioners In Germany a documentary exposed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hired neoNazi security guards to intimidate foreign often illegal hires it had recruited and was housing in crowded companyorganized housing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also fought and won a Supreme Court case to escape compensating its poorlypaid warehouse workers for time they spend in line at the end of shift waiting for security checks Amazons latest keep workers down practice is to make temps sign noncompetes Yes if you are so desperate and foolish as to take a shortterm gig with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>you will be barred from working for virtually anyone else for the next eighteen months Look at how incredibly broad the language is in the noncompete agreement obtained by The Verge hat tip MF During employment and for months after the Separation Date Employee will not directly or indirectly whether on Employees own behalf or on behalf of any other entity for example as an employee agent partner or consultant engage in or support the development manufacture marketing or sale of any product or service that competes or is intended to compete with any product or service sold offered or otherwise provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>or intended to be sold offered or otherwise provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in the future that Employee worked on or supported or about which Employee obtained or received Confidential Information Pray tell what possible employers are not included given how sweeping these terms are A cleaning service Nah <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells Roombas and vacuum cleaners so youd be competing indirectly with them A receptionist in a dentists office Nope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells tooth whitening products A massage therapist No <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells electronic massage devices Working as a gym No <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>sells home exercise equipment And note that this includes intended to be old offered or otherwise provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>temps are precluded from competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>vaporware too Not only is this agreement eyepoppingly broad in terms of productservice range but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also means for it to be farreaching from a geographic perspective From the Verge account Employee recognizes that the restrictions in this section may significantly limit Employees future flexibility in many ways the agreement asserts referencing the section containing the noncompete agreement and three other clauses Employee further recognizes that the geographic areas for many of Amazons products and services and by extension the geographic areas applicable to certain restrictions in this Section are extremely broad and in many cases worldwide Now I have my doubts as to how much success <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would have in enforcing this contract in a lot of nonUS jurisdictions But the Seattle retailer goes to great lengths to turn a shortterm warehouse gig into a bar to future employment Consider Verves description of this provision The contract which was obtained through applying and being accepted to a seasonal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse position even includes a provision that requires employees who sign it to disclose and provide a true and correct copy of this Agreement to any prospective new employer BEFORE accepting employment The intent is to create a captive pool of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>temps who will be forced to accept whatever crappy pay and conditions the retailer offers by virtue of being barred from virtually any other job Verge said it was not able to determine whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>had attempted to enforce these captive labor agreements but pointed out that the company had been extremely aggressive in pursuing noncompete case against whitecollar employees And some perhaps many of the workers who are aware of these clauses do feel the need to obtain consent which at a minimum creates an obstacle to getting hired by a new firm Lee wants to continue her seasonal work at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and because of the noncompete that shes signed she would be careful if she were to apply for a second job at an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>competitor like Sams Club the wholesale subsidiary of Walmart Lee says in this hypothetical scenario she would be clear with the hiring agents at Sams Club about the noncompete shed signed at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and would also contact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>to ask for permission for working at Sams Club In the story Lee bends over backwards to present <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as nicer than WalMart which is a low bar and to stress that shes grateful for the holiday work But its not hard to see the implications Its hard enough for lowwage candidates to land an offer The notion that a prospective employer will go through the hoops of obtaining consent seems unlikely particularly since many temp or shortterm gigs want the candidate to start immediately Its easier to rescind the offer and pick the next in the long line of applicants And even if the prospective employer has the time and inclination to obtain Amazons consent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>can refuse to give it or achieve the same effect by being really slow in providing it Verge describes how practices like this feed the growth of McJobs and accelerate the rush to the bottom in work conditions In this way noncompetes can exacerbate structural inequalities in the current job market inequalities which themselves make noncompetes easier for companies to demand In Americas postrecession economy job seekers continue to vastly outnumber openings for good jobs In this setting workers dont have much leverage when haggling with employers over terms and conditions of work One effect of this has been the expansion of the socalled gig economy where apps like Uber and TaskRabbit draw on a pool of freelancers ready to perform quick jobs that become available with no attendant promise of benefits or job security Large numbers of unemployed and underemployed have also fueled the boom in tempagency staffing that has accounted for significant portions of the countrys postrecession job gains A lack of negotiating power can lead workers to sign noncompete contracts Orly Lobel a professor of labor and employment law at University of San Diego says and those contracts further erode their negotiating power Because noncompetes make job loss more perilous by limiting postemployment opportunities the agreements can tether workers to their current job making them less likely to address grievances with management or attempt to look for better or more fitting work says and those contracts further erode their negotiating power Because noncompetes make job loss more perilous by limiting postemployment opportunities the agreements can tether workers to their current job making them less likely to address grievances with management or attempt to look for better or more fitting work Even though a labor lawyer who reviewed the agreement questioned whether it would be enforceable given how short a temporary role at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would be versus the postemployment restriction and the lack of employee access to trade secret information they are likely to have a chilling since a lowpay worker who understood the reach of the agreement could fear incurring the wrath of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Its time to boycott <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Tell your friends to shun them Its time to recognize that the supposed neoliberal paradise of cheap and easy shopping comes at the expense of workers and hence society as a whole You pay for what you get and stumping up for better conditions for employees means spending more Take your business from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and give it to more ethical retailers Jezus H Christ this is bad What twobit legal chump of a twit at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>carved this little fecal jewel of stupidity and contemptibly unctuous derision of the human person Personally I wont use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>unless absolutely necessary ie obscure math books but only a few over the past year Other than that nada People cant look into their minds and say No No I wont do this no I wont participate in this No I wont enforce this No I wont acquiesce to this No No This is contemptible No It reminds me of some final words written by the late American poet Charles Bukowski He wrote nearing the end of his life what he had learned from the experience of living Not much he said but one thing one huge thing stood out Learn to say No he wrote Of course he wrote it better than I just did Fuck you <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and your petty bullshit abuse of vulnerable and defenseless human beings Fuck your grinning selfsatisfied smug missionary zeal for the customer no matter how much indignity you foist upon nameless and faceless labor to buff and shine your executive stock price and option paydays like a shiny apple from Satan Fuck your innovation Its not innovation Its devolution And I dont want to be a customer of anybody that would do what you do I think of you and I just say No other than the math books to be honest my conscience isnt completely clear I admit but hopefully Ill get sent to a high rung of hell where theres at least a little AC to cool things off You know what the late Chas Bukowski wouldve done He would have drifted on to the next gig just as he always did And if some amazon lawyer sent him a warning letter he wouldve used it as a coaster for his everfull wine glass as he composed a new poem about what aholes they were Not many warehouse workers would have the resources to defend themselves against a corporate law suit But courts regularly on the basis of equity throw out overlybroad noncompete agreements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>knows damned well that any attempt to enforce this blunderbuss of a contract would fail All they can do is try to extort settlements before trial That would be the time for any exemployee actually facing litigation to start a legal defense fund Well said Mr or is it Sir craazyman I myself had an epiphany Im hoping that is a real word and that the autocorrect spelt it right for me this Christmas after internetordering a microwave oven from a supposedly ethical partnership company The item had clearly been dropped somewhere in the supply chain When I signed for it I noticed a corner of the packaging was badly crushed and there was an ominous rattling sound when I shook the box In a store I would have smelt a rat but on my doorstep in the cold caught at a bad time I just scrawled on the dotted line and accepted the goods When unpacked all that remained was a smashed tortured ensemble of plastic and steel It was the Tiny Tim of microwaves poorly broken and forgotten by the world But still it tugged at my heart The whole sorry saga occupied my mind for days like I was in an odd parable for our times It was beyond a simple case of crappification there were too many questions needing answered Who dropped it Who knew it was dropped Why didnt anyone do anything Why was it noones job to care Maybe it was some peeed off Chinese worker extracting their revenge passiveaggressively on the unknown and unknowable end customer who had enabled their exploitation Perhaps a supernatural incident at sea wrestled with the container not unlike what happened when the Nazis stole the Ark of the Covenant in that Raiders of the Lost Ark movie Maybe it was at the fulfilment centre which was probably only related to the company which sold the item via a second cousin thrice removed outsourcing contract Maybe it was the delivery company which was actually a single mum using her own year old station wagon as a delivery truck and who I established over the course of this debacle let me in on the secret the she was forced to use her garage as a storage facility uncompensated to layaway items which were shipped to her by the courier and her vehicle which she had to provide and for as a condition of her zero hour contract employment and for which she was paid the minimum laid down by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs for personal hire of vehicles who either didnt know about or couldnt afford to resolve the situation Maybe it was God Herself sending me a message a bit like the three kings from the Orient but this time around merely bearing consumer durables And instead of the Messiah all they got was me not bringing salvation to the world but only possessing a selfish desire to warm a frozen jam rolly polly in three minutes All I knew was from that moment on never ever again will I order anything online If theres misery and debasement in the supply chain I at least want to view the last leg of it myself That way its harder to ignore What was so bloody wrong with going to a store and dealing with a real live human being anyway Ive always wondered how a noncompete can exist at the same point in the spacetime continuum as the Right to Work State Seems like matter and antimatter to me Wouldnt it just explode or something In Americas postrecession economy job seekers continue to vastly outnumber openings for good jobs In this setting workers dont have much leverage when haggling with employers over terms and conditions of work Verge A generous Basic Income Guarantee would make employers have to compete for employees Besides robots will eventually disemployee most humans anyway What then A vast purge of the useless eaters But yeah Ill boycott <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>the best I can just as I boycott Walmart the best I can I was once offered a job at Walmart because I offered to help a female worker move something Turns out she was management She laughed refused my help and offered me a job I laughed because I dont need to work for a living and walked away Yet I DO work anyway being useful the best way I can Go figure ye who think we all need a jobjawb A BIG is likely to drive wages down given government transfers will make up the difference Employers would be less responsive to workers than they are now The rich will work for a a year or for free volunteer BUT the what where when how and how much are up to them since they dont NEED the money Similarly a financially independent population will have a lot more leverage wrt to work conditions And I dispute your point about wages Walmart and McDonalds workers are paid so low not because of the help they get from Food Stamps Medicaid and other government assistance but because that assistance is TOO LITTLE to allow them to be unemployed A generous BIG would allow them to be unemployed and thus force employers to bid up wages and working conditions UNLESS those jobs can be outsourced which many cannot be The rich work for a dollar a year to avoid all payroll and income taxes Its not from the goodness of their hearts or anything That you have structural unemployment as a IR buffer as espoused by their chaired academic sock puppets is a bit of a tell imo The rich will work for a a year or for free volunteer BUT the what where when how and how much are up to them since they dont NEED the money Doesnt have anything to do with the topic of capitalincome ratio Similarly a financially independent population will have a lot more leverage wrt to work conditions A populace dependent on a permanent living wage handout is not financially independent it is always vulnerable to the whims of Americas conservative culture Cuts to welfare payments will be an annual event as demagogues bang the moochers and looters drum Once those payments are cute sufficiently to force the willinglu unemployed back to work were rght back where we started except thejr skills have so deteriorated theyll have virtually no chance to find paid work And I dispute your point about wages Walmart and McDonalds workers are paid so low not because of the help they get from Food Stamps Medicaid and other government assistance but because that assistance is TOO LITTLE to allow them to be unemployed No business reduces wages paid because public benefits are reduced A generous BIG would allow them to be unemployed and thus force employers to bid up wages and working conditions There is no reason to think significant numbers will choose unemployment willingly To the contrary research into unemployment tells us virtually all Americans want to work BIG advocates ignore cultural and social realities incompatible with their income scheme It seems to me that rather than necessarily being a predatory company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>have found themselves in a trap of their own making From my understanding of the economics it seems that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>along with other online sales companies are finding that the cost of delivery is stubbornly high and is undermining their ability to undermine bricks and mortar stores The con behind big box retailing was always that they could provide superficially low prices by making the consumer pay in time and fuel to do the distribution and selection work for them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is finding that you can only make a profit selling online if you can persuade people that the convenience is worth paying a premium and it would seem this is not the case People are balancing up the convenience of getting something through the mail with the security of going to a shop to actually see what they are buying and they are not convinced in all cases it is worth it unless the online product is significantly cheaper So it would seem the future model of retailing is a fine balance between stores where you can touch and sniff what you are considering buying and various delivery options It may be that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>may turn out be a dead end in retailing as out of date as corner shop groceries Witness to that the steady ratcheting up of the shipping and handling fees charged on ebay etsy and like sites At the small end retail world that dollar added to the shipping and handling fee makes all the difference between being a vendor or not Unless you get lucky and find a Utrillo cheap at the thrift store nickel and dime is the basic business model I follow a similar logic I primarily use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>for supplements that are not easy to find and newused textbooks Ill buy a supplement at a local store if the price is close to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>price Ill ignore the off from the subscribe and save function but a lot of supplements on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>are cheaper than my local store The reverse is true for larger items The first thing we do lets kill all the lawyers Undoubtedly this idea came from the top Bezos is a bit of a wacko who thinks quadcopters can deliver packages and is building his own spaceport in Texas And of course he also has had great successdespite Amazons low profit marginsalthough arguably much of that success is a result of gaming the tax system <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>also fought and won a Supreme Court case to escape compensating its poorlypaid warehouse workers for time they spend in line at the end of shift waiting for security checks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>needs to fully compensate their warehouse workers for time waiting for security checks I dont care whether the Supreme Court says that this is legal What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is doing is immoral Im also wondering how hot it must become in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouses before the air conditioners turn on in the summer Whats the thermostat setting It doesnt matter whether there are air conditioners if they are never or rarely used Some business elites are beyond ridiculous these days or intended to be sold offered or otherwise provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>in the future Who the heck would know this The claims are absurd EditorAll of this text appears twice Because noncompetes make job loss more perilous by limiting postemployment opportunities the agreements can tether workers to their current job making them less likely to address grievances with management or attempt to look for better or more fitting work just because it is in writing does not make it enforceablethe state of washington like many states has case law requiring reasonableness and CONSIDERATIONkeeping your job is not considered consideration and an at will employee is further protected from these toilet paper non competesthe question here is why are not stock analysts trackingGOGIRAGODZILLAi mean amazonasking about creation of liabilities by a law department running in a circle chasing its tailhigh turnover leads to unhappy campers who might wake up one morning and bite back with a class action lawsuit after they are firedor let goa large firm like I am a zoeohn greek zoeohn animal not only does not get a pass but is easily shown to be legally liable as they would have hired tall building law firm to create this toilet paper creating an unconscionable contract opening up liability since the tall building law firm knows bettermost firms will not attempt to actually spend a real dollar in court to enforce the non competes unless the employee is some sales person directly targeting existing clients that were obtained with the resources of their former firm or if they bring in some magic potion information from the previous firm to the new firm and again go after existing clientsbut realistically there is no magic potion information anymore with the arpanetBI before internet there were thousands of small trade publications with market data that could be obtained only by having a corporate addresstoday most of these trade publications have an internet based information platform and the data names and stats they used to send out in a small k to k circulation is now out there for anyone to seethese toilet paper non competes are just to scare the children on Halloween In a peculiar way this sort of attempted policy is a hopeful thing Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>expect their ocean of little fishes to become more scanty in the foreseeable future Are they trying to preemptively secure their minions Do they see a change coming up Okay I dont believe a change in labour availability and thus bargaining power is ahead certainly not in the next months And any industry secrets which an entry level minion would have could hardly be worth the bother of protecting Another peculiarity suppose the policy held up suppose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>hired people and then didnt need their services and those people couldnt take employment elsewhere Wouldnt that make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>responsible for their wellbeing Would their restrictive agreement satisfy the social services beaurocracy that no Mrs McCarthy cant legally take other employment therefore she qualifies for food stamps and Medicare That would be the conclusion in any sane compassionate country ie one where this policy wouldnt be allowed in the first place On further thought the trade secrets part might be intended to prevent staff from talking about their workplace pay conditions complaints and so on in any way at all A backdoor crushdown on any bad publicity or any organizing activity At least in North Dakota that covenant is flatly unenforceable The only question would be whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>would get slapped with sanctions and fees if they attempted to enforce it </div></body></html>
