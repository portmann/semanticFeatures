ETF Hub Jul ET About Apple Inc AAPL By Eric Jhonsa SA News Editor Apple Watch NASDAQ AAPL accounted for well over of the M in annual revenue growth seen by Apples Other Products segment in FQ CFO Luca Maestri mentioned on the earnings call Bloomberg observes Maestris remarks point to M Watch sales if one assumes a ASP live blogs WSJ BI Tim Cook stated Watch sales were higher in June than in April or May He once more declined to provide specific Watch revenueunit figures while asserting Apple has chosen not to do so to keep info out of competitors hands He also once more defends the iPad units YY to M estimating Apple has of the market for tablets and stating customer sellthrough M was better than sellin thanks to a Kunit drop in channel inventories The iPhone units to M but below a M consensus saw channel inventories fall by K QQ bringing them to the low end of Apples week target range Greater China iPhone sales were up YY and Mac sales of iPhone users are said to have upgraded to a Also A strong dollar had an impact on revenue growth and a impact on iPhone ASP the latter was still up YY thanks in part to the of Apples cash balance is offshore The retail store count is up to outside the US thirdparty Watch apps are now available Nothing speaks louder than clear sales figures That has always been a clear indication of the health of a product Cook effectively signalled the failure of the watch even before it went on sale when he stated that he wouldnt reveal sales figures And now he is having to justify the watch couched in descriptive adjectives that mean nothing other than that he is trying to hide the failure of the product Its a sad turn of affairs I wonder if he will use the same tactic for Apple Music I note that he was happy to boast of millions of people signing up for iteven though its currently free Is that not helping the competition Apparently not in Cooks book But will he give concrete figures after a year of paying subscribers If he doesnt we will know it has failed as he has already divulged a rough figure of millions now I guess we now know what all that sapphire was wanted for mirrors The smoke is provided by the forest fires in droughtstricken California Seems like production ramp on the Watch was very slow Lots of issues and supply didnt even come close to catching up with demand for some time One key number Cook said on the call June sales were better than April or May Considering how many of models werent even available until June this shouldnt be surprising but its a good data point The market is hot wind which blows for a day The market overprices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and FB with things perceived in the wind Lets get real This is an opportunity to buy AAPL cheap as the company is only one worldwide with such a breadth of integrated products Its customers are solidly locked into its products the quality is exceptional The Watch will increase rapidly hopefully offering in all markets worldwide by ChristmasHoliday season The critics havent been able to find flaws in the Apple Watch unlike its competitors I was lucky as I ordered on line minutes after the opening time I received my Apple Watch on Day I love it Marketing that includes retail sales and all countries in the world will see a huge surge by December The integration of AAPL products is exceptional in a fragmented market People ask me all the time about my watch and when they see it run through its paces they say they want one some are very disappointed because they do not have an iPhone and they then say that they will have to change their phone So basically a blowout and the stock drops Love it Great opportunity here to sell puts or put spreads Anyone that thinks Apple will fall for a while is mistaken Lots of share repurchase authorization left it will find a bottom fast Despite all the negative Apple comments that you will hear they had a earnings increase this past quarter Over billion in cash Apple is alive and doing very well Just ask Siri shell tell you Thats what I said e years ago when it lost close to of its stock value Ill wait and see They have to come up with something innovative in order to move the needle iwatch isnt it I love apple and it will continue to go higher over the years How high and how fast Who knows Almost Billion in watch sales and this is a failure I believe this will grow now that the early production issue with one of the two component suppliers is fixedand the roll out has been deliberately careful to be able to ship good qualitycustomers will realize what the watch can do and will become buyers in the future This is a new device with a new functionality Apple is now a one trick pony iPhones are its bread and butter Timmy boy better get his act together or just run for office This next couple of quarters will tell the tale on the watch My sense is that it will find its way to the top of Christmas lists and will be the next must have to be accepted by the in crowd Interesting to note almost two million have been sold thus far with a pick up in sales in June I wouldnt consider those numbers to be a failure There are early buyers that eagerly have been showing off their watches and then there are cautious buyers that are waiting for the refining process that always goes on with new products Im betting that watch sales will continue to pick up in the months and years ahead as refinements are made and more application software becomes available Love all this one trick pony stuff First and foremost that one trick rose year of year basis revenue rose faster than the last three years China sales double earnings were at high end for a conservative guidance company EPS beat by Mac kicked ass while PCs are irrelevant see IBM and others nearly B in other revenue and we are stuck on one trick Remove the trick and you still have better numbers from and EPS and growth perspective that the GOOG which missed revenue for the th straight quarter and went up Or why does nobody slander Mr I Will Buy the Washington Post as my Dandy because I have only earned B on B of lifetime sales Market penalizes established money makers because they are afraid future looks grim Sure my million dollar position might take a whack from this but happy to add shares if given the gift of maybe even more Yes comps become exceedingly difficult but that is a good problem to have when you are doing nearly a half billion a day in sales China is going gang busters when India catches up we will see another explosion of foreign sales Here the thing can you real say that a first year run rate of gen product watch at a guess of million units is a failure has Audemars sold that in their existence nope Granted Apples hah play on play versus diamonds but thats the point its a watch and first gen lots of folks hugging the sideline we havent see anything yet from iPay Europe and beyond Apple music future transportation etc Bottom line its ecosystem is undeniable Apple is gobbling up their own shares and divvy will double in next few years As a Father of Four from college grad to twelve my kids brought this to me my goal is to leave them a few thousand shares each I am at per kid rest mine hope to get a chance to add more sell away drive it to please truck is in reverse Samsung or Google Watch that would be Iolwth Im not a die hard Apple fem boy and I bought one The watch is great and will sell better over the holidays and with due refinement Everyone has to consider the market for smartwatches In a TOTAL of million smartwatches were sold worldwide httpbitlyLBEMQZ The estimates from many of the analysts for the Apple Watch is between million to million units current quarter Ladies and Gentlemento me these numbers are outstanding for a month period be it with a planned slow ramp up in sales by Apple Also their comps YY is which includes a YY increase in China Many international companies are citing Chinas economy as a drag on their salesNot so for Apple We consider Apple a strong buy and see this stock price decline as a huge buying opportunity Keep in mind that Apples buyback program kicks in this Fridaywhich will mean Apple will be buying Apple at a lower price pointgreat for shareholders ETF Screener Search and filter by asset class strategy theme performance
