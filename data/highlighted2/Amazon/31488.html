Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo's Microsoft partnership is no longer exclusive.This indicates that Yahoo has further flexibility to drive monetization, design and functionality in search.With this new-found freedom, Yahoo will be betting everything on contextual search..While this adds legs to the long-term investment thesis, it's not yet conclusive as to whether Yahoo has the necessary clout to drive engagement.Here's some good news.Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) now has added flexibility with its search algorithm and design.The question: what will Yahoo do with its newly found freedom?Now Yahoo has blown the loophole wide open.Under the renewal terms announced on Thursday, Yahoo's deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is no longer exclusive on desktop or mobile.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That means Yahoo <b>could</b> strike similar deals with other companies that own search engines like Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) , Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) or <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) to also source their results within its search pages . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Deep down, I'm skeptical that Yahoo will enter into an agreement with another company.Marissa Mayer, while known as a dealmaker, is more of a product-oriented CEO, which is the main reason why the board brought her onboard.Her innate ability to create well-designed web-based services that can fulfill some sort of niche, without clogging the user experience with unnecessary junk, is invaluable to Yahoo, especially in its transformation of search.Now remember, early 2000, Yahoo was a juggernaut, and Google was the challenger.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The main reason Yahoo lost to Google was because it was overly <b>dependent</b> on the directory listing approach versus the search engine .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the early 2000s, Yahoo went ahead and used Google's search technologies and even listed Google as the primary search provider in its directory.Pretty soon, everyone heard about Google thanks to Yahoo.Once Yahoo realized the value in search it went on an acquisition spree to try and shore up the lack of technical talent in search technology.By then, it was too late.Google took off and Yahoo was left behind.Microsoft and Yahoo needed to work together 15 years ago if it wanted to create a legitimate product offering that can challenge Google.Today, a partnership isn't going to amount to much because the combined scale of advertising via the Yahoo Bing network didn't account for the rapid emergence of programmatic advertising, which standardized ad-units across social, search and display platforms.Programmatic ad buying can reach more than 90% of the web and mobile viewing audience.So competing technology rendered the Yahoo Bing alliance obsolete overnight.So, Yahoo isn't shopping for another deal because there aren't anymore silver arrows that will somehow turn Yahoo's search business into an overnight success.Marissa knows this because she has extensive experience working with some of the very best data scientists and software engineers in the field.So what other options does Marissa have at this point?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The creation of a contextual search algorithm would be both disruptive and <b>may</b> be useful enough to bring Internet users back to Yahoo .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Speaking at a Goldman Sachs technology conference in San Francisco , Mayer said she 's still excited about the possibility that search offers for the firm - especially contextual search where ads <b>appear</b> on content pages .  (Uncertainty) </span>"We're long on search," said Meyer during a Q&A session with a Goldman analyst."Search is curiosity, and that will never be done."<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Assuming</b> Yahoo is able to broaden its reach via search deals like the one with Mozilla , while it overhauls its search algorithm for better queries , Yahoo can gain back some users to its search platform .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Furthermore , the development of a disruptive search technology <b>could</b> drive significant growth in MAUs , which will trickle down to both CPMs and net-revenue after taking out traffic acquisition costs .  (Uncertainty) </span>Admittedly, Yahoo doesn't just have a market share problem.Users have visited a search engine less frequently, which indicates that engagement is trending downward.This reduces the number of impressions that will be available for monetization, even if it were to gain back market share.What this also indicates is that Yahoo needs to develop a way to re-create some of that initial excitement Internet users had, when they first came across search technologies.Google is already working on this by developing search partnerships in which it can create deep links into mobile applications like Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This should build-out the amount of available content for search in general , which <b>may</b> translate into more engagement .  (Uncertainty) </span>Unfortunately, Yahoo is still the laggard in terms of market share and it will take more than dealmaking to turn the search business around.Investors should look very closely at the changes that Yahoo makes to its core search product and its ability to drive engagement for mobile apps.These two factors will drive the valuation of the stock post spin-off of its Alibaba holdings unit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While I 'm <b>optimistic</b> in Yahoo 's mobile business , I would need to see further developments on the search side of the business before saying it 's one of the best investment ideas in the internet and media space .
