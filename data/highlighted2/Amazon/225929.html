face value it may be hard to make the decision to invest After all were talking about a company with a PE ratio of over However Im here to tell you that AMZN is a great move Today well talk about why When I started looking into AMZN about a year ago Prime was one of my biggest gripes with the stock I just couldnt understand how the product could be profitable For those of you who dont know about Prime the cost of the service is per year That works out to per month For that cost consumers get free day shipping on quite a few products free streaming videos and far more Considering the average cost of shipping it seems that at this price AMZN would be losing money if consumers purchased only products per month However looking into what Prime actually does for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>its clear to see that its starting to become profitable Ultimately it boils down to the amount of money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime members spend on the retail website Recent reports show that of consumers that have signed up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime spend more on the website now that they are members Not to mention that nearly of Prime members spend more than per year at the online retailers site Moreover of members that have been members for at least years spend more than per year on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>When you look at the amount of members signed up for the service its easy to see that this is a significant source of revenue for AMZN When you first think of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>chances are that the first thing youre thinking about is online retail However the company has a hidden weapon thats building in importance rather quickly That secret weapon is called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services also known as AWS AWS is a cloud computing service that gives companies and consumers incredible infrastructure in the cloud Not to mention its already incredibly popular According to CNN Money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services is currently on pace to bring in more than billion this year alone That growth is continuing as well In fact most recent estimates show that AWS is likely to bring in billion in revenue in the year Thats huge In fact at billion per year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services alone would be worth about billion Late last year I lost hope in Amazons stock I got tired of seeing losses on earnings report after earnings report However Im starting to realize the plan for the company More importantly Im starting to see that they got the plan right The reality is that Jeff Bezos isnt too concerned about profits at the moment Instead this genius CEO is focused on using low prices to build his brand hes focused on using money that comes in to expand services and infrastructure While this plan isnt bringing in massive profits at the moment its likely to bring in the big bucks down the road All in all I used to have a relatively bearish opinion with regard to what we could expect from this stock However with time my opinion has made a complete Ultimately even at a valuation over times earnings AMZN is a great pick for those looking for long run growth What Do You Think About
