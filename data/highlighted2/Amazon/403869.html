( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha We look at <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> versus eBay point by point . I love pairs trades.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I love them even <i>more</i> when they are backed by fundamental factors and not for the mere sake of hedging market <b>risk</b> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And I love them super even <i>more</i> when they 're done with options .  (Surprise) </span>As we move into 2016, we have seen big-name tech stocks with clearly innovated products and reasonable valuation, such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), hurt by earnings, while stocks with no real products and nosebleed valuations, such as Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), fly on earnings.In light of this , I want to direct your attention to two stocks in the same sector and considered by many to be running the same business : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) . I am often asked by my students why I recommend trades on AMZN, but not the other big online superstore, eBay.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The short of it is that AMZN is <i>more</i> <b>volatile</b> and trades at a <i>higher</i> price than EBAY .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But what about investing?Are both stocks equally worth your capital?Notice that in the most recent earnings reports of both companies, both beat on earnings, the stocks rising in response.While I often run fancy codes on fundamental ratios and the like for the analysis of an individual stock, I prefer to open Zero to One, Peter Thiel's book, when comparing companies.In this article, I will apply the Zero to One reasoning in determining which one of AMZN or EBAY you should hold, if any, and whether a pairs trade makes sense.While Mr. Thiel's book is mainly aimed at analyzing startups, I often find that I can bring the philosophies forward in analyzing a pair of companies.Let's do this point by point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>eBay : Now that eBay has split from PayPal ( NASDAQ : PYPL ) , I <b>believe</b> the answer is `` no . ''  (Uncertainty) </span>eBay is an online auction site not much different from any other online auction site, including Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) auctions or Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) Taobao.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Other than a tall barrier to entry , no company is prevented from creating an auction site that mimics and <b>possibly</b> engages in incremental improvements upon eBay .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> : With cloud technology now quite common and competitors such as Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) closing in on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's AWS market share , it is hard to say that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is still innovating in the cloud . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's tech overlaps with that of too many companies , from the Fire TV Stick versus Apple TV and Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) versus <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> does have Mechanical Turk , which is a streamlined outsourcing technology platform that <b>seems</b> irreplaceable at the moment . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , this service <b>seems</b> to be dying on its own - not that it contributed much to revenue anyhow : Is now the right time to invest in either of these companies ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Looking at Google Trends, we get an idea of the trends in these companies' respective popularity, which makes for a good starting point.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We see a pivotal point in late 2014 , when <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> overtook eBay in popularity : But <i>more</i> interesting is the actual shape of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's chart . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Clearly, we have a seasonal trend which peaks in the holiday season.My seasonal investigations into <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> show this to have a significant impact on the stock . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In this respect , EBAY makes for a <i>better</i> `` buy and hold '' than AMZN , which is a <i>better</i> seasonal trade .  (Surprise) </span>Still, other aspects of timing must be considered.For example , because of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> having multiple revenue sources , one of which being cloud services , we must ask ourselves whether these industries are growing . With cloud, the answer is "yes," supporting a bullish long-term thesis for AMZN, the current leader in cloud.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But also , if you believe a market crash is overdue and could happen this year , you <b>might</b> consider what will happen to AMZN and EBAY during this period .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While it is easy to compare prices on the two sites and conclude that one <b>might</b> be <i>cheaper</i> than the other , a <i>more</i> rigorous investigation is warranted .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By observing how both stocks acted during the last market crash , we should get a <i>better</i> idea as to which is the <i>safer</i> hold : Here , AMZN was the clear winner , rebounding rather quickly .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although the maximum drawdown for both stocks was similar , AMZN recovered prior to the end of the market crash period , implying that investors had <b>faith</b> that the company would do well in spite of a recession .  (Uncertainty) </span>EBAY was not so lucky.Does either company have a monopoly?In a way , both <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and eBay have monopolies . However, both companies have changed significantly since their inception.As an early adaptor of eBay, back in high school, I remember that all sales were performed by way of auction.Now, this is not so.My purchases on eBay today are all "buy now" purchases.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I <b>believe</b> both bidders and sellers have caught onto the psychological phenomenon of bidding going <i>higher</i> than the market price in an auction .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With the introduction of sites such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , non-unique items are often <i>cheaper</i> on the one-price-fits-all sites . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Likewise , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's hold on distinguishing retail customers is slipping as a result of many specialty online retailers . Many online retailers are strengthening their online marketing and social media game plans to build communities around their online stores.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Much as how a fashionista would n't settle for buying her clothing at Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) , niche retailers such as Birchbox , Fab.com , and Zulily ( NASDAQ : ZU ) have reeled in customers from the <i>more</i> generic <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>In addition to this change , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> sees much of its revenue coming from cloud services , which is also a slipping monopoly . Spread out on too many fronts, the company will inevitably lose at least one of its monopoly wars.Still, at present, it is the king of online retail in the Western world.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Answer : The auction monopoly that eBay holds is becoming a <i>smaller</i> monopoly ; the monopolies that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> holds are slipping away as a result of competition . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Auction lovers will likely still be using eBay ten years down the line.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if we see niche auction sites pop up , they will <b>probably</b> not steal many of eBay 's customers .  (Uncertainty) </span>In addition, the status that it attaches to seller accounts will keep many sellers using the platform because of the sunken cost bias , and as long as eBay has a wealth of sellers, buyers will continue to come looking for deals.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>eBay is a people business and much <i>more</i> of a community than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In addition , it comes with <i>fewer</i> rules and regulations than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This allows for the sale of <i>more</i> unique items and good deals on brand new items , which brings in a consistent audience .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> also has staying power , for reasons already stated ( monopolies and market leadership ) . The company also managed to make it unscathed during the dot com boom, despite a -10 P/E at the time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>People <b>believe</b> in <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> because of its trustworthiness , in addition to its name recognition . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In other words , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has the people 's trust - everyone , including my grandmother . eBay is a bit of a different story, as many still steer clear of it because of the rare threats of scams and because of a mistrust of PayPal.Many people , including myself , have had bad experiences with eBay , and some of those people refuse to get back on the horse - especially now that we have a car ( in the form of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ) . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has the buyer 's trust AND his credit card , which lowers the threshold for sales and increases the customer base willing to do business through the platform . As long as the company can keep that trust, its retail business will remain safe.The same goes for <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Web Services , but of course , that trust must be at a business-to-business level . Overall, I don't see much negative in either company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Clearly , we did pass an important pivot point in late 2014 , at which point <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> would have been the <i>better</i> buy for investors who must choose between AMZN and EBAY . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> continues to gain momentum , while eBay falls in popularity and in EPS . That said, a logical pairs trade on these two stocks would be to long AMZN and short EBAY.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The short side of the trade is not necessarily a <b>speculative</b> trade against eBay as a company ( though it can be , as revenue and earnings are falling ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The short leg <b>could</b> just be seen as both an industry hedge and a market hedge .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Honestly , I would feel <i>safer</i> in 2016 were I long AMZN and short EBAY , as opposed to being just long on AMZN .  (Surprise) </span>How do you feel?Let me know in the comments section below.My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live here on Seeking Alpha.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this newsletter , we will be employing both fundamental and pattern analyses to <b>predict</b> price movements of specific companies after specific earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>I will also be offering specific strategies for playing those earnings reports.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Investing Ideas , Long Ideas</div></body></html>
