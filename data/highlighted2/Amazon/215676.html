class='textDiv'>How to Score Deep Discounts on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>with Warehouse Deals Here are the tools and resources that changed my financial life I am a huge fan of shopping on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but especially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals I mentioned this little known section of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>before in one of my simple savings Sunday posts Being a deal seeker I try to find the greatest deals that I can wherever I shop I am also an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime member so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is really my one stop shop for many of my products I learned about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals some time agowhen I was searching for a camera lens for my wife If you know about photography then you understand that camera lenses are expensive I am not very savvy when it comes to the camera so my wife told me what type of lens she wanted With that information in hand I was able to start my search Here is my experience with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals and why I think you should always check there for awesome deals My experience with warehouse deals was so positive its one of the many ways I show you how to save on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>You should check out this list for over ways <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>doesnt really make it easy to find their warehouse deals section If you just start searching in their main search bar on the homepage then you probably wont find the section If you want to specifically search their warehouse deals then head to this page This is their main warehouse deals section Now anytime you search you should see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse Deals next to the search box like shown below You can find the warehouse deals when you are on a product page and you are checking the prices You will see the new products first but then you can find the warehouse deals Click the link below to show a screenshot of an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>product page It is easier to find warehouse deals when you click on the Used tab Basically warehouse deals consists of products that have been returned damaged at the warehouse used and refurbished These items just dont meet Amazons new standard so they list them here They also have some new and openboxed items but they are less of these If you are an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Prime member then you can get the same day shipping on eligible items <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>thoroughly tests each product to make sure that it is still functional before listing back on sale They even grade their items to help you find ones that you are willing to purchase Some of their grading can be a little general but if you shop there enough you start to understand how they are doing it Here are their product conditions or grades New This means that the product has not been opened but the package has superficial damage These offer new products with discounted prices because the shipping package was damaged Like New These are typical returns where the customer might pull the item out and then just return it The packaging has been opened but the product is in perfect working order <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>will also put some products that have some physical damage to the outer box of the factory sealed item Very Good The item has been tested and verified to work correctly The item may have some cosmetic damage or blemishes Good Items are tested and verified in working order They may be missing accessories or have large cosmetic damage Acceptable Items are still tested and verified in working order There are signs of wear along with possible different packaging and could include third party accessories I tend to only purchase items that are New which are harder to find Like New or Very Good I have purchased quite a few items from warehouse deals and never had an issue with them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>still stands behind their return policy so if you have any issues then you need to call them up When you see the items listed they will have a little description hear them that talks about cosmetic damage and such like that I have found that these are pretty general but some are quite detailed It really depends on the product If you find something you like when shopping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals then understand that they typically dont have a lot of deep inventory These are returns and damaged items so they wont have a lot of inventory If you are waiting for it to go on sale you might miss your chance to get the item This is especially important when holiday shopping season comes around When people ask me were to find great deals online I typically tell them about warehouse deals The majority of people I speak with have never heard of it yet they have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>accounts I think this is a great opportunity to find great deals on products that you want or need Yes you do have to be careful of what you order but if you find the right product condition then you will most likely be OK <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has warehouse deals for many great and popular categories like consumer electronics baby products sports outdoor home garden shoes and much more You still get the same great service from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>but you can save a good amount of money When I bought the camera lens for my wife I was able to save off the regular price just because the shipping box was damaged The lens had no issues and my wife loved the gift I cant complain there The worst I have had was there was an accessory missing Luckily it only cost me about for a replacement so I considered that a win Some products you can save on while others you can save on It really all depends on the item and how long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has had it in their inventory So if you are looking for a good deal while shopping online then check out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>warehouse deals Regular shoppers should be taking advantage of these deals Yes they can be hit or miss but youd never know unless you checked Before I buy something I will check the warehouse deal section just to be sure I cant find something thats been returned You really never know what you might find If youre really lucky then you might be able to find an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>coupon to go along with it for even more savings Dont forget about those little instaclick treasures Im a business owner blogger father and husband I used credit cards too much and found myself in over in debt I paid it off started this blog and my financial life has changed I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here I run a blog management company along with another blog It is Empowered Shopper which helps people get information about products they want to buy You can also check out Eyes on the Dollar which is a great blog that I coown Ive been checking the warehouse every time I need something after you posted about it last time Did you see this new prime box thing though Some products are prime eligible and some are prime box eligible But for prime box you have to pay for the shipment of the box Its a bit confusing to me but for now Im avoiding the box Good to hear I think you are talking about Prime Pantry I have a post coming up on that soon It is really easy to use They are really just household and nonperishable items that are not sold anywhere else on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>You can only get them on Prime Pantry I have yet to make it over there to check out some of the deals they have but then again I tend to avoid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as it can be a time suck for me I had no idea that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>offered this and I am glad that you have provided a review As someone who worked in the customer service department of a wellknown electronics company through college I have always been scared of returns because no matter what people say is the problem you will never truly know and I hate surprises What a great find Although Im not sure if this is a good or bad thing for me Looking forward to that Prime Pantry post Thanks for sharing September at pm Reply Someone in a forum pointed out to me that there would be no manufacturers warranty with items from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse Deals Were in Canada and deal with Amazonca so maybe its different in the US September at pm Reply It depends on the item being sold Since not all items have even been used or damaged you can still get a warranty on the items I have received a few items which just had box damage but the item was fine I got a discount and the warranty was still intact Its the same search that Amazons site uses Its not weird please dont put in links to sites like that either it was removed due to the spammy nature Perhaps a bit less enthusiasm Purchased an As New Lenova laptop and thought initially it was fine Did as many would do spent a day installing software and transferring data Needed the laptop to replace an failed predecessor Then found Windows complaining Windows license key invalid Contacted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse to be told this is normal and is part of what you get when you buy from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse Interestingly I asked where do they publish this as did not see this anywhere on the site or in the order After a few tense moments they offered some money which is less than will cost to buy Pressed why they do not send a valid license key as advertised Also enquired if so common why do they not get money back from the customer they purchased the laptop from to get money back To send back now will cost time I dont have so accepting the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse discount was a mirage Be Warned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Warehouse do not seek to fulfil Amazons vision of being the Earths most customercentric company Will be leaving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as a seller of choice and only using them whenwhere have to Well thats a crazy story to hear Im sorry you had problems with Amazons warehouse deals Ive never heard of them sending out bad license keys then saying thats how its supposed to be That seems odd to me Thanks for visiting Debt Roundup I built this site to share the journey I took to get out
