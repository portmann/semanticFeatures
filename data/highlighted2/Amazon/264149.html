( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha Netflix stock is up 143 % this year - We <b>believe</b> it 's overvalued by at least 30 % -35 % and has a one-year target price of $ 80 - $ 85 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix 's U.S. leadership position will be challenged by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime and other competitors . Further price increases will drastically slow US membership growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In our view , Netflix 's significant investment in original programming will be an ineffective strategy in the long-term as streaming services become <i>more</i> commoditized .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Significant downside <b>risk</b> for investors at current valuation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Several warning signs are emerging at Netflix and these cautionary indicators <b>suggest</b> that the stock has far outpaced the fair value of the business and a correction is likely to occur in 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We are particularly concerned that long-term investors who are holding shares in Netflix ( NASDAQGS : NFLX ) with a 5-10 year investment horizon and expect considerable capital appreciation from the current level may be exposed to considerable downside <b>risk</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>The stock is up 143% this year and currently has an enterprise value of $52 billion.With a ttm EBITDA of $492 million, the company is trading at 105x ttm EV/EBITDA and at a P/E of 317.At the current valuation the bull case remains tenuous, at best.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many of the key assumptions driving the frothy valuation <b>appear</b> to be misguided and not supported by fact .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Based on our outlook , we believe Netflix is overvalued by at least 30 % -35 % and there are several catalysts in place that <b>may</b> spark a sell-off in 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the U.S. streaming market, Netflix's subscriber growth momentum has slowed dramatically.The company reported a decline in net adds in the US in Q3 2015 (880,000) compared to Q3 2014 (980,000).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> the proximate cause for the loss of momentum is the increasing appeal of competing services such as Hulu and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Also , the recent price increase <b>may</b> have played a <i>larger</i> role in the slowdown than management will admit .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In our view , it 's very unlikely that the past growth of <b>nearly</b> 6 million net subscribers in each of the past four years will be replicated by Netflix for several reasons .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix currently has captured 65.1% of U.S. TV watchers which is down slightly from 65.6% in 2014, according to PricewaterhouseCooper's recent December 2015 report on the SVOD market.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The recent trend <b>suggests</b> that with such a large share and several new competitors with <i>lower</i> prices in the market , Netflix will face challenges in 2016 to expand this number meaningfully .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Secondly , in our view , the U.S. SVOD market is already over-saturated and subscriber growth will likely slow to single-digits by 2018-2020 for Netflix given their already large membership base and increased competition , particularly from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQGS : AMZN ) . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In our view , even though a secular shift from linear TV to on-demand internet TV will benefit Netflix over the next several years , we <b>believe</b> <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime will continue to gain on Netflix . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>In our view , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> represents a legitimate direct threat to take a leadership role in the U.S. market . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime , which is priced at $ 8.25 per month , gives consumers access to `` <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video , Prime Music , Prime Photos , the Kindle Lending Library , free two-day shipping on certain items , and discounted next-day shipping on certain items . '' With over 44 million <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime members , the company is heavily focused on improving the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video offering with aggressive initiatives to build original programming and by launching a new feature that gives members access to premium TV networks including Showtime and Starz . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In contrast , we <b>believe</b> Netflix 's exceptionally large $ 5 billion bet on producing exclusive and innovative original programming will not protect it from the increased competition over the long term .  (Uncertainty) </span>Netflix has a recent track record of success, including developing the hit series Orange is the New Black as well as Narcos.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However we do not <b>believe</b> this a strategy which will give Netflix a sustainable advantage over the competition .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Each streaming service is committed to developing original content , but Netflix 's large investment does not guarantee the company will continue to produce <i>more</i> successful projects than unsuccessful ones .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Moreover , a December 2015 survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers confirms our view on this strategy and suggests that original programming is not as important as many Netflix bulls would seem to <b>believe</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>The number of OTT subscribers who view original programming as very important is down in 2015 to 27.2% from 33.3% in 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The number also is down for those who view original programming as <b>somewhat</b> important in 2015 to 36.6 % from 40.7 % in 2014 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Overall 36.2% of OTT subscribers view original programming as not very important or not important at all.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We see the SVOD market as becoming <i>more</i> commoditized over time in a similar fashion as cable television .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As such , Netflix 's programming budget will add risk to the overall business and <b>may</b> only serve as a point of differentiation amid a trend toward the increasing commoditization of streaming services .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We therefore <b>believe</b> that total U.S. memberships growth will continue to lose momentum and will result in a top-line miss in 2016 .  (Uncertainty) </span>We are forecasting total revenue of $8.59 billion in 2016.It remains to be seen whether management can offset this stagnant domestic growth with remarkable international growth.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In our view , there will likely be a drastic share price correction to reflect the <i>lower</i> projected growth .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Bull Case Overestimates Netflix 's ARPU Pricing Power We <b>believe</b> the Netflix bulls are overestimating the degree to which Netflix can increase prices without a loss in subscribers .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Many Netflix bulls argue that the two recent price increases , one in <b>May</b> 2014 and another in October 2015 , did not result in <i>slower</i> membership growth and indicates that Netflix has the ability to implement further increases in the future .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Furthermore , the bulls argue , as <i>more</i> exclusive and original programming is introduced by Netflix , consumers will be compelled to the pay upwards of $ 12 - $ 15 per month or beyond .  (Surprise) </span>We disagree with this conclusion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , we <b>believe</b> the recent price actions are the reason behind the loss of momentum in U.S. membership growth and puts Netflix at a competitive disadvantage .  (Uncertainty) </span>Ultimately , in our view , a significant number of consumers will move into other options such as <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Prime Video ( $ 8.25 per month ) and Hulu ( $ 8 per month ) that offer tremendous value . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Our projections for U.S. membership growth are 5.3 million net adds in 2016 and 4.7 million in 2017 but we expect another price increase in early-2017 which will contribute to the <i>slower</i> membership growth beyond that point .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> the bulls are underestimating how cost-conscious customers of streaming services are and how willing customers are to switch to one of the many other providers including HBO Go , YouTube Red or another new entrant .  (Uncertainty) </span>Our five-year projection reflects the aforementioned market dynamics and the increasing competition in the crowded SVOD market.We expect a top-line miss and earnings miss in 2016 and project $8.59 billion in revenue and EPS of $0.22 for the year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> this will serve as a catalyst for a correction in the stock price and bring the price within our one-year target range of $ 80 - $ 85 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the following years we are still projecting strong growth in revenue of 15.5% per year.This base case scenario illustrates how overvalued, in our view, Netflix is.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even with these <b>assumptions</b> of only slight weakening of fundamentals , the fair value of the shares drops to $ 80 - $ 85 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span>We are still expecting strong EPS growth of 40.7% per year over the five-year period and EPS in 2020 of $1.19.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>There is a significant possibility that even if Netflix exceeds our projection of EPS of $ 1.19 five years from now by as much as 50 % to $ 1.79 that the multiple on these earnings <b>could</b> be markedly <i>lower</i> in 2020 than the current multiple .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For example, a P/E ratio of 47 in 2020 on earnings that exceed our reasonable estimate by 50% would still put the stock price in our one-year target of $80-$85 per share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In our view , investors in Netflix should proceed with caution in 2016 and prepare for the possibility of a substantial correction in the stock price given the extreme <b>optimism</b> the bull case is based upon and the implications of even a modest shortfall to these expectations .  (Uncertainty) </span>We will look to provide an update following Netflix's Q4 results.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
