Our projections for U.S. membership growth are 5.3 million net adds in 2016 and 4.7 million in 2017 but we expect another price increase in early-2017 which will contribute to the slower membership growth beyond that point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> the bulls are underestimating how cost-conscious customers of streaming services are and how willing customers are to switch to one of the many other providers including HBO Go , YouTube Red or another new entrant .  (Uncertainty) </span>Our five-year projection reflects the aforementioned market dynamics and the increasing competition in the crowded SVOD market.We expect a top-line miss and earnings miss in 2016 and project $8.59 billion in revenue and EPS of $0.22 for the year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> this will serve as a catalyst for a correction in the stock price and bring the price within our one-year target range of $ 80 - $ 85 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span>In the following years we are still projecting strong growth in revenue of 15.5% per year.This base case scenario illustrates how overvalued, in our view, Netflix is.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even with these <b>assumptions</b> of only slight weakening of fundamentals , the fair value of the shares drops to $ 80 - $ 85 per share .  (Uncertainty) </span>We are still expecting strong EPS growth of 40.7% per year over the five-year period and EPS in 2020 of $1.19.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is a significant possibility that even if Netflix exceeds our projection of EPS of $ 1.19 five years from now by as much as 50 % to $ 1.79 that the multiple on these earnings <b>could</b> be markedly lower in 2020 than the current multiple .  (Uncertainty) </span>For example, a P/E ratio of 47 in 2020 on earnings that exceed our reasonable estimate by 50% would still put the stock price in our one-year target of $80-$85 per share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In our view , investors in Netflix should proceed with caution in 2016 and prepare for the possibility of a substantial correction in the stock price given the extreme <b>optimism</b> the bull case is based upon and the implications of even a modest shortfall to these expectations .
