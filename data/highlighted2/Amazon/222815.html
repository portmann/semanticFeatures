Moreover, Facebook has had the fastest growing revenues in the FANG group for the past two years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>FB Profit Margin ( TTM ) data by YCharts All things considered , we actually do not <b>believe</b> Facebook 's valuation is a deterrent at these levels .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that , if anything , Facebook 's fundamentals and growth support a much higher valuation .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> long-term MAU growth will be driven by higher global internet penetration .  (Uncertainty) </span>Higher global internet penetration will in turn be fueled by urbanization and increased smartphone adoption.A growing percentage of the global population has access to the Internet.Whereas the world population is growing at just over a 1% CAGR since 2000, the global Internet population has grown at a 15% CAGR in that same time frame.In 2000, global Internet penetration was merely 6.7%.By 2005, that number had more than doubled to 15.8% and now stands at 40.4%, representing about a 240 basis point increase per year since 2000.We expect to see continued growth in global Internet penetration driven by urbanization and smartphone adoption in developing economies.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Adoption of the iPhone 6s and Plus has been <b>surprisingly</b> strong , and urbanization is rapidly occurring on a global basis .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In 2014 , <b>roughly</b> 54 % of the world 's population lived in urban areas , and the global urban mix is expected to increase to 66 % by 2050 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Studies show that urbanization coupled with global population growth will mean an extra 2.5 billion people living in urban areas by 2050.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Roughly</b> 90 % of that growth will be attributed to Asia and Africa .  (Uncertainty) </span>This urbanization of formerly rural areas will bolster the global Internet penetration rate as many formerly non-Internet users will now have access to the Internet.For these reasons, we expect to see continued strong Facebook MAU growth in Europe, APAC and the rest of the world.Due to falling off popularity of Facebook among US millennials per the Piper Jaffray survey, we do not see Facebook drastically growing mind share in the US.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> our worldwide MAU projections fall in-line with our qualitative sentiment that Facebook should continue to garner more market share .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In 2010 , <b>roughly</b> 30 % of the world 's Internet population used Facebook .  (Uncertainty) </span>By 2014, Facebook's global Internet market share had grown to 47.6%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> global Internet penetration can grow 100 to 200 basis points per year into 2025 , down from 240 basis points per year from 2000 to 2014 , and we see the global Internet penetration rate being 47 % in 2020 and 51 % in 2025 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using UN population estimates , this equates to <b>roughly</b> 3.6 billion Internet users in 2020 and 4.1 billion Internet users in 2025 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Our worldwide MAU estimates put Facebook's market share at 61% and 61.5% in 2020 and 2025, respectively.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> this is consistent with Facebook 's current growing market share trend .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As discussed earlier , we <b>believe</b> targeted video ad campaigns will enable Facebook to charge more for advertising space and drive healthy ARPU growth , especially in Europe and APAC where ARPU is still markedly lower .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We see US and Canada ARPU growing healthily into 2017 , driven by high demand for Facebook video ads , but <b>believe</b> ARPU growth will slow as price saturation occurs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We see the same slowing happening in Europe and APAC into 2025 , but <b>believe</b> those growth rates will be higher as ARPU is dramatically lower in those geographies than domestically .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook defines ARPU as the total revenue during the period divided by the average of MAUs at the end of the period and MAUs at the beginning of the period.Using our ARPU and MAU forecasts above, we can create a full 10-year Facebook revenue forecast model.This model can be seen below.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We see the Facebook platform alone netting $ 61.76 billion in worldwide revenues by 2025 , with US and Canada , Europe and APAC contributing <b>roughly</b> $ 18-19 billion each and the rest of the world contributing $ 4.7 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Considering the global mobile advertising market will be just under $ 200 billion in 2019 and the global ad market is set to top $ 600 billion this year , we <b>believe</b> our target for $ 61.76 billion in revenues by 2025 is reasonable ( Facebook platform only ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As previously discussed , we <b>believe</b> Instagram will add billions of dollars in revenue to the Facebook business .  (Uncertainty) </span>We see Instagram adding $1.5 billion in 2016 revenues and $3 billion in 2017 revenues.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> Instagram will grow quickly into a $ 6 billion revenue business by 2020 ( many analysts are looking for $ 5.8 billion ) , and then grow more or less inline with Facebook ad revenues .  (Uncertainty) </span>We see Instagram netting $9.5 billion in revenues by 2025.This is driven by strong millennial adoption, user scale and a shift to digital ad spend.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For our model , we <b>assume</b> no other forms of monetization ( i.e. no revenue from WhatsApp ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Under these assumptions , we <b>believe</b> net revenue for 2016 will be $ 24.85 billion , above the consensus for $ 23.35 billion but below the high estimate of $ 26.38 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>We expect net revenues to be $48.19 billion by 2020 and $71.31 billion by 2025.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Higher GAAP expenses this year are being driven by stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to WhatsApp and other acquisitions , and considering the terms of the $ 19 billion WhatsApp deal included 177.8 million shares of Class A common stock ( at a $ 100 quote , that is <b>roughly</b> $ 17.78 billion ) , we do not see stock-based comp easing on margins in the near future .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Management is guiding for $ 3 to $ 3.3 billion in 2015 stock comp , with <b>roughly</b> half of that from the WhatsApp deal .  (Uncertainty) </span>At $1.5 billion per year in stock comp toward the WhatsApp deal, Facebook's stock compensation will likely not ease until after 2025.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Margins also are being weakened by FX headwinds , and we <b>believe</b> these are non-terminal headwinds .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As these ease in the coming years , we <b>believe</b> operating margins should expand back to a 40 % rate .  (Uncertainty) </span>We model for a 44% tax-rate.FB Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts Because Facebook reports and trades off of non-GAAP EPS, we reconcile our net income to non-GAAP using the following reconciliation, which is driven largely by stock comp and amortization.Our model calls for non-GAAP 2016E EPS of $3.03.This is markedly higher than the consensus outlook for $2.75 but shy of the high estimate for $3.07.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> non-GAAP EPS will grow at a 9.5 % CAGR into 2025 .  (Uncertainty) </span>We apply a 40x multiple to our non-GAAP 2016E EPS of $3.03 to arrive at a $121 price target for shares of FB.FB's current trailing P/E multiple of 105x is a 374% premium to the market's 22x P/E multiple, but FB is trading at 37.6x forward earnings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> that if Facebook can beat estimates and ramp up Instagram revenue the way we expect them to , then the market will reward FB with a higher multiple .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> a 40x multiple is fair for a stock that has monetization potential beyond the $ 71 billion we expect by 2025 .  (Uncertainty) </span>To arrive at a fair value for shares of FB, we use a 10-year DCF with unlevered free cash flows and a WACC discount rate.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Many of our assumptions for this model have already been explained in our earnings model , but herein we expect depreciation and amortization to be around 90 % of a capex that we expect to be <b>roughly</b> $ 3.5-4 .0 billion per year , which will support a more complex data center , network and server infrastructure .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> shares of FB are worth $ 113 today .  (Uncertainty) </span>Using CAPM as a guide, we arrive at a cost equity of 5.96%.The company has only $149 million debt vs. a diluted market cap of $294.4 billion, so the WACC is by-and-large the cost of equity.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>assume</b> a neutral sentiment 2 % FCFF perpetuity rate to arrive at an enterprise value of $ 307.19 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>Adding in MRQ net cash of $13.976 billion, we arrive at a fair value $321.168 billion.On a diluted share count of 2.85 billion, this equates to fair value just shy of $113 per share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> increased digital ad spend , a boosted video ads platform , and Instagram monetization will fuel a strong Q3 ER .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given our fair value analysis and the action in the options market , we <b>believe</b> shares of Facebook are ready to trend toward $ 113 post-earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>We see shares trending toward $121 in a one-year window.Our model importantly does not include potential revenues from WhatsApp but does include GAAP expenses such as amortization and stock comp from the WhatsApp deal.Therefore, if Facebook monetizes WhatsApp successfully, the fair value of FB shares will be north of $113.For now, though, we feel it appropriate to model as we have it, and affirm a $113 fair value.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
