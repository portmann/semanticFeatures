(Surprise) </span>We expect to see continued growth in global Internet penetration driven by urbanization and smartphone adoption in developing economies, and this will ensure continued MAU growth especially in APAC.Throwing a 40x multiple on our 2016E non-GAAP EPS of $3.03 gets us a one-year price target of $121.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Our 10-year DCF with unlevered free cash flows and a WACC discount rate yields a fair value of $ 113 , and we <b>believe</b> shares will trend toward that price post-earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>We are going long Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) into earnings.The options market is pricing in a 6% move in shares in either direction following earnings, and our sentiment sides with a significant move upward.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We think the fair value of shares is $ 113 , so we <b>believe</b> that $ 103 offers good value for investors on the long-side despite shares being up <i>more</i> than 30 % this year .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We also <b>believe</b> Instagram plus video ads will propel a strong Q3 ER .  (Uncertainty) </span>Throwing a 40x multiple on our 2016E non-GAAP EPS of $3.03 gets us a one-year price target of $121.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The valuation is n't absurd against the backdrop of other high-growth tech stocks like Netflix ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) , and we <b>believe</b> the stock has healthy upside potential into and after earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>We have previously discussed why Instagram equips Facebook with a potential $5 billion-plus revenue business by 2020 .At the time of our previous report on Instagram, Piper Jaffray's Spring 2015 Taking Stock with Teens Survey showed 32% of US teens rated Instagram as the most important social media platform, good enough to make it the most popular social media platform among teens in the US.Piper Jaffray's Fall 2015 Taking Stock with Teens Survey showed that Instagram has slightly gained mind share since then, with 33% of US teens rating Instagram the most important.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is 13 percentage points <i>better</i> than the second most popular social media app , Twitter ( NYSE : TWTR ) .  (Surprise) </span>Concurrently, Facebook, although in a sputter since the fall of 2012, did gain mind share from the Spring to the Fall of 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although Snapchat is the fastest growing social media platform according to Piper Jaffray , Instagram was the fastest growing social media platform from 2012 to 2014 among online adults , <b>roughly</b> doubling adult audience penetration in that time frame .  (Uncertainty) </span>In response to ceding the fastest-growing title to Snapchat, Instagram recently debuted its own moment-capturing video feature which bears a high resemblance to Snapchat .While the new feature isn't a do-it-all Snapchat replacement, it does lessen the necessity for Instagram users to use Snapchat.Several analysts expect video ads to energize Facebook Q3 earnings.In the quarter, Facebook boosted its video ad platforms , creating new ad formats and ad buying options.Facebook also enhanced its video ads' targeting capabilities.We see targeted video ads as being a strong driver of ARPU growth over the next 5-10 years, as we feel there is a great deal of content that still needs to shift to digital ad spend.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Video campaigns are proving <i>more</i> successful than traditional photo campaigns , and we <b>believe</b> a good deal of digital ad spend growth will be driven by video ads .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Because of the <i>more</i> successful results , we <b>believe</b> Facebook will be able to continue to hike prices for targeted video ad campaigns , propelling ARPU growth .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>On Facebook's Success Stories page , one can view all the companies that have run successful video ad campaigns.Heineken teamed up with Neil Patrick Harris on a Facebook video ad campaign which only cost the company $0.07 per view and reached 54% of its target audience while growing brand awareness 11.7% in only three days.Ford (NYSE: F ) ran a soccer-themed mobile video ad campaign through Facebook, targeting a Hispanic audience during the summer of 2014.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The ad reached 27 % of all US Hispanics aged 18 or <i>older</i> , had a 6x <i>higher</i> click-through-rate than the average Facebook automotive campaign , and a 71 % video completion rate .  (Surprise) </span>Las Vegas tourism videos garnered 11.8 million total views on Instagram and Facebook, while start-up financial services company Acorns acquired 33% of its investors through a Facebook video ads campaign.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Ludia Games ran a Facebook video ad campaign for Jurassic World : The Game , and the campaign resulted in 30 % <i>higher</i> yield for video ads than photo ads with a <i>lower</i> CPM .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>From billion-dollar automotive firms to startups to niche mobile gaming companies , Facebook video ad campaigns have <i>greater</i> value and yield <i>better</i> results for advertisers than traditional advertising campaigns .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> Facebook can energize advertiser enthusiasm through these video ads , capitalizing of a digital ad spend shift while charging a premium for targeted video ad optionality .  (Uncertainty) </span>Because of this, we see video ads propelling strong ARPU growth over the next 5-10 years.Facebook has a clean balance sheet that has a lot of strength and actually eases high valuation concerns.The company has $16.95 billion in current assets on $1.88 billion in current liabilities, giving the company healthy liquidity and working capital of $15.07 billion.The company has total liabilities of $4.68 billion, giving Facebook a NCAV of $12.27 billion.Cash and marketable securities totaled $14.12 billion MRQ, while debt totaled $149 million, giving the company net cash MRQ of $13.98 billion.Stockholders' equity totaled $39.45 billion MRQ.Using a $291 billion market-cap, Facebook is trading at 19.3x WC, 23.7x NCAV, 20.8x net cash, and 7.4x book value.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While these multiples are <i>higher</i> than normal , we <b>believe</b> they are actually attractive multiples for a stock with high-growth potential like FB .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>When actually considering Facebook's valuation, we are not deterred by it relative to other high-growth comps.For our analysis, we take the FANG group to understand Facebook's multiples.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Facebook is <i>more</i> cheaply priced than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and NFLX ( Netflix ) from a P/E standpoint , both forward and trailing , while it 's <i>more</i> expensive than Alphabet ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) from both metrics . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>On a P/FCF basis , Facebook is trading at only a slightly <i>richer</i> valuation than <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , a company that is inconsistently profitable and whose valuation is driven by a negative cash conversion cycle which fuels strong cash flow . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Facebook has a profit margin that rivals Alphabet 's profit margin and is much <i>higher</i> than Netflix and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's profit margins . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Moreover, Facebook has had the fastest growing revenues in the FANG group for the past two years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>FB Profit Margin ( TTM ) data by YCharts All things considered , we actually do not <b>believe</b> Facebook 's valuation is a deterrent at these levels .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> that , if anything , Facebook 's fundamentals and growth support a much <i>higher</i> valuation .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> long-term MAU growth will be driven by <i>higher</i> global internet penetration .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Higher</i> global internet penetration will in turn be fueled by urbanization and increased smartphone adoption .  (Surprise) </span>A growing percentage of the global population has access to the Internet.Whereas the world population is growing at just over a 1% CAGR since 2000, the global Internet population has grown at a 15% CAGR in that same time frame.In 2000, global Internet penetration was merely 6.7%.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By 2005 , that number had <i>more</i> than doubled to 15.8 % and now stands at 40.4 % , representing about a 240 basis point increase per year since 2000 .  (Surprise) </span>We expect to see continued growth in global Internet penetration driven by urbanization and smartphone adoption in developing economies.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Adoption of the iPhone 6s and Plus has been <b>surprisingly</b> strong , and urbanization is rapidly occurring on a global basis .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In 2014 , <b>roughly</b> 54 % of the world 's population lived in urban areas , and the global urban mix is expected to increase to 66 % by 2050 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Studies show that urbanization coupled with global population growth will mean an extra 2.5 billion people living in urban areas by 2050.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Roughly</b> 90 % of that growth will be attributed to Asia and Africa .  (Uncertainty) </span>This urbanization of formerly rural areas will bolster the global Internet penetration rate as many formerly non-Internet users will now have access to the Internet.For these reasons, we expect to see continued strong Facebook MAU growth in Europe, APAC and the rest of the world.Due to falling off popularity of Facebook among US millennials per the Piper Jaffray survey, we do not see Facebook drastically growing mind share in the US.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> our worldwide MAU projections fall in-line with our qualitative sentiment that Facebook should continue to garner <i>more</i> market share .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In 2010 , <b>roughly</b> 30 % of the world 's Internet population used Facebook .  (Uncertainty) </span>By 2014, Facebook's global Internet market share had grown to 47.6%.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> global Internet penetration can grow 100 to 200 basis points per year into 2025 , down from 240 basis points per year from 2000 to 2014 , and we see the global Internet penetration rate being 47 % in 2020 and 51 % in 2025 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using UN population estimates , this equates to <b>roughly</b> 3.6 billion Internet users in 2020 and 4.1 billion Internet users in 2025 .  (Uncertainty) </span>Our worldwide MAU estimates put Facebook's market share at 61% and 61.5% in 2020 and 2025, respectively.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> this is consistent with Facebook 's current growing market share trend .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As discussed <i>earlier</i> , we <b>believe</b> targeted video ad campaigns will enable Facebook to charge <i>more</i> for advertising space and drive healthy ARPU growth , especially in Europe and APAC where ARPU is still markedly <i>lower</i> .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We see US and Canada ARPU growing healthily into 2017 , driven by high demand for Facebook video ads , but <b>believe</b> ARPU growth will slow as price saturation occurs .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We see the same slowing happening in Europe and APAC into 2025 , but <b>believe</b> those growth rates will be <i>higher</i> as ARPU is dramatically <i>lower</i> in those geographies than domestically .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Facebook defines ARPU as the total revenue during the period divided by the average of MAUs at the end of the period and MAUs at the beginning of the period.Using our ARPU and MAU forecasts above, we can create a full 10-year Facebook revenue forecast model.This model can be seen below.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We see the Facebook platform alone netting $ 61.76 billion in worldwide revenues by 2025 , with US and Canada , Europe and APAC contributing <b>roughly</b> $ 18-19 billion each and the rest of the world contributing $ 4.7 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Considering the global mobile advertising market will be just under $ 200 billion in 2019 and the global ad market is set to top $ 600 billion this year , we <b>believe</b> our target for $ 61.76 billion in revenues by 2025 is reasonable ( Facebook platform only ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As previously discussed , we <b>believe</b> Instagram will add billions of dollars in revenue to the Facebook business .  (Uncertainty) </span>We see Instagram adding $1.5 billion in 2016 revenues and $3 billion in 2017 revenues.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> Instagram will grow quickly into a $ 6 billion revenue business by 2020 ( many analysts are looking for $ 5.8 billion ) , and then grow <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> inline with Facebook ad revenues .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>We see Instagram netting $9.5 billion in revenues by 2025.This is driven by strong millennial adoption, user scale and a shift to digital ad spend.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For our model , we <b>assume</b> no other forms of monetization ( i.e. no revenue from WhatsApp ) .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Under these assumptions , we <b>believe</b> net revenue for 2016 will be $ 24.85 billion , above the consensus for $ 23.35 billion but below the high estimate of $ 26.38 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>We expect net revenues to be $48.19 billion by 2020 and $71.31 billion by 2025.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><i>Higher</i> GAAP expenses this year are being driven by stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to WhatsApp and other acquisitions , and considering the terms of the $ 19 billion WhatsApp deal included 177.8 million shares of Class A common stock ( at a $ 100 quote , that is <b>roughly</b> $ 17.78 billion ) , we do not see stock-based comp easing on margins in the near future .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Management is guiding for $ 3 to $ 3.3 billion in 2015 stock comp , with <b>roughly</b> half of that from the WhatsApp deal .  (Uncertainty) </span>At $1.5 billion per year in stock comp toward the WhatsApp deal, Facebook's stock compensation will likely not ease until after 2025.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Margins also are being weakened by FX headwinds , and we <b>believe</b> these are non-terminal headwinds .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As these ease in the coming years , we <b>believe</b> operating margins should expand back to a 40 % rate .  (Uncertainty) </span>We model for a 44% tax-rate.FB Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts Because Facebook reports and trades off of non-GAAP EPS, we reconcile our net income to non-GAAP using the following reconciliation, which is driven largely by stock comp and amortization.Our model calls for non-GAAP 2016E EPS of $3.03.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This is markedly <i>higher</i> than the consensus outlook for $ 2.75 but shy of the high estimate for $ 3.07 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> non-GAAP EPS will grow at a 9.5 % CAGR into 2025 .  (Uncertainty) </span>We apply a 40x multiple to our non-GAAP 2016E EPS of $3.03 to arrive at a $121 price target for shares of FB.FB's current trailing P/E multiple of 105x is a 374% premium to the market's 22x P/E multiple, but FB is trading at 37.6x forward earnings.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We <b>believe</b> that if Facebook can beat estimates and ramp up Instagram revenue the way we expect them to , then the market will reward FB with a <i>higher</i> multiple .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> a 40x multiple is fair for a stock that has monetization potential beyond the $ 71 billion we expect by 2025 .  (Uncertainty) </span>To arrive at a fair value for shares of FB, we use a 10-year DCF with unlevered free cash flows and a WACC discount rate.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Many of our assumptions for this model have already been explained in our earnings model , but herein we expect depreciation and amortization to be around 90 % of a capex that we expect to be <b>roughly</b> $ 3.5-4 .0 billion per year , which will support a <i>more</i> complex data center , network and server infrastructure .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> shares of FB are worth $ 113 today .  (Uncertainty) </span>Using CAPM as a guide, we arrive at a cost equity of 5.96%.The company has only $149 million debt vs. a diluted market cap of $294.4 billion, so the WACC is by-and-large the cost of equity.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>assume</b> a neutral sentiment 2 % FCFF perpetuity rate to arrive at an enterprise value of $ 307.19 billion .  (Uncertainty) </span>Adding in MRQ net cash of $13.976 billion, we arrive at a fair value $321.168 billion.On a diluted share count of 2.85 billion, this equates to fair value just shy of $113 per share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>believe</b> increased digital ad spend , a boosted video ads platform , and Instagram monetization will fuel a strong Q3 ER .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Given our fair value analysis and the action in the options market , we <b>believe</b> shares of Facebook are ready to trend toward $ 113 post-earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>We see shares trending toward $121 in a one-year window.Our model importantly does not include potential revenues from WhatsApp but does include GAAP expenses such as amortization and stock comp from the WhatsApp deal.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore , if Facebook monetizes WhatsApp successfully , the fair value of FB shares will be north of $ 113 .
