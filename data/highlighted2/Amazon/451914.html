From <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> - Amazon.com , Inc. ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha The retail sector has been crushed over the last year due to brick and mortar stores getting crushed by <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> . But now <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> has made it clear they want a brick and mortar presence in NYC to sell , of all things , books . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We believe this is proof that our `` hybrid model '' <b>predictions</b> of the past are likely true and that brick and mortar retail , while wounded , will never die in full .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And you thought that Barnes and Noble going bust was a sign that there would be no <i>more</i> Waldenbooks in the mall and no <i>more</i> real brick and mortar book sales .  (Surprise) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is flipping the sector on its head and proving us all wrong . Retail has been one of the worst performing sectors over the course of the last year.The reason for this is pure and simple: online retailing is taking a huge bite out of traditional brick and mortar retailers.Companies like Sears, Macy's and Nordstrom have seen estimates get slashed as in-store traffic continues to decline due to the golden age of online retailing.The obvious pioneer in massive online retailing conglomerates is Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's growth over a five-year period when charted next to traditional retailers tells the whole story without getting into the financials behind the company 's dominance . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Newer</i> online retailers in specialty parts of the retail sector , like Wayfair ( NYSE : W ) , have also popped up .  (Surprise) </span>These companies have adopted the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> model and are also part of the plague that is crushing traditional brick and mortar retailers . We have seen a slew of in-store retailers that were based in mall settings go bankrupt over the last few years, including RadioShack and The Wet Seal.Aeropostale was the most recent company to declare bankruptcy and other retailers that rely heavily on mall traffic have underperformed the sector as well.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Almost</b> every mall-based name we looked at was down over the last 12-month period .  (Uncertainty) </span>We have long been arguing that the endgame for the retail sector is going to be a hybrid model of mostly online with strategic brick and mortar distribution/retail sale points globally.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>As we said during our article about Dick 's Sporting Goods <i>earlier</i> this week , there are some things that people just want to buy in person , either because they need to see and feel out the item , or because they want the instant gratification of owning it immediately .  (Surprise) </span>This is why companies like <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> see the next step as `` same day delivery . '' This is where online retailing and brick and mortar merge together and you get a gray area.There are benefits of having items delivered the same day just as there are benefits of you picking them out yourself.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>While both sides of the retailing spectrum will still need to revert <i>more</i> towards a 50/50 distribution of this model , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> recently proved to us that in-store brick-and-mortar retailers <b>may</b> not be dead just yet . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It was announced yesterday that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is opening up retail book distribution locations , with its second one slated for NYC . Time Money wrote , Good news for New York City bookworms : <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> plans to open a physical store in the Big Apple . <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Books will open in Hudson Yards , a large commercial and residential space located on the west side of Manhattan , the New York Post reported . The store -- the first physical <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> location on the East Coast -- is slated to open in late 2018 or early 2019 . The first <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Books opened in November 2015 in Seattle , the same city as the online retailer 's headquarters . The company was so tight-lipped about the news that the development was nicknamed Project Anne.Though an <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> spokesperson declined to comment on a New York store , the company did say it will open a second location in San Diego later this year . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>This news further validates our assertion that a hybrid model is going to be necessary , and it also makes a key point to us : retail stores will not need to close down entirely , rather just incorporate <i>more</i> online sales into their business .  (Surprise) </span>For companies like Macy's, for instance, this is a great sign.Macy's is an example of a traditional retailer that is doing all of the right things to try and make the shift necessary to implement a hybrid model.Online sales are moving in the right direction; the company is strategically closing down some stores; it is going to be leveraging its real estate soon; and it is still generating cash.The endgame for Macy's is not going to be to close down all retail locations and just implement an online model, it is going to be a mix between the two.On the other hand, companies like TJX are flourishing in getting consumers in the store because of the limited selection of on-sale items that they have.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They are enticing consumers by leading them to <b>believe</b> they are going on a treasure hunt to get them into stores .  (Uncertainty) </span>This is a model that has worked very effectively for TJX so far, but we are sure the TJX is going to need to introduce an online component to its business at some point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We wrote this weekend in an article about DKS that we thought the retail sector <b>may</b> be hitting a little bit of a bottom here .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The average price to earnings ratio in the sector is now around 10X , and the XRT looks to have finally hit <b>somewhat</b> of a baseline at around $ 40 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>If what <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is telling us is true , we do not expect too much <i>more</i> multiple compression in retail , at least from the cash-generating businesses with decent foundations and decent balance sheets . (Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>M PE Ratio ( Forward ) data by YCharts Companies that are extremely levered , like Sports Authority was , will still have trouble in an all-retail environment , which is why we <b>believe</b> investors need to be very picky about the retail stocks they do wind up involving themselves with .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One thing is for sure and that is the death of retail is not as sure of a thing as some financial websites and publications might have you <b>believe</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's moving to in-store distribution and book sales tells us that there is a baseline necessary for a brick and mortar presence , even if it is mostly used for distribution purposes and for sales purposes as a supplemental part of the business . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Companies like Macy 's and Dick 's with a strong retail presence is and real estate assets have a firm enough foundation that we believe <b>could</b> be worth a look at .
