class='textDiv'>Proof That Brick And Mortar Retail Isnt DeadFrom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha The retail sector has been crushed over the last year due to brick and mortar stores getting crushed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>But now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has made it clear they want a brick and mortar presence in NYC to sell of all things books We believe this is proof that our hybrid model predictions of the past are likely true and that brick and mortar retail while wounded will never die in full And you thought that Barnes and Noble going bust was a sign that there would be no more Waldenbooks in the mall and no more real brick and mortar book sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is flipping the sector on its head and proving us all wrong Retail has been one of the worst performing sectors over the course of the last year The reason for this is pure and simple online retailing is taking a huge bite out of traditional brick and mortar retailers Companies like Sears Macys and Nordstrom have seen estimates get slashed as instore traffic continues to decline due to the golden age of online retailing The obvious pioneer in massive online retailing conglomerates is Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN Amazons growth over a fiveyear period when charted next to traditional retailers tells the whole story without getting into the financials behind the companys dominance Newer online retailers in specialty parts of the retail sector like Wayfair NYSE W have also popped up These companies have adopted the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>model and are also part of the plague that is crushing traditional brick and mortar retailers We have seen a slew of instore retailers that were based in mall settings go bankrupt over the last few years including RadioShack and The Wet Seal Aeropostale was the most recent company to declare bankruptcy and other retailers that rely heavily on mall traffic have underperformed the sector as well Almost every mallbased name we looked at was down over the last month period We have long been arguing that the endgame for the retail sector is going to be a hybrid model of mostly online with strategic brick and mortar distributionretail sale points globally As we said during our article about Dicks Sporting Goods earlier this week there are some things that people just want to buy in person either because they need to see and feel out the item or because they want the instant gratification of owning it immediately This is why companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>see the next step as same day delivery This is where online retailing and brick and mortar merge together and you get a gray area There are benefits of having items delivered the same day just as there are benefits of you picking them out yourself While both sides of the retailing spectrum will still need to revert more towards a distribution of this model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>recently proved to us that instore brickandmortar retailers may not be dead just yet It was announced yesterday that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is opening up retail book distribution locations with its second one slated for NYC Time Money wrote Good news for New York City bookworms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>plans to open a physical store in the Big Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Books will open in Hudson Yards a large commercial and residential space located on the west side of Manhattan the New York Post reported The store the first physical <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>location on the East Coast is slated to open in late or early The first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Books opened in November in Seattle the same city as the online retailers headquarters The company was so tightlipped about the news that the development was nicknamed Project Anne Though an <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>spokesperson declined to comment on a New York store the company did say it will open a second location in San Diego later this year This news further validates our assertion that a hybrid model is going to be necessary and it also makes a key point to us retail stores will not need to close down entirely rather just incorporate more online sales into their business For companies like Macys for instance this is a great sign Macys is an example of a traditional retailer that is doing all of the right things to try and make the shift necessary to implement a hybrid model Online sales are moving in the right direction the company is strategically closing down some stores it is going to be leveraging its real estate soon and it is still generating cash The endgame for Macys is not going to be to close down all retail locations and just implement an online model it is going to be a mix between the two On the other hand companies like TJX are flourishing in getting consumers in the store because of the limited selection of onsale items that they have They are enticing consumers by leading them to believe they are going on a treasure hunt to get them into stores This is a model that has worked very effectively for TJX so far but we are sure the TJX is going to need to introduce an online component to its business at some point We wrote this weekend in an article about DKS that we thought the retail sector may be hitting a little bit of a bottom here The average price to earnings ratio in the sector is now around X and the XRT looks to have finally hit somewhat of a baseline at around If what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is telling us is true we do not expect too much more multiple compression in retail at least from the cashgenerating businesses with decent foundations and decent balance sheets M PE Ratio Forward data by YCharts Companies that are extremely levered like Sports Authority was will still have trouble in an allretail environment which is why we believe investors need to be very picky about the retail stocks they do wind up involving themselves with One thing is for sure and that is the death of retail is not as sure of a thing as some financial websites and publications might have you believe Amazons moving to instore distribution and book sales tells us that there is a baseline necessary for a brick and mortar presence even if it is mostly used for distribution purposes and for sales purposes as a supplemental part of the business Companies like Macys and Dicks with a strong retail presence is and real estate assets have a firm enough foundation that we believe could be worth a look at I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long
