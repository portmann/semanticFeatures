( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha We looked into the seasonality of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and found some interesting and hugely profitable investment strategies . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At first appearance , February <b>seems</b> to be <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's underperforming month . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>After pointing out that last week was the time to buy Facebook ( NASDAQ : FB ) ( and being right so far to the tune of 7 % ) , I received the following message : The request for `` the same analysis '' on <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) is one where we look for a strategy superior to buy and hold for this company 's stock . Interestingly enough, Seeking Alpha contributor Dana Blankenhorn argued you should buy and hold AMZN on Wednesday.While he got the fundamentals right - cloud is the future of <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , just as it is for Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) - he did n't justify the `` buy and hold '' part . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In Dana 's defense , the article is <i>more</i> of a long thesis than a reasoning for buy and hold .  (Surprise) </span>So let's ask the question: Should we buy and hold?Is buy and hold really the best strategy for AMZN investors?Or does AMZN, like Facebook, have seasonality you can leverage for extra gains?Let's start by looking at AMZN's performance over the past 19 years - segmenting the stock by monthly performance.The retail sector is a seasonal one , so we should suspect <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> to be seasonal as well . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We find a couple of interesting patterns : AMZN <b>seems</b> to have the pattern of underperforming in February .  (Uncertainty) </span>In addition, its best months tend to be March and April, much like the best months for Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ).February has witnessed drawdowns close to 50%, whereas March and April show the lowest max drawdowns: 5% and 20% respectively.The months of March, September and November seem to be the safest, with over 70% of those months showing positive returns.September and November have the best average returns, giving 10% and 9%, respectively, on average.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>These monthly patterns give us the first <b>possible</b> strategy for an alternative to buy and hold .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> we should ensure we hold AMZN during March , April , September and November .  (Uncertainty) </span>But as I've found in the past, much of these seasonal patterns relate to earnings.So, let's take a look at how AMZN responds to the company's earnings.A quick look at AMZN 's earnings reports show EPS tends to spike the most during Q4 : In addition , the most recent earnings report shows <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is back on the offensive . Previously , <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> was in a negative EPS rut . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> <b>seems</b> to have shaken off this rut in the last fiscal quarter , pointing to an increasingly bullish AMZN . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>We should note that the last earnings report was received negatively, dropping the stock 7%.This was merely due to a failure to meet estimates, not a failure in the fundamentals of the company.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We can deal with this in <i>more</i> depth in a future Exposing Earnings newsletter .  (Surprise) </span>But for now , note that <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> is likely back on the offensive . Therefore, any long strategy that exceeds buy and hold should work moving forward.The question is whether such a strategy exists.Dropping one month per year from our AMZN position cuts our gains in half.Cool, right?No.Even when we hold AMZN during the two safest months per year, we lose a disproportionate amount of gains.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Still , this strategy beats the SPY , so it 's not bad for an investor with a risk-aversion tendency who still wants some <b>exposure</b> to AMZN .  (Uncertainty) </span>This strategy is simply the previous strategy with the addition of holding through December.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Again we beat the SPY and see a <i>more</i> extreme risk/reward profile .  (Surprise) </span>Holding the month surrounding Q4 earnings If you're looking for a way to lose money by holding onto AMZN, you've found it.Holding the stock to capture Q4 earnings is a losing strategy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , it 's <b>probably</b> a great short strategy on this otherwise iron-plated stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This gives way to another <b>possible</b> strategy : avoiding the month of Q4 earnings : ... and there it is : the holy grail of AMZN investing .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>By avoiding the month around the Q4 earnings release , you gain 300 % the yield of buy-and-hold , which <i>more</i> than makes up for the potential tax losses in selling one month per year .  (Surprise) </span>Why does AMZN struggle so much during Q4 earnings releases?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As we saw from the last earnings release , it is likely a result of overly <b>optimistic</b> analysts .  (Uncertainty) </span>In Exposing Earnings, I frequently mention that most analyst estimates are consistently biased; you should ignore EPS and revenue estimates in most cases.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Let 's do one <i>more</i> thing before concluding .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Let 's take a look at a trading strategy for a <i>more</i> daring investor : Short AMZN around Q4 earnings ; long AMZN otherwise : What you 're looking at above is a 100 % <b>exposure</b> strategy that brings 400 % <i>more</i> profits than buy and hold .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>But it's not for the faint of heart, as the short position puts you at a theoretically unlimited list.I recommend the following instead: Now your AMZN gains are not subject to income taxes and you still gain the upside from the short position.Happy trading.My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this newsletter , we employ both fundamental and pattern analyses to <b>predict</b> price movements of specific companies after specific earnings .
