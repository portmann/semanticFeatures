Therefore, any long strategy that exceeds buy and hold should work moving forward.The question is whether such a strategy exists.Dropping one month per year from our AMZN position cuts our gains in half.Cool, right?No.Even when we hold AMZN during the two safest months per year, we lose a disproportionate amount of gains.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Still , this strategy beats the SPY , so it 's not bad for an investor with a risk-aversion tendency who still wants some <b>exposure</b> to AMZN .  (Uncertainty) </span>This strategy is simply the previous strategy with the addition of holding through December.Again we beat the SPY and see a more extreme risk/reward profile.Holding the month surrounding Q4 earnings If you're looking for a way to lose money by holding onto AMZN, you've found it.Holding the stock to capture Q4 earnings is a losing strategy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact , it 's <b>probably</b> a great short strategy on this otherwise iron-plated stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This gives way to another <b>possible</b> strategy : avoiding the month of Q4 earnings : ... and there it is : the holy grail of AMZN investing .  (Uncertainty) </span>By avoiding the month around the Q4 earnings release, you gain 300% the yield of buy-and-hold, which more than makes up for the potential tax losses in selling one month per year.Why does AMZN struggle so much during Q4 earnings releases?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As we saw from the last earnings release , it is likely a result of overly <b>optimistic</b> analysts .  (Uncertainty) </span>In Exposing Earnings, I frequently mention that most analyst estimates are consistently biased; you should ignore EPS and revenue estimates in most cases.Let's do one more thing before concluding.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Let 's take a look at a trading strategy for a more daring investor : Short AMZN around Q4 earnings ; long AMZN otherwise : What you 're looking at above is a 100 % <b>exposure</b> strategy that brings 400 % more profits than buy and hold .  (Uncertainty) </span>But it's not for the faint of heart, as the short position puts you at a theoretically unlimited list.I recommend the following instead: Now your AMZN gains are not subject to income taxes and you still gain the upside from the short position.Happy trading.My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In this newsletter , we employ both fundamental and pattern analyses to <b>predict</b> price movements of specific companies after specific earnings .
