( NASDAQ : NFLX ) | Seeking Alpha NFLX will report earnings after market with consensus expecting $ 0.02 in EPS and $ 2.0 b in revenue .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'><i>Slower</i> domestic subs trend and increased competition will weigh on the stock .  (Surprise) </span>Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) will report earnings after the market close.Consensus expects $0.02 in EPS and $2.11b in revenue.The stock is down -12 % since its Q1 earnings compared with +2 % growth for the Nasdaq as the market is clearly concerned about the weak domestic subs growth and increased competition from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , which recently rolled out its own OTT product . <span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although the <i>broader</i> macro environment continues to support NFLX given the viewership transition from pay TV to online , I continue to be <b>cautious</b> on NFLX due to the growing competitive environment , rising content inflation and questionable overseas expansion .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the company is making the right moves by shifting focus to in-house development and original content , such strategy will require increased investment as the hurdle for creating the next hit show gets <i>higher</i> ( i.e. , House of Cards Season 4 was not as good as Season 3 ) .  (Surprise) </span>Domestic subs growth will likely remain challenged due to the growing competition from alternative OTT providers such as Hulu, AMZN, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) ( Google 2016 Outlook: The Changing Face Of TV ) and HBO, which have been partially responsible for the decelerating domestic subs growth over the past several quarters.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The recent decision by AMZN to introduce a standalone OTT service magnifies the <b>risk</b> profile that NFLX faces .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Although AMZN 's content library is still <i>smaller</i> relative to that of NFLX with <i>smaller</i> geographic footprint , AMZN 's execution on several original contents is a good indication of its future success in my view and this poses a threat to NFLX in the long term .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>( <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 2016 Outlook : Ready For Prime Time ) <i>More</i> important to the NFLX story is the growth in its international subs , which I believe <b>could</b> see significant headwinds in the target markets that NFLX is targeting . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In Europe, AMZN reported to be rolling out its own standalone OTT service in France, Spain and Portugal that puts itself in direct competition against NFLX.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Although AMZN may not succeed to taking subs share from NFLX in these regions given its <i>smaller</i> content library , I believe that AMZN <b>could</b> be competitive if it bundles its OTT product with its Prime membership to make the service even <i>more</i> compelling .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This <b>could</b> potentially lead to a pull back by consumers on NFLX as they gravitate towards AMZN , which offers a <i>more</i> attractive value proposition with both OTT service and ecommerce .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In India, NFLX made good inroads (see - Netflix: First Dance With The Elephants ), but the competitive environment is becoming increasingly competitive, particularly from the incumbent Eros (NYSE: EROS ), which is widely considered to be NFLX of India.I note that EROS currently has 44m streaming users in the country and is the clear leader in the space.Just recently, EROS has partnered with telecommunication providers IDEA and Airtel for OTT distribution partnership, giving the incumbent access to half of India's wireless users.Additionally, NFLX faces competition from Reliance Communications and Singapore-based Hooq given that they have been operating in India for some time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>In China , NFLX continues to look for inroads , but without a qualified partner or NFLX making a sacrifice by taking on <i>lower</i> revenue share it would be difficult to break into the market ( see - Netflix : Eyes On China ) .  (Surprise) </span>A logical partner would be Leeco, formerly known as LeTV, which has a wide distribution network and deep penetration of smart TVs and smartphones in China.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>LeTV has the tendency to bundle its hardware and content to drive user adoption , and NFLX <b>could</b> potentially ride on LeTV 's hardware footprint to expand its presence in China .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>However , similar to any other Chinese partnership , NFLX <b>could</b> potentially be entitled to <i>less</i> than half of the revenue share , and this will require multi-year investments by NFLX in the country in order to produce meaningful long-term ROI .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I would remain <b>cautious</b> on NFLX and prefer content holders to be the best way to play the <i>broader</i> OTT theme for two reasons .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>First, content holders are the key beneficiary of the OTT trend given the growing number of new entrants wanting to acquire award winning TV shows or movies to draw audience to their platform, leading to gradual content inflation.Second, content holders or studios with content catered to the global audience base stands to benefit from potential M&As from well-funded Chinese bidders.I note that recent reports on potential Paramount sale to Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ), or Wanda are good indications that quality US studios will be heavily sought after as the Chinese look to ramp up on their own content library.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Services , Music & Video Stores, Earnings</div></body></html>
