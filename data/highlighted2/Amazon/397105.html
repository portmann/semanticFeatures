forever you say And I agree A slowdown was inevitable particularly as the smartphone market matures and starts to shift from just upselling to getting new customers who already have phones and are holding onto them longer If last week wasnt a wakeup call that theres something amiss in Cupertino I dont know what is Im not talking about the fact that Apples NASDAQ AAPL Chinese love fest seems to be on the rocks or that iPhone sales tanked Nope Its the fact that Apple cant give us one meaningful statistic on how well all of its postJobs initiatives are really doing And that the companys efforts to feed us tiny crumbs of positive news are beginning to look more lame every earnings call I know you know Im going to get to Apple Pay which is what everyone in the payments and commerce business really cares about But first hold on while I share some stats on just what a horrible first quarter Apple had and what it really means about the companys standing Compared to the first quarter of iPhone revenues were down a pretty dramatic percent And it wasnt just currency fluctuations Actually unit sales were down percent as in the number of iPhones sold Apple made billion less on iPhones in Q than in Q OK part of the plummet is due to the surge in sales in Q from the iPhone which tapped into the pentup demand for a largerscreen phone But only part of it iPad revenues were down percent too while Mac sales only declined by percent Overall the sales of Apples flagship products all products sprung from the genius of Steve Jobs were down percent The company didnt just have its first revenue decline in years It had a massive blowout A holymolyyikeswhatintheworldjusthappened decline A stunning reversal of fortune Even after you add the gains from the cats and dogs the ones I really want to focus on Apple revenue was down percent quarter over quarter for a total decline of billion Then theres what happened in China Revenues in Greater China were down billion for an overall decline of percent Last week we also learned that China in its crackdown on even more foreign influence shuttered iTunes and iBooks Thats on top of a number of other things that the Chinese government is doing that should make all foreign companies trying to do business there shake in their shoes Like the Chinese government becoming investors in Internet companies like Tencent OTCPKTCEHY and Alibaba NYSE BABA and demanding board sites to monitor them and presumably keep them in line Any company now that is in the media or communications business whether foreign or Chinese has a target on their back The Chinese Communist Party is determined to clamp down dissent No wonder Carl Icahn dumped all million of his shares of Apple stock in a down market His reading of the tea leaves must see it getting nothing but worse Its also why we took the position last week that Ant Financials IPO could end up being a big fizzle Now I hear you Apple has been so incredibly successful and innovative that there was no way the explosive growth could go on forever you say And I agree A slowdown was inevitable particularly as the smartphone market matures and starts to shift from just upselling people to getting new customers who already have phones and are holding onto them longer and who need a really really good reason to dump them more quickly But folks lets be clear Were not talking slowdown here Were talking about the company doing a complete reversal and walking way backwards In fact the news was so bad that Im hoping that Ill start getting less hate mail from Apples fanboys when I express skepticism about Apples payments strategy Speaking of which if you thought youd actually learn anything real about how Apple Pay is doing last week hopefully by now you realize that you didnt learn much at all Apple talks about Apple Pay a lot The company features it in ads for the phones It trots it out as one of its great innovations Theres a constant string of press releases about it rolling out here or there globally with Amex NYSE AXP which we all know has very little acceptance globally But I digress Just try to get any information at all from Apple on how it is doing Just more head fakes which I will get to soon Everyone in payments knows that you measure the success of a payments system by the share of the volume its getting Thats what every payments company reports If you want to know how PayPal NASDAQ PYPL Visa NYSE V MasterCard NYSE MA Discover Financial Services NYSE DFS or American Express AXP are doing its a matter of public record They report the dollars or whatever currency that consumers are actually spending using that payment method and what merchants are actually receiving when they do Any other statistic might be interesting but payments volume is the name of the payments game and the data point that everyone wants Eighteen months after the launch of Apple Pay youd sooner get the secret method for hacking iPhones from these guys than payment volume on Apple Pay It is widely known in the payments industry that the fraction of payments going through Apple Pay in the US is miniscule The PYMNTScom data analytics team has estimated that it is probably on the order of about sixtenths of percent of total card volume in the United States And look if Apple thinks we have this wrong all they need to do is tell us and the world what their volume is and well know whether our estimate is too high too low or right on the money Now heres the head fake Tim Cook did claim that Apple Pay was doing great because it was getting a million user activations a month Wow you say That means that by the end of this year Apple Pay will have more than million active users Holy Apple Pay and mobile payments Batman But here is where those numbers might be coming from When you upgrade your iOS operating system which you are prompted to do like three times a day now you also are reminded how easy it is to save your iTunes card to the Apple Wallet if you havent already All one has to do is enter the CVV and voila ones Apple Pay wallet is activated and ready for use Activated and active by those standards is quite different from how most everyone else in the world defines active which equates to usage and usually more than once Of course since the company controls the operating system and much of what goes on the phone it can really push Apple Pay in a way no other thirdparty wallet could At the end of the day though even Apple cant make a consumer whip out their phone to pay The consumer needs to decide that In fact it doesnt matter whether every single one of the millions of Apple iPhone users activates their Apple Pay account if they dont actually use it when they are standing at a terminal that takes Apple Pay Our PYMNTScom data analytics team based on a series of surveys weve done of iPhone S users for the last months knows the answer to that The odds that a person with an iPhone that supports Apple Pay standing to pay facing a terminal where they could use Apple Pay actually puts that transaction on Apple Pay is a stunningly low To put it more bluntly out of people that could pay with Apple Pay choose not to when given the opportunity And that figure hasnt budged much over Apple Pays first months In fact if anything the propensity of use of Apple Pay has actually declined People are actively choosing not to use it Again this is based on surveys and are therefore estimates But Apple has the real data on how many times people who have activated Apple Pay use it to pay All the company has to do is share the facts and then no one will need to actually estimate things But right now the company hype over Apple Pay combined with the utter lack of transparency on how it is doing should give investors a lot of concern especially since it was presented as that One More Thing that was going to propel Apple forward And especially when combined with quantifiable evidence that its not doing all that great Take Apple Music It has clearly done well because unlike Apple Pay Tim Cook crows about numbers that mean something like how many people actually subscribe to Apple Music After only nine months it has gotten million paid subscribers By comparison it took Spotify Private MUSIC about five years to get that many paid subscribers According to Cook Apple Music got million new paid subscribers in the last two months This is great news for Apple Today the Swedish streaming company has about million paid subscribers so Apple is likely to be at least half as big as Spotify in its first year of operation So then why am I being such a crank Well Apple started Apple Music in part because its paid download business was getting creamed It needed a streaming music service to account for the shift in music consumption from downloading to streaming Its why the company spent billion to buy Beats in But what really matters is how Apples digital music business is doing Are the gains from Apple Music more than enough to compensate for the decline in music downloads Funny thing the company doesnt report that in its financials either Instead Apple Music sales are clumped with revenues from the Apple App Store iTunes Apple Pay and other in a big Services group Now Apple Services is doing great with a percent increase from Q to Q Apple picked up about billion of extra revenue quarter over quarter from Services But more than half of that million came from a onetime patent litigation settlement from Samsung OTCSSNLF while the rest came from an increase in Apple App Store and Apple Care revenues So its hard to know from the financials whether the company is growing its digital music business holding its own or easing the decline our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline So what that says is that Apple Music has managed to reverse the free fall of Apples flagship music business that Jobs started in the early s Thats a great weve stopped the decline story but not such a hot we have an engine of growth story Then theres the Apple Watch More so than Apple Pay this was supposed to have been the killer new product for the company and a driver of future growth It has been in the market for about a year now And darn if you can find out from Apple really how it is doing What weve observed is that Apple has discounted the Watch a number of times something it never does with its products suggesting that it needs to discount the product to get it to move Analysts have given it a rather backhanded compliment too by saying that its the best seller in a category that overall isnt setting the world on fire On the earnings conference Cook revealed that they sold more Apple Watches in the first year than they sold iPhones in the first year but he didnt give any hard numbers I guess thats supposed to suggest that the Apple Watch could do as well as the iPhone but the comparison seems a bit off base When Apple first introduced the iPhone it was really only appealing to hardcore early adopters The Internet was slow on the phone because cellular networks hadnt upgraded yet to G there werent very many apps and the app ecosystem was just getting started The battery life was horrible and the phone wasnt even very good for making phone calls Not many other than the hardcore would put up with those rather significant tradeoffs By contrast the Apple Watch was introduced as a complement to the iPhone something that every iPhone user should want to have at a time when there is a highly developed app ecosystem and millions of Apple lovers eager for the next big thing from the company Things have not exactly gone according to that plan A year is too quick to write off the Apple Watch Maybe someone will develop a killer app for it Or some subsequent version will tickle the fancy of people But look around There arent a lot of people wearing Apple Watches Silicon Valley residents excluded of course Many of those gifted or received last Christmas Ill bet are neatly tucked away in dresser drawers an expensive novelty and trendy gift that was fun for a while Were seeing a pattern with Apple The company introduces a new product The hype machine goes into overdrive Early evidence points to problems with sales A cone of silence over actual data on adoption comes down combined with dribbles of positive but largely irrelevant information Apples fans in the media start talking about how the adoption of the iPhone or iPod was slow too and they became successful so this or that new product will too But I suspect that last weeks earning bust will put an end to the denial that theres something amiss in Cupertino Its not just this or that product that has been a disappointment its been the whole string of them Its becoming increasingly clear that Apple can no longer draft off the genius of Jobs His roadmap has run its course as it was bound to do and is no longer capable of keeping the revenue engine humming the way it once did Device sales are only as good as the utility that its apps and ecosystem delivers The vision that drove Apple to think differently about what would really make a dent in the universe seems to have gone missing Its Time To Make A Dent In The Universe Apple Pay I think illustrates this best It was introduced in as the companys big hope a cure for the many failed attempts by many others before it that tried to get consumers to use mobile devices to pay for things in a physical store That experience Apple and Tim Cook surmised would make the iPhone an elegant and essential solution for the group of customers who drive a disproportionate amount of consumer spend And Apple Pay is elegant and is a very slick way of integrating payment into a mobile device But theres just one problem Apple misjudged the degree to which instore and plastic cards werent very big consumer payments pain point And how merchants activating NFC was The company also whiffed on what really did cause consumers pain and still does buying online and via mobile devices also largely ignoring the field of very powerful players with traction and clever ways to help consumers solve that problem Recognizing that if successful these players could use that base of digital accounts to redefine how the online and offline worlds of commerce would converge and reinvent how consumers and merchants engage anywhere Physical merchants have way bigger problems facing them right now than whether consumers are using Apple Pay at the register Foot traffic is down dramatically and retailers are closing right and left According to a report in The Wall Street Journal last week for department stores to get back to the productivity levels of they would need to close about onefifth of all anchor stores in malls thats about stores Instead Apple Pay introduced friction to a consumer who didnt have any problems paying for things in a store solving Apples problem how to sell more devices but not one that many consumers or retailers do Steve Jobs once said that hed rather gamble Apples vision than create me too products something Jobs said hed rather leave for everyone else But metoo seems like Apples product MO today Streaming Music News Watches and Apple Pay are all more or less Apples versions of things that others are doing or have done for a while and for which the company had to play catch up but doing so lacking that killer app or App store more precisely that caused people in droves to ditch their beloved Blackberries for the iPhone As the next decade begins the shift to connected devices billions and billions of them capable of conducting commerce the endpoints capable of playing music and getting news and reading email and paying for things will become more and more diverse Just ask Alexa and the voiceactivated ecosystem that she is powering Or Facebook NASDAQ FB or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN or Alphabet GOOG GOOGL that are bringing more and more apps into their ecosystems that can go anywhere any device or endpoint will take them And payments apps like PayPal that are becoming the enabling payments and financial services rails for apps and ecosystems worldwide Tagged Technology Personal Computers Editors Picks Expert Insight SA Submit </div></body></html>
