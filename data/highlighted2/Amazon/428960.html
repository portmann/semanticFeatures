(Amazon: Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While the latter strategy results in many product and service initiatives , few of them ever see the light of day and even <i>fewer</i> become successful and profitable .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>What is the <i>better</i> strategy ?  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That <b>depends</b> on your definition of innovation and whether you prefer breadth or depth .  (Uncertainty) </span>In terms of profit and cultural impact, Apple's strategy has certainly worked over the last two decades.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>However , the notion that Apple does not look ahead and innovate is not correct , even <i>more</i> so now that the company is working with Didi Chuxing to redefine transportation .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Finally , Mr. Blair <b>suggests</b> that Apple 's alleged focus on short-term profit and the lack of innovation is reflected in the company 's valuation , while innovative products from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> and Google power their respective stocks ahead . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>Both AMZN and GOOG certainly benefit from the positive sentiment surrounding their many initiatives while investors are glad to pay a premium for their recurring service cash flows and growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the other hand , no matter how it innovates , AAPL 's valuation will always be limited by its hardware business model and its consequence : secretive development ( to prevent the Osborne effect ) , changing technology cycles , and low <b>predictability</b> of future product cash flows .  (Uncertainty) </span>There is no denying the fact that AAPL is currently going through difficult times.The enormous growth (in fact unprecedented for a company of Apple's size) seen in recent years is coming to an end as the smartphone market is showing signs of maturity and so is the most successful and profitable technology product of all time, the iPhone.However, this is not to say that the company has stopped innovating.The company is currently establishing itself in the important wearables and health markets, brings security and convenience to the payments industry, and its rumored electric vehicle is widely considered the worst-kept secret in Silicon Valley.While these are only a few initiatives, they represent big long-term bets on some of the most important industries and Apple's relevance and survival.Author's Note: If you have enjoyed reading my article and found its content valuable, please take 5 seconds to follow me by clicking the Follow button next to my name at the top of the page.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Additional disclosure : This is no recommendation to buy or sell securities as that carries with it very high <b>risks</b> .
