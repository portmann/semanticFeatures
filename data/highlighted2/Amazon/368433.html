And unlike desktop and servers requiring x86, the big customers are free to choose competitive alternatives.And those large IoT companies also have a huge market inside their own products.This gives them a huge volume and cost advantage over Intel.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>And commodity IoT chip margins will be <i>lower</i> than the legacy x86 products .  (Surprise) </span>Many argue that Intel has the far superior silicon production capability and thus will always have 60% plus gross margins.I would argue that the huge, impressive margins are due to the monopoly nature of the x86 products that represent 89% of their revenue.In the IoT chip market, competition is fierce and the pricing power of Intel will be limited by the margins competitors are willing to take to move products through their fabs.One only has to think of Intel's mobile chip contra revenue fiasco to know that pricing (and ultimately margins) are not determined by Intel but by the level and intensity of the competition it faces in a given market.Another example was Intel's abandonment of the memory market because of low margins.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Intel has bid adieu to their IoT Group 's manager and <b>maybe</b> it was voluntary and <b>maybe</b> it was not .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But regardless of that issue the fact is the IoT Group 's results are <b>disappointing</b> with sales up only 7 % in 2015 and profits actually falling by 12 % .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>IoT is a miniscule part of Intel 's revenue ( <i>less</i> than 5 % ) and is in a competitive market segment with low margins , large , well-funded competitors and few prospects going forward .  (Surprise) </span>Getting rid of the manager is not going to solve Intel's IoT problem.Intel is at this point a hold.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I would remain on the sidelines until I can see a <i>more</i> certain source of sales and especially profits falling to the bottom line .  (Surprise) </span>But don't expect it to come from IoT.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Tagged: Technology , Semiconductor - Broad Line</div></body></html>
