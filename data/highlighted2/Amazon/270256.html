(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub.ETF Hub Dec 20 2015, 17:46 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: SA Eli Hoffmann , SA News Editor In an interview with 60 Minutes' Charlie Rose set to air today, Appleï¿½(NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook defends Apple's tax practices.Cook dismisses claims that Apple does its best to avoid paying taxes on overseas earnings as "total political crap," adding that "Apple pays every tax dollar we owe."It would cost me 40% to bring it home, and I don't think that's a reasonable thing to do," Cook says."This is a tax code, Charlie, that was made for the industrial age, not the digital age.It's backward.It's awful for America.It should have been fixed many years ago.It's past time to get it done."The segment will also go inside Apple's design lab with Jony Ive, and take an early look at a new Apple store design with Angela Ahrendts.No, Patrick, it's the market that "has really stunk this year."Apple has simply been stuck in that market.I concur with Tim Cook regarding taxes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I 'd rather see Apple move its HQ to Ireland ( as <b>may</b> Pfizer , and others ) than pay a thieving 40 % corporate tax levied by the slack-assed , do-nothing , incapable Congress that we are stuck with .  (Uncertainty) </span>Tim "Ballmer" Cook needs to get moving and leave!He has made all the wrong moves, Iwatch,, Icar, Itv.He has tyurned AAPL into a cult stock, once the cult turns the stock will tank.Ruffdog, if you're going to criticize, at least call the products by their real name.There's no such thing as an iWatch.Wow...You knock up Apple for a practice used by every Fortune 500 company?Welcome to the Modern Age of Tax "Avoidance".It's the stupid Dems....I mean the stupid Reps.....I mean the stupid Government.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hey , maybe a fair tax repatriation bill <b>could</b> bring the stupid sides together .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple <b>might</b> solve one of the biggest problem this country faces .  (Uncertainty) </span>Stupid Government.I agree with TC.The tax code was made for US economy of 100 years ago.Too much pork for legacy industries that employed too small a segment of the population.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I <b>hope</b> that Charlie Rose took the time to speak with politicians who have not addressed the current tax codes .  (Uncertainty) </span>Why would Apple or any other company not take advantage of tax laws that save them and their shareholders money?As I understand it, taxes have already been paid in the countries where the sales were made.To bring the cash back to the US with a further 40% hit would be irresponsible.It doesn't benefit he shareholders in these corporations to do this and it doesn't benefit the US taxpayers to leave it abroad.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Surely it 's time to <b>revise</b> the tax laws and find a compromise .  (Uncertainty) </span>Its really not a 40% hit, as taxes paid overseas are credited against US taxes owing.Of course, if there were no taxes paid overseas, then it would be a 40% hit, but why should Apple, one of the richest companies in the world, be able to avoid taxes that the rest of us are forced to pay?Are you making money overseas, paying taxes abroad, and also filling at home?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unless you 're a U.S. citizen working abroad , I <b>doubt</b> it .  (Uncertainty) </span>And unlike corporations, most Americans are sheltered from that tax even if they do work overseas.Yes let corporations bring it back home for free to invest in RnD, capital goods, new jobs.Will have positive effect on overall long term tax revenue.But don't expect a lot of wisdom from the legislative class.Apple and the tech sector has no shortage of money to invest in R&D, capital goods, etc.All of this money, if repatriated tax-free, will flow to shareholders.Who will effectively enjoy tax rates lower than most other US business, particularly those with domestic manufacturing operations for which it is impossible to perform such tax trickery.Lowering taxes on repatriated profits just serves to further discourage domestic manufacturing as foreign manufacturing will have a comparative tax advantage.pequity..keep dreaming.by bring it home u mean buy back stock!profits made by corporations hardly ever get recirculated back into the economy like you'd think agree.I am of the opinion the corporate tax should be ZERO in U.S. Between the 3 things you mention above, do those 3 things in U. S. and also it will free up the wasted money spent on accounting legalize to get tax return income to zero(different than book financial income) which  can be invested in something more productive to Apple, and the U.S. Sure, I have no problem getting behind a 0% corporate income tax rate, but it needs to apply to all corporations, not just ones which happen to use transfer pricing and intellectual property agreements to shift such profit offshore into tax havens.in accordance with Canada personal tax rules if any person has a Canadian driver license he must pay taxes to  Canada even income was earned outside of Canada...as I know $AAPL is considering as American company...so AAPL must pay all taxes to America Sort of true.The Canadian residency test is a bit more complicated than merely a drivers license.But in Canada (and in the USA as well), a taxpayer is entitled to offset a domestic tax liability with foreign taxes paid, on profits which were derived from holding shares in a foreign corporation.But otherwise, they pay Canadian taxes at Canadian rates on the paid-out profits of the foreign corporation.In some instances, "mark to market" rules also apply to Canadians investing in certain foreign trusts, whereby tax has to be calculated and paid each year on gains in the trust.Apple is following the rules set by the U.S. Government.If the government doesn't like companies moving profits to Ireland, fix the rules.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I rarely agree with Tim Cook , but he <b>could</b> n't be more right about the tax code .  (Uncertainty) </span>I only wish he'd have been this vocal back when Paul Otellini (former Intel CEO) was pushing for changes.The US has one of the most bass ackwards corporate tax codes in the world because of Democrat populist policies.The stupid voters that fall for this are only cutting their own necks and forcing investments overseas.Stand by and watch high tech grow in Asia and shrink in the US.Why should one sector of the economy receive tax preference over others?Apple is still an amazingly profitable organization, even when they properly pay their taxes.They benefitted from infrastructure paid for by taxes, including the BSD operating system most of their products are built on.Why shouldn't they be paying taxes to support such?The US corporate tax code doesn't apply to just one sector.In fact the high profile companies that have relocated overseas have so far not been in the tech sector.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Keep pumping your brain-dead populist polices and that <b>may</b> change though .  (Uncertainty) </span>But many sectors can't take advantage of it like Apple.For instance, the restaurant owner around the corner can't accumulate profits in overseas entities mostly tax-free.Hence, he faces taxation at the full rates.Most industries in the USA can't shift their profits elsewhere using transfer pricing and software licensing agreements.Why should these sectors be placed at a comparative disadvantage tax-code-wise?You don't have any idea of what you're talking about.Apple wouldn't be avoiding paying taxes on US earnings.They aren't avoiding that now.If you want the US to be a nation of restaurant owners and burger flippers keep pumping your populist policies, because that's what you're going to end up with.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One can only <b>hope</b> that the rest of the US populace has more common sense than that , and wakes up .  (Uncertainty) </span>If the burger flippers and restaurant owners can create economic growth and pay their taxes, and Apple can only grow by not paying their taxes, then we need to get behind the burger flippers and restaurant owners.But as it stands, Apple is an amazingly profitable company fully capable of properly paying its taxes.They just don't want to, and have employed a plethora of gimmicky in order to try and avoid such.Congress should not be picking winners and losers as far as the economy goes as they usually get it wrong.Cinci,  Hell must be about to freeze over as this item is the first time I have ever agreed with what you have said.MarkOfO,  What part of this do you not understand?The tax law says U.S. companies do have to pay taxes on foreign earnings until the foreign earnings are brought back to the U.S.  All earnings generated in the U.S. are taxed by the U.S. and Apple pays their U.S. taxes.There isn't any tax evading taking place, it is strictly according to the U.S. tax code.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>could</b> certainly argue that this section of the tax code has severe `` unintended consequences '' for the U.S. Treasury but this is not Apple 's problem .  (Uncertainty) </span>My opinion is that all earnings generated outside of the U.S. should be repatriated with no tax liability.This external money coming into the U.S. would go a long way in enhancing our economy and would eventually be taxed as it is distributed or used within the U.S. No, it is not a dumb analogy and comment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Restaurant owners can not use transfer pricing and intellectual property agreements to accumulate profit in foreign entities ( well they technically <b>could</b> license their recipes from their foreign affiliates , but that 's not very practical ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>Why should one class of business that can play tax trickery derive a benefit that firms who can't play tax trickery cannot?You're right, there's nothing illegal going on.If there was, then the IRS would be all over Apple.However, Tim Cook and many other sectors of the tech industry are asking for a tax benefit to be provided exclusively to reward their tax avoiding behaviour.And if you start allowing earnings generated outside the US to be tax-free, then companies will shift all their earnings overseas.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This would be catastrophically bad for the taxpayers who remain who would be forced to pick up the mess , and <b>horrible</b> for the economy .  (Uncertainty) </span>My opinion is that the rules as currently constituted work just fine, and that Apple needs to examine its sense of entitlement to tax treatment that most normal American businesses that do business in America cannot take advantage of.Apple has benefitted enormously from American society, American investment in education.They need to pay taxes to keep up their end of the bargain.Nobody pays more than required by law.But Apple is asking for the laws to be changed to reduce their tax liability.Change the tax laws then.The restaurant owner can always start over there and accumulate the profits there!Do you think they will pay the tax there and here too?No, the restaurant owner can't merely operate in America, but book its profits overseas.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Well I guess they <b>could</b> sell their recipes and trademarks to a foreign affiliate and pay royalties on such recipes to their foreign affiliate , but the professional costs to make this practical and defend such to the IRS would be prohibitive .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple, on account of its scale, can essentially do such, accumulating 'profit' in foreign affiliates.So you're saying that there should be no tax on foreign stocks?For instance, it should be less taxing for me to buy stock in, say, Hoffman La Roche (a Swiss corporation), than it should be to buy stock in Pfizer?Do you really think that such a tax preference would lead to a growing US economy?Of course not.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Actually , the foreign investment <b>probably</b> should be taxed at a more punitive rate than investment in America .  (Uncertainty) </span>That is, if you want the US economy to grow instead of foreign economies to grow.Apple should not be given a tax break that honest hard-working American companies who do business in America and pay American taxes receive.Cook and the rest of the tech sector is delusional if they think that future governments will favour companies that operate overseas, over companies that operate at home.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The US , I <b>believe</b> , is the only developed country in the world that insists on taxing earnings made outside the US .  (Uncertainty) </span>Even though Apple's has paid the applicable taxes based on where those earnings were made, the US wants to tax those earnings again if the money is transferred into the US.In the global economy we have, how can any international company justify remaining in the US with these kinds of tax laws?America does not tax earnings outside the USA.They only tax investments outside the USA when such investments make payments to the benefit of their US owners (ie: Apple is the owner of its foreign affiliate).Apple is asking for an exemption on such taxes, and they most likely will not receive such.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple <b>could</b> have accumulated its profits domestically and paid taxes , but they chose not to , and are now left to suffer the consequences of their past decisions .  (Uncertainty) </span>The tax code does not need revision.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And <b>nearly</b> every country taxes the investment returns of its domestic taxpayers who invest overseas .  (Uncertainty) </span>We should allow these corporations to bring this money home without penalties---Our borders r open for all to come in why not do the same for money born in America.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We <b>could</b> even allow it amnesty followed by citizenship ... .  (Uncertainty) </span>Why?Allowing Apple to repatriate cash tax-free would be giving them a significant advantage over a plethora of domestic corporations who did not engage in such.The tax code should not be encouraging such behaviour.Do you know what the US Corporate tax rates are?Compare our rates to other countries--come on get a clue.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Your <b>suggestion</b> of allowing no incentives to bring money home -- is the lets talk big and do nothing approach .  (Uncertainty) </span>Sounds like you are a government employee or elected official.I know what US corporate tax rates are.Sure, they are high, but they (partially) fund the sort of infrastructure that made Apple the success it is.Apple was started in America, not in India, not in Singapore.Great insight Mark0f0---The brilliant minds of Apple didn't build this company.Like Obama said--government, tax money, infrastructure that's what did it.Government should just take all the money foreign and domestic and let Bernie divvy it out... Well great minds in America pay taxes.That's how the system works.Why should one set of great minds in the American economy, whose activities are mostly domestic, pay a high tax rate, while Apple with its army of accountants (and great minds) pay a lower rate?Nobody is talking about taking all the money.We are just talking about Apple paying taxes like every other profitable American business or individual pays.Tim Cook having a temper tantrum on TV should not (and arguably will not) meaningfully change US tax policy to which we must all adhere.Hahaha---US tax policy is so complicated, no one adheres to it---even the IRS employees can't figure out what we owe or who owes it.But I'm sure the billions Apple has paid in taxes is not near enough in your brilliant mind.If you had it your way, all corporations would pay much more, but this foolish thinking just runs em out of the country one after another!!!Aren't you late for a Bernie Sanders fundraiser?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Hoping</b> Paul Ryan will lead fixing this early 2016 with Obama gaining new reduced tax money for infrastructure and more .  (Uncertainty) </span>this is the quarterly between earnings aapl time to buy, then sell after they crush earnings.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At least that <b>appears</b> to be the pattern .  (Uncertainty) </span>Because of how cheap aapl and the wmt beat down, I'm bullish from here into earnings season.The only way we get tax repatriation is if lobbyists say we do; know who's in charge.Apple's lobbyists are really stronger than lobbyists from the 95%+ of other US corporations who do not engage in such aggressive transfer pricing and foreign profit accumulating schemes?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Doubtful</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple <b>might</b> be big as far as the tech sector is concerned , but they 're just small fry in the rest of the economy .  (Uncertainty) </span>The government is increasingly desperate for tax revenue, and they are not going to allow Apple to get away with not paying billions in tax.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Any company that has cash that <b>could</b> be taxed at a future date need to have a future tax liability on their balance sheet .  (Uncertainty) </span>$1 overseas is not equal to $1 in the US.I've seen claims that the 'money' itself is actually invested by a Apple-owned hedge fund operating in the United States, in USD$.Just that the 'owner' of the fund is a foreign entity controlled by Apple.So the 'money' isn't actually physically overseas, but rather, its in America, just nominally 'owned' by a foreign affiliate of Apple, Inc.,  Not Apple Inc. itself.Apple's taxes as a % of income before taxes run about 26%, fairly close to the average for the S&P 500, which is 28.7%.The IRS has rules and auditors, and if they object they can ask for additional payments, and go to court, if necessary.The rules are complex, and accountants are ingenious, as are lawyers.The US should beef up tax collection/audit activity, and speed the resolution of disputes through the courts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>After everyone has been brought current and the noise dies down , we <b>could</b> then work out a simpler and fairer way of doing it .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If not for the need of the Democrat Party to harness anti-business votes from the 47 % who pay no taxes and the millions who earn tax credits on top of not paying anything , hundreds of billions of dollars of earnings <b>could</b> be brought home to the US and contribute to the economy and lower the deficit .  (Uncertainty) </span>If a 10% tax was put on repatriated funds, and say $500 billion was invested back in the US, That's a $50 billion direct tax payment, plus individual taxes on any dividends paid out and the economic benefit of share repurchases and business expansion.Why reward the behaviour of firms that engage in such trickery, instead of booking profits in the USA?That's what a 10% tax on repatriated funds would be -- a huge tax cut to corporations who aren't really willing to play by the theme and the spirit of the rules.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the case of Apple , the money is <b>apparently</b> held in USD$ , in the US , just beneficially owned by their offshore affiliates .  (Uncertainty) </span>So the 'money' is already re-invested in the US economy, albeit indirectly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple is just seeking to lower its tax burden in a way that most domestic taxpayers <b>could</b> only dream .  (Uncertainty) </span>If the tax code is unfair, it is up to the government to fix it.It is not the responsibility of one company to unilaterally pay more taxes than they should.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple 's management is playing a game of chicken which <b>could</b> easily backfire on them , especially if the government actually raises taxes on repatriated profits instead of lowering them .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't think shareholders want their managements to be playing tax games and ` chicken ' with the government which <b>could</b> result in severely negative consequences .  (Uncertainty) </span>There is no rational economic rationale for giving companies which engage in aggressive tax avoidance strategies a break.To do so would be to throw the other 95% of corporations who keep their profits domestically and play by the rules under the bus.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the tech sector ca n't survive without paying taxes on its profits ( Google is another significant abuser of transfer pricing with their so-called `` double dutch '' schemas ) , then <b>perhaps</b> the viability of their business models needs to be examined .  (Uncertainty) </span>As many colleagues here mention, the reason is a tax code that Penalaises international profitability.The US is the only country that tax income earn overseas.Not true.All countries levy tax on profits of foreign holdings when they are paid to domestic actors.Some countries even go so far as to "look into" the activities of foreign affiliates/trusts to tax them on a yearly basis.The US does not.And if those companies are so 'successful', why can't they pay their taxes like everyone else is expected to?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> they 're ` successful ' , not because they have superior businesses , but merely because they enjoy lower tax rates and are able to grow faster than their fully taxed competitors .  (Uncertainty) </span>Why not level the playing field?Do you think AAPL share holders should pay tax 3 times, 1) Overseas, 2)when they bring back the profits and also 3) when they pay dividend?"Do you think AAPL share holders should pay tax 3 times, 1) Overseas, 2)when they bring back the profits and also 3) when they pay dividend? "Yes.1)  they accumulate these profits in tax haven countries where they don't pay much, if any tax.Most tax they pay overseas is applied as an offset to US taxes, BTW.2)  every US citizen who invests overseas has to declare payments from overseas entities to themselves to the IRS and remit taxes accordingly, and 3)  (qualified) dividends receive a preferential rate on account of tax already being paid by their corporate payors.The tax system is 'integrated'.Apple knew the rules at the outset, and the rules are uniform for all taxpayers.Apple is seeking a preference for their business and businesses which engage in similar activities.They should have considered this in their decision making calculus before engaging in such activity.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Maybe</b> someday US will have a corporate tax as low as the rest of the world , and encourage repatriation of earnings .  (Uncertainty) </span>Our country is behaving like a third world  country when it comes to taxes, greedy and stupid!<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>, if we had a decent tax bracket for companies like this one they will all bring back the money into the country and that will represent trillions for the countries arcade , instead they want to impose outrageous tax brackets like France for example and that 's why most of the wealthy want to leave the country and big corporations want to set up banking shop <b>somewhere</b> else .  (Uncertainty) </span>Give a tax break to these big corporations like apple and you see how the money will come back.Here is the president of one of the biggest companies in the world saying this outfront and flat out , lets  see if finally our Government will do something about it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Individuals do n't have the option of simply stashing their profits overseas and <b>hoping</b> that the government wo n't come after them eventually .  (Uncertainty) </span>Why should Apple be afforded such?Its about tax fairness.Do you really think the government would give tax avoiding/evading individuals a preferential lower tax rate to incent them to bring money back?If not, then why do such for Apple?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't <b>believe</b> it is right to specifically blame either the Dems or the GOP for this debacle .  (Uncertainty) </span>Both sides are equally at fault IMO.I haven't seen either Party in Congress or the White House making a serious and public push for repatriation.That money would have been very helpful during the depth of the financial crisis - instead of the money printed to bail out the big bank culprits.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Hope</b> to post some more after the show tonight .  (Uncertainty) </span>"Cook says."This is a tax code, Charlie, that was made for the industrial age, not the digital age.It's backward.It's awful for America.It should have been fixed many years ago.It's past time to get it done.""Tim Cook is right.IMO the best idea George W Bush had as president was corporate tax reform.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Unfortunately , he could n't get it done because he did n't propose it until the electorate and congress had lost <b>faith</b> in his ideas .  (Uncertainty) </span>Which means designed by American citizens and residents, living in America with the rights, protections and benefits of being in America.....Except when it comes to financial gain from that IP of course.In that case, Go Irish!!or whichever place will allow Apple to assign financial rights (not legal rights) to the intellectual property designed and developed by Americans working in America.Increasingly not even designed by American citizens, but designed by foreigners brought to America on H-1B and other guest worker visas.we need to stop spending and putting the US into such debt that we don't need to charge such taxes to try to keep afloat.there are many US companies with money that stays over seas so they don't have to pay tax.there is prob enough over there that the tax would help reduce debt by hundreds of billion Exactly.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is even a good argument to be made that profit repatriation should be taxed at a punitive rate , rather than a preferential rate that Cook et al are <b>hoping</b> for .  (Uncertainty) </span>After all, the real value of the taxes owing on previous profits is declining over time on account of inflation.Apple/Cook should consider themselves lucky if they only have to pay the current rates to repatriate, instead of much higher future rates or punitive rates.THERE ARE MORE THAN 2 TRILLION DOLLARS OF U.S. CORPORATION MONEY OVERSEAS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN TAXED.WHY SHOULD THE CORPORATIONS BRING  THE MONEY BACK INTO THE U.S. & AND PAY A 35% TAX ON THE MONEY.TIME TO CHANGE THE PRESIDENTIAL ATMOSPHERE & ELECT TRUMP SO THAT THE MONEY CAN BE BROUGHT BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY TO EXPAND THEIR BUSINESS & MAKE MORE JOBS.Why should corporations pay their fair share of taxes, particularly corporations who made the explicit business decision to use various transfer pricing schemas and intellectual property agreements to accumulate profit in tax havens?Why should businesses that engage in such trickery be rewarded to the detriment of domestic corporations that do business in America and pay full taxes in America?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The real beef here is that the US government is an enormously wasteful spender of money , and has set taxes so high ( and <b>probably</b> not even high enough given there 's still huge debt ) .

(Uncertainty) </span>Unless states are rebating federal taxes, tax rates in the USA are very unlikely to ever be 0%.However, Apple should not be rewarded for having its products manufactured in Asia by the tax code allowing for preferential repatriation of profits derived from such.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Domestic manufacturing will be increasingly decimated if such a <b>horrible</b> precedent is set to reward the likes of Apple .  (Uncertainty) </span>Considering the huge numbers of US citizens unemployed (and thus, drawing government benefits) on account of Apple manufacturing in Asia instead of America, a 40% tax rate on the profits really isn't all that punitive.Hahaha---US tax policy is so complicated, no one adheres to it---even the IRS employees can't figure out what we owe or who owes it.But I'm sure the billions Apple has paid in taxes is not near enough in your brilliant mind.If you had it your way, all corporations would pay much more, but this foolish thinking just runs em out of the country one after another!!!Aren't you late for a Bernie Sanders fundraiser???Bernie Sanders, lol.Don't like the guy at all.But if the US tax policy is so complicated and nobody adheres to it, then why is Tim Cook complaining about it?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As for taxes , sure , they <b>might</b> have paid ` billions ' , but what have their profits been ?  (Uncertainty) </span>Its all about scale.A company with the scale of profit as Apple has should expect to pay proportionally scaled up taxes.And no, not all corporations need to pay more.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If all corporations did n't have these loopholes to exploit , then rates <b>might</b> actually fall .

(Uncertainty) </span>LOL!Sounds like we need a MUCH HIGHER dividend!The tax code should be updated  PERIOD!It should not be an issue for us based companies.Also, companies that chose to move their HQ to avoid us taxes, they should addressed as well.It should be as unpleasant as a US citizen who renounced  their citizenship.I thought corporations were people.The real issue is that the US government spends way too much.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is the big elephant in the room , not whether Apple <b>might</b> have to pay a higher rate on repatriated profits .  (Uncertainty) </span>It wouldn't cost anywhere near 40% to bring their money back to the States.It is common knowledge that Apple has used the loophole of Ireland's tax haven as a hiding place for all of its EU profits.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Whilst it <b>may</b> be legal on paper , it is effectively tax evasion .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the EU deem Apple to not be observing the spirit of the law , they <b>may</b> decide to fine them and shut down the loophole .  (Uncertainty) </span>That would be the fair thing, in my opinion, not just for Apple, but also for the other corporations taking unfair advantage of the Irish situation.What is total crap is Cook's continual evasion of the truth, which he has made his hallmark, first with the non-reporting of Apple Watch numbers, and now with his gross distortion of the tax status of Apple.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>When you look at Apple 's huge cash pile , which they have no clue with what to do but sit on , like some grotesque Smaug , and which has been stashed up thanks in large part to the avoidance of billions of dollars of tax , one has to express astonishment at Cook 's <b>amazing</b> lack of political credibility .  (Surprise) </span>In a time when governments are being overwhelmed in a sea of debt and pension black holes, with recession looming and with the US's coffers starting to be drained by a just war, how the hell does Cook think he is going to win friends by losing his temper?Apple's profits are obscene, their treasure chest is obscene, the tax they pay in the EU is much lower than is the average for the EU.Not only should they have paid billions more in tax for the past 20 years, it would not even affect their long-term health if they paid the proper tax rate.I'm sick of Apple's unjustified margins, when they try and squeeze every last ounce from musicians.I will not forget how they tried to make musicians go unpaid for three months with Apple Music.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> they should donate three months of their revenue to the war against ISIS and go unpaid for three months ; it 's not as though it would make the slightest bit of difference to their lifestyles .  (Uncertainty) </span>We have aggressive tax avoidance, which is deemed illegal.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That means that if a person or business takes advantage of a legal means to avoid tax that is against the spirit of the law , he or it <b>may</b> be prosecuted .  (Uncertainty) </span>Ideally, those legal loopholes wouldn't exist, but this is a compromise.Just think how many times in a day we, on a personal level, make decisions that can be legal but morally wrong.It is often up to us to police ourselves.But when corporations lose their sense of moral compass, it is necessary for the government to step in, as they are effectively being defrauded to the tune of billions of dollars by big business.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>It is easy to get <b>frustrated</b> with the Machiavellian tax laws and demand that loopholes are closed , but I suspect that if it were that easy , it <b>might</b> have already happened .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>The structure of the EU is to blame, I feel, in treating the whole of the EU as one block, yet preserving national tax laws.This is a fundamental flaw; you cannot have a single currency without a federal state.Hence, the abuses we see by Apple and other corps.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I do n't <b>believe</b> England will ever want to be part of a federal state , which is why we want to leave the EU , as that is the only successful outcome of the EU .  (Uncertainty) </span>As it is made up of so many different countries, I don't think they will ever agree to a federal union, which dooms the EU to failure.Cook's hypocrisy is especially risible, as he claims Apple want to leave the world a 'better place than they found it'.We all know he's talking about his petty and pointless social activism, yet his hypocrisy is double: he freely does business with China and Russia because he 'follows the money' as he likes to say in the quarterly earnings, despite their support for social mores wholly opposed to Cook's.And he gets on his high moral stance about accessibilityï¿½'It's not about the bloody ROI'ï¿½when it suits him, but not when it suits the welfare of countries.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All of this <b>could</b> have been avoided if Apple chose to pay tax for the countries in which their products were purchased , which is where their huge profits were really made , and if Cook had not made Apple a vessel for his personal political views .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We can see how Jobs was wise to keep focused on Apple and <b>almost</b> never be distracted by political matters .  (Uncertainty) </span>He would have still had the problems of tax, but I feel sure he would have dealt with this matter in a better way.Well put.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Actually I think Apple is putting its shareholders at grave risk by not realizing that the next move in taxation <b>might</b> be to apply punitive , not preferential rates , to repatriated profits .  (Uncertainty) </span>In an effort to discourage offshoring of profits and manufacturing.If the "40%" turns into "60%", Cook and Apple 's management will have a lot of egg on their face destroying so much shareholder value on an ill-advised bet that tax rates would be falling in the future.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>A move which <b>seems</b> wholly implausible given the fiscal situation of government going forward .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple is playing a high stakes game of chicken here.And the odds aren't all that significantly in their favour.The government will gladly throw a relatively small group of tech companies under the bus to save its tax base and provide tax fairness for the majority of people and businesses who conduct business in America and do not engage in such aggressive tax avoidance measures.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>`` All of this <b>could</b> have been avoided if Apple chose to pay tax for the countries in which their products were purchased '' and not just Apple ; <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , Ebay , Starbucks , the list of companies that make a fortune in the UK and pay NO TAX here at all grows by the day . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>That has to change.Exactly, firms should be rewarded with net profits on account of their ability to deliver the best product to market, operate the most efficiently, etc.Not on account of their ability to conjure up tax schemas which are able to most efficiently game the tax system.Lots of those firms' competitors play fully by the rules, do not use aggressive tax avoidance schemas, and shouldn't have the playing field artificially tilted away from them.There is a BIG difference between TAX EVASION and Tax avoidance.Tax avoidance is a legal effort to not pay taxes , Tax evasion is flipping the bird and saying I'm not paying TAXES.Point is Tim Cook still can pay the 35% and set up a credit card company and make up the difference in two years, with 20%  to 30% interest rates just just like the credit card companies do.This headline is a misuse of the word "evades".He pays 100% of what is owed in order to obey the law.He declines to pay 100% + $0.01 in order to obey his fiduciary duty to Apple's owners.It is not his money to waste on overpaying the revenue authorities of any government.If Apple's owners want to voluntarily donate any amount of their profits to government, they are always welcome to do so.If they would like an introduction to a less wasteful philanthropy, I can make several.Apple is playing a sort of game of chicken.Currently the claim is that repatriating profits will cost "40%" in taxes.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Tim Cook is <b>hoping</b> to have that number reduced , potentially to 0 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But there is always the possibility that such rate goes up , to <b>perhaps</b> 60 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>Especially in this rising interest rate environment in which the fiscal straitjacket on the US Treasury tightens with each Fed policy rate increase.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So by deferring repatriation of profits ( to pay to shareholders as dividends ) , Apple is forcing their shareholders into a very <b>risky</b> bet on future tax policy .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If they get it wrong , the consequences to Apple 's long-term balance sheet <b>could</b> be significant .  (Uncertainty) </span>He has demonstrated that he does not have the moral responsibility necessary to realise that the American public demand that Apple pay their fair share of tax.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Using Ireland as a tax haven to hide their money <b>may</b> be legal , but it is morally bankrupt .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple simply must not be let to get away with defrauding the American people out of tax that is rightfully due their government.ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes</div></body></html>
