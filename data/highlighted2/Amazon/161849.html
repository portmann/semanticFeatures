growth The companys spending history if repeated however could ultimately nullify its recently achieved record margins and profit improvements Despite the concerns the firm has a promising outlook Revenue growth and operating income growth are expected to continue through the fiscal third quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN has become the marquee destination for online shoppers but there is more to the company than meets the eye It is also becoming a leader in the cloud computing market The firm continues to focus on taking market share and the possibilities may be endless for the foreseeable future of course Amazons gross margin has improved recently due to dramatic success in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Web Services AWS thirdparty seller unit growth and lower shipping costs A lot has been going on and new products should prove to be great investments for the firm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Echo a device designed entirely around the users voice has moved to general availability in the US Customer response to Echo has been overwhelmingly positive with over star reviews and an average customer rating of stars Prime Day was also a resounding success More new members tried Prime worldwide than on any single day in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>history and customers purchased more units on Prime Day in than on Black Friday in Though the firm has made profit growth a high priority Amazons record margin and profit improvements could be shortlived if its spending history resurfaces in the future The company is trading at high earnings multiples and its fair value estimate is ultrasensitive to normalized margin expectations For example we estimate that for each percentage point that we change with respect to our midcycle gross margin assumptions Amazons fair value estimate changes per share Its true intrinsic value may never be known hence the stocks significant volatility Free cash flow should improve if investments turn out to be profitable but the company remains a lowmargin operation Despite the concerns <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has a promising outlook and recent news that it has overtaken WalMart NYSE WMT as the largest retailer by market capitalization is quite something Revenue growth is the highest it has been in three years and gross margins are at a record high Investors are on cloud nine and the solid pace of revenue growth and operating income expansion are expected to continue into the fiscal third quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>earns a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT the highest possible mark on our scale The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years a track record we view very positively Return on invested capital excluding goodwill has averaged during the past three years The firm operates as an online retailer It seeks to be a customercentric company for four primary customer sets consumers sellers enterprises and content creators The company also provides advertising services and cobranded credit card agreements The online retailer continues to focus on taking market share and damaging its competitors Kindle Fire variants tablets that sell for roughly breakeven have been topselling products on Amazoncom Recent events such as raising prices for Prime members indicate that profit growth has become a higher priority Amazons cash flow generation is about what wed expect from an average company in our coverage universe However should the company decide to turn off the spending gushers its free cash flow would explode higher The companys fair value estimate is ultrasensitive to normalized margin expectations In our opinion the best measure of a firms ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firms economic profit spread Amazons year historical return on invested capital without goodwill is which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of As such we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT In the chart below we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome in our opinion and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate Firms that generate a free cash flow margin free cash flow divided by total revenue above are usually considered cash cows Amazons free cash flow margin has averaged about during the past years As such we think the firms cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow FCFF which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>cash flow from operations increased about from levels registered two years ago while capital expenditures expanded about over the same time period Through the first half of the company reported cash from operations of million and capital expenditures of billion resulting in free cash outflow of billion This is the most important portion of our analysis Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Amazons shares are worth between and each The shares are currently trading at in the upper half of our fair value estimate This indicates that we feel that there is more downside risk than upside potential associated with these shares The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firms MEDIUM ValueRisk rating which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers The estimated fair value of per share represents a pricetoearnings PE ratio of about times last years earnings and an implied EVEBITDA multiple of about times last years EBITDA Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of during the next five years a pace that is lower than the firms year historical compound annual growth rate of Our model reflects a year projected average operating margin of which is above Amazons trailing year average Beyond year we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of for the next years and in perpetuity For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>we use a weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows Although we estimate the firms fair value at about per share every company has a range of probable fair values thats created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers like future revenue or earnings for example After all if the future was known with certainty we wouldnt see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock In the graph above we show this probable range of fair values for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>We think the firm is attractive below per share the green line but quite expensive above per share the red line The prices that fall along the yellow line which includes our fair value estimate represent a reasonable valuation for the firm in our opinion We estimate Amazons fair value at this point in time to be about per share As time passes however companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends The chart above compares the firms current share price with the path of Amazons expected equity value per share over the next three years assuming our longterm projections prove accurate The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year represents our best estimate of the value of the firms shares three years hence This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time should our views on the firms future cash flow potential change The expected fair value of per share in Year represents our existing fair value per share of increased at an annual rate of the firms cost of equity less its dividend yield The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>clearly has potential The online retailer has finally turned the corner with respect to a renewed focus on profitability but the companys fair value estimate remains sensitive to normalized margin assumptions in our view Throughout most of its history <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>has seemed content with simply growing revenue and creating new products but if recent investments continue to gain steam free cash flow generation could pave the way for significant economic value creation Though we like the recent focus on the bottom line the company will always remain of the lowmargin variety and that means it will always have tremendous earnings leverage and with tremendous earnings leverage comes significant sensitivity to midcycle assumptions and a large range of fair value outcomes Given the incredible difficulty in forecasting its true intrinsic value we doubt the firm will ever meet the criteria to be included in the newsletter portfolios <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon
