home automation products from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and Google Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Echo really the next big thing in technology with services replacing hardware In the recent months the world of technology and investment has been captivated by new home automation products from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL The SA community is not an exception with contributors Motek Moyen and Michael Blair praising Amazons Echo Dot as an innovative product with a great price and vast potential In her Internet Trends report venture capitalist Mary Meeker even suggests that the Echo could pose a threat to Apples NASDAQ AAPL mighty iPhone Are we really witnessing the arrival of the next big thing in technology with services replacing hardware Or is this just another dead end <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Echo is a good example of the companys lowend hardware strategy aimed to support its servicesoriented business model With the Echos voiceonly interface and limited feature set <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>mitigates its weakness in hardware while playing to its strength in cloud computing and services This approach is in stark contrast to Apples premium product strategy and a device like the iPad Pro which the company calls the clearest expression of our vision of the future of computing With the iPad Pro Apple positions rich experiences as the reason for customer purchase These are made possible thanks to a strong hardware component with a wide variety of input methods touch voice and optionally keyboard and digital pen and outputs display speakers and soon no doubt haptic feedback Which of these two fundamentally different approaches represents the future of technology For clues I look at the most successful technology device of all time and a product which will supposedly be challenged by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Echo the iPhone The success of the iPhone and smartphones in general has demonstrated the importance of mobility and flexibility in technology A mobile device with a flexible user interface can constantly adapt to the users changing needs based on time place and activity Different settings and conditions lend themselves to completely different control and communication methods For example using a voice assistant makes much sense when driving a car however it would probably not be a good idea in the middle of an office meeting or at home at am No matter how good your deep learning and AI are a world in which we would solely rely on voice control as the primary input method is simply not realistic On the other hand a device with a rich variety of input and output methods fits very well in our varied and complex daily lives The Echos limited mobility and voiceonly interface so far in English only presents a considerable problem for the devices usefulness and limits its value and potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Echo is further praised for its affordable pricing for the Echo Dot model which is supposed to further boost the products prospects However as business theory and market reality teaches us the price is only a part of the story and one of many considerations in the consumer decision making process Factors as value quality trust and convenience are also considered in the marketplace The iPhone is a shining example of consumers recognizing and paying a premium price for a highvalue product Just as the iPhones higher price is not an obstacle for the success of Apples premium product I dont see the Echos lower pricing as an advantage for what is essentially a connected speaker with limited value The next big thing in technology will expand on the success of the smartphone and its core concept of making technology more personal mobile and flexible The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Echo is not such a product as it goes exactly the opposite way and trades off the high value of mobility and flexibility for the low value of a more powerful speaker Home automation products like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>Echo and Google Home will find their niche and continue to evolve Apple is rumored to update its Apple TV to include a microphone and speaker which would make sense as this would further expand its interface and increase the value of the home device But mobile devices like notebooks tablets smartphones and soon smartwatches will continue to play the most important role in technology as we want to access our apps services and connected devices from wherever we are and via a rich flexible interface In this light a smartwatch is ideal for home automation and tasks like controlling music lights or temperature Its versatile interface including a microphone display and haptic feedback is always on you wherever you are I consider the smartwatch to be the next big thing in technology as it takes mobility to the next level while introducing new unique use cases related to health convenience and fashion The car as the ultimate mobile device is another example where technology can have a significant impact on our lives selfdriving cars in a ridesharing network is quite a powerful combination A voicecontrolled speaker Call me a skeptic I think the buzz press coverage and positive sentiment surrounding the Echo tell us more about the maturity of the smartphone market than about the inherent value of Amazons product Look beyond the novelty and promise of a hardwarefree future and there is little to be found However this is not say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is making a mistake here Instead lets see the Echo for it really is just another device complementing Amazons lowend product portfolio designed around the strength of its service business model and weakness in hardware Once the hype dies down it will be back to basics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>as a tremendous retailer and
