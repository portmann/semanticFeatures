class='textDiv'>Microsoft AI Solves The Famous Imaginary Pizza Ordering Problem Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT Seeking Alpha The ghosts of past innovation failures still haunt Microsoft as it once again showcases technology in search of a problem to solve The lesson of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>is that innovative technology succeeds when it demonstrates it can solve real problems Microsoft to be taken seriously as a technology innovator needs to turn its AI Bots loose on real problems such as improving its own products user experience Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT wants respect as a technology innovator but it has just failed a major test Microsoft announced at its Build conference what it claims is an exciting new technology that will allow developers to implement AI chat bots in their applications Microsoft gushes this will enable developers to create Bots that increase user productivity and help them get things done Microsoft offered up examples such as creating Bots that can order pizza or book a hotel room I had thought the ghost of Ballmer had left the building but I was wrong I really dont need or want a Bot that can order a pizza And the prototype Bot to book a hotel room strikes me as an even more invasive form of popup advertising While I am excited to see Microsoft release this technology if it expects to succeed and gain adoption it will need to do a better job of demonstrating its potential instead of offering up useless use cases that serve no purpose Why would anyone try it if Microsoft doesnt have a clue on how to apply it Microsoft has often been at the forefront of creating innovations that dont get market traction because they become too enamored with what they have created instead of its application This is another example where a technology company becomes too focused on creating technology in search of a problem to solve rather than creating technology that solves actual problems its customers are having <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN succeeds at creating innovative new technologies that are adopted because they focus first on developing and applying technology to solve existing problems and then secondarily search for new use cases Microsoft should learn from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and do the same While Microsoft often speaks of dogfooding consuming your own products in this case it has reverted to behavior more reminiscent of the Ballmer years This was most visibly demonstrated by the very public failure of its teen chat Bot Tay which it unleashed without adequate testing and rapidly learned of the power of internet trolls Contrast this with how IBM NYSE IBM has developed and promoted Watson Computers up until now have been rather dumb machines and as a consequence can be rather frustrating to use at times The advent of Bots offers opportunity to devise innovative selflearning systems that can spot when users are frustrated with how dumb the computer is I would like to see Bots that can learn about their own weaknesses and shortcomings Give the computer the ability to step in and take shortterm corrective actions that make up for its own mistakes while it informs its maker with telemetry on what needs to be improved Microsoft should instead focus on proving out its Bot technology by using it to create selflearning systems that improve the user experience of its own products Now that would be a productivity enhancing Bot I would welcome Here are some examples I would offer Learn to autoset my time zone Im traveling and my IP address is now in a different time zone My Surface should offer to automatically switch to that time zone just like my cell phone does Ideally it would do this by default but give me a configuration setting to override This is an example of where MSFT is still treating my Surface as a desktop PC not a mobile device Learn that just because I have traveled to another country I have not switched languages Bing should not switch to BingMX and serve up news in Spanish just because Im vacationing and connected to a Mexican IP address Windows is using code that probably hasnt been touched in years operating by default parameters that harken back to when someone thought it would be cool to have a desktop computer automatically assign its region location based on the location of the IP address A Bot could easily learn and override this Learn that I temporarily need to use an unsecure network and offer to turn off alerts I often need to connect to a public airport or hotel network while traveling and Windows dutifully warns against connecting as the security certificates are out of date I really have no choice when I am traveling and sometimes have to accept the risk However why do I have to go through these annoying alerts and override them every time I connect Instead a Bot should observe that I am repeatedly overriding the warning each time and should ask if I want to turn off the alerts for that specific certificate for a set period of time Learn that Edge Browser is not compatible with a web site and auto switch to Firefox I launch a website in Edge and within a very brief amount of time I launch the same page in Firefox because something on the site fails to work in Edge Cortana should be smart enough to learn from my actions when a site is incompatible with Edge remember these sites and in the future automatically offer to launch it in Firefox if I try to go there in Edge until Microsoft has fixed this issue Now that would be an improvement in productivity Learn that a device driver keeps crashing and auto fix the issue About once a week my audio device driver Intel NASDAQ INTC Audio SST Device WMDI crashes usually due to a web site video incompatibility with the Edge Browser Windows is too dumb to notice that the driver has crashed and continues to report the audio driver is working fine Searching around on the web I find others having the same issue and found the only way to fix the problem is to uninstall audio driver and do a reboot to force it to reinstall I want a Bot that lets me tell it that its audio driver has crashed and set it off to go learn why it failed to detect it Furthermore the Bot should remediate the issue by error trapping and diverting similar requests with offers to launch the video in Firefox until Microsoft has fixed the issue in Edge There are many more I could list but these all happened to me multiple times in the last two weeks While these are minor annoyances it is frustrations like these that build up over time and sour users on products Satya Nadella has done a great job turning things around at Microsoft but lurking under the covers are indications they still have not fully exorcised past behavioral tendencies to ignore frustrating UX issues in favor of solving imagined pizza ordering problems If Microsoft wants to be taken seriously as a technology innovator then it should turn its Bots loose on real problems such as improving its own user experience by learning what product behaviors frustrates its customers and offer smart ways to provide interim workarounds until they can implement systemic fixes That would provide a real bench test exercise to prove out the AI Bot technology as a productivity booster and would provide a much better value proposition to those who might consider using the technology in their own applications Until then Microsofts attempts to gain traction for it AI platforms will likely languish while other firms such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>and IBM focus on demonstrating they can deal with actual problems that need solving I wrote this article myself and it
