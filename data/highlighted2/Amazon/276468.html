This is a ten-year chart of Wal-Mart.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one had bought in 2007 or perhaps even at the lows of 2010 , they would have been tracking along at around a 12 % total return , <b>depending</b> on exactly when they bought , up until 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But with both deteriorating fundamentals and serious competition from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , once Wal-Mart started tracking below that 12 % total return in the first quarter of 2015 it would have been time to sell and look for <i>better</i> opportunities if I had owned it . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Of course, not all investors care about total return or as stock's performance relative to some benchmark like the S&P 500.For some dividend growth is what matters, and for others, they are only looking for a 4, 5, or 6% return.The key is to have a goal.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Depending</b> on what the thesis is for the initial medium-to-long-term stock purchase , I usually start measuring performance no <i>earlier</i> than a year , <i>more</i> typically around two years , after purchasing stocks in this category .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It's important to keep in mind that these goals are built-in to every medium-to-long-term thesis I make.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This means that I do n't purchase , or recommend purchasing , medium-to-long-term stocks unless I think there is a good <b>probability</b> of the annual total return exceeding 12 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the thesis plays out over , say , a two-year period and the annual return is only 8 % , then I would admit that I made a mistake in judging how the market would value the company after the thesis played out , and I would sell .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For example , if I thought Gilead ( NASDAQ : GILD ) would sell far <i>more</i> hepatitis drugs over the next two years than the market anticipated , and that it would develop another profitable drug during that time as well , and that those factors would cause the price of the stock to rise <i>more</i> than my required 12 % per year , and then both of my <b>predictions</b> happened , but two years later the price had only risen 8 % per year , I would sell .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>My thesis would have been correct, but the price wouldn't have met my goals.This would happen only if I purchased Gilead as a medium-to-long-term stock.In my Roth account, all my purchases are strictly long-term purchases (3) that I hold for at least five years.Essentially what this does is ties my thesis to the performance goals, so that the thesis goes unstated.In my next article, I'll discuss my investing strategy for long-term purchases and when to sell the successful ones.I am always trying to improve my process and love to hear others' thoughts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Feel free to leave them in the comment section , and if you would like Seeking Alpha to notify you when future articles of mine are published , consider ` following ' me .
