(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It can be even <i>more</i> difficult to decide when to sell successful investments .  (Surprise) </span>Having a performance goal can help decide if it is the right time to sell.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Probably</b> one of the most difficult decisions investors make -- and one we seem to be especially bad at -- is when to sell our investments .  (Uncertainty) </span>I have previously written about different types of investments.Some investments are short-to-medium-term investments, others are medium-to-long-term investments, and others are strictly long-term investments.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am of the opinion that investors perform best when they have formed some kind of time-sensitive thesis about a stock and attached some sort of <b>probability</b> of the thesis playing out .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the thesis proves to be incorrect or the risk/reward <b>probabilities</b> change for the worst , then those are good reasons to sell the stock .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>While selling a stock is never an easy decision , it is <i>easier</i> if a thesis as failed , become seriously threatened , or , if the risk/reward has dramatically changed .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is much <i>more</i> difficult to sell a stock when a thesis has proven to be correct and the risk/reward has n't dramatically changed .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It other words , it is <i>more</i> difficult to sell a winner .  (Surprise) </span>There are at least three types of long-term winning stocks: (1) The stocks that start out with strong fundamentals and that have had a short-to-medium-term thesis successfully play out, and then afterwards perform well enough over the medium-term to become long-term holds.These are my favorite type, but they don't seem to come along very often.The second type (2) of long-term winning stocks are the ones that have strong fundamentals, and a medium-to-long-term thesis that has successfully come to fruition.The third type (3) of long-term winning stocks are those that were purchased as long-term holds from the very beginning without much regard for the short and medium term.This article is about how I go about determining when--and when not--to sell the second type (2): medium-to-long-term winners.I'll begin by using Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock as an example.I bought Apple for my daughter's account in the summer of 2013.I would classify the purchase as a medium-to-long-term investment.At the time, Apple's fundamentals were fantastic.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>They had <b>almost</b> no debt , loads of cash , exceptional free-cash-flow , and a dividend yield around 3 % .  (Uncertainty) </span>The only reason Apple was selling so cheaply was because their growth had slowed and people were unsure about the future prospects of the iPhone.At the time, I knew the risk/reward was so skewed toward the "reward" that even someone as dumb as me would be wise to buy the stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While I did n't write my thesis down at that time , if I had , it would have been that iPhone sales would not decline as much as expected and within two years Apple 's growth would improve .  (Uncertainty) </span>Soon after purchasing the stock, Apple's growth resumed, iPhone sales increased, and Carl Icahn declared Apple as the type of value that comes along only once in a decade.Apple has been an ideal investment for my daughter.2015, however, hasn't been kind to the stock, and there have been plenty of opportunities to sell along the way while locking in major gains, as well as opportunities to sell when the stock came off its high this year.Yet, I haven't sold, nor do I plan to anytime soon.Here's why: While everyone's goals are different, having a goal or benchmark for every investment is essential.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I know some folks are against using benchmarks ( and if we are talking about short periods of time then I would agree with some of their reasoning ) .  (Uncertainty) </span>But I just don't see how one can tell if an investment has been successful if they haven't established a goal or benchmark.Without a target to compare to, one is quite often at the mercy of one's emotions when determining when to sell.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And I have found that emotionally driven investing decisions are <b>probably</b> where the worst investing mistakes are made .  (Uncertainty) </span>My goal for long-term investments is a 12% average total return per year.When I buy a stock for the medium-to-long-term it must pass several fundamental and value standards in order for me to buy and hold.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>But if after I buy a stock it turns into a long-term hold , as long as the stock is meeting the 12 % average total return per year standard , I no <i>longer</i> care about value .  (Surprise) </span>Price sensitive metrics like P/E, PEG, P/FCF etc. mean nothing to me at that point.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If a long-term stock happens to <b>appear</b> way overvalued from a price standpoint , I do n't care as long as the fundamentals are good and the company is profitable .  (Uncertainty) </span>Here is the total return of that Apple investment after 2 1/2 years: AAPL Total Return Price data by YCharts And here is Apple's performance for 2015: AAPL Total Return Price data by YCharts Even with a slightly negative return for 2015, Apple has still returned 94% over 2 1/2 years.My long-term requirements require about a 32% return over that time period.There is such a huge distance between the performance of the stock and what I require, that don't monitor Apple very much at all.It's important to remember that the market is ultimately very concerned about growth and that makes Apple's stock price very sensitive to its future growth prospects, but I bought Apple at such a low price, that it doesn't have to grow very much at all to be a good investment for me.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It just needs to stay profitable , and <b>perhaps</b> post some modest growth , and if that happens there is a very good chance I 'll meet my 12 % goal .  (Uncertainty) </span>If there comes a time in a few years that my 12% goal converges with the stock price, then I will consider looking for other opportunities if I find them, but for now, this is a good example of how a stock can become a long-term hold that one doesn't need to consider selling, and instead simply requires a quarterly check-up to make sure earnings aren't collapsing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'><b>Perhaps</b> the most important thing is not to sell a winner simply because it has risen rapidly , provided the fundamentals are good and the business is still doing well .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am of the opinion that investors usually go wrong when they sell good long-term companies because of valuation concerns.A good company can remain 'overvalued' for a very, very long time, especially if it is being compared to the average valuations of inferior companies.There are formerly good businesses that are severely challenged, though.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Wal-Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) is an example where one <b>might</b> have considered selling this year .  (Uncertainty) </span>Each generation has had a particular retailer that came to dominate the category.We 've had Woolworths , Sears ( NASDAQ : SHLD ) , Wal-Mart , and now we have <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) . This is a ten-year chart of Wal-Mart.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If one had bought in 2007 or perhaps even at the lows of 2010 , they would have been tracking along at around a 12 % total return , <b>depending</b> on exactly when they bought , up until 2015 .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>But with both deteriorating fundamentals and serious competition from <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> , once Wal-Mart started tracking below that 12 % total return in the first quarter of 2015 it would have been time to sell and look for <i>better</i> opportunities if I had owned it . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Of course, not all investors care about total return or as stock's performance relative to some benchmark like the S&P 500.For some dividend growth is what matters, and for others, they are only looking for a 4, 5, or 6% return.The key is to have a goal.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'><b>Depending</b> on what the thesis is for the initial medium-to-long-term stock purchase , I usually start measuring performance no <i>earlier</i> than a year , <i>more</i> typically around two years , after purchasing stocks in this category .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>It's important to keep in mind that these goals are built-in to every medium-to-long-term thesis I make.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This means that I do n't purchase , or recommend purchasing , medium-to-long-term stocks unless I think there is a good <b>probability</b> of the annual total return exceeding 12 % .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If the thesis plays out over , say , a two-year period and the annual return is only 8 % , then I would admit that I made a mistake in judging how the market would value the company after the thesis played out , and I would sell .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>For example , if I thought Gilead ( NASDAQ : GILD ) would sell far <i>more</i> hepatitis drugs over the next two years than the market anticipated , and that it would develop another profitable drug during that time as well , and that those factors would cause the price of the stock to rise <i>more</i> than my required 12 % per year , and then both of my <b>predictions</b> happened , but two years later the price had only risen 8 % per year , I would sell .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>My thesis would have been correct, but the price wouldn't have met my goals.This would happen only if I purchased Gilead as a medium-to-long-term stock.In my Roth account, all my purchases are strictly long-term purchases (3) that I hold for at least five years.Essentially what this does is ties my thesis to the performance goals, so that the thesis goes unstated.In my next article, I'll discuss my investing strategy for long-term purchases and when to sell the successful ones.I am always trying to improve my process and love to hear others' thoughts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Feel free to leave them in the comment section , and if you would like Seeking Alpha to notify you when future articles of mine are published , consider ` following ' me .
