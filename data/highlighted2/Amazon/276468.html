more difficult to decide when to sell successful investments Having a performance goal can help decide if it is the right time to sell Probably one of the most difficult decisions investors makeand one we seem to be especially bad atis when to sell our investments I have previously written about different types of investments Some investments are shorttomediumterm investments others are mediumtolongterm investments and others are strictly longterm investments I am of the opinion that investors perform best when they have formed some kind of timesensitive thesis about a stock and attached some sort of probability of the thesis playing out If the thesis proves to be incorrect or the riskreward probabilities change for the worst then those are good reasons to sell the stock While selling a stock is never an easy decision it is easier if a thesis as failed become seriously threatened or if the riskreward has dramatically changed It is much more difficult to sell a stock when a thesis has proven to be correct and the riskreward hasnt dramatically changed It other words it is more difficult to sell a winner There are at least three types of longterm winning stocks The stocks that start out with strong fundamentals and that have had a shorttomediumterm thesis successfully play out and then afterwards perform well enough over the mediumterm to become longterm holds These are my favorite type but they dont seem to come along very often The second type of longterm winning stocks are the ones that have strong fundamentals and a mediumtolongterm thesis that has successfully come to fruition The third type of longterm winning stocks are those that were purchased as longterm holds from the very beginning without much regard for the short and medium term This article is about how I go about determining whenand when notto sell the second type mediumtolongterm winners Ill begin by using Apple NASDAQ AAPL stock as an example I bought Apple for my daughters account in the summer of I would classify the purchase as a mediumtolongterm investment At the time Apples fundamentals were fantastic They had almost no debt loads of cash exceptional freecashflow and a dividend yield around The only reason Apple was selling so cheaply was because their growth had slowed and people were unsure about the future prospects of the iPhone At the time I knew the riskreward was so skewed toward the reward that even someone as dumb as me would be wise to buy the stock While I didnt write my thesis down at that time if I had it would have been that iPhone sales would not decline as much as expected and within two years Apples growth would improve Soon after purchasing the stock Apples growth resumed iPhone sales increased and Carl Icahn declared Apple as the type of value that comes along only once in a decade Apple has been an ideal investment for my daughter however hasnt been kind to the stock and there have been plenty of opportunities to sell along the way while locking in major gains as well as opportunities to sell when the stock came off its high this year Yet I havent sold nor do I plan to anytime soon Heres why While everyones goals are different having a goal or benchmark for every investment is essential I know some folks are against using benchmarks and if we are talking about short periods of time then I would agree with some of their reasoning But I just dont see how one can tell if an investment has been successful if they havent established a goal or benchmark Without a target to compare to one is quite often at the mercy of ones emotions when determining when to sell And I have found that emotionally driven investing decisions are probably where the worst investing mistakes are made My goal for longterm investments is a average total return per year When I buy a stock for the mediumtolongterm it must pass several fundamental and value standards in order for me to buy and hold But if after I buy a stock it turns into a longterm hold as long as the stock is meeting the average total return per year standard I no longer care about value Price sensitive metrics like PE PEG PFCF etc mean nothing to me at that point If a longterm stock happens to appear way overvalued from a price standpoint I dont care as long as the fundamentals are good and the company is profitable Here is the total return of that Apple investment after years AAPL Total Return Price data by YCharts And here is Apples performance for AAPL Total Return Price data by YCharts Even with a slightly negative return for Apple has still returned over years My longterm requirements require about a return over that time period There is such a huge distance between the performance of the stock and what I require that dont monitor Apple very much at all Its important to remember that the market is ultimately very concerned about growth and that makes Apples stock price very sensitive to its future growth prospects but I bought Apple at such a low price that it doesnt have to grow very much at all to be a good investment for me It just needs to stay profitable and perhaps post some modest growth and if that happens there is a very good chance Ill meet my goal If there comes a time in a few years that my goal converges with the stock price then I will consider looking for other opportunities if I find them but for now this is a good example of how a stock can become a longterm hold that one doesnt need to consider selling and instead simply requires a quarterly checkup to make sure earnings arent collapsing Perhaps the most important thing is not to sell a winner simply because it has risen rapidly provided the fundamentals are good and the business is still doing well I am of the opinion that investors usually go wrong when they sell good longterm companies because of valuation concerns A good company can remain overvalued for a very very long time especially if it is being compared to the average valuations of inferior companies There are formerly good businesses that are severely challenged though WalMart NYSE WMT is an example where one might have considered selling this year Each generation has had a particular retailer that came to dominate the category Weve had Woolworths Sears NASDAQ SHLD WalMart and now we have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN This is a tenyear chart of WalMart If one had bought in or perhaps even at the lows of they would have been tracking along at around a total return depending on exactly when they bought up until But with both deteriorating fundamentals and serious competition from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>once WalMart started tracking below that total return in the first quarter of it would have been time to sell and look for better opportunities if I had owned it Of course not all investors care about total return or as stocks performance relative to some benchmark like the SP For some dividend growth is what matters and for others they are only looking for a or return The key is to have a goal Depending on what the thesis is for the initial mediumtolongterm stock purchase I usually start measuring performance no earlier than a year more typically around two years after purchasing stocks in this category Its important to keep in mind that these goals are builtin to every mediumtolongterm thesis I make This means that I dont purchase or recommend purchasing mediumtolongterm stocks unless I think there is a good probability of the annual total return exceeding If the thesis plays out over say a twoyear period and the annual return is only then I would admit that I made a mistake in judging how the market would value the company after the thesis played out and I would sell For example if I thought Gilead NASDAQ GILD would sell far more hepatitis drugs over the next two years than the market anticipated and that it would develop another profitable drug during that time as well and that those factors would cause the price of the stock to rise more than my required per year and then both of my predictions happened but two years later the price had only risen per year I would sell My thesis would have been correct but the price wouldnt have met my goals This would happen only if I purchased Gilead as a mediumtolongterm stock In my Roth account all my purchases are strictly longterm purchases that I hold for at least five years Essentially what this does is ties my thesis to the performance goals so that the thesis goes unstated In my next article Ill discuss my investing strategy for longterm purchases and when to sell the successful ones I am always trying to improve my process and love to hear others thoughts Feel free to leave them in the
