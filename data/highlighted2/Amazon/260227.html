Inc. ( NASDAQ : YHOO ) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo has changed the terms of its BABA spinoff , <b>maybe</b> to avoid IRS regulation , <b>maybe</b> for other reasons .  (Uncertainty) </span>The company will likely pitch this as best way to unlock value from the core business.By now, the news has broken that Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) is not planning on spinning off Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), as planned, but is rather now focusing on a plan to spin itself off and keep BABA parked where it is.This news broke yesterday via a number of outlets, but seemed to first come from CNBCs David Faber.We also know that the company is planning a conference call for early this morning, which is just about an hour or so from the time of us finishing this article.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We are choosing to submit and have this article published prior to the conference call , because the nature of this article is to be relatively speculative and to warn about risks that we do not <b>believe</b> would be covered in a openly transparent matter on the call anyway .  (Uncertainty) </span>We think the call will say that this is either to skirt regulations or that it's the best way to unlock value from the part of the business that investors are giving no value to, the Yahoo portion.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Our readers may recall that we have been writing about the proposed spin-off for some time , and we also made note several times that this spinoff may be at <b>risk</b> due to IRS regulations .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There was an original <b>scare</b> some months back , when an IRS executive made comments at a conference that seemed to indicate that companies spinning off other companies for tax purposes would soon be coming to an end .  (Uncertainty) </span>Of course, everybody thought this had something to do with Yahoo and the stock sold off on that Friday before the close.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Yahoo 's CEO and Board of Directors subsequently made statements that they did not <b>believe</b> there was going to be any issues moving forward with the spin off as planned .  (Uncertainty) </span>As we see now, that certainly doesn't look like what happened.Whether they knew it or not, they were wrong.Now, the question becomes why is Yahoo structuring the transaction this way and what does it mean for holders of both companies.1.Spinning off YHOO to unlock its value 2.Spinning off to skirt IRS/other regulatory rules 3.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Not spinning off BABA because of disclosure issues The obvious reasoning <b>seems</b> to be unlocking YHOO 's value or that the company is trying to avoid some sort of regulatory implications by spinning off itself and keeping its secondary assets .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>We will know <i>more</i> after this morning 's conference call , but there is a very scary scenario that <b>may</b> or <b>may</b> not have something to do with the way that this deal is been transacted .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>For the last year, Alibaba has been under intense scrutiny, not only for their business practices but also for their financials and their accounting.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Readers <b>may</b> recall that we pointed out <i>earlier</i> in this year that CEO Jack Ma was taking a $ 2 billion loan against the value of his shares , leading us to believe that he <b>may</b> think the shares are at the highest value that they are going to reach .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Regardless , we did not <b>believe</b> this was a good sign and we pointed that out in our article about BABA .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>CNBC contributor Herb Greenberg , through his independent research company Pacific Square Research , has <b>appeared</b> on CNBC numerous times to speak about many of the gray areas he noticed when him and his forensic accountant started to dig into Alibaba 's financials .  (Uncertainty) </span>There have also been questions raised about the volume of the business as it compares to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) and other online retailers . <span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Short seller John Hempton made several interesting posts ( `` the numbers <b>could</b> be fake '' ) questioning the organization and the volume that runs through BABA on a daily basis .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We are not here to support or lend credence to either of these arguments , but what we do want to say is that there seems to be a growing amount of <b>doubt</b> and skepticism as it relates to how BABA does business .  (Uncertainty) </span>That leads us and several others to begin to ask questions about why Yahoo would need to engineer the spin-off in a different fashion.Naturally, when you spin off a business you are required to make certain disclosures about that business in a prospectus style document that is supposed to be lengthy and comprehensive.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Today we ask the question whether or not it is possible that Yahoo is engineering this spin-off in a reverse order because there <b>may</b> be some items that they either can not or do not want to disclose regarding their stake in BABA .  (Uncertainty) </span>These are only questions at this point, and we have no direct or indirect evidence to substantiate these claims.Normally, we do not write about companies unless we have something tangible to offer to readers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We would not be bringing this up and making a point of at least mentioning it , if we did not feel that there was at least a small percentage chance that this <b>may</b> have something to do with changing the terms of the spin-off .  (Uncertainty) </span>Also Wednesday morning, we saw the departure of one of Yahoo's directors from the board.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>This may be as simple as having a disagreement about the terms of the spin-off , or there <b>could</b> be <i>more</i> to the story .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Regardless, it's a theory that is worth keeping in mind as you listen to the company's explanation for why it is taking its action on this morning's conference call.We have urged caution in the past about Yahoo and this spin-off transaction, and we continue to think that a skeptical view is necessary.We look forward to hearing from the company this morning.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
