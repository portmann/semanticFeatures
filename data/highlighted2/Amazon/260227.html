(Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We are not here to support or lend credence to either of these arguments , but what we do want to say is that there seems to be a growing amount of <b>doubt</b> and skepticism as it relates to how BABA does business .  (Uncertainty) </span>That leads us and several others to begin to ask questions about why Yahoo would need to engineer the spin-off in a different fashion.Naturally, when you spin off a business you are required to make certain disclosures about that business in a prospectus style document that is supposed to be lengthy and comprehensive.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Today we ask the question whether or not it is possible that Yahoo is engineering this spin-off in a reverse order because there <b>may</b> be some items that they either can not or do not want to disclose regarding their stake in BABA .  (Uncertainty) </span>These are only questions at this point, and we have no direct or indirect evidence to substantiate these claims.Normally, we do not write about companies unless we have something tangible to offer to readers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We would not be bringing this up and making a point of at least mentioning it , if we did not feel that there was at least a small percentage chance that this <b>may</b> have something to do with changing the terms of the spin-off .  (Uncertainty) </span>Also Wednesday morning, we saw the departure of one of Yahoo's directors from the board.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This may be as simple as having a disagreement about the terms of the spin-off , or there <b>could</b> be more to the story .  (Uncertainty) </span>Regardless, it's a theory that is worth keeping in mind as you listen to the company's explanation for why it is taking its action on this morning's conference call.We have urged caution in the past about Yahoo and this spin-off transaction, and we continue to think that a skeptical view is necessary.We look forward to hearing from the company this morning.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
