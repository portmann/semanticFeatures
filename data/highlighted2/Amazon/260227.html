class='textDiv'>The Yahoo Spinoff The Scary Wild Card Scenario Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Yahoo has changed the terms of its BABA spinoff maybe to avoid IRS regulation maybe for other reasons The company will likely pitch this as best way to unlock value from the core business By now the news has broken that Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO is not planning on spinning off Alibaba NYSE BABA as planned but is rather now focusing on a plan to spin itself off and keep BABA parked where it is This news broke yesterday via a number of outlets but seemed to first come from CNBCs David Faber We also know that the company is planning a conference call for early this morning which is just about an hour or so from the time of us finishing this article We are choosing to submit and have this article published prior to the conference call because the nature of this article is to be relatively speculative and to warn about risks that we do not believe would be covered in a openly transparent matter on the call anyway We think the call will say that this is either to skirt regulations or that its the best way to unlock value from the part of the business that investors are giving no value to the Yahoo portion Our readers may recall that we have been writing about the proposed spinoff for some time and we also made note several times that this spinoff may be at risk due to IRS regulations There was an original scare some months back when an IRS executive made comments at a conference that seemed to indicate that companies spinning off other companies for tax purposes would soon be coming to an end Of course everybody thought this had something to do with Yahoo and the stock sold off on that Friday before the close Yahoos CEO and Board of Directors subsequently made statements that they did not believe there was going to be any issues moving forward with the spin off as planned As we see now that certainly doesnt look like what happened Whether they knew it or not they were wrong Now the question becomes why is Yahoo structuring the transaction this way and what does it mean for holders of both companies Spinning off YHOO to unlock its value Spinning off to skirt IRSother regulatory rules Not spinning off BABA because of disclosure issues The obvious reasoning seems to be unlocking YHOOs value or that the company is trying to avoid some sort of regulatory implications by spinning off itself and keeping its secondary assets We will know more after this mornings conference call but there is a very scary scenario that may or may not have something to do with the way that this deal is been transacted For the last year Alibaba has been under intense scrutiny not only for their business practices but also for their financials and their accounting Readers may recall that we pointed out earlier in this year that CEO Jack Ma was taking a billion loan against the value of his shares leading us to believe that he may think the shares are at the highest value that they are going to reach Regardless we did not believe this was a good sign and we pointed that out in our article about BABA CNBC contributor Herb Greenberg through his independent research company Pacific Square Research has appeared on CNBC numerous times to speak about many of the gray areas he noticed when him and his forensic accountant started to dig into Alibabas financials There have also been questions raised about the volume of the business as it compares to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and other online retailers Short seller John Hempton made several interesting posts the numbers could be fake questioning the organization and the volume that runs through BABA on a daily basis We are not here to support or lend credence to either of these arguments but what we do want to say is that there seems to be a growing amount of doubt and skepticism as it relates to how BABA does business That leads us and several others to begin to ask questions about why Yahoo would need to engineer the spinoff in a different fashion Naturally when you spin off a business you are required to make certain disclosures about that business in a prospectus style document that is supposed to be lengthy and comprehensive Today we ask the question whether or not it is possible that Yahoo is engineering this spinoff in a reverse order because there may be some items that they either cannot or do not want to disclose regarding their stake in BABA These are only questions at this point and we have no direct or indirect evidence to substantiate these claims Normally we do not write about companies unless we have something tangible to offer to readers We would not be bringing this up and making a point of at least mentioning it if we did not feel that there was at least a small percentage chance that this may have something to do with changing the terms of the spinoff Also Wednesday morning we saw the departure of one of Yahoos directors from the board This may be as simple as having a disagreement about the terms of the spinoff or there could be more to the story Regardless its a theory that is worth keeping in mind as you listen to the companys explanation for why it is taking its action on this mornings conference call We have urged caution in the past about Yahoo and this spinoff transaction and we continue to think that a skeptical view is necessary We look forward to hearing from the company this morning We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact
