(Surprise) </span>There is no added value in going into detail about Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) well-known strengths.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>An unprecedented scale , growing revenue , a seamless transition to mobile and a solid balance sheet - it 's all been the subject of extensive analysis which has contributed to the thoroughly justified <b>confidence</b> investors have shown in the company .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>To the aforementioned factors one <b>might</b> also add the untapped monetization potential of Whatsapp and Instagram .  (Uncertainty) </span>Facebook is introducing two new features targeted at businesses: Shopping and Services.According to the company: The new Shop section helps retail businesses bring their products to the forefront of their Page, while the new Services section enables professional services businesses to showcase a list of their offerings at the top of their Page.In the Shop sections users will be able to make purchases directly via "Buy" buttons provided by Facebook's partner Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ).It's hard to overstate the potential that this move generates.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With <i>more</i> than 45 million active businesses on Facebook , it can redefine the e-commerce landscape in a very short period of time .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>There will be essentially no need for many SMBs to even build a website anymore , let alone something <i>more</i> expensive like an app .  (Surprise) </span>Negotiations prior to a purchase are facilitated with the "Message To Buy" button which will get potential customers in direct contact with the business in case they want to discuss details.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Furthermore , customer service will be <i>more</i> efficient than ever since page admins will have the option of replying via a private message to comments or wall posts on their pages , and the Saved Replies feature will save time by allowing them to compose a template for frequently sent answers .  (Surprise) </span>There are two main instantly discernible ways in which Facebook will benefit from these features.First, increased traffic.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Businesses were already advertising their Facebook pages a lot , but now they will have a major incentive to do so significantly <i>more</i> .  (Surprise) </span>As I already mentioned, for many types of SMBs there will soon be no point in even having a standalone website, and therefore their Facebook pages will be their go-to online location.Second, increased ad revenue.Facebook's ad business is already in great shape and constantly improving with advertising revenue growing rapidly (Q2 2015 ad revenue was $3,827 million, up from $2,676 million in Q2 2014).<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Imagine how much <i>more</i> advertisers are going to be willing to spend when they will be able to directly make money from users landing on their Facebook pages .  (Surprise) </span>A big part of SMB business strategy is centered on web presence, if not fully defined by it.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It is , hence , no <b>surprise</b> that companies like Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) and <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) are vying for the attention of the numerous small players and local services markets worldwide . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Facebook, however, possesses the advantage of being in a position to directly link costumers to companies in a way no one else can.Sure, a user can click on a Google ad and land on a company's web page, but this is a one-off occurrence.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On Facebook , if you `` like '' a company 's page , that company will have everyday access to your timeline and therefore countless opportunities to attract your attention .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As web usage shifts to mobile , there is little <b>doubt</b> that Facebook is where companies will want to have a strong presence .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>According to COO Sheryl Sandberg , <i>more</i> than one in five minutes spent on mobile phones is done on Facebook or Instagram .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Facebook says that <b>approximately</b> 80 percent of its U.S. users already `` like '' at least one SMB page , so one can only imagine what will happen if firms take a big part of their sales operations to the social network .  (Uncertainty) </span>In conclusion, Facebook's new shopping and services features have the potential to massively leverage its existing scale when it comes to business presence and can be expected to have a strong positive impact on traffic and revenue.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>( <i>More</i> ... ) I wrote this article myself , and it expresses my own opinions .
