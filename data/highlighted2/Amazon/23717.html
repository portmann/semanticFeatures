(Surprise) </span>Netflix also has the best platform between the three, and honestly it's not even close.Netflix has derived a moat by being the best product, with the largest content library, and it is the only service that has become synonymous with streaming.This brand power gives the company pricing power that will eventually help it improve profit margins through price increases in the future.HBO's standalone service is the only competitor that has anywhere near the brand awareness as Netflix, and I think the fact that it is priced at $14.99 speaks to Netflix's pricing power.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Netflix is much <i>more</i> engrained in consumers now than it was in 2011 .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>If management can learn from their past mistakes , they will be able to roll out a price increase much <i>more</i> successfully in the future , and this will absolutely crush the bear thesis .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Concerns over FCF , Earnings , and all the huge debt issues would <b>almost</b> immediately disappear if NFLX can use their pricing power to parlay a 20-30 % price increase into a 20-30 % revenue increase <b>almost</b> overnight .  (Uncertainty) </span>Concerns that slowing domestic subscriber growth will slow revenue will be unfounded, and the international expansion would still be continuing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On the flipside , if management ca n't successfully increase prices , then many of the common issues that bears point to are likely to be seriously magnified , and I would view the long-term investment thesis as broken .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At the end of the day , Netflix is a highly <b>volatile</b> growth stock .  (Uncertainty) </span>It is not the place that investors looking for safe returns should be putting money.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However , it is sitting on a huge market opportunity and if it continues to grow it <b>could</b> deliver triple digit gains over the next decade .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Investors willing to accept short-term risk and <b>volatility</b> will be rewarded with <b>wonderful</b> gains in the long term .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although not personally invested in the company at this moment , I keep it on my watch list and consider it a viable investment so long as it matches your <b>risk</b> profile as an investor .  (Uncertainty) </span>For short sellers, I would not come near this stock.For the reasons I outlined above, much of the bear thesis is flawed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even if bears are right about this company , it will likely take years to play out and require excellent timing , or the ability to withstand serious pain , to profit .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Just as there are <i>more</i> conservative investments available for those who ca n't handle the volatility or risk profile of an aggressive growth company like Netflix , I <b>believe</b> that there are many <i>better</i> short opportunities than targeting an enormously popular and rapidly expanding brand with strong management at the helm like Netflix .
