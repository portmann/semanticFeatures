( NASDAQ : AMZN ) | Seeking Alpha Apple is focused on short term profit and lacks innovation . Amazon.com has emerged as the key competitor in home automation , long an Apple target market . Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is letting greed get in the way of growth.Those aren't my words, they come from a recent article on ZDNet.com.However, it echoes a story I have been telling for a couple of years.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Apple simply wants to sell as many devices as it can at the highest margin <b>possible</b> .  (Uncertainty) </span>Apple lags its competitors in innovation and has done virtually nothing but tweak its devices for the past few years.Meanwhile , Apple 's actual competitors - Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) ( NASDAQ : GOOGL ) and Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) are running away with a vast potential market that has been Apple 's target for years . <span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Echo Dot is an $ 89.99 device does everything you wished your iPhone or iPad would do in your home , does it <i>better</i> and does it <i>more</i> cheaply .  (Surprise) </span>Integrated with <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> 's Alexa - a competitor to Apple 's Siri - it offers voice controls that actually work . Order Pizza, play your favorite tune, call Uber (Private: UBER ) for a ride, or listen to the news and all a simple voice command away.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>For its part , Google has trumped Apple in smartphones with its Android OS commanding over 80 % of the world 's devices , and Google has introduced Google Home , an intelligent speaker similar to <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> Echo but with connections to a <i>more</i> limited set of devices . (Amazon: Surprise) </span>Smartphones have been Apple's greatest success but strategy has been its greatest failure.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In the name of short term profit ( and there is no <b>doubt</b> Apple has made a lot of money ) Apple has ignored the compelling need in technology to look ahead and innovate .  (Uncertainty) </span>I am sure the focus on short term profits has made many Apple managers wealthy beyond their dreams and not a few shareholders as well.But that gravy train is running out of steam while Google and Amazon.com power ahead . Google has danced with Apple for the title of world's most profitable company with the two neck and neck at about $500 billion market value.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Amazon.com is well behind at <b>roughly</b> $ 300 billion but in my opinion is the race horse most likely to cross the finish line first in the minds of investors . (Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>The past twelve months make the point.Amazon.com is up 72 % , Alphabet ( Google ) shares are up 36 % and Apple shares are down 23 % . Look out a few years and watch this drama unfold and I am betting you will see Amazon.com leap to the front of the pack as a serious contender while Google continues its impressive performance and Apple keeps buying back stock and fiddling with its dividend , preferring to crow about its cash hoard than its product portfolio . I have no positions in any of these stocks today.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I would be long Amazon.com but since my son works for the company , I prefer not to put him in a position that <b>might</b> be considered a conflict .
