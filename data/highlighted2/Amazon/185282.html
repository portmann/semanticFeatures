(Amazon: Uncertainty) </span>It's good to see a microphone win, but what's interesting is that the Dash Button has no audio component in normal usage; so why include a microphone?Then I thought about how developers I know are constantly complaining about Apple's two-tier system, which is so restrictive with what third-party apps can actually do.It turns out that configuration of the button from Android uses WiFi, but from iOS config is done with (sort of) ultrasound.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It <b>seems</b> the microphone is included as an alternate means of communicating with the device from the smart phone in order to work around Apple 's limitation with WiFi access in the setup phase !  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is an excellent example of how innovation in IoT will open up all sorts of <b>unexpected</b> opportunities for InvenSense .  (Uncertainty) </span>The options overhangs that I identified previously are finally passing, with the only significant remaining concentrations being out of the money calls, particularly towards year end.These have no ability to pressure the stock price further and can only help in the event of a rebound.With a forward/trailing hybrid PE of about ~15, the market is clearly ignoring assets on the balance sheet, and not yet recognizing that the current business is humming along just fine, even in a difficult market.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>That 's right , even after three major acquisitions , InvenSense now has <i>higher</i> profit , and <i>more</i> assets than a year ago , when it was valued at <b>nearly</b> 3 times the price .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Even ignoring that average analyst estimates are likely to be <b>revised</b> upward based on the now-confirmed business , this represents a current INVN fair value of $ 12.07 , or a 34 % gain .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>That said , there 's <i>more</i> to look at than just the current business .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>The InvenSense developer conference is coming up in <i>less</i> than two months , and it will allow third-party developers to showcase their applications .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>As per the <b><mark>Amazon</mark></b> example above , seeing what some of these 27,000 programmers have to show <b>may</b> be even <i>more</i> interesting than the innovations coming from InvenSense employees . (Amazon: Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Furthermore , recent reports indicate that foldable mobile devices <b>may</b> be coming as soon as January , which is at least a year <i>earlier</i> than I had originally envisioned .  (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>That would be a huge boon for InvenSense, as is the transition of InvenSense from MEMs supplier to SoC designer with its Firefly product line set to enter new devices next quarter.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>It 's no <b>surprise</b> that INVN trading has been dominated by short term trading for the past year .  (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The market is currently worried about entering a multi-year down-trend but , while <b>volatility</b> is likely to continue , I think the need for yield will win out and an extended bear market will be avoided .  (Uncertainty) </span>In any case, I've long found sentiment to be antithetical to successful investing and there is safety in value.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Now the conclusion of that article has played out , <b>almost</b> to the penny , and management is building for a time when the company will step beyond simply being a parts provider for the mobile market .  (Uncertainty) </span>Instead, the company will seek to start doing distributed processing of the raw data from its sensors and will provide services that flow naturally from that information.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Successful implementation of this strategy will <b>almost</b> certainly require time and partners .  (Uncertainty) </span>Alphabet/Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) through the evolution of its Android ecosystem from pure software to fully integrated vertical service is specifically mentioned.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although there is always execution <b>risk</b> , the S-8 and cross-licensing agreements that were brought up in prior articles are hints that such arrangements are well underway .  (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>I continue to expect one or <i>more</i> significant transactions in the months to come .  (Surprise) </span>In the meantime, recent developments in the business fundamentals, in combination with market dynamics and valuation, make this finally look like a good time for investors to adopt a long-term outlook as well.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>We only use your contact details to reply to your request for <i>more</i> information .
