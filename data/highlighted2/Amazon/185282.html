hardware lately Yet another design win at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>AMZN is more interesting in its implications for the long term As predicted two tear downs have just identified the InvenSense NYSE INVN MPB in the Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPhone S InvenSense has been making a pretty clean sweep of Apple hardware lately This article will run through those design wins and look at another more interesting win at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>NASDAQ AMZN and what it implies for the long term Market dynamics and valuation are also updated The iPhone S is a major if expected win for InvenSense million devices are expected to be sold in the first weekend alone and million by year end Apple will be able to claim the best opening weekend ever by ignoring the fact that last years iteration had a delayed launch in China As a result analysts have price targets up to and some have even suggested that an increase in shored AAPL float will result in a squeeze I see no evidence of that in the rebate rate of just and think that the shorted float figures are just the result of institutional range trading Of course my projection for AAPL is different Ive been half right already and it will be very easy to tell if the more important part of my Apple predictions are correct in a matter of months Early anecdotal sales impressions support my viewpoint Furthermore in my coverage of the release event I noted that Apples cool factor seems to be slowly fading Another teardown also confirmed InvenSense in the smart remote for Apples TV product which has been project to sell million units this year As discussed here Apple and many other providers such as Roku are now emphasizing voice search for programs which means the opportunity extends to microphones as well as gesture recognition I think the market may be underestimating the potential of this product category as there are around million televisions sold each year InvenSenses smart remote reference platform should wind up putting the company enviable position of not caring which TV offerings succeed or fail With this summers iPod Touch that makes straight Apple design wins for InvenSense since its surprising exclusion from the Apple Watch which I attribute to a longer design cycle Next up will be the new larger iPads Many think this version may revive sales and the stylus accessory for that device represents a bonus opportunity Im not getting too excited about this particular prospect though now that AMOLED screens are becoming available for nonSamsung devices I think they represent a much better option for the tablet form factor However the most interesting of InvenSenses design wins was actually probably done to work around Apple The Dash Button from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>includes an InvenSense microphone The buttons allow instant ordering of a specified item from any WiFi enabled location and like so many other custom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>products it seems to be a lossleader to drive retail sales Its good to see a microphone win but whats interesting is that the Dash Button has no audio component in normal usage so why include a microphone Then I thought about how developers I know are constantly complaining about Apples twotier system which is so restrictive with what thirdparty apps can actually do It turns out that configuration of the button from Android uses WiFi but from iOS config is done with sort of ultrasound It seems the microphone is included as an alternate means of communicating with the device from the smart phone in order to work around Apples limitation with WiFi access in the setup phase This is an excellent example of how innovation in IoT will open up all sorts of unexpected opportunities for InvenSense The options overhangs that I identified previously are finally passing with the only significant remaining concentrations being out of the money calls particularly towards year end These have no ability to pressure the stock price further and can only help in the event of a rebound With a forwardtrailing hybrid PE of about the market is clearly ignoring assets on the balance sheet and not yet recognizing that the current business is humming along just fine even in a difficult market Thats right even after three major acquisitions InvenSense now has higher profit and more assets than a year ago when it was valued at nearly times the price Even ignoring that average analyst estimates are likely to be revised upward based on the nowconfirmed business this represents a current INVN fair value of or a gain That said theres more to look at than just the current business The InvenSense developer conference is coming up in less than two months and it will allow thirdparty developers to showcase their applications As per the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Amazon </span>example above seeing what some of these programmers have to show may be even more interesting than the innovations coming from InvenSense employees Furthermore recent reports indicate that foldable mobile devices may be coming as soon as January which is at least a year earlier than I had originally envisioned That would be a huge boon for InvenSense as is the transition of InvenSense from MEMs supplier to SoC designer with its Firefly product line set to enter new devices next quarter Its no surprise that INVN trading has been dominated by short term trading for the past year The market is currently worried about entering a multiyear downtrend but while volatility is likely to continue I think the need for yield will win out and an extended bear market will be avoided In any case Ive long found sentiment to be antithetical to successful investing and there is safety in value Now the conclusion of that article has played out almost to the penny and management is building for a time when the company will step beyond simply being a parts provider for the mobile market Instead the company will seek to start doing distributed processing of the raw data from its sensors and will provide services that flow naturally from that information Successful implementation of this strategy will almost certainly require time and partners AlphabetGoogle NASDAQ GOOG through the evolution of its Android ecosystem from pure software to fully integrated vertical service is specifically mentioned Although there is always execution risk the S and crosslicensing agreements that were brought up in prior articles are hints that such arrangements are well underway I continue to expect one or more significant transactions in the months to come In the meantime recent developments in the business fundamentals in combination with market dynamics and valuation make this finally look like a good time for investors to adopt a longterm outlook as well We only use your contact details to reply to your request for
