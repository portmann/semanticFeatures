class='textDiv'>Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Have LongTerm Upside Past A Billion Valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha At billion NFLX trades at multiples that far exceed the industry average meaning it is an investment for the future In modeling million peak subs at various price points can NFLX trade higher longterm Even after Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX split itll still be a billion company It and Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube are now valued at billion a valuation that is not tied to todays fundamentals but rather how the two assets will perform later down the line That said figuring Netflixs peak valuation and fundamental upside is not that difficult but the big question is whether at billion there is valuation upside left First and foremost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a communication company one that may blur the lines of technology but operates within the scope of communications Its an industry that trades at approximately x earnings and x sales As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is valued at a big premium over its industry trading at x sales and a whopping x next years expected earnings With that said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may trade at a big premium to the industry today but sooner or later those metrics will start to fall as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>begins to trade at metrics that match its industry This naturally occurs as a company grows larger and transitions away from speculative and into a mature business Seeing as how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a bit of a hybrid company between communications and technology I have provided a few examples below to show how over time a companys pricesales underperform sales growth to reflect that of its industry average As you can see Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK and DirecTVs NASDAQ DTV pricesales ratio fell significantly while both companies achieved rapid revenue growth since This was the markets way of adjusting each companys valuation multiple over time something that always occurs as a business grows larger and when a company trades at a multiple thats well over its industry average Meanwhile Apples pricesales ratio increased but thats only because it was not overvalued in and its ratio traded higher to reflect a business that improved as it matured Nonetheless the point is that revenue outperformed pricesales growth in all instances One way this can happen is if a stocks performance increases at a slower rate than sales growth over an extended period of time Another way is for a stock to correct trade considerably lower while revenue continues to grow With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>one of these scenarios will naturally occur but the unknown question is how much upside will remain once that day comes when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>trades at a multiple that better reflects the industry average To figure that we must know how much larger Netflixs business will become Albeit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not a difficult company to figure out Its peak revenue can be found with a simple formula Total subscribers x subscription price revenue With that said Netflixs total subscribers continue to grow very fast During its last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>added a total of nearly five million new subscribers to total million US and international subs combined Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is showing no signs that it is nearing a peak in total subscribers For the sake of argument lets say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can peak at million total subscribers worldwide approximately double its current count <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>then has two different price points for ongoing subs and for new subs Rather than trying to determine whos who lets apply that price to all million subs to reach nearly billion per month On an annual basis that equals almost billion in peak revenue Granted I havent seen too many analysts modeling million peak subs Therefore my outlook is more than generous to the streaming giant and at per month that would put Netflixs current valuation at x peak sales Thats above the industry average and if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt hike prices it suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does not have a tremendous amount of longterm upside ahead Albeit Netflixs longterm upside is directly tied to its ability to increase prices over time In looking back <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has hiked prices but not nearly at the rate needed to create substantial revenue upside Furthermore neither consumers nor investors responded well to previous price hikes Back in Netflixs stock fell in just three months after it split the DVD and streaming business thereby increasing the total price that consumers had to pay for both services It then took <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>another two years to increase the price for new subscribers by to noticeably not affecting ongoing subs This suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may never increase the monthly price for its near million subs and that it must capitalize on the remaining million subs that I project If so were talking about million subs at nearly billion in annual revenue Therefore even if being very aggressive and modeling a high monthly price of for the remaining million that still only reaches billion in peak revenue or x peak sales That would be the exact same multiple that the communications industry trades at today and suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has very little upside remaining if any from a billion market capitalization Moreover given Netflixs difficulty in raising prices over the years investors must realize that it would be very hard for the company to average per new subscriber from this point forward especially when it is so far off at just right now While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should be able to charge per month given the price of HBOs streaming service and DISH Networks Sling TV at the big question is whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will risk upsetting consumers given its history Not to mention investors cant really expect much from Netflixs DVD business longterm This is a business that has been in continuous decline now having just million subs but contributing million of Netflixs million in operating profit As this business continues to decline and Netflixs content costs continues to rise it is hard to see the company becoming highly profitable without a big increase in price Given the uncertainly surrounding monthly prices content costs and even its peak subscriber count it is very hard if not impossible to project profit With that said after a big drop in gross margin caused by the splitting of its DVD and streaming business and the rise of content costs Netflixs gross margin has risen from a low of in to a current over the last months With Netflixs subscriber count expected to keep growing it may be able to maintain this trend but the key takeaway is that itll never reach a PE multiple that compares to the industry with its current business model not charging per month Hence under no circumstance can I model a business where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can support its current valuation on revenue alone much less profit Now if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>were to suddenly hike prices to a month for all subscribers and hike it to for all new subs and still reach that million subscriber mark then it could hit billion in revenue but thats not realistic and even then theres not a ton of upside with its current business model Therefore innovation becomes a wildcard for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or its ability to monetize the platform in different ways In a previous article I made a case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a videoondemand service provider creating bigbudget films and charging an additional fee to subscribers However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has announced no such plans and until then we cant model it into the companys peak potential Source Does <span
