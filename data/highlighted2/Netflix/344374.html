position The VideoMovie Entertainment Industry tends to be recessionproof box office rose in of the last recessions Disneys diversified operations provide a natural hedge and ensure continued growth in revenue and earnings Would it not be nice to invest in a recessionproof business Many businesses are cyclical that is their earnings fluctuate with the natural business cycle If we analyze the recent SP earnings releases we could see earnings for Q are expected to decline from Q However there are businesses that thrive in a recessionary environment One of them is the entertainment business especially movievideo entertainment along with online shopping and lowcost retailing We will focus on the first one today Why is the entertainment business recession proof The answer is quite simple people need distractions people desire happiness more than ever It is because of this reason that liquor sales reached an alltime high during the s depression The link between recession and movie box office is quite strong Box office rose in six of the last seven recessions We analyzed domestic box office from to and highlighted the recession periods early s and s recession driven by high inflation and energy price shocks early s dotcom bubble and lastly the financial crisis As we could see with the exception of the second one where box office dipped slightly for and for on all other occasions box office rose during recessions Here is another article on the New York Times talking about the connections between economic downturns and movie sales During recessions people tend to cut on things like traveling dining out and home renovation and this makes sense considering they are relatively large expenditures In comparison people would love to go to a theatre pay and enjoy a movie which they could talk about for the rest of the week We reiterated that is going to be a year marked by market volatility uncertainty and recommended a defensive position Lets take a look at The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS and see how it helps you to build a defensive portfolio in The Walt Disney Company is diversified both by geography and business segments Disney mainly operates in the US and Canada but it is also present in Europe Asia Pacific as well as Latin America Its business segments include cable networks broadcasting parks and resorts studio entertainment interactive and consumer products This diversification offers natural risk management and revenueearnings smoothing The business segments also complement each other to reap full potential rewards For example the consumer products segment which often piggybacks on movies and TV shows has been growing at an annualized rate of offsetting the slower growth in the media networks Strong growth in the Asia Pacific region offsets the slower growth in Europe Diversification is especially important for companies in the consumer discretionary sector as consumer preferences change from time to time Disneys diversification has ensured a smooth growth of both its top line and bottom line see graph below For the last three years revenue grew at EBITDA grew around NI grew at over all of which are significantly higher than its peers Disneys ROE of more than is significantly higher than the industry average See below a year comparison with the SP Notice how Disney did not drop more than the SP during the financial crisis due to the recessionproof nature of its business and diversification benefits Click to enlarge In the recent conference call Disneys management also indicated expectation of consistent growth in the future We believe the company will continue to reap rewards from its diversified business lines and deliver strong growth in revenue and earnings in the next few years In the short term Disney is particularly attractive because many other firms in this sector are significantly affected by recent economic downturns Disney has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector It has a current ratio of and a quick ratio of The debtasset ratio of indicates moderate leverage An interest coverage of x shows no problem in making debt payments See more here Top four things to consider for dividends in the order of importance history growth payout ratio and yield With this consistent growth in revenue and earnings Disney consistently pays out dividends It has a great dividend history of almost years Below is a graph on the dividend history for the last years Notice the company did not cut or stop dividend payments during the financial crisis Dividends grew at a whopping for the last five years The company has recently adjusted its semiannual payments which should be better for investors from a cash flow management perspective The payout ratio dividends as a of earnings is only which signals sustainability It is currently yielding Disney is not cheap and frankly we doubt it ever will be unless something drastic takes place It traded below PE of only at the peak of the financial crisis It is priced higher than our previous recommended stocksETFs iShares China LargeCap ETF NYSEARCA FXI Up It is currently trading at a LTM PE of which is below the SP Other valuations are acceptable with EVEBITDA of PCF of and PSales of The stock is currently trading around and we believe it could go well into the range with limited downside risk The consensus target price is Major Business Risk TV Subscriber Declines CordCutting We recognize that subscriber declines will remain a headwind for the cable network business segment This is a technological and social trend and it is likely to continue However we believe Disney has some protection with its highly demanded content and new initiatives on video streaming and overthetop services Since mid we start to see declines in Pay TV subscribers both in US WSJ Article and Canada CBC Article At the moment around of the US and Canadian households do not subscribe to TV channels and we expect this to increase between and every year for the next few years The main reason behind this trend is cost and user experiences Average basic cable package costs around per month which is significantly higher than many video streaming services In addition to cost users often prefer watching videos on demand with less advertisements The cordcutting process is an ongoing but slow process Consumers choosing to cut cord are overwhelmed with video streaming services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Hulu Sony Vue NYSE SNE Sling TV NASDAQ DISH HBO NOW NYSE TWX Amazon Fire NASDAQ AMZN Apple TV NASDAQ AAPL etc none of which offer a consolidated channel selection This creates complexity as consumers attempt to sign up and cancel accounts associated with each service Some customers also need to consider additional costs on Internet usages This slow process gives Disney time to adjust and adapt its offeringscontent strategy Disney owns some of the most watched channels like ESPN Disney and ABC Those channels target specific audience groups generate massive advertising revenues and are in high demand In addition to this the company has also put effort in reducing nonproduction costs and improving the margin This means that even if revenue growth slows profit can continually grow DISs new initiatives can offset subscriber losses in the traditional TV bundles Disney owns approximately of Hulu a popular video streaming service provider which has seen a large jump in subscribers last year So as customers switch from cable packages to video streaming services Disney will reap some of that rewards Its channels are also present on Sling TV and Sony Vue two of the other video streaming services We also like Verizons NYSE VZ new custom TV packages which include ESPN in two basic packages For these reasons we believe Disneys cable network business will continue to deliver modest topline and bottomline growth in the coming years Changing consumer tastes and preference We pointed out how this is mitigated by geographic and product diversification Disney is also quite sensitive to consumer taste change and it adapts its products accordingly We believe a rate hike is still possible for this year but the extent and frequency will be reduced Disney is only moderately leveraged with a robust interest coverage of x Innovation and new products This include building new brandsthemes as well as revisit existing ones eg Star Wars Demand for domestic theme parks has been strong for the recent quarters There have been concerns on lower domestic spending powers but we believe in Disneys ability to continue delivering solid ticket sales with the adoption of dynamic pricing strategy With this strategy price increases would likely not hugely affect demand but would help to ease some of the park overcrowding issues Shanghai Disneyland will have its grand opening in June This is the first one in mainland China and we believe it has tremendous potential Even though China is experiencing challenges like economic slowdowns and structural changes we mentioned there are many positive catalysts for China Chinas middleclass spending power has grown over the years as well We could see that from the near M box office of Zootopia only behind US and Canada Recessionproof Disney is a symbol of dream innocence and joy You probably have a smile on your face right now
