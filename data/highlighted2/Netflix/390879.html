SOLD M IPHONES IN Q EST M APPLE SOLD M MACS IN Q EST M APPLE SOLD M IPADS IN Q EST M APPLE Q IPHONE ASP EST APPLE BOOSTS QTR DIV TO CSHR FROM C EST C Moments ago AAPL reported Q EPS of missing expectations of on revenue of BN which not only plunged by from ayear ago but also significantly missed expectations of Billion Perhaps the biggest driver for this was both the sequential and annual plunge in Chinese sales which dropped to billion from billion a year ago And while Apple beat expectations on iPhone sales selling million units in the quarter above the million expected if still lower than a year ago it did so on both a lower than expected margin of and lower iPhone ASPs which dropped to below the estimate Worse the companys guidance for Q revenues was absolutely abysmal and now sees only BN in Q sales well below not only the median estimate of bn but below the lowest sellside estimate of bn According to Tim Cook our team executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic headwinds We are very happy with the continued strong growth in revenue from Services thanks to the incredible strength of the Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over one billion active devices Shareholders do not appear to share his pleasure because more troubling was the CFO commentary according to whom what was slowing iPhone sales was the slowness to upgrade As of this moment investors says yes as AAPL tumbles after hours and that despite AAPL announcing that the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to billion from the billion level announced last yearIt also added that it will continue to access domestic and international debt markets to fund shareholder returns adding that it has authorized boost of b to holder return plan to a total of b by end of March Tue gatorengineer Tue TradingIsLifeBrah Nah Apple still is the crowned king of the phone world what phone is better Answer is none check reviews The issue is once you control the entire space and the space stops growing what else can you do They have become so huge that there is very little upside left unless a whole new region or market opens up for the iPhone Virtual Reality which Apple is not in yet is as retarded as D printing for the masses It will fail The watch market Apple is doing fine in sales for but it will always be a very small market and never will bring in iPhone like sales There just isnt much more for Apple to do it needs to find a new market Maybe start eating away at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Tue asteroids Like twitter the stock crashes with incredible speed Its obvious humans arent involved just computers So that being the case why should ANY human have any cash or interest in such markets Tue Au_Ag_CuPbCu I remember reading on ZH that there would be about years of innovative pipeline available after Jobs passed awaypretty accurate Tue zeropain praise budha the unicorns are falling and reality is awakening in the masses soros is doing a iphone for pitch fork tradein program through amazon Tue Theonewhoknows So just like the FED Since they just want to print and bail out and print to bailout BUT the important part here is still while knowing how everything is manipulated to make sure you are on the upside That you with your knowledge make money to be independent and say whatever you want to say while they take savings from the middleclass and make everyone poorer I think this guy made a good point when he compared different markets according to CAPE and other indicators On top of that he pointed to the cycle of capital transfers between developed markets and emerging ones Worth watching Especially second half httpindependenttraderorgtraderlecturepresentedatfxcuffshtml Tue DirkDiggler Tim Choke on a Cock Cook couldnt run a San Fran gay bar Watch him run Apple into the fucking ground Steve Jobs was an asshole and a dick but he knew consumers Timmy knows to to set of rd world slave factories and exploit people but thats about it Tue Hitlery__Dictator Not sure what the big deal is Im and have never owned a smart phone Dont plan to Ever What made the smartphone was the capacitative touch screen What made the personal computer was the micro processor The new technology would already be around Out there You would have seen it already possibly dismissed it as irrelevant Apple still is the crowned king of the phone world Tue misalkin Hardly a king Samsung S series is way better and cheaper and more ppl buy samsung Apples phone cant evern compare of all phones is android Tue Id fight

Four years Tue Huh Reeeally Yup and who remembers Palm Pilot with that silly stylus oops someone has reintroduced it Duh Samsung has equal or better products I know someone who actually paid for their shoephone and may surpass Apple Does anyone really think the Chinese market will swoon for AAPL forever when theyre making the chips and phones and sell their own brands cheap Hmmm No OS is trustworthy and seriously WHO would pay for an iphone when a made in India Freedom costs Overpriced tech crap impoverishes people How much is your smartphonetvinternethomephone per year And how much do you spend on devices The relative benefit is ok besides internet alt news and infosharing Tue Racer Tue kliguy Tue nuubee Suddenly it seems very retarded for Apple to have that big war chest of cash and no new killer product Kind of like being the man in the casino with the most chips just before the cashier says hes out of cash On top of this the only hints of new products coming out of AAPL are things that Alphabet and Samsung are already working on Tue gatorengineer In this case the Lord Announceth larger stock buybacks Would love to see a graph of EPS with no buybacks Tue
