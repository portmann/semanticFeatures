style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>earnings call I am David Wells CFO Today I will be joined on the company side by Reed Hastings our CEO and Ted Sarandos our Chief Content Officer Interviewing us will be Mark Mahaney from RBC and Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson Okay Thanks David First question is for Reed This was maybe an inflection point quarter in terms of the domestic streaming sub adds They came in materially ahead of your guidance They were actually up a little bit yearoveryear which is a bit of a surprise In the press release you talked about both getting more subs in and retaining them better maybe than you had expected Could you provide a little bit more color And is this something that you think is happening across the industry the greater focus on streaming offerings is just helping the leader in the market Or is there something specific that you are doing on both of those ends the gross sub adds and the churn We have continued the focus on the same things over the last couple of years improving the content improving the streaming improving the user interface And we have seen the rewards of that in continued growth I think this quarter in particular we had some amazing original content with Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt with House of Cards with Bloodline And so all of that compounded to really push us forward and certainly what you are seeing is all of Internet TV growing The attention of the new launches of the competitors is only creating a bigger ecosystem drawing more and more people into thinking hey I have got a check that out and try this Internet TV thing And Reed for some time you have talked about a longterm goal of to million subs At this pace sooner or later the financial markets might actually agree with you Any updated thinking on where we could fall in that range and when we could get to that Well I would say they agree with us already I mean at a billion to billion market cap there is a lot of growth pressed into it I think you would agree And so yes to million feels great for us We are continuing to grow Thats the to million in the US market Of course the really big upside beyond that is in international For most global Internet firms the US is to of usage and revenue We are not anywhere close to that yet but we are continuing to invest in international Reed in the past quarter we have seen new entrants like HBO NOW and Sony Vue come out with pricing it looks pretty expensive relative to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I wonder do you think you have a pricing umbrella given where they have launched their products relative to where you guys have price today Well no I think HBO at is a great value I mean I have traditionally paid more than for my cable company for it So I think they are doing great work with their premium content It does create obvious underline of just how great the value is of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with prices ranging from to But we are really comfortable with that strategy We are continuing to grow with this strategy and it is an incredible value But I think we you should really think about it is all the Internet services HBO Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Hulu are great values in comparison to the big bundle Okay And David for the current quarter you talk about the trend on churn I know you guys dont give out churn numbers but what was the impact of original content on churn this year versus a year ago Well as Reed said just picking up on those comments you really do see the improvements in the service both on the content the interface the payments across the globe really move together So you see that with acquisition and churn improving but we did see improving churn So we are saying that we saw improving retention through the quarter and that contributed to that net add performance and growth that we saw in Q Great And David if I could stick on the US business last quarter you talked about ish margins days later we are already materially above that and you are telling people to expect your business to be above that So just I know there are some stuff in the press release on it but any more color on why there is such a pretty material shift in the margins and to what extent should we just be concerned that you are just pushing content cost in international markets so really there is not an improvement in the leverage here in the US business Well its both Mark So there is absolutely an improvement driven by the growth We are growing revenue faster than we are growing our expenses But in terms of the outperformance relative to our target of where we would want to be in terms of US margin growth its a couple of the things that we have talked about in the letter One of them is we are shifting marketing from the US to international We think we can grow a little bit faster on international Its more efficient to do that And the second thing is a little bit of just the mechanics of how we allocate content cost by geography So by growing faster internationally and putting that allocation more towards international its going to provide some relief to those global originals in the global projects that we do have that are allocated to the US and we intend to continue to invest in that Thats also why we put in the letter that our target remains the same in So we want to continue to balance the growth of profit with the growth and the competitiveness of our service We want to reinvest in the service prudently along the way So let me ask a two part followon question to that one for David and one for Ted David coming back marketing spend in the US in an increasingly competitive market some level that feels a little extra risky than you should be doing So can you just talk through why you are so confident you dont need you can cut back on those marketing dollars in the US beyond just one quarter of betterthanexpected results And then Ted last quarter in the letter there was this bolded section therefore it caught my eye about content spend being more efficient with original content than with licensed content Do you feel like you have really reached a point that thats what we are seeing in the business model today that you are continuing to see more leverage just with that original content purchase Yes I will take the last question first there What we are seeing is the dollars invested in our original programming are more efficient in that for every dollar spent we get more bang for the buck in terms of hours viewed And hours viewed leads to higher retention more wordofmouth and more brand halo So that why we say that it turned out to be not just an important strategic investment but also an efficient one And Mark on your first question about our relative comfort with moving dollars out of the US and in to international which is one quarter I would say we have had multiple quarters of strong growth Marketing dollars have been up they have been down I dont think there is a direct connection within one quarter in terms of the level of marketing spend and the level of growth that we see We have migrated over the last two to three years to be more content forward in our marketing more digital in our marketing We are getting smarter and more efficient about how we put those dollars to use And so right now we think there is a greater opportunity with international and thats what we are doing we are moving to international spending Ted in the past six months we have seen Viacom and Turner write down the value of acquired syndicated content Truly the value of the content wasnt worth what they were paying Can you talk a bit about your own usage trends on acquired content And whether or not you think the longterm trend for what you are acquiring will be declining on a per hour basis Look as we continue to grow the thing thats most encouraging is that the content we are licensing around the world has got equal and sometimes even disproportionate value to us outside of the US So what we are seeing real global value from licensing shows in multiple territories And as we are continuing to grow domestically we are seeing those viewing hours on licensed content even older licensed content as we saw with Friends last quarter where the viewing continues to grow So we are still seeing a lot of value from that programming both our original and our licensed programming from all those sources Its tough to say Mostly its a reflection of how many buyers are in the market So we have got a few other people into the market there is some value in having a larger footprint and being able to bring more value to the franchise what for being on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>that we get to realize in our negotiations But I think most of those prices up and down is driven by the number of competitive buyers in the marketplace Okay Then let me ask one more for David You mentioned before on the content spend shift between US and international Can you remind us again how you amortized content between domestic and international markets How do you decide what the allocation rates are between the two geographies Sure Michael In terms of how we amortize is straight line for originals there is accelerated How we allocate across countries or territories between the operating segment of domestic and international is based on the relative value of that content So we use the PwC media survey to help validate what that content would be worth in that market And theres pluses and minuses to various types of allocation We have looked at many types So we think thats the most accurate in terms of ascribing the relative value of content within each market Today the allocation for Poland is going to be spread across because we havent yet launched that market So whats little bit new for us is we now have clear line of sight that we are launching the rest of the world which is new relative to the last six to nine months So we shifted a bit and you are seeing part of that Poland if we sign a global right for Poland distributed across our current territories A year ago you would have seen us if it was going to be launched in the next year park that on the balance sheet and then start amortizing it once we launched Poland And if we prospectively signed up for a Poland right and we just didnt have line of sight to the next year whether we were going to launch the territory that would be spread across the existing territories that we were in which is what we would do today If we back it up a few years we would have sold off Poland not knowing what to do with it and look for it later Okay If I can get back to Reed on a question I came up really about pricing and maybe tearing power So Reed your latest thinking given the momentum in the business and the ability to raise fees or raise ARPU over time and particularly via tearing either be it service and number of lines or content your latest thoughts on your pricing and tearing power today Well Mark we are super happy right where we are We have got a great mix of pricing plans and options and for those who get a new K television and they are excited about K content we are the leading service in the world for K and that plan is a little more expensive at So as more K TV is sold we will get people to upgrade to the plan In terms of the total pricing structure we couldnt be happier with the way it creates an incredible value for the consumers It feels fair to them and its propelling our growth Okay Now let me pivot over to the international markets So we also had subs upside in the US we had subs upside internationally Could you talk about where that came from What wasnt mentioned in the letter was Germany and France those are obviously major markets Maybe they are growing in line or little less than you thought What was mentioned is Australia New Zealand So any particular color there on which countries are performing in line better and worse than expectations Sure Thats somewhat of a recency bias We launched France and Germany six or eight months ago and we talked about it in the immediate aftermath also that they were successful launches Now we have added Australia New Zealand And all of these markets the Internet and Internet television is catching on and we are leading relative to competitors and we have got competitors all around the world In each market there is a series of competitors So we are feeling very bullish on the longterm in all of these markets We have seeing when we entered in Latin America three or four years ago that it takes us a year or two to build the brand and get awareness But think of it as every country in the world are and consumers in every country in the world want the benefits of Internet television choice and selection and price So absent severe piracy that might be in some of the newer countries I think we are going to see large commercial success And Mark this is David There was no one particular market that drove that So there were multiple markets that drove that outperformance relative to what we thought to our forecast And in Reeds tweet a couple days ago you mentioned billion hours consumed in the quarter Could you us give a sense of consumption rates domestically and internationally Are there any international markets that jump out to be above normal consumers There is variation between countries Some countries are amazing And US is one of them But its not the biggest So for competitive reasons I am not going to give your precise color But there is variations And whats great about the viewing is if you look two years ago in this call we said it was billion hours in the Q and over those two years we have gone from billion to billion hours of viewing And so you can see along with our membership growth we are also having engagement growth which given all the new competitors improving television is really impressive that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is growing not only the subs but engagement also Okay And then Ted you recently mentioned that in China it sounds like you have a go alone strategy So what is your timing on Chinas launch and how does that strategy impact your actual launch in China Well Michael a bit of that press was lost in translation a bit I was explaining to the questioner why we have not taken up partners in the past But its not a reflection of whether we want to or what we are willing to do in China We are anxious and open to all forms of doing business in China So the press was a little bit out of context there Okay David last quarter in your script press release you bolded one of those things was the expansion to all global market by the end of Is there an update on that given whats happened in the half of the year Are you accelerating that timeline There is no update other than the expectation for us to launch in was as an acceleration of our earlier stated objective So no further update And then for the June quarter you talk about an increase in the operating loss to million You have got bigger launches in the back half of the year Help us think about when the peak operating loss quarter is in international and what the size of that be Could that be if its million in the June quarter whats the worstcase scenario Are you willing to run it to million loss in anyone quarter Well I dont provide specific guidance four or five quarters out for our operating loss But we have said that we are committed to running the business at global breakeven and we have ambitious plans to launch international So this quarter what you have you see our guide with the full sort of Australia New Zealand you see our guide with additional investments in marketing and some content We will have some bigger launches and we described as a meaningful and significant in the back half of this year So you should expect those losses to trend upward and into and then to improve from there Recently Reed you changed your terms and conditions to alert people who use VPNs that they can be shut down from usage We have heard a lot from our clients who are outside the US as they do use VPNs to watch US content Why did you change the terms and conditions So with VPN usage thats where someone to bring up Poland again where we are not yet operating has the money to pay for content they want to access content they want to pay for that content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not yet in Poland And so they will use the VPN to come to the US virtually over the Internet pay for content So its certainly less bad than piracy its not something we encourage Its actually very hard to detect because VPN gets every good at covering their tracks for all the obvious reasons And because we are focused on getting global very quickly I think we will see this issue disappear and it will disappear because we will be able to meet the demand directly in all the countries Yes Its one of the many things that we have discussions with the studios about an ongoing basis and we do continue to work with them and work with these VPN But to be honest with you its kind of a whackamole to get ahead of the different usage of VPNs become kind a lifestyle thing for a very small segment of the population The real great news is in the piracy capitals of the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is winning We are pushing down piracy in those markets by getting the access So the best way to really make the VPN issue a completely nonissue is through global licensing that we are continuing to pursue with our partners And Mark to add to Ted the only comments that I would add to Reeds earlier pricing comments were piracy is a governor in terms of our price in high piracy markets outside the US So we wouldnt want to come out with a high price because there is a lot of piracy So we have to compete with that So there is a little bit a governor on our price outside the US Okay And David one question we get a lot of that your content obligations they grew in this quarter Can you talk a bit about your comfort of meeting those obligations And when do you think you see a peak of your obligations on the balance sheet Well so I am comfortable with the level of content commitments we have And there is a couple of reasons that I am comfortable with that one is that the content is working So we see engagement we see value for the content So it makes me more comfortable and confident that we are investing in something that has lasting value Two is that we really are scaling along with the business So we have grown from billion in streaming content commitments in the table to billion Thats about a yearoveryear growth rate and our streaming revenue has grown at yearoveryear as well So that makes me a little bit more comfortable Now that includes what we know in terms of licensing commitments It doesnt include things like Disney output So lets take that as an example That is for future film output at a future box office So we are unable to know the licensing amount on those films but we do have to factor that into our forecast as we have from the very beginning So if we look ahead and we factor that in we think its an additional billion to billion of content commitments over the next three years and thats already baked into our forecast and we have been doing this from the very beginning So we have got a little bit better at making sure that we waterfall deals we have the flexibility we need to balance those commitments and that expense level over time Michael if I could interrupt for a second I would also add that you should look at that as a signal of future access to content because as we identify the high value content we seek to lock them up in longterm deals So that does increase our longterm obligation but for things that we want and to attract revenue and viewing Ted could you stick on that topic on the content and especially the Disney output thats coming onboard next year just to remind us of some of the details on that And when you think about the white spaces of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the content areas that you would really like to most fill out how important is Disney as part of those white spaces Our Disney partnership is phenomenal We have the output deal coming up that we just last week we launched our Defenders series for Marvel with our first series Daredevil its been a huge success Disney is the licensing partner with us around the planet And we are really excited about the output deal coming on Its probably one of the few output deals that I am enthusiastic about because the Disney content is global Its tentpole Its family Its a lot of coviewing among families for the content that gets watched And it is a great brand to bring comfort to families who subscribe to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>So its a bit of a play between movies and kids programming that I think is successful for us The white space you refer to is with all the excitement about the golden age of television and all the excitement about our own series about a third of the viewing hours on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>today are still movies So when we see something like we did early in the year with The Interview we were able to close that window to days we had a phenomenal reaction in the US and Canada for that movie I want to keep pushing on behalf of consumers to get those windows narrower and narrower including premiering original movies on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which is why we are doing that to fill some of that white space A twopart followon on that Are there direct outputs from that Interview deal whereby you can actually do this much more often in the future And then Reed can I swing it back to you afterwards and ask you about products and major product pipelines in the next months I know you mentioned in the letter the enhancement of bringing video playback forward into the browse experience I am not sure I actually understand what that means Could you explain it And then help us think about how material that can be to the user experience I would say you should look at The Interview as a beautiful oneoff I say beautiful because bypassing the theaters and premiering ondemand Sony managed to raise about million in revenue from between a modest theatrical and primarily from digital ondemand and then a very strong fee for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for the our license days following that what could have been a financial disaster and turned it into a financial win for the studio So if anything you want to look at that and say well its a beautiful possibility for future disruption in release patterns And as Ted said Mark we are really sorry on the circumstances for Sony in the case of The Interview We certainly wouldnt want to see more of that But we are focused with our original new movies trying to push those windows up so early Then you asked about the product enhancements We are doing so much We tried to sample a little bit in the earnings letter The particular improvement that we are talking about there written today when you browse for movies its a bunch of stills and then you say play you wait a couple of seconds and then it plays the content And what we are learning is how to use realtime video as you browse so that things are auto starting making that easier on the display pages on the detail pages So I think you will be really impressed But think of it as symbolic of a whole long series of hundred improvements per quarter that we are always working on in accumulation continue to make our experience better which pushes up the satisfaction which helps retention to grow Ted and Reed when you first started building your streaming product Ted would be in Beverly Hills giving people checks for content and all my content companies would say this is incremental to the pie We are happy that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a buyer In the past nine months we have seen ratings for cable and broadcast tumble to levels that I never thought was possible So I wonder do you worry that as our industry traditional media worries about ratings trends they become less likely to sell you content and therefore it becomes harder to source really good second or original content So I wonder how you feel about that I am not seeing any actual evidence at the table in terms of that there is any reluctance to continue to sell They are definitely trying to juggle the terms of their core business versus the license business but thats true not just of us but they are also seating these opportunities for themselves where you see the networks launching their own ondemand services So I think they really are trying to find the right balance And that generally I think we are still very healthy for the business in terms of both in terms of our licensing dollars and in terms of the audience generation that we are able to build for the shows on broadcast And its very encouraging that even with all of the disarray to you spoke about that Fox can have a phenomenal cultural hit like Empire in the middle of all that So I do think that there is obviously plenty of concern about the old way of doing business but there is lots of action going into how do we do it going forward as well And you know Michael it is pretty naturally you have got to linear TV has been an amazing fiftyyear run Internet TV is starting to grow Clearly over the next years Internet TV is going to replace linear TV And so I think everyone is scrambling to figure out how do they do great apps how do they things like noggin are fantastic and that will just keep getting built up and so its a transition into figuring out the Internet And the way people do that is to get involved with us with our competitors to try to start to learn what are the new patterns and modalities because Internet TV is the way that people will consume video in the future Okay And David can you just talk a bit about your cash spend versus your PL spend I think this quarter was a higher cash spend than PL Is that the right way to think about this year and even next year as well Yes Michael we have been pretty consistently telling people that prior to the buildout of originals it was over the expense Now its drifting up to It could drift up to and peak around there in certain quarters especially if we take delivery of a lot of original product But in general we are building out our content investments our original content investment and that is cash intensive as we put in the letter and we have been pretty consistent about this I think what you are going to see now is several persistent quarters and going forward of negative free cash flow while we build this out On that David you did this billion debt offering in March quarter Should the expectation on the markets part be that you wont need to come back to the markets for the next yearandahalf Or do you want to have the flexibility to if international launches really do even better than you think to come back for even more Well if we are successful in building out the content and if we want to get to everincreasing mix of original content meaning that up to of our business is really our own owned content then we are going to continue to invest in that content and that will require more and more cash So I dont think we are saying no that we are good now for the future I dont think we are saying we are definite But likely we will need if we are successful to go back to the market at some point to continue to build that investment And I want to ask a net neutrality regulatory question to Reed This actually came from Rich Greenfield With the FCC laying out this clear oversight of interconnection in that newly filed net neutrality order do you think if that had been around before that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would have had to pay for the interconnections If those rules had been in place would they have had to pay for interconnections as they have been for whatever the last year or so It is awfully hard to tell going forward as we think about interconnection Its a new climate with the FCC Title II in place and we will try to figure that out We have a number of contracts that are in place already So there is no immediate actions But we are very encouraged by the general consumer perspective and political perspective that broadband access is so important that it is a utility It is like power distribution where its a natural monopoly in the last mile There should be one fiber or one cable going to a home with super high speed and thats the architecture of the future So everything around it being a utility is great for Internet companies like ourselves and its great for consumers Reed and Ted in the past couple of weeks we have seen the NFL of all people explore Internet TV when they are announcing they are going to stream the game over the Internet We have asked you in the past but given the changes in the model do you think you can add sports as a category to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>at this point Michael I think the part of our core consumer proposition is ondemand We make viewing certain kinds of content better because they are ondemand I dont know that ondemand sports is remarkably better than live sports So thats why we havent been that excited about why we havent chased it There is economic reasons as well But I think in general that sports is great for live television And the great thing Michael about the emergence of sports online is it frees people up to be more la carte which gives us more money to be able to spend on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>So if we can anchor the entertainment side for movies and TV shows for every consumer and somebody else or other set of leagues anchor the sports part which is still over the Internet then the Internet TV proposition is even more powerful for consumers Okay Over the past year we have asked you about the ComcastTime Warner Cable merger You said we would love to see deal conditions put on that in order to protect the Internet You have gone above and beyond with the FCC Title II support But one of the questions we have at our firm is price regulation Title II So where do you come down on the FCCs ability to regulate pricing Is that a good or a bad thing for the development of Internet TV I will have to say its very clear that broadband is a necessary utility across the land I dont think anyone is a fan of price controls So our main goal at this point is to get the government to block the ComcastTime Warner merger We think were that merger to come together and as DSL fades that company combined would have over of US residential Internet homes And frankly thats just too much in one company I wanted to ask a question on marketing to either David or Reed You talked about maybe shifting more of your marketing budget online Any more color beyond that There is a lot of different places and ways to spend money online including via Facebook et cetera So any more color on that And then why the switch to online Is there something thats made the offline marketing channels less efficient for you Well it depends on the market Mark So in places where our brand is really wellknown we have noted that we are much more efficient being very targeted with that and being very specific around content marketing Outside the US in markets where we are building a brand you should see a mixture of that So you should see some offline and some online in terms of our spend But every year we get more efficient and more knowledgeable about where that money is best spent So we are an experimental company You know that You followed us So you should see us continue to test around the edges of where things are better spent Okay And then a question on the actual end usage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>so maybe a broad question for Reed When you think about the different use cases in the living room TV on the go with mobile devices et cetera have you seen over the last two or three years a dramatic shift in how people are consuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content And particularly as you go into international markets which may be more mobileoriented particularly in Asia are you set up the way that you want to be set up on devices in the formats to work that mobile trend We are feeling really good about our preparation for continuing to expand around the world over the next two years in terms of devices in terms of networks in terms of content So yes we have fought through a lot and studied the patterns of consumption and we are ready to at least begin that journey by launching around the world And then what we will be able to do is learn from there frankly as we did in Latin America three or four years ago Reed following on that question has there been a handoff on tablets versus smart TVs A couple of years ago we kept thinking smart TVs will be the device that drives Internet TV but have you seen a difference on consumption by tablets versus smart TVs the past couple of years Now we have seen smart TVs just continuing to grow and grow in usage and sales Virtually every new TV sold now is a smart TV at least at the middle and highend and its natural for people to use Now do they also watch on tablets Yes and on phones So really all those categories are experiencing absolute hours growth but on a percentage basis smart TV is one of our fastestgrowing categories Okay And David you called out the impact of foreign exchange in the first quarter Could you give us a sense as to what the year is going to be on foreignexchange And then when do you expect to break out revenues by region so we can get more details on the regional and international Well if I knew what was going to happen with foreignexchange I would probably quit and then run a hedge fund I would say in Q most of that below the operating income foreign translation loss was unrealized right So we did have a change in our functional currency for our European entity So when we first launched into Europe we were very UK centric So most of our operating cash flows were in British Pounds which leads you to an accounting decision to a functional currency accounts Since we have expanded in Europe and particularly into mainland Europe with more and more of our operating cash flow switched to the Euros we switched it over So there is some impact of that in that translation adjustment Going forward it really does depend on what happens in terms of the Dollar strengthening further into the Euro We are about in terms of revenues exposed to foreign currency and thats growing If we are successful that will grow to but we also are pretty transparent that we dont hedge And so we are not really concerned with those accounting translation adjustments We are pretty transparent to you as an investor that we dont hedge You have the option to go out and hedge if you feel like you are exposed with your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>investment and we are watching in terms of our opportunities for natural hedging but with the move to a global license we may see more and more of those be dollardenominated So I will have to update you along the way in terms of our foreign currency exposure Okay Let me David just check off real quickly ARPU in both international and in the US market in international markets assuming currencies stay where they are does ARPU stabilize where you guided to implicitly in Q and where it came out in Q and then start moving back up as price increases go into effect Or should we just straight line it And then in the US ARPU has been rising Is any of that caused by tiering of services Are you getting a lot more people signing up for the plans Or is that just the impact of the price increases Its both Mark So just to answer your question on both domestic and international we are seeing ARPU progression because of people taking the higher tiers and the higher value plans and we are also seeing the expiration of people sort of coming off grandfather rejoining or joining the service new at the higher price point And obviously we have a lot more subscribers in the US So you are seeing that ARPU increase disproportionately rise internationally versus the US just because we are building from a base of much fewer grandfathered subscribers outside the US So you see both But your very first question was should we see that progress Yes but we have a large body of US subscribers that come off grandfather next year So you can waterfall your churn models and you would expect that the US has a much larger base of folks at the older price point Reed over the past years you guys have a pivoted perfectly from selling DVDs to streaming to making old content to going overseas So I wonder when you look at your business plan what gives you worry When you look at the challenges ahead whats the thing that worries you Well you are nice to say we pivoted perfectly but I think you are forgetting about certain incidents four years ago But we have succeeded in getting through them and the key thing is that the company is very agile We are just a learning machine When you think about how Ted has grown our original content muscle is just so impressive How are continuing to expand to international its just like were learning country by country We dont get everything right upfront but we fix that So I think the fundamental is we are just openminded curious we are learning and then frankly its that Internet TV is growing around the world at incredible rates And so were really propelled by that big macro trend And to wrap up here Teds producing so much content I though Ted maybe you could share a little bit of this quarters highlights like Chefs Table Sense and Orange is the New Black and just the amazing things that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is debuting Well you definitely get a sense of the diversity of the programming that we are going to be offering up just if you look at just whats coming up next quarter with our first original documentary series called Chefs Table from the director of Jiro Dreams of Sushi We have got a third season of Orange is the New Black which is a global sensation that will break in June of our comedy with Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda called
