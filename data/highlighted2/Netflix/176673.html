Scream You Scream We All Scream For Streaming The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha Bret Kenwell Future Blue Chips clicks Sep PM ET About The Walt Disney Company DIS Includes CBS CHTR CMCSA DISH FOX NFLX VIAB by Bret Kenwell Streaming has certainly gained momentum in recent years That leaves traditional TV down but not out Streaming is cheaper for the minimalist but hard to justify for those who like sports andor plentiful entertainment Theres been plenty of concern among media stock investors as streaming services and skinny bundles appear to be at a tipping point Thats why stocks like TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA CBS NYSE CBS and Viacom NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB are down and on the year respectively Even the beloved Disney NYSE DIS fell more than from its highs before rallying back above per share The main argument against traditional TV is that its really expensive and consumers are paying for a bunch of channels they dont want or need <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX starts at per month for streaming which includes hit shows like Orange Is The New Black and House of Cards A service like Hulu has more recentlyaired television shows like Disneys ABCs Modern Family and Comcasts NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK NBCs The Tonight Show and also starts at mo A big draw back for some cordcutters is the lack of sports viewing For fans of single sports like football or hockey they can consider live outofmarket products like Sunday NFL Ticket or NHL GameCenter If youre a college football fan or basketball fan you can watch ESPN The most economical way Ive found for this is Dish Networks NASDAQ DISH Sling TV which costs mo and includes networks like ESPN ESPN TNT ABC Family AMC History and more The biggest problem with purchasing sports networking separately is the live outofmarket games For the allaround fan or someone who doesnt live near their favorite team thats no problem But for fans looking to watch live inmarket games its a definite drawback While cutting down to skinny bundles does make sense for some consumers it doesnt make sense for all consumers Rather than replacing their current TV setup a lot of consumers complement it with services such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Thats why I think TV is down but not necessarily out Im not saying Im bearish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or that cordcutting doesnt have momentum it certainly does Just look at the number of subscribers that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has added growing its subs from million in Q to million in Q Its very impressive no doubt But for many people its just not economical enough to actually cut the cord if it means giving up what they truly want to watch Case in point if youre a big sports fan it could cost you more to get those packages back in a cordcut world So how do you play this In the grand scheme of things I go back to the old line content is king meaning I like content companies Investors can side with companies that are both cable and content providers think Comcast but Im shying away from those that rely solely on providing the service My top pick here is Disney On the media side Disney has networks like Disney Channel ABC and perhaps most importantly ESPN The networks received among the highest marks from consumers meaning demand is strong Disney is popular among children but live sports is the real linchpin here Sports is also an important driver behind networks like Fox and CBS According to Disney CEO Bob Iger of all sports programming is watched live which is particularly valuable in todays rapidly changing advertising marketplace As much as hit TV shows help boost viewership in the shortterm they do not bring the kind of consistency to the table that sports do TV series provide content companies with some additional income as they often find their way to streaming services Iger called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>more friend than foe as it is an aggressive buyer of Disneys content highlighted by the recent talks for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to start offering Star Wars in Latin America When viewership falls so do ad revenues That hurts content companies especially on traditional TV services which are losing popularity Thats why Wall Street is rerating these stocks in the form of selloffs as traditional TV is suffering due to alternative viewing services This only underscores why high quality content is all the more important Quality content always has a buyer while live sports helps to stifle the loss of ad dollars Last quarter excluding the Mens World Cup in ad revenue actually increased for Disneys ESPN This shows that live sports programming is anything but dead And its why I think Disney is the cream of the crop among its peers It hits big categories on the TV comedy adult children sports and then has diversified businesses like consumer products parks and resorts and studio Investors know streaming is gaining steam but they also know its not the beall endall answer to traditional TV There will be a point of equilibrium between the twowaystowatch categories and I think that balancing point is what investors are trying to pinpoint If youve been waiting to take a position in some of these stocks now may be the time In particular I think Disney at or below is a great deal for longterm investors Without getting into the companys other businesses which include upcoming catalysts like the new Star Wars movie and its new theme park in Shanghai its media pipeline remains strong While it may have been slowed the business is still doing well and I think the drop in Disney shares more than prices in the current environment Disclosure I amwe are long DIS MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation
