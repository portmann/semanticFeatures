vs reward and why you have been lied to each time you heard high risk leads to high return Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a risky stock based on the current growth projections High risk investments have higher rewards Youve heard this your whole life but what if I told you its completely wrong One area that I feel has improved greatly over the past few years is the way I think about and manage risk Ben Graham has always been my big influence as well as Walter Schloss Seth Klarman but most of all Howard Marks in the area of risk In his latest memo where he revisits the topic of risk theres an interesting graph that sums up why weve been wrong in thinking that higher risk equals higher return The line slopes upward to the right meaning the two are positively correlated as risk increases return increases In both the old memo and the book I went to great lengths to clarify what this is often but erroneously taken to mean We hear it all the time Riskier investments produce higher returns and if you want to make more money take more risk Both of these formulations are terrible In brief if riskier investments could be counted on to produce higher returns they wouldnt be riskier And heres the actual graph that portrays a better view of reality when it comes to defining risk with reward Investments that seem riskier have to appear likely to deliver higher returns or else people wont make them The word appear is important because the last vertical line shows you that the higher the risk the larger the range of return possibilities Instead of higher risk leads to higher returns the inverse is that higher risk also can lead to higher losses as the graph above shows The expected return increases as with the traditional graphic In a letter to investors Seth Klarmans wrote about the speculative valuation of Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Their demand has surged they are finding ways to grow further and penetration into new markets are a huge success In Australia the demand has been so strong that ISPs are hurting badly from the heavy usage The industry longterm growth is currently at and while that number includes all sorts of companies bundled together a growth rate of is extreme and puts NFLX on the last bar of the graph Id be lying if I said I dont want that type of gain But right now is that risk worth it Where on the return scale will you be at current prices Toward the middle of the band At the top Below the line One way to get a clear picture is to do a simple valuation and refer to a sensitivity matrix Its a simple matrix version of Howard Marks graph How To Tell The Risk Level of a Company With Numbers Since there is no mathematical formula for risk I use a simple method of checking how much the valuation number changes if I change growth or the discount rate by If the valuation of a stock doesnt change much that company is mostly likely undervalued from a numbers standpoint When there are big differences just by changing the growth rate just a couple of percentages that shows the risk and the range of possibilities are higher The first thing to do is to do a perform a reverse Discounted Cash Flow with the current earnings or net income to show what the market is currently expecting from the stock is not as bad as analysts are expecting but is a safe growth rate The number in the middle is the fair value using the reverse engineered growth rate When the growth rate decreases to the intrinsic value decreases to When the growth rate increases to the intrinsic value increases by to Same thing applies if the discount rate is changed with the growth rate fixed at A discount rate decreases the value to and an discount rate increases the value to In percentage form everything are in increments That means if you are wrong by just a small margin your expected value is wrong by at a minimum Growth is a vital part of investing I just prefer to pay as little as possible for growth In fact heres what Buffett wrote in his letter that sums up this article Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition value and growth Indeed many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual crossdressing We view that as fuzzy thinking in which it must be confessed I myself engaged some years ago In our opinion the two approaches are joined at the hip Growth is always a component in the calculation of value constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive Thats exactly what Howard Marks is talking about If you were playing a game where the odds of winning are but you could win m would you take it Or would you prefer to play a game where the odds of winning are with the prize being But the question is whether you would go for the stock with limited upside that also protects your downside or the high upside high downside stock Ive chased plenty of the stocks on the far right end and felt the merciless punishment as the stock reversed and went the wrong direction for a mile then another mile I prefer to look for stocks in the second or third bell curve where the upside is lower but the downside is much lower as well Source Why <span
