unprofitable subscriber growth It is almost becoming an expected event every quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX releases quarterly earnings amid much speculation about its future and the price soars Were not talking about Netflixs stock price though Netflixs streaming content obligations continue to soar year in and year out Weve previously written about the many issues with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and with each quarterly report our thesis gets stronger The companys Q earnings reveal that our thesis is stronger than ever as costs continue to rise faster than revenues the profit expectations in the stock price are unrealistically high Investors who own this stock are playing a dangerous game with momentum When the music stops on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the stock will likely get crushed We first highlighted Netflixs content cost problem in April As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to increase its streaming content library it must also pay licensing fees to host and distribute this content to its customers However the growth in spending on this content far outpaces the companys revenue growth Versus Netflixs streaming content obligations increased to billion dollars while revenue only increased This trend began in when streaming content costs first accelerated Figure shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is spending more and more to increase its content library but those costs have not been matched by enough of an increase in revenue How long can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>pay for more content without more rapidly increasing its revenue growth Sources New Constructs LLC and company filings It seems that the only number that many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>investors care about is subscriber growth Overall subscriber growth was up in but issues with that stat persist under the surface We mentioned Netflixs slowing subscriber growth in October and that trend continues through Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>added only million subscribers to its US streaming segment down from million the prior year This segments contribution margin declined to down from the prior quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has continued to expand internationally and the company added million members over million the year before However the international segments contribution margin plummeted to from the prior quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has grand plans to expand internationally but as of late those plans have only cost the company more money At its core <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is merely a content delivery platform and one of many From Amazon video services to CBS All Access to HBO Go and Dish Networks new Sling TV there is no shortage of competition in this space and none of them stand out as offering anything that is really unique <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is attempting to separate itself by creating original content only available to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers but it is no longer the only player in that game Competitor Amazon NASDAQ AMZN has established itself as a formidable competitor recently winning two Golden Globes Making matters worse original content creation is expensive and risky which is why most movie studios are owned by larger media conglomerates that can afford to take the big risks that making blockbuster movies often takes It is hard to see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can differentiate itself enough from the competition to charge the higher prices it needs to charge to generate the profits already embedded in its stock price You May Have Missed This Item That Inflated EPS Another item of note that artificially inflated Netflixs results was the release of a million benefit from the companys tax reserves This million which was recorded as quarterly income nearly doubled Netflixs reported net income and allowed the company to beat quarterly and yearly comps Without this unusual and nonrecurring tax reserve Netflixs income before taxes was down from the prior quarter and from the prior year While the aforementioned factors have put the brakes on Netflixs profit growth the company projects profits to decline in Q they are hardly new concerns This makes the momentum run in Netflixs stock even more confusing Investors are simply ignoring some very transparent truths about the company Slowing growth declining margins and skyrocketing costs are not features of company that is generating meaningful shareholder value Valuation is Ridiculous Even Cramer Agrees Using different scenarios below we examine just how much growth in profit margins subscribers and revenue is implied by Netflixs current stock price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>currently maintains a pretax margin around and has million subscribers Sources New Constructs LLC and company filings Next we use our discounted cash flow DCF model to provide transparency into the growth implications of the current stock price Scenario assumes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>prices and margins remain the same The DCF model shows at the current profit margin of the company must grow revenues at compounded annually to justify the current price That performance means the company would reach over billion in revenue in years At per month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would need over billion subscribers to generate billion in revenue The world population is about seven billion Any questions Scenario assumes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can triple its price and double its profit margins We realize that tripling price and doubling margins at the same time is a stretch Nevertheless lets see the impact The DCF model shows after tripling prices and doubling margins the company would have to reach over million subscribers over double their current subscriber base I wouldnt bet on that happening In this scenario it is more likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would lose subscribers not double them at month because Amazon Video is month and includes Prime shipping and Hulu Plus is just Moreover at month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would compete directly with toptier cable and satellite TV companies such as Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA and DirecTV NASDAQ DTV whos TV packages start at month for the first year of service As David Trainer discussed last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is one of if not the most overvalued stock in the market today To justify its current price of share NFLX would need to grow revenue by compounded annually for the next years Essentially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to significantly increase its margins expand its customer base by adding more content and not pay as much for that content Weve seen this movie before After a huge run up in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock dropped early Then again after a large run the stock dropped in October Dont get caught in Netflixs unfounded momentum again Source The Ugly
