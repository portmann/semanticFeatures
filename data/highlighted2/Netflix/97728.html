forward The recent stock performance over the last year should not deter investors from continuing to add on any and all dips For anyone that has followed me here on Seeking Alpha many of my articles tend to pertain to growth stocks like Skyworks NASDAQ SWKS and FireEye NASDAQ FEYE amongst others These growth companies can be a lot more fun for the average investor to own but make it very easy to severely underperform benchmarks due to the volatile nature Two of the stalwarts in my portfolio that have been able to successfully generate alpha in just about any holding period over the last few years are Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Disney NYSE DIS Perhaps one of the easiest ways to become a successful investor is to keep it simple Both of these companies have some of the widest economic moats around the world which has led to consistent top and bottomline growth An economic moat is a competitive advantage that is sustainable over the longterm Companies that are able to maintain this advantage over competitors put themselves in prime position for sustainable longterm earnings growth perhaps the best indicator for generating alpha Disney fits into this category in just about every aspect of its business but it is also the synergies between business segments that truly enable Disney to shine Disneys revenue is broken down into four main segments Media Networks Parks and Resorts Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products Disneys Media Networks division owns and operates ABC ESPN and Disney channels and accounts for just under half of Disneys total revenue When examining the current television landscape one could see the possibility of declining TV viewers in favor of products such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and Hulu for traditional programming The one area that is somewhat immune to this structural change is sports due to its live nature While these events may migrate away from traditional television sets Disney will still be able to maintain its profits with ESPN and ABC holding exclusive content with many professional and collegiate sporting organizations In addition the cash generation of this segment allows these two networks to outbid competitors for future contracts essentially maintaining their stronghold on a majority of sporting events This is the exact definition of an economic moat and will suit this segment well going forward The Studio Entertainment division which makes up over of revenues is just what it sounds like a movie producer With the acquisitions of Pixar Marvel and Lucas Disney has positioned itself well within the industry for future blockbuster hits All of these studious have had wild success with multiple story lines While blockbusters like Avengers and Star Wars are most likely priced into the stock already one should not overlook the ability to further explore these characters It has been proven over time that blockbuster sequels also tend to perform extremely well in the box office and there is no reason to think Disneys writers will be unable to continue generating hits with the expansive story lines and characters already created not to mention any new beginnings Again this is the literal definition of an economic moat The Parks and Recreation division has had close synergies with the Studio Entertainment division recently As movie characters become beloved and ingrained within childrens minds Disney has presented the opportunity to bring imagination to reality with its theme parks As the movies continue to succeed the Parks and Rec can capitalize on that growth Continued low gas prices throughout the summer will also have a strong impact on the bottomline as families see the cost of a Disney vacation decreased due to lower travel expenses by car or plane This has enabled Disney to raise prices at some of its parks such as Magic Kingdom The expansion of theme parks abroad in places like Europe and the Pacific region will also continue spreading the Disney brand while increasing profits While maybe not the largest Disney possesses an extremely wide economic moat evident in each of its divisions sustainable profitability and even its brand equity valued at over B There is no reason to think Disney will be unsuccessful in growing both its top and bottomline over the longterm The diversification across the media industry from live sports to movie production and its ability to turn imagination into reality through theme parks and consumer products all lead to the chart below Disney has been able to grow its Return on Equity one of the most important ratios to shareholders considerably over the past ten years which generates alpha on behalf of the investor I am a firm believer that the management team of a company is one of the best indicators of stock price performance In this regard Disney receives all As on their report card Bob Iger and his management team might be the best Fortune executives in terms of creating shareholder value Two facts this prove this point is the consecutive and increase in annual dividends for and respectively and the aggressive share buyback plan Capital is being returned to shareholders in an extremely efficient manner evident in the chart below which shows a large decrease in shares outstanding and todays dividend hike However it is not just capital returns which the management team should be praised for Disneys organic growth over the past few years has been impressive and well above Wall Street expectations specifically the Parks and Rec division as they increase earnings from sameparks YoY and expand internationally opening new parks in highdemand areas These capital gains blended with a dividend that is bound to increase from the current yield over the course of the next few years will only put further upward pressure on the stock price It is almost as if Bob Iger and the rest of the executive team wake up each and every day with the purpose of making their shareholders happy which is more rare than one might think with companies this large As I mentioned above Return of Equity is one of my favorite indicators for evaluating a company since it measures how much a shareholders pays for in net income Since a company is only worth the amount of cash flows they can produce another good indicator for this is FCF yield which divides FCFShareholder Equity DIS Free Cash Flow Yield TTM data by YCharts The FCF yield chart is slightly skewed though due to repurchasing of common stock and dividend payments greatly decreasing Disneys net cash flows as these cash outflows have been ramped up recently By examining operating cash flows only they have been able to grow at a rapid rate for a company of their size This measure sheds light on Disneys operating efficiencies synergies between business segments which tend to grow off each other and scalability Examining OCF Yield Operating Cash Flows divided by Shareholder Equity sheds light on Disneys superior business practices with a ratio above almost all peers for respective business segments This breakdown compares the Media Networks division specifically to companies like CBS and NBC Studio Entertainment to other movie producers etc This OCF yield proves Disney is not in the same category with the likes of IBM who solely focused on capital returns to shareholders and not operating performance DIS Cash from Operations Annual data by YCharts While Disney can seem overvalued on the traditional PE metric where it trades at a premium to the SP there are clear signs of why this premium is warranted In addition their EVEBITDA which measures operating earnings rather than net income is much more in line with peers While Disney appears fairly valued on these metrics the growth has outgained peers the brand equity is unmatched within its industry and the downside risk is fairly minimal Unless there are multiple flops within the Studio Entertainment division with releases like Star Wars or a recession that decreases the ability to attend movie theaters and Disney parks the revenue streams just seem too durable to reverse course Due to the aggressive stock buyback plan and dividend payments it seems that it would be hard for any news to lead to downside Disneys management team has consistently generated shareholder value through MA activity capital returns and organic growth The company possesses one of the widest economic moats across the globe and all these factors will lead to Disneys continued growth I recommend to buy Disney on all dips as the company is comprised of durable revenue streams and operating efficiencies that will not waver anytime soon This is one of the few companies that the investor can continue adding to his position
