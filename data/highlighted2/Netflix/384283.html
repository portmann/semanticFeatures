#A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is close to reaching its saturation point in the United States if it hasnt already Global markets offer opportunities for growth but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to cater to local tastes which will raise productionacquisition costs Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX destined to take over the world If you happened to have read this entertaining and insightful post by fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Greg Wajda you may have been led to believe that yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be the next global giant on par with Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or Apple NASDAQ AAPL Lets take a moment however to consider the opposing view that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is already overvalued its future is not only uncertain but also perhaps even dim This certainly isnt a shot at Greg and if you havent read his post yet you absolutely should But before you sink your cash into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>you should consider the following points The importance of this view and possibility is underscored by the recent slide suffered by the company after it reported weak subscriber growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>added M net subscribers in the US and M in global markets solid numbers that topped the companys guidance but failed to meet investor outlooks Share prices declined as a result Of course that decline could be temporary and the stock could be a great buy Or slowing growth could hint at the new reality The argument that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is overvalued has already been outlined by numerous analysts and investors I wont focus too much on the companys current position and the allegations it is currently overvalued but I would like to touch on a few key points First off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a trailing PE ratio TTM intraday of approximately and a forward PE ratio of about FYE Dec These numbers are extremely high suggesting that at the very least <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a highly speculative stock A lot of people are expecting great things out of the company and theyre betting quite heavily on it Meanwhile the current profit margin is low at and revenues are also rather low for a company valued at about billion coming in at only billion Quarterly revenue growth however is exceptionally strong at which helps explain why the PE ratio is so high Many investors likely believe that NFLX will continue to post excellent quarterly revenue growth and are probably betting that the company can expand profit margins in the future At the same time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>isnt carrying too much debt with billion on its books vs billion in cash Still the company is closing in on its saturation point in the United States with survey results showing that over of the population are using their streaming service International markets offer the potential for growth but outside of the US the global economy is tepid at best Further new regions mean new content While Hollywood blockbusters enjoy international success outside of these major movies most countries and regions have their own content to enjoy Theres a reason Bollywood is considered the largest movie market in the world producing well north of movies per year and in sold billion tickets roughly twice as many tickets as Hollywood Each region has its own tastes and as well as local content producers and for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to reach high penetration rates it will likely have to meet local demands which will raise content acquisition andor product costs Meanwhile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has been in the process of raising subscription rates which could turn off subscribers at home and abroad What really has me worried however are not the current numbers but instead the environment that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is operating in Licensing fees have been steadily rising due to increased competition and the fact that the company itself could be a threat to many content producers such as Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has already been forced to drop agreements with several major content producers such as Epix Over the past few years the company has seen its selection of content drop from over movies and TV shows to just over As selection declines theres good reason to believe that some subscribers may simply decide that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>isnt worth the subscription price anymore Its possible that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be able to head off discontent by ramping up its own content which so far appears to be the chosen course for the company Still this may raise prices as highquality programming is expensive to produce Producing content isnt cheap and its notoriously hitormiss Theres a reason why were seeing more rehashed content from Hollywood for example More super hero flicks more reboots more movies that rely on star power rather than innovative stories and scripts These are safer bets as producers know that they can rely on already established fan bases Point being producing content is a highriskhighreward environment So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a pretty good track record in regards to producing its own content Orange is the New Black BoJack Horseman House of Cards and Narcos are just some of the very popular and critically acclaimed shows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has produced or at least acquired exclusive rights to Its questionable however that the company can continue to hit home run after home run in regards to the content it actually produces Original series Hemlock Grove lasted for only three seasons and got tepid reviews Marco Polo got lambasted by critics though appears to have secured a decent following of fans Competition in streaming space heating up At the same time other streaming services are stepping up their own efforts to produce highquality content and large portfolios of programs to watch For the sake of brevity Im only going to glance at the competition but theres a lot to be concerned about For streaming services the barrier to entry will be relatively low especially if big companies decide to enter the space <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>owns no proprietary technologies that can keep competitors out and doesnt even own its own data centers relying instead on Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Going to the cloud was probably a smart move allowing the company to cut costs but suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is more about brand rather than any key technology The power of brands however can be fickle Speaking of Amazon the global behemoth is rapidly expanding its own offerings aggressively buying licensing rights and producing its own hit content such as The Man in the High Castle Amazon has already proven to be a tough competitor having taken Barnes Noble NYSE BKS to the brink and having pushed other book companies into bankruptcy Amazon has also emerged as a threat to WalMart NYSE WMT and other brickandmortar retailers On top of that theres HBO NYSE TWX which has been lauded for its own premium selfproduced content and has so far leveraged parent company Time Warner to gain access to a huge repertoire of quality movies that can be streamed Of course we cant forget Hulu which has been aggressively buying up licensing rights and producing its own content HBO has about million subscribers in the US and million subscribers abroad Meanwhile Comcast is increasingly getting involved directly in the streaming business while also placing datacaps on customers in some areas which could put a crimp on streaming all together Disney NYSE DIS also has its own streaming services and any content producer not in the streaming business may soon jump in Technology wise theres not much stopping them Of course we cant forget about Hulu partially owned by Comcast Point is the streaming market is already a competitive place and it appears to be growing more competitive by the day And thats not even considering piracy and other threats Conclusion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a speculative bet at best Investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>isnt necessarily a bad idea despite what was written above More or less the companys success will likely be tied to its ability to produce original content that is compelling enough to get people to pay subscription fees The licensed content market is drying up and the company will face further headwinds in this area in the future If youre going to invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>however dont bet the house and dont sink your retirement portfolio into it even if youre young <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is highly speculative The company has upside but also a lot of downside If I were going to invest Im not Id limit my exposure strictly to risk capital Personally Ill be looking for stocks that offer a better value with similar upside and risks Disclosure Iwe have
