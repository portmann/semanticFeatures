out the ETF Hub ETF Hub <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>added million new subs in its last quarter million in the quarter before that This proves that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still priced at any extraordinarily low price Its such high demand and the opportunity to raise monthly prices longterm that make Netflixs seemingly expensive stock look quite attractive For all of the great things were seeing at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX such as revenue growth and margin improvements the most important metric is the rate at which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is gaining new subscribers The company now has million monthly subscribers adding million total subscribers US and international during this most recent quarter and million in the quarter before that This incredible level of subscriber growth and retention proves one thing and that thing leads to the reason why shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are still a longterm hold even at new alltime highs of afterhours What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>proved is that even after large monthly price hikes over the last couple years its streaming services are still priced at a point that consumers flock to In essence Netflixs services are just too economical now that it has invested billions of dollars in content with vast viewing options and original content Since Netflixs streaming services have increased from roughly a month DVDstreaming was to per month Thats a sizable increase one that many consumers have complained about in dramatic fashion over the years Yet despite this increase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>remains the cheapest content king on the block although it is also one of the largest Both HBO Now and Dishs NASDAQ DISH Sling streaming competitors to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are priced at a month PlayStation is taking the premium route charging almost a month for services While significantly higher than Netflixs prices these prices are nothing compared to the that DirecTV NASDAQ DTV earned per subscriber during its last quarter which might I add was a near increase yearoveryear The point being is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still has a lot of room in front of it to increase prices in the years ahead per month is still very cheap Given Netflixs large collection of content its dominant user base and its awardwinning critically acclaimed original series theres no reason that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shouldnt charge more and wont if anything Dish HBO and Sony NYSE SNE just set the bar higher for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>making it more acceptable for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to increase prices to to a month with little backlash Therefore with Netflixs now billion valuation it might look pricey at x next years earnings but the opportunity to increase prices anywhere from to longterm creates a golden opportunity for further margin expansion and explosive revenue growth for many years to come That said many will object to this theory Many will say that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>were to charge per month that they would no longer use the service However many of those same people pay to a month for payTV bringing little logic to this theory In fact the only theory thats supported with actual proof is that media companies always increase prices as the cost of content rises and their content assortment grows DirecTV and Dish are perfect examples as their revenue per user rises annually to reflect increased costs for content Hence if these companies can do it then so can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as it continues to invest in content of its own All things considered I am in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for the long haul Sure it looks expensive today but when you start thinking about the opportunity to increase monthly prices and the potential for new revenue channels like video on demand for big budget films I believe the future is bright for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>If anything Netflixs last quarter helped to confirm my belief as its continued subscriber growth is proof that consumers still see the service as a great value play and will continue to do so even with future price hikes Source What Netflixs Earnings Really Prove Disclosure The author is long NFLX MoreThe author wrote this article themselves and
