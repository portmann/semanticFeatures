class='textDiv'>Illustrating My Fair Value On The Walt Disney Company The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha Jun AM ET About The Walt Disney Company DIS Includes FOX NFLX VZ by Alexander J Poulos Disney share price continues to zoom higher The good fortune is a reflection of the stellar moves by the management team I expect Disney will continue to monetize the Marvel and Star Wars franchises over the course of the rest of the decade The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS immediately conjures up thoughts of friendly family entertainment Some of the more memorable characters include Mickey Mouse Snow White Donald Duck and the always lovable Goofy DIS ability to evolve and generate new characters has allowed them to withstand the test of time and morph into one of the largest media plays in the world The article below will discuss my fair value for the esteemed company along with some risks inherent in my thesis The names Captain America Thor Hulk and Iron Man immediately equate to the legendary Marvel Comics Marvel continues to generate a plethora of rich characters with welldeveloped plot lines well suited for movie making material DIS in a major coup acquired the rights to Marvel and the vast majority of their characters Marvel continues to feed DIS an extensive amount of material to create content content ranging from major motion pictures to spinoffs tailor made for broadcast television Agent Carter Agents of SHIELD shown on the ABC network The abundance of rich characters provides DIS with a new line of products to sell in their Company stores as adoring fans clamor for merchandise of their favorite superherovillain The results at the box office thus far clearly vindicate managements decision to purchase Marvel The first Avengers movie generated over billion worldwide with the recently released sequel tabulating an equally impressive billion thus far The Avengers property can neatly be summarized as a tent pole franchise with further sequels widely expected Sequels are preferred by studio houses as they tend to have a builtin audience and engender less risk than newer unproven material A recent example is Tommorwland which has yet to earn back its budget DIS struck gold last year with Guardians of the Galaxy grossing over million worldwide DIS expects to release a sequel in as the movie remains wildly popular with fans The popularity of Guardians of the Galaxy is an example of a franchise with low initial expectations that has handily outperformed expectations Star Wars The Force Awakens Lucasfilm Dec Zootopia Walt Disney Animation Studios March Captain America Civil War Marvel May Finding Dory Pixar June Not to be outdone DIS scooped up Lucas Films acquiring the rights to the Star Wars franchise I believe the latest installment Star Wars The Force Awakens will be the highest grossing movie of the year In a similar vein to the Marvel acquisition DIS will have a plethora of widely adored characters to monetize over the course of the rest of the decade Star Wars fans tend to be more loyal than comic book fans an area I expect DIS to capitalize on The real beauty of the transactions mentioned above is the tying together of previous generations to the current youth I vividly remember playing with Star Wars figures and going to the theater when the Empire Strikes Back came out I naturally know the characters and instinctively want to accompany my children to see the latest installment of this franchise The ability to bring joy to a childs face is a timetested method to work your way into the parents pocketbook With the parents intuitively understanding the characters they are more willing to part with funds as opposed to set of characters they are unfamiliar with With the above backdrop in mind an investor would naturally conclude DIS remains poised for years of future growth The interesting thing here is the Filmed Entertainment division only makes up of DIS revenue stream in I will continue my overview of DIS with a discussion on the media properties ESPN ABC etc which collectively contribute of DIS revenue DIS remains well positioned here via their ownership of the ABC network and ESPN Sports content remains the only area of televised entertainment where live viewership is essential A football enthusiast will simply not settle for time shifting their viewership of that weeks contest Thus live sports remain impervious to being TIVOd cementing their importance to advertisers The rise of timeshifting has negatively impacted ad rates as advertisers rightfully fret over the effectiveness of their ad campaigns The name of the game for advertisers is ratings live sports broadcasts continue to generate high numbers thus cementing their worth in the eyes of advertisers ESPN has shrewdly locked up the rights to broadcast Monday Night Football and Major League Baseball games thru along with a recently announced nineyear deal with the NBA The challenge here for DIS is the looming threat of cord cutting or skinny bundles The cord cutting phenomena is real and gaining momentum as the younger generation opts to use an internet based provider such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX to stream content The skinny bundle phenomena in my opinion are the greatest overall threat as customers begin to rebel over the increasing cost of their cable bill In my view we do not need a package consisting of over channels DIS has significant exposure here as the sports network makes up the largest portion of a customers monthly bill If providers allow customers to opt out of the sports package the cost born by the fans will become quite prohibitive placing a crimp on revenue growth at ESPN DIS along with TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOX has filed suit against Verizon NYSE VZ over the introduction of a skinny bundle package Over the long run I suspect it will be a losing battle as the ability to save money will win out over a plethora of sparsely viewed channels The theme park division is the second largest division of DIS contributing over of the parent companies revenue The unit will undergo a significant expansion with the expected completion of the Shanghai Disney Resort I expect the resort will be welcomed with open arms and will perform quite well The resort business remains an economically sensitive area that tends to outperform when the economy is healthy Worldwide economic growth continues albeit at a tepid pace that should augur well for continued sales growth in the division I have constructed a discounted cash flow model in an attempt to gauge DIS fair value I am modeling high singledigit revenue growth over the next two years due to massive hits in the filmed division and a growing economy which will allow many to take a vacation A vacation to one of DIS numerous resorts remains one of the top destination for families a position that should endure for many years I have modeled for a higher sales bump next year as DIS fiscal year ends in September and will not take into account the coming Star Wars movie I have modeled for a slowdown in revenue growth in the later part of the decade due to the threat of skinny bundles and the possibility of superhero fatigue The recent Avengers movie grossed less than the original perhaps we are beginning to see audiences tire from the genre I have not modeled for a recession I find it nearly impossible to model so far in advance with any accuracy I doubt we will see a recession over the next twelve months after that it is anyones guess My model pegs DIS fair value at indicating the shares are roughly undervalued I tend to favor investing in companies that are undervalued based on my DCF Using the lower end of my criteria which is fair for a stable entity such as DIS would indicate a buyin of or less The shares would need to pull back a good bit before I would open a position DIS is a unique company pertaining to its dividend policy DIS payout is on an annual basis versus the more traditional quarterly basis used by most US based companies For those who rely on quarterly dividend payments to pay bills they will view the policy as a negative The basis for DIS decision is centered on the shareholder composition for many DIS is the first company owned by children Many have accounts with less than ten shares making the payment of a quarterly dividend a burden on the enterprise DIS in response to the worldwide economic meltdown in froze the dividend in place until An investor needs to keep in mind DIS second largest division is the parks and resort area that is economically sensitive The move to freeze the dividend in my view was justified as long as when the business rebounds investors will be rewarded for their patience DIS did exactly this first by paying a cent dividend in then making two dividend payments in for a total of per share The double payment in was in response to tax law changes enacted by Congress DIS accelerated payment to the fourth quarter of thus ensuring favorable tax treatment The dividend was again hiked in to cents and once again in to its current level of per share The CAGR of the dividend is a stunning indeed an acceptable growth rate DIS current dividend yield is a tad over which is not appealing An investor in DIS should view the dividend as a direct reflection of the growth of the companies underlying cash flow I suspect the dividend rate will grow at a low doubledigit rate for the rest of the decade The key to the DIS story is the continued health and growth of the worldwide economy As long as we do not lurch back into a recession and DIS continues to deliver memorable hits such as Frozen and the various superheroes the company is well positioned for growth I view the shares of DIS as an excellent play on the continued growth of the worldwide entertainment market The stock price currently reflects quite a bit of the good fortunes I see ahead for the company For that reason I believe it is wise to wait for a better opening before committing funds A pullback below would make me an enthusiastic buyer of the shares I
