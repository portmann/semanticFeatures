corporate betrothal the better part of a year ago The planned merger between the two companies has comparatively speaking flown under the radar as so much time and attention fell to the nowcollapsed ComcastTWC plans But now that the million ton elephant has left the merger room all eyes are swiveling back to the other looming giant Way back in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>said to the FCC PDF that there were threats and potential harms in the ATTDirecTV merger and asked for significant conditions to mitigate them to be placed on any approval However as the likelihood of a decision one way or another looms nearer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has changed its tune In a new filing PDF <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>urges the FCC to block the merger as currently proposed If the timing of the change in tone right after the demise of the Comcast merger seems a little too suspicious to be completely coincidental thats because its not The specter of the notgonnahappen cable merger appears more than once The filing lays out the big red video companys arguments for why the merger should be blocked in its current form Basically says <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the merged company would have both the ability and incentive to harm online video distributors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Since ComcastTWC is out of the picture <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>says a postmerger ATTDirecTV would be the nations biggest MVPD cable satellite or fiber payTV company And to an MVPD <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is pure competition Add that to the fact that postmerger ATT also plans hugely to expand their broadband coverage and it becomes a potential recipe for disaster ATT already has demonstrated ability to harm OVDs by leveraging its control over interconnection to degrade its own customers access to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>points out And indeed ATT Uverse customers were getting absolutely horrible <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>speeds until a dramatic sudden leap in quality after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>paid ATT an interconnection fee last year ATT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also adds is pretty fond of data caps on home broadband service And while net neutrality might prevent them actually throttling competition promotions like zerorating could still allow ATTDirecTV to give their own streaming services an edge and push competitors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>concludes that although ATT and DirecTV say they would not have the incentive to cause such harms they totally actually would If ATT is able to slow the development of the OVD industry either by foreclosing access to broadband customers or imposing discriminatory data caps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>says ATT would be able to preserve its market advantage by slowing or even reversing the shift toward competitive online video offering and away from bundled videobroadband offerings And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>adds switching ISPs is a pain in the butt even for those few who can actually do it so consumers might not have the recourse of simply taking their business elsewhere As for whether the FCC will agree with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>that still remains very much in the air The informal day shot clock at the agency has been paused since March as the commission tries to wrangle its way through the legal ins and outs of a big pile of confidential industry data and the companies that dont want to share it While Netflixs FCC filing clearly states that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>urges the Commission to reject the merger as currently proposed the company is not being as resolute in the comments it makes to the media In a statement to Ars Technica <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>only adds confusion to its stance on the ATTDirecTV deal claiming that it is not opposing the merger Weve been highlighting concerns about ATTs broadband practices and the need for appropriate remedies since last September Click to print Opens in new window
