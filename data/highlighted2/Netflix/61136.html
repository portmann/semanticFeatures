in the guts as he is already agonizing on the floor but nobody wants to do it to poor old Uncle Sam do they The World Platinum Council do not believe that platinum stocks will be completely depleted and reach zero because the amount includes long term holdings by private investors sovereign wealth funds Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Here is the only part that matters in the latest massive word letter Carl Icahn just sent to AAPL CEO Tim Cook in which he advocates an AAPL stock price of share or over trillion or of US GDP We are pleased that Apple has directionally followed our advice and repurchased billion of its shares yielding the companys shareholders an excellent return but the companys enormous net cash position continues to grow while the companys shares are still dramatically undervalued With Apples shares trading for just per share versus our valuation of per share now is the time for a much larger buyback We appreciate that the Board just increased the share repurchase authorization by billion and that it continues to prioritize share repurchases over dividends as it should We again simply ask you to help us convince the board of how these two underlying issues inefficient net cash growth and share undervaluation persist and combine to enhance the opportunity for accelerated share repurchases in greater magnitude We also ask you to help us convince the board that this is not a choice between investing in growth and share repurchases As our model forecasts despite more than growth in RD annually through FY to billion up from billion in FY and your updated capital return program Apples net cash position currently the largest of any company in history will continue to build on the balance sheet Share Repurchases we assume share repurchases of billion billion and billion over the next three year for our forecast and not the more aggressive pace we hope the Board will undertake Uncle Carl and his two analysts remain convinced they know how to run AAPL better than its CEO and his thousands of employees Uncle Carl and his two analysts have built up a massive stake in AAPL shares which however they cant get out of in this illiquid market without tipping the market they are selling a tip which would promptly send the stock plunging and as a result have come to the only buyer who is big enough to buy all of Icahns shares without causing a massive ripple the company itself And here is just the cash AAPL holds domestically and which can be used for buybacks and dividends without being forced to repatriate and pay taxes on its offshore cash For now however Icahns opinion is all that matters and the value of AAPL stocks has risen by billion just on one tweet We again applaud you and the rest of management for Apples impressive operational performance and growth It is truly impressive that despite severe foreign exchange headwinds and massive growth in investment in both RD and SGA the company will still grow earnings by this year according to our forecast After reflecting upon Apples tremendous success we now believe Apple shares are worth today Apple is poised to enter and in our view dominate two new categories the television next year and the automobile by with a combined addressable market of trillion a view investors dont appear to factor into their valuation at all We believe this may lead to a de facto short squeeze as underweight actively managed mutual funds and hedge funds correct their misguided positions To arrive at the value of per share we forecast FY EPS of excluding net interest income apply a PE multiple of x and then add of net cash per share Considering our forecast for EPS growth in FY and our belief Apple will soon enter two new markets Television and the Automobile with a combined addressable market size of trillion we think a multiple of x is a very conservative premium to that of the overall market Considering the massive scope of its growth opportunities and track record of dominating new categories we actually think x will ultimately prove to be too conservative especially since we view the market in general as having much lower growth prospects We are pleased that Apple has directionally followed our advice and repurchased billion of its shares yielding the companys shareholders an excellent return but the companys enormous net cash position continues to grow while the companys shares are still dramatically undervalued With Apples shares trading for just per share versus our valuation of per share now is the time for a much larger buyback We appreciate that the Board just increased the share repurchase authorization by billion and that it continues to prioritize share repurchases over dividends as it should We again simply ask you to help us convince the board of how these two underlying issues inefficient net cash growth and share undervaluation persist and combine to enhance the opportunity for accelerated share repurchases in greater magnitude We also ask you to help us convince the board that this is not a choice between investing in growth and share repurchases As our model forecasts despite more than growth in RD annually through FY to billion up from billion in FY and your updated capital return program Apples net cash position currently the largest of any company in history will continue to build on the balance sheet It is our belief that large institutional investors Wall Street analysts and the news media alike continue to misunderstand Apple and generally fail to value Apples net cash separately from its business fail to adjust earnings to reflect Apples real cash tax rate fail to recognize the growth prospects of Apple entering new categories and fail to recognize that Apple will maintain pricing and margins despite significant evidence to the contrary Collectively these failures have caused Apples earnings multiple to stay irrationally discounted in our view When we compare Apples PE ratio to that of the SP index we find that the market continues to value Apple at a significantly discounted multiple of only x compared to x for the SP awarding the SP with a premium valuation to Apple Importantly as we have noted previously we assume a tax rate for the purpose of forecasting Apples real cash earnings not the effective tax rate used by Apple and view this as a necessary adjustment often overlooked by both analysts and investors For more detail on our methodology for this adjustment please review our letter titled Carl Icahn Issues Letter to Twitter Followers Regarding Apple published February th which you can find here httpwwwshareholderssquaretablecomlettertotwitterfollowersregardingapple By applying this adjustment to the current consensus FY EPS of among the analysts who have updated their EPS targets since April nd the adjusted result is Notably while previously criticized by some of these analysts as being too aggressive this consensus EPS forecast which includes interest income is now largely in line with our own forecast of which does not include interest income And once again we exclude interest income from our EPS forecast because we value Apples enormous net cash balance separately from the enterprise unlike most analysts While our forecast for FY EPS is significantly above Wall Street consensus today in October so was our original forecast for FY EPS which is now in line with the Wall Street consensus We are optimistic that ecosystem improvements Apple Watch Apple Pay Homekit and Healthkit in particular will drive modest growth in iPhone revenues next year despite the difficult comparison that will result from iPhones tremendous performance this year With a new iPhone expected in September Apple stands to benefit as iPhone continues to take premium market share switchers from competitors as the middle class continues to grow in emerging markets and as the modest level of upgrades only to date indicates pulling demand forward from FY to FY may not be as severe as some have highlighted Along with a more dramatic push into the TV market increasing traction with Apple Watch and the introduction of a larger screen iPad we have confidence in our forecast for FY We believe Apple Watch Apple Pay Homekit Healthkit Beats Music and further innovation in existing product lines collectively represent a tremendous opportunity that on their own justify a valuation that at the very least reflects a market multiple That being said we share your excitement that our best days are ahead of us and that Apple has no shortage of growth opportunities to pursue The companys dramatic increase in RD spending should signal to investors that Apple plans to aggressively pursue these growth opportunities It may be difficult for some to fathom only because Apple is already the largest company in the world but Apple is very much a long term growth story from our perspective which is exactly why we believe the companys shares should trade at a premium multiple to the SP as opposed to the SP trading at a premium to Apple While we respect and admire Apples predilection for secrecy the companys aggressive increases in RD spending and some of the more wellsupported rumors have bolstered our confidence that Apple will enter two new product categories television and cars Combined these two new markets represent trillion three times the size of Apples existing markets if we exclude Apple Watch Excluding advertising the addressable market for television is approximately billion which is larger than the smartphone market Also given that people spend an average of of the day watching TV equating to of their free time we view televisions role in the living room as a strategically compelling bolton to the Apple ecosystem In addition to an Ultra High Definition television set we expect Apple to launch a related suite of tiered products and services including a skinny bundle of paytv channels partnered with various media companies and an updated Apple TV microconsole which will continue to service the massive install base of televisions offered by other OEMs This will enable Apple to pursue the entire market by offering multiple products at various price points across the demographic spectrum <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offers a similar tiered approach to pricing today by charging a higher price for those seeking the ability to receive ultra high definition content We believe this move into TV will also benefit all the other devices and services in the Apple ecosystem As just one of many possible examples of this the Apple Watch could perhaps be used as a remote control Similarly as we expect Apple to launch a larger iPad it would offer an enhanced viewing experience for an Apple pay tv service or act an improved second screen to an Apple UltraHD television At trillion the enormous addressable market for new cars is approximately four times the size of the smartphone market Its estimated that people spend an average of hour every day traveling mostly in cars but not everyone drives implying that the average time that daily commuters spend in a car is much higherWe believe the rumors that Apple will introduce an Applebranded car by and we believe it is no coincidence that many believe visibility on autonomous driving will gain material traction by then As autonomous driving would release drivers attention from the activity of driving and navigating and perhaps even increase the time people actually want to spend inside a car both an automobile and the services provided therein become even more strategically compelling While Apple currently addresses this market with CarPlay it seems logical that Apple would view the car itself as a the ultimate mobile device to which it could bring its peerless track record of marrying superior industrial design with software and services along with its globally admired brand and offer consumers an overall automobile experience that not only changes the world but also adds a robust vertical to the Apple ecosystem And for Apple the car market is more than big enough to move the needle significantly even as the worlds largest company The rising cost of oil its impact on global warming the geopolitical risks associated with oil dependency especially as fuel for automobiles followed more recently by the rise of cost effective alternatives presents a change the world opportunity for Apple It is widely believed that the electric battery will play a key role in this transition The lithiumion battery already represents a critical component across many of Apples existing products iPhone iPad Apple Watch MacBook Beats and any further innovation could be a game changer in terms of both battery life and form factor across Apples entire ecosystem Since lithiumion batteries represent a large percentage of the cost of todays electric vehicle we believe Apple should be well positioned to leverage its existing knowledge domain and more robust RD spending in this area and in turn apply any energy density battery life improvements for a car across all the other products in its ecosystem that will share the benefit from such battery innovation iPhone iPad Apple Watch MacBook Beats As a mobile device that is differentiated by design brand and consumer experience where software and services are increasingly critical an Apple car would seem to be uniquely positioned While the television and the car offer tremendous growth opportunities Apples core ecosystem continues to improve and grow now sometimes referred to as a megaecosystem a term we find increasingly appropriate as we look at the breadth of its components which now include existing products iPhone Apple Watch Mac iPad Beats Apple TV softwareservices Apple Pay Homekit Healthkit Carplay iCloud iTunes and rumored Beats Music pay TV service as well as possible new products in new categories a Car a TV set Furthermore ongoing innovations and enhancements to all of the above will drive even more premium market share gains for iPhone which sits at the epicenter of this megaecosystem Apple has clearly demonstrated a track record of excellence and success when entering new categories We expect this to continue with the Apple Watch the television and the car and the world will look back on todays undervaluation as a fascinating example of market inefficiency and likewise on our valuation at x earnings per share as conservative Because of this we encourage both accelerated and largermagnitude share repurchases as you consider how to allocate capital going forward As you continue to evaluate this opportunity and consider the right prices at which to opportunistically repurchase shares we hope you give credence to our advice in light of our investment record Unlike the many actively managed mutual funds and hedge funds that are underweight Apple and have underperformed the SP we have exhibited strong outperformance thanks in part to our large position in Apple The Sargon Portfolio a designated portfolio of assets comanaged by Brett Icahn and David Schechter within the private investment funds comprising Icahn Enterprises Investment segment and High River Limited Partnership subject to the supervision and control of Carl Icahn has generated annualized gross returns of since its formation on April through April with billion of assets under management as of April If you choose not to pursue some of the new categories we highlighted or you find our growth forecasts too aggressive for any one new category in particular well be the first to admit that you are more knowledgeable in these areas than we are But we believe that under any circumstances you would agree that in the aggregate all these new categories taken together along with those of which we may be unaware represent one of the greatest growth stories in corporate history as well as one of the greatest opportunities ever for a company to invest in itself by repurchasing its shares
