style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>holders may wish to finally take some profit Increasing competition from companies like Apple Amazon Hulu HBO ABC and CBS mean a rapidly changing landscape <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is definitely the leader in streaming home content but questions have been raised about the companys ability to stay on top NFLX had the benefit of being the first company to explore alternative means of getting content to consumers starting with mailing DVDs When the progression naturally moved to streaming media NFLX was first to the party and has benefited greatly for doing so The companys dominance has led to a rapid appreciation in the stock price which has led to a split Since the split performance has been good but murky of late as the stock is well off its highs and research firm Citron recently stated they expect a correction in the stock back down toward the level Fueling NFLXs fire has been its subscriber growth which has accelerated in recent quarters Bears continue to avoid looking at subscriber growth and point out the company isnt cash flow positive and is far overvalued on an earnings basis In addition the competitive landscape is getting much much worse for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>As the company is getting ready to launch in Japan its competition is increasing substantially Hulu recently just announced an adfree service for per month and individual networks are starting to stream their content like HBO is doing with HBO Go In addition news like CBS just released yesterday that they will be streaming all major NFL games this year online for free means that the landscape is changing very quickly for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and not for the better Apple NASDAQ AAPL is also starting to get into the game Reports have said that Apple is in talks with some major names in the entertainment industry which could put it in direct competition with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Many have assumed Apple may buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but if its strategy with streaming audio is any indication theyre not interested in buying companies that are leading their sector at high valuations Companies like ABC are also moving into the same space If you need even further proof that the streaming media field continues to expand look no further than this mornings news from Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Heres the news that Seeking Alpha reported last week on Amazon In addition this writeup detailing the threat of YouTube points out another competitor in the streaming world thats going to continue to haunt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>If Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL continues to develop YouTube into a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>style streaming service in addition to the free content that it generates YouTube could be added to the long list of competitors that may stand in Netflixs way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>aims to be more like HBO a service with almost double the number of subscribers that makes its money on its original content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is going to have to create a hybrid viewing experience luring some people in with old unfamiliar content while then hopefully exposing them to original content that will hook them on the service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does have another wrench in can turn in its pricing as well Its not like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has run out of offensive weapons either The company is still pushing its boundaries growing and expanding to try and maintain its growth an create new revenue segments Over the weekend it broke that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was also preparing for its first theatrical film release Supposedly the release has garnered good reviews across the pond and itll be available for streaming on October th What one must consider when evaluating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for an investment is the premium the stock is priced at today compared to what the competitive landscape is going to look like in several years This increased competition is going to be a major factor when considering an investment in a company thats so highly valued as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The companys billion market cap x pricesales and x pricebook ratio show how puffy the valuation has gotten postsplit In addition the companys FCF picture is getting ugly The company isnt earning much and on an earnings basis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is trading about x its earnings next year With the company continuing to burn cash million in the ttm period we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is going to be due for a cooling off period as the market environment continues to deteriorate heading into the Feds consideration of raising rates We think today is a great time for those who have been all aboard the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>train for the longterm to take some profit Disclosure Iwe have no positions in
