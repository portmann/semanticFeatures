Netflixs advancement into the world of film took another step last week with the acquisition of action film Bright <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>won a bidding war for the project which adds a glorified blockbuster to its ranks of original projects Bright star Will Smith may not be the same draw he once was but his name still garners attention and is a big get for the streamer If you want to go see the latest Will Smith film this year youll need to go the theaters No Im not talking about the Screening Room controversy that is currently dividing Hollywood Im talking about Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX latest move Last Friday it was reported by top industry site Deadline that the streaming giant has managed to top itself again with its latest acquisition Bright Starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer the film found itself in the middle of a bidding war among studios and in the end <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>won out As has been the case all along in order to get the rights <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had to bid much much higher than its rivals Here it was nearly double and million later <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had its prize The film is important to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for a number of reasons not the least of which is that it could turn into a franchise For investors though it important because it represents the next phase of the companys business model blockbuster feature films Having already conquered the small screen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decided its first entrant into film would be in the awards race in order to first gain credibility Following the wellreceived Beasts of No Nations and the acquisition of War Machine which is expected to be its entry in next years race the streamer is now looking more commercially successful Netflixs deal with Adam Sandler for four films was the first step in this process and now its thinking bigger Of course this will lead to the inevitable questionis Will Smith still as profitable as the high premium <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is seemingly putting on him and his drawing power Those asking the questions arent necessarily wrong to pose that inquiry Remember the last time Will Smith had a summer tent pole release it didnt go well The action drama After Earth was mercilessly beaten on by critics and audiences Rotten Tomatoes has the film at a likeability rating with audiences and an anemic fresh with critics Suffice it to say it was not Smiths best work While the film itself had issues the biggest problem was the fact everyone felt this was Smith trying to gift a blockbuster to his son who also was his costar Audiences wanted nothing to do with it and Smith hasnt put out action film since instead focusing on more dramatic roles that is until this year Suicide Squad is going to be one of s biggest films Warner Bros NYSE TWX second film in DCs new connected universe of movies centered around its heroes and villains Smith is playing a big role in that launch and he along with director David Ayer are largely being viewed as why the film is expected to live up to the hype Bright a Men In Black style film about a cop teaming with an orc in a world where humans and mythically creatures live sidebyside was heavily courted by Warner Bros which was hoping to land the project to capitalize on the expected success of its shiny new toy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>though had no problem playing spoiler <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is basically giving the producers and the creative team including million to writer John Landis payment upfront essentially eliminating any risk on their part In this age of the box office when no original pictures are a sure thing anymore thats valuable Of course it is also valuable to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Like with Sandler the deal isnt about a domestic play its about a global one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can comb through its data and see which stars play well both in the States and internationally and then doubledown on those names Say what you want about Smith but hes always going to be a boldfaced name and hes always going to bring star power to whatever hes in even to something as undervalued as Concussion in which he was brilliant As a result all sides seem poised to win on this deal Subscribers win out because its a summer blockbuster level project investors win out because it will likely up the subscriber count and the company itself wins because it continues to gain the credibility it has been building for years Who knows If After Earth had been a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>film maybe it wouldnt have been regarded as such a terrible film Then again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is too smart to stick its foot into something like that Instead its executive team waited for something like Bright which feels like the organic next
