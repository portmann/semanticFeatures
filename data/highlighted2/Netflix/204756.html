Seeking Alpha The company reported solid earnings and revenue with some weakness in Q outlook domestically The core strategy still works and certain regional launches show a lot of promise in terms of revenue and audience metrics Going forward linear becomes weak as survivability is based heavily on sports programming However sports broadcasting is being disrupted by data analytics and serverbased architecture that contextualizes and visualizes the programming better This bodes badly for conventional media players The risktoreward still favors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can thrive without sports broadcasting Linear dies the moment sport broadcasts transition successfully to webbased TV <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX reported a pretty solid quarter all around but then again the stock is down by more than Thursday morning so theres obviously a couple soft patches from the report as well However I believe the company has positioned itself to be more of a global platform which explains why theyre not renewing certain content licensing deals in regional markets like the United States Better to invest into content and distribute internationally than to overspend on certain licensing deals that are limited to the United States With promising metrics in terms of viewing hours and ARPU trends investors have plenty of reasons to be excited I also remain fairly optimistic as the content mix has strengthened and the launch in Japan is widely viewed as successful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>mentioned that viewership metrics for its original content in Japan was similar to other regional markets outside of the United States on the earnings conference call I figured the Japanese launch would be successful The company reported revenue of billion which slightly missed the consensus estimate figure of billion The companys operating income slightly declined qoq from million to million The company reported EPS of which was at the low end of the estimate range but all of those things aside the company had a pretty good quarter as its likely to drive a meaningful increase in revenue once the oneyear grandfather period from month to month comes to an end and new subscriber additions move subscribers up in the pricing tiers Of course Ive made numerous comments in the past about how pricing increases will likely develop into a normal trend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has plenty of pricing leverage and not much of that has changed in the most recent quarter However the company did clarify a change in accounting with regards to their amortization schedule Assuming viewership hours are high in the initial launch window the company rapidly amortizes However if viewership hours are spread the amortization schedule is also spread out to match that viewership So there could be some lumpiness in terms of COGs depending on the titles being released and the run rate for content spend as they move through a fiscal year That being the case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>remains one of my betterperforming ideas Sure I can acknowledge that the stock trades at some pretty high multiples but given the potential to widen profitability through economies of scale its hard to criticize a company for being in the early growth phase Of course many will miss out as its difficult to rationalize the lack of profitability However the ongoing rampup in terms of sales and other pertinent qualitative factors make it an interesting growth play While the valuation is stretched its primarily due to the low earnings figure that serves as the denominator to any valuemetric In a sense profitability will remain constrained as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is in a heavy investment phase which negates much of the conventional wisdom of value oriented investing However the key theme to watch for going forward is whether growth can in fact accelerate Furthermore survey data indicates that the younger demographic is continuing to transition to streaming as an alternative form of content consumption as opposed to linear TV programming Theres also no denying that its more cost effective and that people prefer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as opposed to Hulu and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN HBO launched HBO Now and while they do have some great tentpole franchises the content collection isnt as large as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which removes much of the competitive friction from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>HBO does have a distribution advantage when compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as its sold as a part of a channel bundle which broadens the sellthrough However the established subscriber base isnt larger than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and while I did pay the month to try out HBO streaming I felt like the quality of streams favored <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>kept me updated with more compelling original content Yes I just said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has better content than HBO youre welcome to chastise me in the comment section Narcos was the biggest release in the prior month period You have to watch it folks Im sure many of you investing into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also have a subscription and can agree with me that Narcos is like Breaking Bad but on steroids and with stronger storytelling Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but retelling the story of one of the largest cocaine rings is a stroke of genius and lives up to Netflixs reputation of creating compelling original series I anticipate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue to differentiate itself as it continues to invest more aggressively into original programming It was only a couple days ago where a group of media executives were arguing about the future of media on Squawk Box For the most part they agreed that sports programming is the holy grail of linear television So as long as they can hold onto sports programming theyll be able to remain relevant for the next couple years However apps have been launched for MLB NBA NHL and NFL The four major sports categories in the United States and while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt have any sports programming it has been very successful without it Going forward I anticipate that the various sport associations will retain more of their content and sell direct to consumer via app based subscriptions There are two ways to capitalize on this as you can invest into Apple NASDAQ AAPL and earn a small chunk of every OTT subscription or invest into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and avoid the situation entirely because once sports programming transitions to web TV the conventional media players become even weaker In fact I saw the demonstration of the MLB app at the Amazon ReInvent Conference and for the most part sport apps are starting to become big data friendly Now you can see live statistics of ball hit velocity ball throw speed in real time Next year they plan on rolling out dimensional viewing angle shifts The idea of introducing more camera angles and more data is data center dependent but when youre feeding the programming via a data pipeline its possible to add more features to content and create a more unique user interface This implies that NFL statistics on hit power speed and etc enters the domain of live sports science combined with GoPro NASDAQ GPRO like viewing angles With the transition to faster data speeds its possible to strap cameras to helmets program the cameras to turn on and off depending on the play call all while displaying various points of data across the entire field If you thought sports were cool the st century plans to take it a step further by identifying everything thats going on in real time No lost data no messed up calls and more immersion all in real time The cloud and the internet of things seem extremely disruptive to sports programming and reduces viability for linear programming to zero Of course this makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>that much stronger because by the time conventional TV programming reacts to the situation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be on pace to generate billion in sales which positions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as the next generation of TV The live content become more dynamic and more global But there are only a few platforms positioned well enough to capture streaming dollars and I anticipate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to remain one of those platforms Many of these sports apps are unbundled and disorganized You need sports to be packaged into a broader webbased bundle and right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is best positioned to pay for that kind of programming especially if youre thinking years down the road Of course Verizon already knows this and they too are attempting to launch an OTT service thats inclusive of sports programming Time will tell but we already know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will do fine with or without sports Its the conventional media players that are left in a do or die situation I cant think of any real reason for investing into the companies who own the data pipelines or the content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the safer play as its better positioned
