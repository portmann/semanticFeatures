Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>rockets off the news of smashing subscriber growth estimates as the companys plan to expand is in full force Cash flow and net income have both been negatively affected by the companys growth initiatives Law of large numbers could apply soon We love <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a company but as an investment it may just be too expensive here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX posted earnings on Wednesday that yet again the street loved The stock opened up in trading on Thursday as analysts hiked their priced targets all happy with the companys subscriber growth Much like Tesla NASDAQ TSLA we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a fantastic company with a great product but we feel that the pricing of the stock may dictate that its going to be time to take profits soon In addition to earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is being helped out by its recent split adjustment which took effect earlier this week With a lower stock price retail investors and certain funds are more prone to adding exposure to the company Subscriber growth has been the main key to watch during NFLX earnings Both net income and cash flows have taken a back seat while the company continues plowing through its aggressive growth model You cant make an omelet without breaking some eggs right The market seems to only be focused on the rate at which it is adding new subscribers but even bullish analysts estimate that NFLX will top out at about million subscribers Part of this reasoning leads us to believe the valuation could be too far out in front of the fundamentals here Part of the reason the stock has responded so positively despite the lack of net income growth is that the company crushed subscriber growth numbers They were expected to add subscribers in the US and instead they added The company also beat on international subscribers posting million vs estimates of million The company now has million members That aside were going to take a look at five reasons we think that taking profits here and perhaps waiting for a correction may be the right move to make for those holding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Cash flow The company reported FCF of million vs expectations of million The company is burning through cash quickly as it tries to grow internationally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a substantial cash position near billion and so FCF isnt the main focus as it grows but its one of a few items that we think needs to be steadied Managements comments on this were that negative free cash flow was expected as the company grows internationally The management team focuses on the ratio of content PL expense to cash which hovers in the to range They expect it to peak at Net income Just like with cash flow with the company trying to expand internationally the bottom line is being negatively affected and net income was down substantially YOY Though hardly a reason to panic at this point as the company remains profitable while spending to expand its offerings and outreach we think investors should keep a close eye on the PL and not lose sight of the companys fundamentals as it grows Yes this is a growth story but at the end of the day we buy stock because we think the company can over the course of whatever timeframe were looking at provide more than what youre paying for it in earnings per share China isnt moving as planned China slated for a arrival for NFLX is a monster international market and arguably the most important international move for the company With a delay in moving into China however can the market keep the stock priced for this growth for another two years without any tangible progress This was CEO Hastings comments on China So China again we still have some things to figure out so I suppose its possible he said but added he was pretty confident about the rest of the world The biggest hurdle Hastings said in an interview is securing the required government clearance and partnerships needed to operate in China a country with strict regulation of media The valuation is becoming immense and NFLX only has so much more room for subscriber growth When that ends the pricing model is going to be key Please read this fantastic article out yesterday goes into the law of large numbers problem that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is going to have moving forward especially if they dont update their pricing The market itself is going to have to hold up and support the generous price it has given to NFLX In the face of rate hikes China and Greece we think there are too many factors that could negatively impact US equity markets for us to be confident buying NFLX here Were not really bonafide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bears were just cautious investors We like the company and several of us at the office are subscribers ourselves We just are trying to face the reality that without bumping up pricing right now with the company in global expansion mode the stocks high valuation could be bordering on irrational We dont want to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>catch the Amazon effect Wed like to see some quality of earnings eventually net income and cash flows steady and the stock pull back before we take a position at these levels If we were long <span
