are trying to figure out what VZ sees in AOL Neither its advertising media nor dial up internet fit into what Verizon is currently doing The big news today is that Verizon NYSE VZ is dishing out billion to acquire a company that many believe to be way past its prime AOL NYSE AOL While many have speculated about why Verizon would make such a deal and whether AOL is a good fit I initially believe that Verizon hit the ball out of the park with this acquisition and that itll lead to good things for the company First and foremost I describe myself as a longterm near decade long investor in Verizon turned skeptic The billion acquisition to take full ownership of Wireless has not drove free cash flow growth the way that many believed it would mainly because the US wireless price war forced margins lower Due to the unexpected reality of lower margins in wireless AOL became an attractive asset In a mature US wireless space new revenue channels are very important for Verizon and it likely found one in AOL In response to the acquisition Verizon investors are most optimistic about AOLs digital content publishing and its services business that allows publishers to automate ad sales The publishing business is a bit of a headscratcher for Verizon which might explain the initial rumors that Verizon plans to spinoff assets like Huffington Post That business saw revenue of million during AOLs last quarter with growth of yearoveryear Meanwhile AOLs advertising technology is very interesting for Verizon a business that saw revenue growth of during AOLs last quarter Currently this segments quarterly revenue of just million is not large enough to move the needle on Verizons income statement but if Verizon does have hopes of becoming an advertising company and one that provides automated advertising options for other companies then it could become a longterm growth driver It could become a segment that diversifies Verizons business and gives it a service that no other telecom can offer its enterprise customers mainly those who are using Verizons Digital Media Services to power video and digital content Also the Internet of Things is expected to be one of the biggest technology growth drivers of the next five years We are talking about billion connected things worldwide all consuming data and running off of wireless networks Maybe Verizon sees an opportunity to offer automated advertising solutions to developers on its network smartphone makers and software developers AOLs CEO Tim Armstrong sure thinks so saying that AOL is as big as it can possibly be in todays landscape He then added if you look forward five years youre going to be in a space where there are going to be massive globalscale networks and theres no better partner for us to go forward with than Verizon This statement certainly seems that IoT is a big reason for Verizons interest and AOLs willingness to sell Another likely possibility has to do with advertising on Verizons upcoming web TV platform Verizon has not unveiled how it will monetize the service and with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Dish HBO and the countless other web video platforms charging a monthly fee it is possible that Verizon will choose to go the advertising route The move to buy AOL suggests this as highly likely The key takeaway is that the possibilities are endless for Verizon with this acquisition as AOL takes Verizon in a direction that we havent yet seen in telecom As someone who has followed Verizon for over a decade this move to buy AOL feels very much like past Verizon moves that didnt make much sense at the time but paid dividends longterm For several years when iPhones were first taking over the market and exclusive to ATT investors thought Verizon was crazy for not taking whatever deal Apple offered and to get its products into Verizon stores Instead Verizon waited patiently and helped put Android on the map focusing all marketing towards Android when ATT was pushing Apple Verizon ultimately got Apple but had a solid foundation with Android at the same time This helped Verizon outperform ATT for years in subscriber growth Around the same time investors thought Verizon was equally as crazy when ATT was expanding its G network miles ahead of Verizon whereas Verizon chose to invest in this speculative technology called G We all know how that played out as Verizon continues to boast the nations largest G LTE network a title it has owned for many years while competitors play catch up and retire inferior G networks For me the acquisition of an advertising technology media company with over two million dialup internet subscribers feels the same as those events in the past It doesnt quite make sense there are still a lot of questions However if AOL gives Verizon a way to monetize its video services provide advertising solutions to its Digital Media and IoT customers and allows it to convert highmargin dialup internet users to FiOS subscribers then Verizon would have hit a home run with this acquisition While we cant know for certain how meaningful AOLs business will be for Verizons longterm growth prospects the companys history suggests that we should trust its decision and perhaps believe that advertising will play a crucial role in Verizons longterm plan Source Verizon Might Have Hit A Home
