the stock Far from being reassuring ESPNs subscriber engagement is low enough to be dangerous Disney NYSE DIS today is a stock beset by contradictions Although worries over ESPN and its million lost subscribers continue to dog the stock it has recovered substantially from a low of as continued strong results in the Film division ie Captain America Civil War and Star Wars Episode VII buoy some traders A growing number of Disney bulls are also challenging the skepticism of ESPN arguing that it remains a potent asset for Disney I too am encouraged by the Film division results but I am steering clear of Disney stock and may even open a short position ESPN is simply too big a deadweight for any of the companys other divisions to overcome The argument against ESPN is twofold First as the channel which benefited most from the old cable bundle it is the channel most at risk as that bundle continues to fray ESPN is far and away the richest channel in cableTV taking in almost five times the persubscriber fees of the next closest channel And that is just the flagship channel ESPN brings in more fees as does ESPNU ESPN Classic and all the rest Second ESPN is not nearly as capable as some other channels of adapting to a decline in its revenues This is because of the kind of content it carries sports which just a few years ago was seen and is still seen by some as ESPNs greatest strength In fact it is its greatest weakness Traditional channels which produce TV shows have a monthslong lead time for their content commitments They order a show in March or that shows runs for episodes through Christmas If it does well it gets a further commitment for another episodes to take it through to next May when the whole lineups performance is reviewed and the whole thing starts all over again This means that if CBS or NBC suffered a sudden loss of income as people didnt like their shows anymore they would only need a couple months to adapt When they got to next May or even just to Christmas they could throttle back their spending on their lineup and either replace the shows with lowerbudget alternatives or even just produce fewer shows ESPN is different Its content is composed almost exclusively of multiyear sports agreements that are set years in advance Currently it is committed to the NFL through the NBA through and MLB through On the college front it is committed to the SEC through and to the BCS playoffs for a year longer Those are the biggest contracts but there are lots of others These commitments mean that spending at ESPN is almost completely independent of income Although it spends billions each year on its sports rights it spends very little on adding an additional subscriber and cannot quickly spend any less when it loses one This is a good thing when its adding subscribers because almost all of the marginal revenue of an extra subscriber goes straight to the bottom line But when subscribers are falling off it runs the other way every subscribers lost revenue corresponds almost to lost profit Almost all content creators have high fixed costs in the shortterm of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CBS HBO Hulu Amazon NBC They all face the same system And in the longrun they are also in the same boat no ones content obligations go on forever all costs are variable But in the mediumterm in between there they are very very different CBS and NBC and even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can ramp down spending in months ESPN needs years and in some cases it needs over a decade Analysts spend a lot of time calculating just how big a slice of Disneys pie ESPN is every quarter But because of the almost marginal effect that I just described we actually dont need to dig down in the report for those numbers However much Disneys total profit is whatever they lose from ESPN we simply subtract that from the current number What we do need to know is how much each subscriber contributes as well as an estimate of how many more subscribers they could lose That number multiplied by Disneys ownership stake Hearst Corporation owns of ESPN is the hit to the profit level According to Disney bulls that second number might well be zero In fact some bulls including Seeking Alphas own Nicholas Mushaike think subscriber losses could even reverse and start growing again As evidence of that he cites among other things a widely reported statistic from Disneys last fiscal year At a conference in March CEO Bob Iger repeated that of multichannel television cablesatellite TV subscribers watch live sports and of them watched ESPN First please note how carefully this is phrased If you currently have a MVPD subscription you have a chance of watching sports and an chance of watching ESPN specifically So all the people whove already left the sportsheavy cable bundle because they dont need it are excluded right off the bat Still Sounds like great news right Its not To understand why simply remember how MVPDs work Customers pay a fixed fee for a set package of channels They cannot pick and choose channels and they pay nothing extra to watch whatever channels they already have as much as they want In other words the marginal cost of ESPN to existing MVPD customers is zero of those customers watch ESPN So Igers comment could just as easily be rephrased like this of the people buying cable bundles wont watch our content even when its free with their subscription So as the cable bundle continues to fray and payTV continues to slowly migrate towards a la carte or at least smarter bundles a la Verizons Custom TV its safe to assume that a minimum of of customers will be leaving ESPN behind How bad is that Commentators usually cite ESPNs subscriber fee of a month But its twin channel ESPN is always in the same bundle with it and shares the same content packages Basically the overflow from ESPN is on ESPN So the two together are a month or per quarter of ESPNs remaining million subscribers is about million million subscribers times last quarter is about million coming straight out of ESPNs bottom line But the ESPN family actually consists of eight channels including ESPNU per month the SEC Network per month but its only in about twothirds of American households the Longhorn Network in Texas ESPN Classic ESPNews and Spanishlanguage ESPN Deportes Assuming the SEC Network lost subscribers proportionally to its original size million multiplied by multiplied by months knocks about another million out ESPN Classic ESPNews and ESPN Deportes losses would be less but theyd still hurt At a conservative per channel plus ESPNUs per month multiplied by a proportional share costs another million last quarter Longhorn Network has a very narrow Texas focus so Ive excluded it for now So ESPN is out almost million per quarter in profit almost billion per year Disneys share of that comes out to billion Disney is trading at right now after plumbing a low of Its last annual profit was billion Assuming its TTM PE of didnt change it would have to fall to a new low of to make up the loss of billion from the apathetic subscribers Thats before any actual declines in viewership at ESPN ESPN will not lose all those subscribers at once of course The transformation of payTV will continue to move gradually although fewer and fewer question that it is transforming But the stock market is a discount mechanism and investors should be concerned that the stock might come to price in their loss a good deal faster than that once evidence of it begins to emerge as I believe it already has and will continue to Investors should not wait for that to happen If they bought the dip they have already secured a good profit But the longterm future of Disney I believe is very cloudy at the moment with a chance of thunderstorms I would avoid Disney stock Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned
