expensive than WalMarts which were only higher than Amazons during the BTS season The creation of a more priceattractive consumer environment should result in increased year old and under shoppers at Target The company has an opportunity to widen its economic moat via designer collaborations Target NYSE TGT unveiled a new pricematching policy today which includes pricematching both online and instore This is part of Targets greater initiative to compete with the convenience and price advantages offered by competitors Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and WalMart NYSE WMT both of whom are included in Targets new pricematching which is set to launch on October We believe this pricematching initiative is a necessary move for Target and a step in the right direction According to Profitero Targets online prices were more expensive than WalMarts which were only higher than Amazons during the BTS season So while WalMart and Amazon ecommerce prices are competitive they are far better than Targets online prices As opposed to competing on price Target instead chose to compete on shipping during the BTS season offering free shipping and returns on all purchases regardless of size during the first two weeks of August Both Amazon and Target offer free shipping on purchases over The new pricematching policy will couple these shipping initiatives with price initiatives to aggressively attempt to put Targets prices on par with Amazon and WalMart We believe this is critically important to influence consumer buying trends and attract more consumers both online and instore especially young consumers We have previously discussed Millennial shopping trends including that studentdebt burdened Millennials in a slow wagegrowth US labor economy are pricepreferred shoppers This has made WalMart the most preferred general merchandise retailer among shopped age and younger Despite being more expensive Target is still more preferred than WalMart among the and demographic and has continued to post impressive comps numbers both online and instore The creation of a more priceattractive consumer environment should result in increased years old and under shoppers at Target and this coupled with already strong growth among older demographics set the stage for a successful Holiday sales season for Target Target might also be able to benefit from following a <span

According to a Motley Fool piece Target has found much success with its designer partnerships and signature categories Amazon has made aggressive moves in the fashion space as it owns Zapposcom and Shopbop so fighting low Amazon fashion prices should be an initiative for Target Through offering exclusive products Target widens its economic moat and could create a more loyal customer base These designer collaborations are typically consumer designer merchandise offered at a significant discount so they are generally popular but still offer great margins These products are also not subject to margin compression from the pricematching policy as there are no comparables from which to pricematch Much like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the success of Targets gradual shifts to exclusive content rely heavily on what the content is and how it resonates with consumers We do believe though that Target does have potential herein to substantially widen its economic moat On top of all this the US consumer spending economy is strong despite a stumbling equities market Real PCE posted a MM gain in August while Real DPI posted a MM gain Real PCE growth has been north of throughout Consumer confidence came in points above the consensus estimate at Economic indicators hint at immediate strength in consumer spending The timing of the pricematching policy heading into the Holiday season is ideal and coupled with competitive shipping prices creates a priceattractive consumer environment both instore and online The US consumer economy is strong and growing and the
