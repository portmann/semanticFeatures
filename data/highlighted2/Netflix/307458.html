and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Netflixs shares have risen thanks to an article proposing Apple buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I believe reaction to this purchase would be extremely negative On Monday shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX were on the rise as a Seeking Alpha market news detailed some potential discussion of a takeover by Apple NASDAQ AAPL The discussion was started in a Forbes article seen here detailing how Apple would leapfrog into the streaming space and past a number of key competitors with this purchase I disagree with the premise that Apple should buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for a variety of reasons If Apple were to decide an acquisition is the right strategy to help launch its own streaming service I think Hulu would be a better purchase The first reason I disagree with a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>buyout is that it does not fit with Apples strategy of mainly buying small private firms Apple received a lot of criticism for its purchase of Beats and that deal was valued at billion Imagine the reaction to a purchase of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which the Forbes article states would be in the billion to billion range That price tag would be about double what Apple would pay for Tesla Motors NASDAQ TSLA something widely discussed Additionally there are some statements in the Forbes article that are either somewhat misleading or require a bit hope Here are the main ones I have issue with The PL contribution from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will make an immediate and meaningful impact on Apple financials right off the bat The dilutive effects on the share count would more than likely be easily offset by a reenergised Apple shareholder base that would take Apple shares higher right off the bat The synergies from a combined NetflixApple would also be immense Think about the crossmarketing and synergistic potential of a combined Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>While a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>purchase would help Apple immediately on the revenue line it wouldnt do that much <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is forecast for a little under billion in revenues during calendar Q while Apple is forecast for more than billion On the bottom line the impact is tremendously less because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in an investment quarter has guided to net income of just million while Apple has guided to a profit of more than billion While there could be some synergies between the two immense seems a bit much I also dont know if Apples shareholders would be invigorated right off the bat Back in November it was reported that Hulu was looking to sell a stake in the billion to billion range Thus Apple could step in and have the company for less than billion a fraction of the price for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>While Hulu doesnt have the subscriber base of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>theres a lot less risk involved when you are talking about this size of deal A purchase of Hulu would also be more in line with Apples purchase history of private companies A purchase of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would also require a very interesting discussion of acquisition funding In its latest Q filing Apple disclosed that billion of its billion cash hoard was located outside the US For Apple to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>it would either need to repatriate a large chunk of funds thus incurring a large tax bill take out tens of billions in debt or use a large amount of stock for the purchase Fifty billion dollars of debt even at would equal more than billion in annual pretax interest expenses while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>last year had a total profit of million With Apple buying back stock to reduce its share count tremendously in recent years using equity to fund a deal seems like a complete If Apple was going to issue so much debt Id rather the company do so for future repurchases At the least Apple retires shares and saves on dividend payments while not incurring the cash burn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is currently facing That size of buyback would boost earnings per share by a lot more than a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>acquisition would especially in the short term A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>acquisition would also result in a big management shuffle Would Reed Hastings Netflixs CEO want to work for someone else Im not entirely sure On the other hand do most consumers and investors even know who the CEO of Hulu is Perhaps Apple would need to float some big severance package to get Hastings to step aside and that alone would add to the deals already large cost On the other hand some would speculate Hastings take over for Tim Cook Im not sure handing over the keys to the most profitable company in the market today to someone who has never really focused on the bottom line is a good strategy Apple Music has passed the million subscriber level which is probably around the figure that Hulu currently has estimated at million very recently Apple Music started out small and has gradually expanded over time With Apple looking to launch a streaming service a Hulu acquisition would give Apple that small foot in the door while not facing the risk of a billion acquisition Apple could slowly expand the service as it sees fit using its ecosystem to further its global reach Overall an Apple acquisition of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>seems extremely farfetched The price tag is extremely high and several times north of Apples most expensive purchase ever While I do believe there are reasons to own Netflixs stock I dont believe an acquisition by Apple is one of them A purchase of Hulu which would still end up being Apples biggest acquisition seems to fit in more with the companys strategy There are just too many questions involved regarding a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>purchase and the financial impact in the short term would not be pretty Additional disclosure Author long DIS which has a stake in Hulu Investors are always reminded that before making any investment you should do
