NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Netflixs contentdriven strategy has served it well so far with subscriber growth Netflixs partnerships with others such as payTV providers have helped widen its service availability A Netflixbranded streaming device would further increase its services visibility <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX has got a lot to thank the Internet ecosystem for its content delivery Different digital platforms of computers mobile devices game consoles settop boxes and smart TVs provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>viewers convenient access points for the companys growing content offerings While benefiting from others Internetconnected hardware <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>itself has been focusing on obtaining third party content and later on producing its own original shows as the way to attract subscribers As of the end of June over million people subscribe to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in the US some over percent of the population and a celebrated affair from the companys contentdriven efforts As a result of its subscriber growth Netflixs stock has done very well Over the last two and a half years a stock of under rose to be in the range and was becoming too expensive to own A to share split had to be called for to bring the stock back to the level providing some perceived affordability But knowing by heart that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still commands the same valuation multiple when it was a stock anyone who purchases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares at this price level is betting on continued robust subscriber growth Thats a daunting task and could become harder to achieve when content alone may not be enough to further stimulate subscriber growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has produced some hugely successful shows but so far theyre reaching only percent of the population How will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>go from here to sign up as many more viewers as possible out of the remaining percent If so many potential viewers are not coming to such alluring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content it may be no longer a content problem but potentially a streaming device issue While any streaming device is good enough for a willing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>user to find Netflixs service on it only a Netflixbranded streaming device presents an unobstructed visibility so that even someone not initially interested in Netflixs service may consider using it simply because the service is visibly there on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>device The idea of having a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>visibility thats truly ubiquitous is as important as if not more than the companys belief in unique content when it comes to gaining and sustaining subscriber growth The availability of Netflixs service on all streaming devices is still not the same as an unencumbered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>visibility which only a Netflixbranded streaming device can showcase When bundled with other applications on others devices Netflixs service has to compete for eyeballs against all available choices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>actually believes in making its service as visible as possible but not by launching its own streaming device The company has tried to team up with payTV providers to incorporate Netflixs service into their TVviewing navigation systems in hopes of signing up some of the payTV customers The agreement with Marriott NASDAQ MAR to insert Netflixs service into the hotel chains own TV platform is another example of Netflixs desire to make its service a thing of ubiquitousness This illustrates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>understands the importance of actively pushing its service to where its right before a potential viewers eye <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>didnt just leave it to chance by relying only on potential viewers to decide whether to look for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on their computer or a handheld device When someone didnt decide to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on such a device that would be one subscriber lost With all that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is trying to do the company may think its doing a good job promoting its service by being highly involved in the fight for subscribers However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not going all the way and should consider to include a devicedriven subscriber acquisition But First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has to soften its hardcore stance on no to streaming device <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CEO has a dismissive conviction of novalue add in launching the companys own streaming device But based on the analysis so far it just seems that Mr Hastings may be mistaking his services availability everywhere for a true ubiquitous <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>visibility that could potentially make using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a thing of automatic The only way to engage with potential users in that process is to have a Netflixbranded streaming device But it cannot be a mobile phone or tablet as both devices have to build other complex computing functions beyond a simple streaming task Plus consumers would not want to trade all the goodies from an iPhone or Android for something called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>So the ideal streaming device to help achieve a ubiquitous <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>visibility is easily a settop box or better yet smart TV The power of people still watching TV from their living rooms has been overly underestimated all in the name of changing digital times While many people use computers and mobile devices for work they go and sit in front of a TV for entertainment Some may not sign up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>even though its available on their other digital devices but the same people just may pay for Netflixs service if they have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>TV right in their sight A third party TV just may do the opposite encouraging people to continue to pay big dollars for other payTV programs The utter convenience of a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>service or totally unhindered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>visibility as provided by a piece of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>streaming hardware is what could win over the audience here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has embarked on a global expansion and is expected to be nearly global by the end of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>investors had better believe that a global pursuit has got to be an ambition and is not prompted by any misinformed concerns of a saturating US streaming market something of a sure misconception While having not made it easier to penetrate in the home market a lack of devicedriven strategy may show up as a fatal weakness in international markets Chinas Alibaba NYSE BABA is said to be competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in that countrys sizable media market Not surprisingly it will do so through the use of both Alibababranded settop box and smart TV Its time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to rewire its hardware
