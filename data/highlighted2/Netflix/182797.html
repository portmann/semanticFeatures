DIS Includes CMCSA DISH FOX NFLX by Bret Kenwell Streaming has gained momentum but not all companies are subject to lose Disney TwentyFirst Century Fox and Comcasts NBC are the joint owners of Hulu a hedge against the growing world of streaming Shares of Disney have sold off too much given its leading position in different businesses along with this Hulu hedge In early August Disney NYSE DIS reported its third quarter earnings results While the numbers were pretty good a few comments from CEO Bob Iger confirmed what too many investors had hoped would never come ESPN subscriber loss While the company has done a great job diversifying its business with theme parks cruises movies and television the strategy has become skewed toward the media segment It led the way in Q with billion in revenues making up of the companys total sales for the quarter At the same time these comments were only deeply concerning if you turned off the conference call after the first five minutes curled up in a ball and cried yourself to sleep Because further along in the call Iger seemed relatively upbeat about the situation highlighting that of sports programs are viewed live which is good for advertising Ad dollars for the quarter rose roughly for ESPN when excluding the difficult comparison with the Mens World Cup in Q last year which more than offset the benefit of an additional game of the NBA Finals in Q this year Iger explained Hes being realistic for sure but thats what you want to hear from the leader of a company you own The truth In fact Iger says basic TV bundles will do fine going forward because the pricing is fair and appropriate I think thats true for most households as I outlined last week But what if hes wrong Investors are revaluing shares of content companies gauging what the damage will be from cordcutting Not all are created equal though Several of these companies have an ace up their sleeve that few investors seem to acknowledge Yes Im talking about the valuable asset that Disney TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA and Comcasts NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK NBC Universal own Hulu Like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Hulu is a paypermonth streaming service Rather than having a plethora of original dated and relatively new content though Hulu thrives on streaming recentlyaired content This includes the likes of Modern Family and The Tonight Show In the trio put Hulu up for sale only to pull it off the auction block and instead pump it with million to fuel future growth I think this was a good move Hulu is gaining in popularity with subscribers up yearoveryear to million as of April Viewings are up are as well climbing over last years figures while a growing number of that is coming from mobile devices Think of Hulu like a hedge for the three companies For Disney in particular it could leverage Hulu to add on offerings like ESPN for an additional monthly fee For example Hulu starts at per month but consumers can tack on Showtime for an additional In a recent conference Disney COO Tom Staggs noted how viewership and the number of devices accessing ESPN Watch the companys online streaming network is also seeing robust growth up and respectively So when the time comes why couldnt Disney role out its own standalone ESPN streaming service and make it as an additional tackon to Hulu too Furthermore between the content power and licensing agreements these three companies have Hulu could become its own version of an online streaming skinny bundle service where consumers have the power to start with a basic package and pay for additional channel packages much like Dish Networks NASDAQ DISH Sling TV Given the companies content and Hulus extremely uptodate shows this could be a very viable option in the future Hulu personnel is also promising particularly Jenny Wall the head of marketing Beginning her career with HBO and working most recently with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>she helped launch campaigns for original series like Orange is the New Black as well as led the global creative teams brand campaigns I think shell be able grow Hulus domestic and international distribution and reach to consumers Hulu has three big content providers the juggernaut being Disney capable of driving subscribers to the platform From that April presentation linked above Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins said If you take only one thing away this morning know that is the year Hulu will break out I think he might be right While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the clear leader Hulu still has a lot of ground to make up with some pretty big backers as well While Hulu is a nice side business for Disney and the others it could have a much larger role if the streaming wars continue to heat up For its part I think Disneys near selloff is a bit much considering it has a diversified portfolio ongoing strength in its media business and a worthy hedge in Hulu against the streaming wars Iger has been an extremely good manager up until now and Im not about to start doubting him going forward We only
