MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Its a sign of how dominant Facebook has become that skeptics are so scarce but despite Estimizes bullish earnings estimate there are reasons for caution in the nearterm We discuss those reasons for caution including SA contributor Alex Pittis thesis of Facebooks recession risk and JC Parets bearishness on the market as a whole Prior to its IPO in Facebook NASDAQ FB had its share of skeptics One of the most prominent ones was David Heinemeier Hansson creator of the Ruby on Rails web application framework and partner in the software firm Basecamp formerly known as Signals In a late post Hansson wrote that Facebook is not worth billion referring to its valuation at the time as a private company Hansson assumed that private valuation wouldnt withstand the scrutiny of the stock market As former Facebook employee and current angel investor Bobby Goodlatte reminded us via Twitter last fall see image below Facebook as a public company ended up worth almost x more than its valuation when Hannson wrote the post we linked to above Facebooks shares have pulled back a bit since Goodlattes tweet as of January ths close FBs market cap was about billion but Facebook skeptics remain hard to find Still there are reasons for caution in the nearterm Well look at a couple of reasons for that below consider two other perspectives on the company and offer an optimal collar hedge for Facebook shareholders looking to limit their downside risk In an article earlier this month Why I Sold My Facebook Seeking Alpha contributor Alex Pitti who remains a longterm bull on the company offered an interesting fundamental reason for caution in the nearterm Drawing on his earlier prediction of a recession Pitti argued that Facebook is a cyclical business that will be affected by a slowdown in ad spending during the recession He noted that this wasnt the case during the last recession but that was only because Facebooks share of advertising dollars was so small at the time that it still had plenty of room to grow Now that its an established behemoth Pitti argues that Facebook will be more sensitive to a decline in ad spending across the board Another reason for caution relates to the stock market as a whole In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday Eagle Bay Capital president JC Parets argued that the performance of the financial sector as represented by the Financial SPDR ETF NYSEARCA XLF and illustrated in the chart below image via Bloomberg TV boded poorly for the broader market If we were still in a bull market Parets argued he would expect financials to be leading the way higher Facebook is scheduled to release its earnings after the close on Wednesday As the chart below from Estimize shows the Estimize community expects Facebook to report earnings of cents per share in its FQ one penny above the Wall Street consensus estimate Every trading day Portfolio Armor ranks every hedgeable stock and exchangetraded product such as ETFs by its potential return Potential return in our terminology is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next months As of Mondays close the site calculated a potential return of for Facebook By way of comparison this was the worst potential return the site calculated for FANG stocks on Monday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX the subject of our recent article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>And Chill had a potential return of Alphabet Class A shares NASDAQ GOOGL were second highest with a potential return of and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN had the highest potential return of any security in our universe at With our potential return for Facebook in mind well look at a way of hedging it below First a quick reminder about a few hedging terms Recall that puts short for put options are contracts that give an investor the right to sell a security for a specified price the strike price before a specified date the expiration date And calls short for call options are contracts that give an investor the right to buy security for a specified price before a specified date A collar is a type of hedge in which you buy a put option for protection and at the same time sell a call option which gives another investor the right to buy the security from you at a higher strike price by the same expiration date The proceeds from selling the call option can offset at least part of the cost of buying the put option An optimal collar is a collar that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest cost while not capping your possible upside by more than you specify In a nutshell with a collar you may be able to reduce the cost of hedging in return for giving up some possible upside Were going to use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find an optimal collar to hedge Facebook below but you dont need the app to do this you can find optimal collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if youre willing to take the time and do the work Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app two pieces of information youll need to supply in addition to the number of shares youre looking to hedge are your cap and your threshold Cap refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge For example if youre hedging over a month period and you think a security wont appreciate more than over that time frame then it might make sense to use as a cap you dont think the security is going to do better than that so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that For the example below we started off using a cap of the potential return our site calculated for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but we raised it to because that was as high as we could raise it without raising the hedging cost All else equal though the lower the cap the less expensive it will be to hedge The other term threshold refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purposes of the example below weve used a threshold of If you are more risk averse you could use a smaller threshold and you are less risk averse you could use a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge As of Mondays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of FB against a drop over the next several months while not capping an investors upside by less than As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or as a percentage of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was or of position value So the net cost of this optimal collar was negative meaning an investor would have collected more from selling the call leg than he paid for the puts an amount equal to of his position value Note that to be conservative the cost of the hedge above was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls in practice an investor can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and the ask and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have collected more than when opening this collar Although the threshold on this collar is and thresholds are calculated to take into account positive hedging costs they dont take into account negative hedging costs So the worst case scenario in this case when taking into account the hedging cost would be a decline of less than assuming conservatively a negative cost of the maximum drawdown here would be Similarly the best case scenario wouldnt be the level at which this collar is capped but Tagged ETFs Portfolio Strategy Technology </div></body></html>
