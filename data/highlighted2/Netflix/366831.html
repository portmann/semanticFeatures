significant part of its content budget on movies and programs geared toward kids entertainment Already it has by far the biggest content budget adding up to billion which is half of total boxoffice revenue By allocating a higher proportion of the budget to content aimed at a younger audience the firm hopes to create a longterm fan base Back in January Ted Sarandos chief content officer of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gave a hint about this when he stated that the firm would be doubling down on kids and families Of the global originals which the firm hopes to release this year are made for kids The increasing effort made by the firm for this segment reflects its membership pattern A majority of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers are

House of Cards or DareDevil The firm also provides multiple parental control options including little kids older kids and teens After analyzing the viewing pattern for kids programs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has found that a high percentage of programs are popular across different geographies Close to seven out of top most popular shows watched by kids have been popular in all countries This is quite favorable for the firm as it does not have to spend an extra amount on customization for this age group Content customization costs for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be one of the most important areas focused by analyst and investors as the firm increases the percentage of international subscribers within its portfolio currently roughly million or of its total million subscriber base is made by international audience Having a sizable market share of kids programming should help <span

times the time which consumers spend watching TV This does not bode well for traditional cable networks as they would need to up their game and increase the spending on new programs At the same time a
