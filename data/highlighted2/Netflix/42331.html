class='textDiv'>Verizon Releasing Skinny And OTT Packages Will They Work Verizon Communications NYSEVZ Seeking Alpha Verizons skinny package didnt get great reviews from the critics This is because of the numerous fees and lack of options This happens to be the exact reason why consumers are leaving paidTV The OTT option is the best way Verizon can try to have the exodus from linear TV not hurt its subscription metrics I detail the potential problems with using Awesomeness TV to bring millennials on board Content creators will produce for Vessel and a paid version of YouTube instead of TV It is where their viewers are it gives them more control over the content There is a problem with cable Most people dont watch most of the programming and millennials are cutting the cord and skipping linear TV altogether The average household has a TV package with channels and Nielsen estimates the average customer only watches I understand the consumer will never end up watching close to of the video content they purchase whether it is from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX or HBO However watching of the channels is a very low amount considering the average channel TV package costs per month Imagine if customers only liked of the original content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>produced the company would lose subscribers quickly The cable packaged deals arent representative of free market competition because most consumers pay for content they dont enjoy This dynamic is finally ending because of the competition online services such as Hulu <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and HBO provide It is a messy situation for Verizon NYSE VZ which is the th largest cable provider in the country It has to satisfy the customer and the networks simultaneously With this dynamic in mind lets look at the two initiatives Verizon is trying to employ to solve this conundrum The first is skinny packages of channels It is being marketed as a step toward a la carte service because consumers get to choose fewer channels with the goal of lowering their bill This package is aimed at addressing the problem which I previously mentioned The second initiative is an over the top internet mobile service which attempts to serve the millennials who are defecting from traditional cable In this article I detail the specifics of the plans and give my opinion on how they will turn out In theory the Verizon skinny package sounds like a step in the right direction for linear TV because the prices will be lowered and the number of choices will increase Verizon would like customers to view it as a move toward the a la carte model In reality the new packages are more of the same poor value propositions that are causing the trend toward over the top options Verizon is marketing the package as only more than what the internet costs alone but the hidden fees add up to the point where the new deal isnt so great According to a USA Today reporter his bill was only lower than when he subscribed to the old package The reason the actual bill is higher than what it is being advertised for is because the advertised package doesnt include a high definition picture and a DVR There are also other taxes and additional fees that add up If youve ever paid a Verizon bill Im sure youll be confused as I was when I tried to decipher my parents bill This review by TechHivecom perfectly sums up the situation This whole exercise just illustrates how Verizon and other traditional payTV providers are trapped in a system of their own design which relies on expensive hardware invented fees and shifty pricing tactics to keep the profits coming To summarize Verizons new offerings the packages are expensive and confusing consumers are moving to services like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>because its pricing is cheaper and simpler The content is also more compelling on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a recent survey stated the average subscriber to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>watches it for hours per day Verizons TV offering is similar to its wireless offering In wireless TMobile NYSE TMUS is attempting to be the innovative company with its Uncarrier initiatives making it more consumer friendly In both cases Verizon is a behemoth that is struggling to respond to the needs of the customer The main problem Verizon has with making a more compelling TV offering is the networks who are stuck in the past The a la carte pricing plan would hurt their earnings if their content isnt watched enough Its an understandable situation because of course a network like ESPN would want all consumers to pay for the channel even if they dont watch it The ultimate free market of internet video entertainment is difficult to compete in and prices often end up going down This is why ESPN is challenging whether Verizon has the right to put it in a sports addon pack It is a bad sign that Verizon is getting this much push back when its new package barely makes much of a change The networks and cable companies will end up fighting each other This will punish the subscribers making linear TV become completely irrelevant in a few years Its a demographic problem as most people under arent interested in paying cable companies for content they dont want The trend of consumers switching away from paid TV to broadband shown in the two charts below will not slow down because of this skinny package The OTT service which will launch in the second half of this year is more exciting for consumers and investors than the skinny package It is similar to the Sling TV offering which nabbed subscribers in the first month What I like about the package is the content on it The only reason why many people still subscribe to traditional packages is because of the live sports coverage Of the channels offered ACC Digital Network Campus Insiders CBS Sports ESPN and Sports are included Live college football and basketball games will be provided by CBS Sports and ESPN The other content offered is from Awesomeness TV which is a multichannel network that features YouTube stars and also has shows on Nick Awesomeness TV will provide Verizon hours of original content Awesomeness will create OTT channels for Verizon Awesomeness TV has billion views and million subscribers on YouTube From my perspective as a millennial who watches YouTube I would describe Awesomeness TV as more watchable content than the traditional networks because it features the top internet stars who I love The problem is that the model of a network creating content the way traditional linear channels and Awesomeness TV do is broken and will no longer exist in years The reason why YouTubers want to be on a TV network is the increased exposure and the pay increase These advantages are going away as YouTube will be offering a paid subscription service to help content creators make more money Vessel is another option for content creators who want to get paid more YouTube has recently put a huge amount of money into advertising for top creators as anyone who rides the subways in NYC can attest to which means the exposure difference is declining As the number of people who subscribe to traditional paidTV decline networks wont be able to offer YouTubers the exposure they crave The negative with making the jump to TV is the loss of complete control over what content is released because the networks have producers To be clear my criticism of Awesomeness TV is aimed at the content delivered on TV shows as opposed to the content on YouTube In my opinion the internet stars loss of control hinders overall quality of the shows and makes them lose their originality TV shows tend to copy what is popular on the internet as opposed to coming up with original content Because this explanation may seem fuzzy to you Ill give you an example of this happening The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon did a couple of skits on its show called the whisper challenge This was a challenge popularized by the YouTuber Joe Sugg Im not trying to say the Jimmy Fallon skits werent entertaining I am trying to portray the idea that if TV channels just copy content originally on the internet it has the potential to be less entertaining YouTube is entertaining for the viewer because of the connection made with the audience With more produced shows this connection is lost Verizon hopes Awesomeness TVs content will drive popularity in this OTT option but it may not be as successful as it hopes because of this reason The situation has not sorted itself out yet but the circumstances are interesting because by the end of the year Awesomeness TV will have content on a paid version of YouTube and a paid OTT option on Verizon Even if the content is better and more diverse on the Verizon channels YouTube would have a huge advantage because Awesomeness TV is only a small part of the content offered This situation isnt playing out now even though Awesomeness TV already has content on TV because cable providers arent using the content as a reason to subscribe If there are Awesomeness TV channels out of a channel offering it would be a big selling point for Verizon If I were Verizon I would probably do a similar partnership with live sports content and Awesomeness TV in a new OTT package My point is even Verizons best efforts may not be enough to bring millennials to subscribe I think a paid subscription of YouTube and Vessel will work better than trying to make internet stars go back to the old way entertainment used to be produced by being on an Awesomeness TV channel on Verizon Verizon is swimming uphill The executives are aware of the trends that face them this doesnt mean their actions will end up being successful Another determining factor of whether this experiment will be successful is the price point it is sold for These details have yet to be released Verizon doesnt have a great track record at providing a simple and reasonable pricing structure as we can see from the problems with the skinny package Id expect this package to be offered for around but if hidden costs which hinder the TV packages are present then the entire experiment could be a disaster Verizon states the OTT option is a mobileonly offering because younger people prefer it to TV This may be partially true but the real reason is it doesnt want to directly compete with its other cable offering If it was a TV offering then some consumers would trade down to this package costing Verizon money In reality a connected TV is just a smartphone with a bigger screen Im sure millennials wouldnt mind watching content they like on the TV The reason millennials originally moved to watching content on phones and tablets was it was the only place to get the content they loved With the advent of connected TVs users will be watching Vessel and a paid version of YouTube on the big screen Verizon must allow consumers to watch this new service on TVs if it wants to remain competitive There are two trends in video content The first is consumers are switching away from cable and towards OTT options The second is OTT options are getting more expensive as the content creators look to earn more money The exact model of how OTT services will be bundled together is what Apple NASDAQ AAPL is working on I think Vessel gets the lessproduced content right and companies like HBO and Hulu get the produced content right I find it difficult to believe Verizon will get the lessproduced product right That being said it still makes sense to monitor its actions because although the skinny package was a failure according to the critics the OTT option may be promising The idea of having live sports and Awesomeness TV sounds great on paper but pricing hasnt been released The other problem is content on the two Awesomeness TV channels may not be able to beat out Vessel and YouTube Source Verizon Releasing Skinny And OTT Packages Will They Work
