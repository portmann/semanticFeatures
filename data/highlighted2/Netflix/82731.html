are numerous uncertainties that make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>not a very intelligent investment There are though other companies that can benefit from the growth of IP traffic and high bandwidth trend One such company is Level Communications Inc NYSE LVLT Following is our detailed take on why LVLT is better positioned than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to capitalize on the growth prospects of IP traffic and internet delivery of digital content including video Lets get a hold of LVLTs business first It is a technology company that belongs to the industry of diversified communications The company is basically a facility based provider that created its international communication network by constructing its own assets and through acquisitions Level provides communication services to enterprises governments and carriers globally The company provides data security video voice and unified communications It has an extensive fiber optics network globally that is used to provide scalable services to the clients LVLT is a fortune company that serves customers in more than markets across countries Core network

also provides colocation and datacenter services and voice services for local and enterprise customers Together these segments generated of the revenue for Level during Regarding the revenue model the company charges on usage basis or charges a contractual amount Contract based compensation is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract As of year ended weighted average contract period was around years see the annual report Usage based revenue allows LVLT to benefit from the growing need of increased bandwidth and IP traffic growth Transformation of enterprises from legacy to efficient scalable and secure technologies that can address the need for bandwidth and IP traffic growth will be the primary driver of LVLTs performance The company pointed out in its recent annual report that enterprise bandwidth and content delivery were among the largest contributors for its top line growth Anyhow our buy thesis for LVLT is as follows Level is moving into enterprise and is less focused on wholesale The company had pdf enterprise customers as of first quarter ended of the companys revenue came from enterprises during the same period Enterprises are shifting to fiber in order to cater to consumers bandwidth needs Adoption of cloud computing is also helping LVLTs growth story Enterprises are opting for offpremise cloud solution and hence requiring high bandwidth and high security private connections All in all the growth of data consumption efficiency of networks and network security is driving the need for advanced network solutions Level will benefit from this trend as indicated by its high proportion of revenue from enterprise customers Internet delivery of video content bodes well for Level Internet is the prevailing mode of content distribution including software audio and video Level gets to benefit from this as it operates an extensive proportion of global networks enabling this delivery The company has an extensive fiber network that connects three continents The company also owns route miles pdf of undersea optical cables LVLTs fiber network is in markets covering route miles The company has an inherent cost advantage amid ownership of network assets CDN and cloud connect solutions of the company look promising Cloud connect is attractive for enterprises as it offers private and secure connection for enterprises to connect to web scale cloud service One of the many reasons enterprises hesitate using an offpremise cloud solution is the security of the interconnection Level s Cloud connect offers that to enterprises Global Switch recently added LVLTs Cloud Connect to its portfolio Overall security will remain a high selling point for Cloud Connect Regarding the companys content delivery network video delivery over the internet is becoming main stream Global coverage is a very strong selling point for Level s CDN Despite low barriers to entry in the video streaming business international expansion can be a problem LVLTs content delivery network can be very attractive for streaming players requiring scale LVLTs CDN gives broadcasters a larger reach It can also result in cost efficiencies for broadcasters Southern Cloud is relying on Level to distribute streamed media services Moreover BWM recently entered into an agreement to use Level s CDN across its dealership network Level will witness integration related benefits from its recent tw telecom acquisition million EBITDA savings are expected from this acquisition Additionally the company also expects million in capital expenditure savings Further the company expects to achieve of EBITDA savings within months of the closing NPV of synergies is expected to be billion that alone translates to a increase in the stock price The point is that revenue growth alongside cost savings will lead to substantial earnings growth during the next year or so We believe earnings growth will be the number one catalyst for LVLTs stock appreciation in the near future Not only this tw telecoms acquisition tripled Level s network footprint within North America Industry is witnessing growth which is a positive for LVLT IP traffic will grow threefold over the next five years Metro traffic will surpass long haul traffic in Content delivery will carry half of the internets traffic by Broadband speeds will double by and business traffic IP will grow at a CAGR of between and All this is according to Ciscos recent forecast Moreover the video CDN market is expected to grow at pa during Level s extensive networks expose the company to the growing trends of the internet With its vast optic network LVLT is well positioned for broadband explosion says Leslie P Norton According to Barrons financial newspaper Level Communications Inc could rise in the next year as it is well positioned to benefit from an expected tripling in broadband usage in the coming years There are several other reasons to support LVLTs growth story among those mentioned above The company recently increased its full year revenue and cash flow guidance Average interest rates for the company are coming down yearly GAAP interest outlook is revised to million as compared to million previously The company has always been a leader in deploying new technologies including global MLPS IPV VoIP and a converged IP solution It also holds patents and patent application ranging from data and voice to content distribution LVLT is a very decent bet to invest in the growth of the internet Why then are investors not seeing this As a matter of fact investors are somewhat appreciating LVLTs position The stock trades at times forward earnings while the SP stands at However the market is not fully acknowledging LVLTs potential as it is still thought to be a legacy company relying on wholesale with execution problems In reality the company has beaten consensus despite currency headwinds And its no longer a wholesale business Its wholesale enable scale which the company is using to serve enterprise customers mostly in the growing IP data services and transport and fiber services Once the market fully understands that the benefits of content delivery over the internet can be more beneficial for Level than they are for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the stock will take off In fact we believe Level is going to outperform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in terms of stock price during the next few years Both the companies are positively correlated to the growth of internet distribution of video but only Level has the luxury of high barriers to entry and economies of scale Lets analyze why LVLT will outperform NFLX over the next two or three years Good news already bakedin for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>growth stock they say For starters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>already had a decent run in the past couple of years Justified or not the stock is up since This could mean that positives like anticipated growth in subscribers and international expansion is already factored in by the market Looking forward the stock trades at astronomical levels Forward PE stands at Bulls tout <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a growth stock Lets see how much of a growth stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is as compared to Level Despite advocating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with lofty price targets why is Wall Street reluctant to increase projected earnings The answer is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is quite sensitive to a miss and even Wall Street is not sure about the earnings growth And their uncertainty is justified The company is adding subscribers but it has to show earnings growth at some point in time which is not possible in the near future at least Why Lets find out The company has a subscription based model which is good for retaining subscribers but the company is missing out on a very lucrative advertising market From where do the giants of internet generate their revenue And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt plan to bring advertising to its platform anytime soon The company supports a very high cost structure with a high variable proportion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has to pay for original content interconnections and infrastructure improvement as the company expands The companys trailing twelvemonth operating margin is just And it is not expected to get better The company is expanding internationally which entails additional costs Regarding international expansion Europe may be the last successful venture for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Emerging markets pose several challenges including low average disposable income content relevance and piracy There is literally no control over piracy and torrent based delivery in emerging markets So meaningful revenues from emerging markets are for now out of question Then there is competition There are quite low barriers to entry and large media houses are already offering streaming services HBO Hulu and Sling are just a few competitors And competition is intense Daredevil is no Game of Thrones Quality of HBOs original programming is quite higher than others Sling is bundling channel streaming which is a very compelling selling point International markets competitive dynamic is totally different Local players are better positioned to offer relevant content to the public in those markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has to deploy additional resources to offer more relevant programming which entails more costs To review meaningful margin expansion for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not possible in the next few years amid high cost structure variable nature of costs high content costs lack of advertising competition and international challenges To add to the problems of the company the CEO promised meaningful margin expansion in and beyond Based on the current scenario it is not possible for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to bring down the PE multiple to a reasonable level with its current earnings growth estimates And when the company fails to deliver on its promise the stock will tank The market is mispricing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as it is just focusing on subscriber growth while completely ignoring the costs of acquiring subscribers Catalysts that will eventually hurt Netflixs stock include the rising interest rate environment slowdown in subscriber growth which is just around the corner and earnings miss Back to why LVLT is better than NFLX As mentioned above costs are mostly variable for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>In contrast Level can benefit from economies of scale as it owns most of the assets it operates Growth in IP traffic including video can positively impact the companys margins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has to pay interconnect fees and transit fees to network service providers As transit and interconnect fees are priced per MB they add no economies of scale for NFLX that can arise from more traffic LVLT gets higher fees due to more traffic while Netflixs margins remain under check due to the variable nature of pricing In conclusion IP traffic growth helps LVLTs margin while having no positive effect on Netflixs margins This is one of the reasons to own LVLT instead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in order to benefit from internet traffic growth Demand for higher bandwidth is also not exactly good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The company has to make capital investments in order to deliver K content etc On the other hand LVLT can benefit from high bandwidth demand as most of the companys infrastructure is already in place Even if LVLT has to upgrade its network it is charging a variable fee which is correlated to the demand Netflixs subscriber growth may not move in perfect correlation with bandwidth demand So LVLT is a better bet to capitalize on the demand of high bandwidth going forward Increasing competition in the streaming business can hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>over the longer run But for LVLT the more the merrier LVLT gets to charge transit fees or even provide CDN services to competing streaming players Healthy growth prospects of video streaming and internet TV will attract more players which will benefit LVLT but is not good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>All in all competition in internet streaming can add to the top line of LVLT In the above table LVLT is assumed to grow at pa while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is expected to grow at pa Note that analysts are expecting earnings growth for LVLT and growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Despite that we choose a higher growth rate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and a lower rate for LVLT The table depicts that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be trading at times its earnings by if the stock maintains its current price Now the companys CEO says that meaningful profits are expected in As expansion is going to be complete by the end of it is improbable that the company will maintain a growth rate beyond just by cost cutting methods in a high cost business Not to mention expansion into emerging markets will put pressure on the companys margin Even if we choose a multiple of for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in the present value of its stock price comes around indicating that the stock is priced at an extremely dangerous level Regarding LVLT a multiple of gives a price target with more than upside Note that we used a earnings growth assumption while analysts are expecting pa growth during the next five years Therefore the upside would be much higher Internet traffic is set to grow in the coming years thanks to delivery of content over the internet and adoption of cloud The market is putting a very high price on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>due to the companys exposure to internet TV growth We believe that Level is a better play than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as it can benefit from the growth of overall IP traffic not just internet TV Competition in internet TV will benefit LVLT and hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Demand for bandwidth will benefit LVLT while increasing Netflixs capital investments Rising interest rate environment is also not good for stocks with lofty prices like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Finally all the traffic will benefit LVLT whether coming from HBO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or Sling All in all Level will benefit from the positives of internet TV growth while avoiding the negatives like high costs of original content and competition Therefore if one wants to ride the internet TV bandwagon an indirect play like Level is worth considering As for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>there are too many problems ranging from disproportionate valuation unclear visibility on margin expansion competition and international challenges In a nutshell buy Level dump <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>No Thanks Well Have Level
