stock rise I apologize for criticizing an article that predicted such price behavior Nonetheless NFLXs rise has more to do with multiple expansion than growing into its valuation Indeed most market sectors have experienced such multiple expansion In June I took exception to overly bullish analysts appraisals of tech stocks choosing as my foil an article written by Alex Cho on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX I purposely left out Alexs name from my article since I was just using his article as one example of many but given how the stock has performed since then I think I owe him this public apology While his ultimate NFLX target market cap of B hasnt yet been reached he was certainly right about the stocks direction while I was completely wrong That said and without diminishing the apology I have to say that in rereading both articles Im still of my original opinion though Ive been stopped out of my NFLX short to focus on other companies which in my opinion are even more overvalued With the apology issued I think its illustrative to look at how NFLX has garnered its current B market cap both as an end in itself and to help readers appreciate the general change in market valuations that I discuss in the closing section of this article How Did We Get Here Under Appreciated Business Model or Multiple Expansion A key element in Alexs valuation case was projecting a year CAGR on revenues and a net profitability of on the terminal year revenue number One year later how close are we to achieving these targets Keep in mind that at least for the revenue growth number its much easier to hit high growth percentages in earlier periods than in later ones if for no other reason than the size of the potential remaining market and the law of large numbers Yet NFLX doesnt appear to be on a year trajectory anywhere close to CAGR on revenues The profit margin is even more distant but I understand that the bull retort is simply we grow market then we rake in incredible profits I personally take the word incredible literally in this case Revenue growth and profitability dont yet seem to substantiate the stocks meteoric rise but what about other metrics Perhaps the single most important valuation metric is PCF as well see below but that certainly doesnt argue in NFLXs favor Indeed the stock is trading at lifetime highs on this measure excluding periods where cash flow was negative If not cash flows what about sales book value or earnings ratios Again none of these metrics suggest that NFLX has grown into its valuation instead all of the important metrics indicate that NFLXs current price is simply due to bull market multiple expansion That said and before we look at the markets multiples there is an area in which NFLX is demonstrating real advances Employee Productivity as a Sign That NFLX is Extremely WellManaged In contrast to many companies that I short NFLX has proved itself very adept at increasing employee productivity as evidenced by the next two graphs Whether NFLXs management prowess can translate into longterm profits is an open question but certainly these two graphs have to give bears pause It turns out that Netflixs rising stock price AND rising valuation multiples despite decreasing revenue growth and minimal profit margin is actually typical of todays market The two figures below particularly the second are the best depiction of this process that Ive seen in a number of years The source article is worth reading for these two graphics alone Two points emerge from a study of NFLXs multiples and that of the markets generally First todays market is trading at multiples much higher than it has in at least years Were fundamentals to remain constant but multiples contract to historical averages the market would undergo a substantial downdraft All investors should be cautious as a result Second given that multiple expansions havent impacted all sectors equally my plan going forward is to focus my valuation shorts in the sectors whose multiples are highest today biotech software services and consumer services Accordingly if NFLX rises closer to the top of my valuation screens I may reinitiate a short in it Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself
