The two figures below, particularly the second, are the best depiction of this process that I've seen in a number of years.The source article is worth reading for these two graphics alone.Two points emerge from a study of NFLX's multiples and that of the markets generally.First, today's market is trading at multiples much higher than it has in at least 10 years.Were fundamentals to remain constant, but multiples contract to historical averages, the market would undergo a substantial downdraft.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All investors should be cautious as a result. (Uncertainty) </span>Second, given that multiple expansions haven't impacted all sectors equally, my plan going forward is to focus my valuation shorts in the 3 sectors whose multiples are highest today: biotech; software & services; and consumer services.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Accordingly, if NFLX rises closer to the top of my valuation screens, I may re-initiate a short in it.
