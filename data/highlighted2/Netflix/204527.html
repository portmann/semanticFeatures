Things I Like About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>And Its Stock Right Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha NFLX is now down about over the last five sessions visibly in correction mode Such losses create better longterm opportunity something that NFLX has been lacking In todays market theres not a lot to get excited about especially for high beta momentum stocks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX However even as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares now sit off alltime highs including a near loss during the last five sessions there are two things that I really like regarding both the company and its stock right now Last Thursday just before the bottom dropped out of the market and Netflixs stock price cinemablendcom noticed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is hiking its prices from to per month in Europe and from to in Switzerland <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CEO Reed Hastings has noted several times that as content costs rise as will prices Still <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has been very slow to hike prices probably because of how poorly investors responded back in Nonetheless back in July I explained that even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>were to top million worldwide members it would still have a hard time supporting its valuation with fundamentals Thats unless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>raises prices substantially This is a company whose content costs continue to soar and its high profit DVD rental business continues to dwindle If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>ever wants to be a highly profitable company that supports its valuation it must raise prices Therefore I am happy to see the company implementing higher prices for new subscribers and more importantly exploring a price hike for ongoing customers after oneyear as reported by cinemablendcom That said I discussed why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to raise prices in that first linked article above but just to reiterate the reasons here The US is renowned for having the highest cable prices around as other areas in the globe have cable prices that are half to as much as the US Netflixs largest market is the US and it is missing an opportunity to better align its prices domestically with that of cable prices As explained in my first article if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>earns just per month from million peak subscribers thats only billion a year in revenue Sooner or later Netflixs yearoveryear growth will slow as its subscriber count increases and the company will have a hard time supporting a billion valuation with slower growth low margins and limited peak upside beyond billion in revenue However if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>hikes its prices or even over time its peak revenue rises by the same degree Seeing as how itll be difficult to implement such a hike overnight <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to get on the ball with increasing prices both here in the US and around the globe Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>increased prices from to in the US and I am happy to see it doing so in other parts of the world With that said talks of peak revenue and a billion valuation brings up the second thing I like about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>right now Its stock is trading lower Prior to the markets recent correction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was approaching a market capitalization of billion Based on my earlier analysis if Netflixs peak fundamentals couldnt support billion then it sure couldnt support billion longterm This means that stock upside was minimum shortterm and longterm investors were likely to suffer However with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>falling over the last five sessions and now priced under its market capitalization is now billion While still very expensive I like that Netflixs stock is moving in a direction to where it could create better shareholder value All things considered I still think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is too expensive but I really like the company I am glad to see price hikes and if it gets cheap enough Id be the first to jump on the stock Even with fiveday losses of plus I still dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is cheap enough to buy but I do think the perfect sequence of events are lining up to push <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>lower thereby making it a good investment Netflixs stock is up over the last five years and still up more than this year alone Hence if the market keeps falling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will likely keep underperforming as investors tend to sell their winners first and momentum stocks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are usually the first to go In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may have hiked prices in the US last year but relative to cable prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>remains very cheap domestically compared to the rest of the world and also in comparison to competing streaming services like HBO and Sling TV This leads me to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will announce a much larger price hike sooner rather than later perhaps one that prices its services closer to Sling TV and its prices in Europe around per month That would still be very cheap but it would instantly improve Netflixs peak potential while more than likely leading to further stock losses In other words I am hoping that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to raise prices and that its stock goes much lower like lower Thats not because I am a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bear or want to see the company fail but rather I do like the company and if the price is right I want to own <span style='background-color:
