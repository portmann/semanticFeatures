content costs have risen to B Their content library has shrunk over with content costs doubling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is now purchasing complete content rights packages versus streaming only a la HBO When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX first burst on the scene with its streaming service in it was hailed as an innovative disrupter that was going to transform the media industry And to a large degree it did just that Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is transforming once again but this time its from a disrupter to just another media company Its no secret that we believe the threat of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is overblown and we own several traditional media companies Time Warner NYSE TWX TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA Scripps Network Interactive NASDAQ SNI and Viacom NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB in our portfolios So I thought I would again share some of our research into why we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is essentially becoming just another premium service like HBO Starz or Showtime Sure it will be an extremely successful premium service but still more like a traditional media company then the innovative disrupter it once was The crux of this thesis lies in Netflixs content strategy Years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gave users an alternative to a traditional television bundle As of January st <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had almost movies and over TV series available data from AllFlickscom That is easily enough content for a person who isnt particularly interested in live sports to cut the cord and ditch their cable bundle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gave users a choice Access a ton of on demand content for to a month or pay to per month or a different bundle of content some on demand some linear Its easy to see why a lot of people made the switch There is no way you can possible watch all the titles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has or all the shows on your cable bundle so why not just get the cheapest option But over the years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>started to change As the years went on content costs become much more expensive After realizing the threat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>posed many content licensees started demanding higher rates and longer exclusivity windows Additionally competitors such as Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Prime and the media industry funded and owned Hulu started bidding up content prices Hulu recently outbid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for Seinfeld and Empire In FY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spent B on content By FY that number had jumped to B Except that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wasnt buying more content they were actually buying less content From FY to FY the number of titles in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>library shrunk by yet the cost per title more than doubled to M As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content library shrinks in size it is going to become less of an alternative to the traditional cable bundle and more of an addon service By contrast HBO has a content library of around titles for HBO Go As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to prune its library and approach the size of HBOs library its going to become more and more like HBO and other premium services The process isnt going to happen overnight but if it stays anywhere close to the annual reduction rate its library will shrink to the size of HBOs very soon Indeed we are even seeing more similarities with Netflixs new focus on original content Again like HBO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has begun sourcing original exclusive content At first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>only purchased streaming rights for original shows with limited exclusivity windows For example House of Cards a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>original can now be found on other services Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has changed to buying more expensive expanded rights just like HBO does rather than streaming only rights <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is transitioning to a new business model similar to HBO a smaller but more expensive library with a large amount of exclusive original programming For investors in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the million dollar question is what happens to the premium multiple that Netflixs stock currently gets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has traded at well above market multiples based on its tremendous growth potential and status as an innovative disrupter But what happens to that multiple once and if it becomes just another premium service For comparison purposes the chart below shows the TTM PE for all the major media companies Comcast the cablemedia hybrid was excluded and for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is indeed becoming HBO then investors should be very worried about the multiple attached to Netflixs earnings stream when that future arrives Disclosure I amwe are long VIAB FOXA TWX SNI I wrote this article
