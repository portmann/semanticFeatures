class='textDiv'>Why Amazon Prime Is A Juggernaut Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Amazon can leverage its existing international consumer audience billion monthly visits globally to build the Amazon Prime sub base globally Including costsavings from free shipping we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is more than more expensive on an annual basis than Amazon Amazon can leverage IMDBs size and international popularity to generate traffic to its Instant Video segment as the feature becomes offered in more and more countries internationally HDTV penetration is much higher in the US than other countries and we believe this negates the HD advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>enjoys in the US Amazon Prime is creating the first Internet onestopshop a central location where visitors can do all things Internet on one platform We recently wrote an article detailing why Amazon NASDAQ AMZN had a significant competitive advantage in Japan over streaming rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX The two companies will make excursions into the Japanese market within the next month We believe the competitive advantage Amazon will benefit from in Japan is internationally transferable and gives Amazon significant leverage in international markets While we do not believe Amazons significant leverage will dramatically hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>until Amazon Instant Videos library can reasonably compete with Netflixs streaming content we believe it does position Amazon Prime as an international juggernaut According to Similar Web analytics Amazoncom gets roughly billion unique visits globally per month This makes Amazoncom the th most visited website in the world and the most visited shopping website in the world Visitors to the website also visit with a purpose and are among some of the most engaged audiences on the web Visitors spend an average of minutes and seconds per visit and scroll through roughly pages per visit A low bounce rate means that users are engaging with a high number of the pages they visit It is important to note here that these are visits to simply Amazoncom Amazon operates under several different domains specific to countries of operation Amazonde the companys Germanspecific website generates roughly million visits per month and is the third most visited shopping website in the world and the fifth most visited overall website in Germany Amazons UK domain receives roughly million visits per month and is the sixth most visited shopping website in the world and the eighth most visited overall website in the UK Amazons Japan domain receives roughly million visits per month and is the seventh most visited shopping website in the world and seventh most visited overall website in Japan All told Amazon generates traffic upwards of billion global visits per month to its online platforms The US accounts for of Amazoncoms billion monthly visits and a rough average of rough average of US traffic share on foreign domains of the remaining million of the traffic through other Amazon domains That equates to the US accounting for just around million of the billion global visits per month or The US accounts for less than of the online traffic to Amazon This means that or roughly million visits per month of the online traffic to Amazon is from foreign countries We believe Amazon can leverage these million international monthly visits to generate mass market adoption of Amazon Prime in international markets As Amazon continues to bundle features into its annual Prime subscription market adoption of Prime should be even further strengthened In Japan for example Prime will cost only per year versus Netflixs subscription price of to per year and these rates do not account for the money saved through Free Shipping offered in the Prime subscription On prices we believe Amazon Prime is much more favorably priced than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>even in the US In the US Prime is offered for per year while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will cost users per year To understand the magnitude of costsavings via free shipping Amazon reported million in shipping revenues in Q Roughly of sales were from North America so transferring that North America mix to net shipping revenues we arrive at a rough estimate of million in US shipping revenue in Q In the same quarter million US consumers bought something online If we assume every single one of those people bought something from Amazon that equates to an annualized rate of around in shipping per online shopper In reality not all US online shoppers in the quarter shopped at Amazon but we believe this assumption is offset by the fact that not all North American revenues are from the US so we believe the shipping revenue per shopper is as good an estimate as possible For more comparable services of streaming content then the price difference in the US can be seen as roughly per year for Amazon versus per year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>meaning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is more than more expensive on a comparable annual basis Prime also includes music and photo content that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does not include so the true comparable prices are actually more skewed in favor of Amazons cheapness streaming video content vs streaming video content A lesserknown but nonetheless poignant advantage of Amazon Prime Instant Video over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is IMDB The International Movie Database or IMDB was acquired by Amazon in It is a place where individuals can browse rate comment on view show times and release dates of and discuss movies and television shows Most importantly for Amazon Prime Instant Video though IMDB provides links to watching streaming movies online Seeing as IMDB is owned by Amazon the only links provided are Amazon Instant Video links Each movies page will tell the browser if that movie is or is not available on Amazon Instant Video and provides a link to watching the movie on Amazing Instant Video if it is available The same goes for TV shows There exist significant synergies here Amazoncom is the top destination site for those visiting IMDBcom and IMDBcom is among the top referring sites for Amazoncom This means a significant amount of IMDBs traffic flows through to Amazon Instant Video IMDB is no small website either The website generates million global monthly visits making it the nd most popular website in the United States and th most popular overall website in the world More importantly though IMDB is the number one movie website in the world This is because IMDB has a huge international presence Like Amazon less than of is internet traffic comes from the US Only of IMDBs internet traffic is from the US By comparison rival movie website Rotten Tomatoes which features links to all streaming content providers including both Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>generates less than of the traffic of IMDB and is much more centralized in the US Amazon can leverage IMDBs size and international popularity to generate traffic to its Instant Video segment as the feature becomes offered in more and more countries internationally We believe this is a significant competitive advantage that will generate substantial traffic We see users being attracted to this model in the sameway consumers prefer to shop at onestopshops In many ways Amazon and its online platform are becoming the Internets first onestopshop through diverse shopping categories video streaming services video recommendation and rating services music content photo storage and more The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Advantage HD and Exclusive Content While Amazon has a larger content library than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has more HD offerings HDTV penetration reached of US homes in That number has grown since according to Ofcom Consumer Research who found that of US homes had an HDTV in HDTV is clearly ingrained in American society and has become the standard Accordingly nonHD streaming is an issue for a majority of Americans and Netflixs larger HD portfolio is considerably more attractive than Amazons smaller HD portfolio in the US This is not the case in other countries Outside of Spain Austria and the United Kingdom other nations have a considerably lower HDTV household penetration rate than the US Italy only has HDTV penetration while Germany France and China have and respectively Japan comes in at a startlingly low We believe this lowerthanUS HDTV household penetration will buy Amazon some valuable time to increase its HD portfolio We do not forecast a smaller HD portfolio as a hindrance to Prime subs in countries outside of the UK Spain and Austria given low HDTV household penetration We also affirm however that HDTV is growing in popularity globally and that Amazon must increase its HD portfolio in the longterm to retain Prime subs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does have a distinct advantage in terms of exclusive content Amazon is attempting to expand its exclusive content portfolio but the popularity of Netflixexclusive shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black makes it difficult for Amazon to compete on exclusive content It is estimated that Amazon Prime has roughly million subs in the US Those million members spend on average more than x the nonPrime Amazon customer on Amazoncom Timothy Stenovec at The Huffington Post had this to say about Amazon Prime users Prime is creating all of these loyal Amazon customers that increasingly look to Amazon before they go anywhere else Michael Levin a partner at CIRP told The Huffington Post People arent even going to the retail outlets Theyre starting at Amazon As we said earlier Amazon Prime is creating the first Internet onestopshop a location where visitors can do all things Internet on one platform We see this nextgen Internet onestopshop as having huge upside and believe Amazon Prime may a bigger juggernaut than most currently believe Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
