class='textDiv'>The Reasons Im Short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Irrational Valuation And A Broken Model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha The net book value of Netflixs rights to stream content are just b vs its b market cap This seems to make no economic sense Domestic profits and FCF are reaching maturity Perpetually negative FCF internationally regulatory hurdles and vast regional differences ensure that economies of scale on contentmarketing investment will not develop like they did domestically Investors are capitalizing hope Continued negative FCF will force the company to raise debt in while its market captonet debt ratio plummets likely causing expensive changes in its capital mix I have a material short position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX by way of June puts with a strike price purchased for a contract on January th when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was trading at share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has billion of content streaming rights assets financed by billion of content streaming rights liabilities for a net balance sheet investment in content streaming rights of billion This compares to Netflixs current enterprise value of billion Think about that the market is valuing billion of book value investment in limited life rights to stream content at billion billion at share Further consider this Netflixs cumulative PL spend on marketing technology and GA for the last five years was billion Add this to the billion above and add billion for Netflixs fixed assets and arguably <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can be recreated for about billion in capital Why are investors paying billion for this in the stock market Some would argue its because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has competitive advantages growth runway and future profitability at scale Maybe Netflixs business cant be recreated or competed with and therefore is worth more than the historical cost of all of its business investments Even if you could recreate and compete maybe there can be more than one winner If this is your argument consider this In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>started the year with gross content rights of billion and bought an additional billion in new content for a total of billion of content with streaming value in the year It amortized billion of that content in roughly a third of the gross content Prior years were even higher suggesting that content amortizes very quickly as perhaps reason would dictate Also in roughly billion of the content rights acquired in the year were amortized within the year Two things should be apparent when thinking about these numbers in the context of the streaming business model making content investments is a never ending treadmill getting faster every year challenging the notion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will achieve content leverage especially internationally and there is nothing magical about Netflixs content library that others cannot replicate and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has no special access to purchasing or developing content that others cannot do as well That billion market value should seem less and less economically plausible It is clear that US growth is maturing It does though have a positive contribution margin the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>defines it ignoring technology and admin costs and has some economies of scale on its domestic content library And this stands to reason the domestic market by definition is a generally homogeneous audience requiring maintenance of just one fairly welldefined content mixlibrary making subscriber adds very profitable at the margin Projecting lower mature domestic growth and profitability into the future can be done with reasonable visibility and there is some value in that cash flow if you ignore technology and admin costs even if there is some competition domestically But it is unlikely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have the same experience worldwide every region and country are obviously vastly different and therefore to grow worldwide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will require multiple and vastly diverse content mixeslibraries The international growth in topline is impressive but there is no evidence that there will be the same content marketing and technology cost economies of scale in the out years making discounting the future cash flows a garbagein garbageout modeling exercise at best In its Ks for and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>disclosed the value of its streaming rights broken out by domestic and international segments It stopped this practice in lumping domestic and international streaming assets together It seems plausible that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does not want users of its financial statements to be able to calculate international revenue per dollar of international content investment It also appears that the long investor in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not considering or discounting the complexity of regulation customer tastes and viewing habits disposable incomes and internet infrastructure that are already creating challenges for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>that it diddoes not face domestically creating more operational risk and a wider set of potential outcomes for the international business With billion in revenue in the international business is roughly half the size of the domestic business with a contribution profit of negative million and its cumulative contribution losses are now billion before accounting for content investment When the domestic business last generated roughly the same revenue billion in it had a contribution profit of million It is abundantly clear that the international business while its topline growth is impressive has vastly different economics The market value today is capitalizing hope Aside the QA on pages and of Netflixs Q Earnings Call Transcript are revealing in terms of the struggles the company faces on the issues of return on content investment and international expansion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>currently has billion in longterm debt and has million in annual interest costs Its debtEBIT is roughly x and its interest coverage EBITinterest is x Its free cash flow is negative Lenders and shareholders are clearly giving the company a pass in the short term And the companys CEO Reed Hastings touts the companys market captonet debt ratio as evidence of the companys financial strength and cushion If one financial metric doesnt look so good just point to another one Besides being an irrelevant metric relying on the market captonet debt ratio to justify your financial strength is dangerous One day your market cap may not be there to bail you out and it has shrunk by roughly billion in just two short months Netflixs management has stated that given its increasing investments in native content increasing purchases of thirdparty content and continuing negative operating cash flows that the company will need to raise additional debt in Q shareolder letter page Perhaps another billion by any reasonable estimate Will lenders play ball On what terms Will the company have to raise additional equity At what valuation What will the market reaction be This is not a range of outcomes that I want to be long on in Reed seems to be a fairly well respected executive and is responsible for Netflixs operational success to date That said I want to explore a couple of comments made in an interview with Reed conducted in November by Andrew Ross Sorkin of CNBC at the annual Dealbook conference in New York The interview is highly recommended for longs and shorts and for me some of the things Reed articulates reveals at best his naivety and at worst stock promotion At around the minute mark Sorkin challenges Reed on the investments in content and plans for debt issuance planned for the upcoming year and then reads him a quote from David Einhorn from a recent Greenlight Capital investor letter but apparently Red Ink is the New Black whether the spending proves successful wont be known during the investment horizon of most <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shareholders In todays market the best performing stocks are companies with exciting stories where accountability is in the distant future Reed first reaffirms his belief in the market captonet debt ratio as the indicator of his companys health which I have addressed above But then he goes on He uses the companys free cash flow losses and its billion valuation as evidence of longterm orientation of his shareholder base Sure according to Morningstar of the shares are held by institutions and funds but this means the balance is the true float thats establishing market value That float is approximately million shares and with average daily volume of over million shares the float turns over every five days To me this is where Reed reveals his naivety He goes on to say if there is any shorttermism its providing great liquidity Who cares It does help with insider selling I suppose According to insider activity tracking firm INK Research in the last months directors and officers including Reed have sold shares worth a total of million I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
