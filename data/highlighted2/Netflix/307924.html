and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>went into Sundance a year after being spurned and made a big splash No matter how strong the streaming networks have become the traditional route is still seen as the preferred method to ensure awards consideration While the traditional studios are still in control overall the streamers are laying the groundwork to make it a closer race When it comes to Sundance traditionally traditional studios dominate but this year marked a stark change in the dichotomy as Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX made their presence felt Keep in mind this was not a gradual takeover but was a sudden and calculated approach designed to show they werent backing down and it worked For all the success the streamers have had the companys executives havent been able to make all the deals theyve wanted Simply put it was because they werent taken seriously at the bargaining table and executives knew that needed to change This year the pair went in and with tactical skill achieved all their goals well almost all their goals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>pounced on six pictures including in a strategic move buying up a bunch before the festival even opened That haul included films starring Ellen Page Tallulah Paul Rudd The Fundamentals of Caring and an ensemblebased foreign cast Under The Shadow that has earned rave reviews The total cost for the three is well north of million The network has said it expects to spend upwards of billion on content in basically its way of saying that money wasnt a problem What is a problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>though is the widowing effect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is adamant its films go dayanddate with its streaming service meaning there is no window between theatrical and SVOD release Theaters hate that As a result the big theaters boycott those films aside from the more independent ones that usually thrive on more arthouse releases For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>that doesnt make a difference because as long as the films screen in one theater in New York and Los Angeles to qualify for awards season its mission is accomplished Its also important to note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>mainly went after the streaming rights for these new acquisitions meaning sales agents could attempt to sell theatrical rights down the road Of course the problem is that no studio is going to spend massive amounts of money on a film they know will be turned away by larger chains because a streamer aired it first Now contrast that with Amazon The company is looking to spend billion this year and it too made a big splash with six acquisitions including drama Manchester By The Sea Sea stars Casey Affleck and is produced by Matt Damon The cost to Amazon was million and represents its largestever deal at the festival Amazon is different though as its executives are willing to work with the theaters to create a window for theaters to get its films before hitting their service While this is obviously more appealing for theaters the fact remains the ultimate goal is for the film to stream for free after a small set period While that sounds similar to how traditional films work the difference is the windows for those studio releases are much larger with various carveouts and caveats attached Amazons first film released under its partial window model ChiRaq ended up running into the same problems as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Theaters were not receptive to any sort of smaller exclusivity window The company will of course keep trying and tweaking its model as it should having purchased both the theatrical and streaming rights to its purchased films It will look for a strategic partner to try and find a balance with theater owners especially with regard to Manchester It is important to remember whether you want to admit it or not that the traditional model while facing steep competition is still in control of Hollywood Producers want to make a film profit off that film and then if applicable see it run the awards table So far those options arent available at the same level if you pick a streaming partner Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon share the same end goal and thats to win an Oscar These companies have successfully invaded the Emmys and now they have their sight set on the Oscars The difference is that the Oscars have proven to be a harder nut to crack That brings us to the traditional studios which also made news with a few key pickups none more so than Fox FOX FOXA That leads to a company like Fox ironically becoming the disruptor to the disruptor Last year Amazon famously tried to buy the rights to Brooklyn but was rebuffed Producers opted to go to Foxs specialty division Fox Searchlight because they wanted a chance for the film to get more exposure through a theatrical run and be taken more seriously during awards season Brooklyn was produced for million and has since earned over million It also snagged nominations from many top award groups and guilds including three highprofile ones at the Oscars Best Picture Best Actress Best Screenplay As for the Oscars yes its not likely to win but it is still in contention which is a win in itself In fact it is the only Sundancesold film from last years festival to score nominations in a top category Fox used that success to swoop in and buy this years it film Birth Of A Nation even though its team didnt present the highest bid That designation went to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which bid million million more than Fox but was turned down because the filmmaker Nate Parker wanted the film exposed more to the masses Parker recognized that with Birth having a life in theaters it had a better shot at being seen as an awards contender Birth was the one film that got away the one target neither studio could acquire Now let me be clear I dont want to imply the men and women behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazons film teams are not capable of successfully challenging the traditional model because thats simply nowhere near the truth These are experienced and talented individuals who know how to play the awards game but they need more time to succeed and this showing at Sundance will certainly help them Right now we are stuck between two competing trains of thought with the question being Which film will be the one that changes the balance This years Sundance proved a tipping point is coming but the exact time frame remains hazy Author payment page view Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of
