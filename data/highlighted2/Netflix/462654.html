style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported a slowdown in subscriber growth for Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX has ceased to be a momentum upward stock and is entering a period of correction in which its earnings and valuation converge to a more sensible PE The share price trend is mostly downhill from the peak in Along this slippery slope sudden cliffs may appear as large institutional investors abandon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as no longer disruptive In January I wrote the article Have We Already Seen Peak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>pointing to the recent share price history as a possible indication that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had peaked late in the year As the chart above shows the share price has continued to trend down With the Q earnings report investors have much more in the way of confirmation of the Peak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>thesis As I pointed out in January underlying the success of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a momentum stock has been the fact that subscriber additions was a metric that anyone could understand As long as subscribers were added at a constant pace the share price rose accordingly That all came to a crashing halt with the Q subscriber data Total subscriber additions came in well below the forecast of million at million This represents a dramatic rolloff in growth rate as the chart below shows During the conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management offered a number of rationalizations for the shortfall It was claimed that churn was higher due to higher service fees being charged especially in the US as existing subscribers were ungrandfathered CEO Reed Hastings reiterated his belief that the shortfall was not due to competition even though domestic subscriptions nearly flatlined His vision is that the market even in the US is far from saturated and he continues to maintain that there is plenty of room for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its myriad competitors including virtual MVPDs Multichannel Video Programming Distributors such as Dish Networks NASDAQ DISH SlingTV along with SVOD providers such as Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Instant Video and Hulu Hastings seems to see streaming services in the same vein as the broadcast and cable networks In the old broadcast distribution model consumers had access or bought access to a number of different channels often at a multiple of the cost of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Hastings also stated the intention to continue to grow the proportion of original content on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Its clear that he sees content becoming primarily original just as in the case of the traditional network and cable channels So In Hastings view there would be little mutual exclusivity involved in the competition between the SVODs Consumers would buy all or most of them in order to select their preferred content Theres a problem with this thesis however The problem is that theres already far more content on the major SVODs than most people can watch Most consumers will not choose to buy additional SVOD services that they dont need So in effect the SVODs and virtual MPVDs are competing That competitive impact is already being felt in the US market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may already have reached a plateau in US subscribers As of January I had not foreseen the subscriber rolloff effect but now that its starting to manifest it makes the Peak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>thesis all the more compelling Most of my attention in January was focused on the fact that operating income and net income before taxes had also appeared to peak back in as the chart below shows Income appears to have recovered in but its still off the Q peak Revenue growth is still healthy at yy to billion but operating income is down yy to million The sequential improvement in operating income was due to a smaller operating loss overseas I had expressed concern about the increasing cost of servicing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>debt about million per quarter This is still a significant problem and accounts for much of the gap between operating income and net income before taxes Unfortunately this is only going to get worse as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management has indicated that it will continue to increase debt in order to fund original content The need to sustain growth in overseas markets will probably continue to limit operating income I dont see it recovering to the level any time soon And of course nonGAAP free cash flow continues to be negative at million for the quarter The profligate spending of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would all make sense if it was faced with negligible competition The spending is predicated on unlimited growth But were already seeing signs that the growth of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is probably very limited Its not that I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is doomed Far from it It has a strong product offering and is a leader in its industry But that industry is maturing rapidly Just about everyone has figured out by now that the Internet is the future of content distribution of all types The mainstream media companies are moving rapidly to fill the void that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had all to itself Under the best case scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>grows into its valuation But even in this scenario the stock doesnt appreciate significantly Unfortunately I dont see the best case scenario as being likely I think its far more likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will fail to live up to the lofty expectations of investors and the share price will correct accordingly Those corrections are likely to be sudden and steep drops as we saw afterhours following the Q report But the worst is yet to come <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>institutional ownership is a very high according to Google Finance As institutions realize that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is done as a momentum play theyre likely to bail out putting large volumes of shares on the market For this reason I rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a short opportunity Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
