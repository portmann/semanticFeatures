was in the best possible position to succeed over the long term not only from a creative standpoint but also in terms of the companys overall financial performance On the creative side we appointed new leadership in our feature animation business and committed to a series of changes in our creative process including resizing the business to focus our talent and resources on producing two feature films per year instead of three Nine months later were seeing higher levels of creativity collaboration team work and cost efficiencies While there is still much to do I am proud of the work our team have done in what has been a challenging transitional year That said our strong third quarter results highlight the earnings potential of our company when all of our businesses are delivering meaningful segment gross profit and reflect the progress I believe weve made towards the goals we laid out at the outset of this year Id like to walk you through a few of the key highlights of the past quarter Let me begin with our Feature Film segment where the highlight of the quarter was Homes strong performance in the home entertainment market particularly across digital platforms In fact Home has sold the highest number of digital sellthrough transactions worldwide of any DWA title It is also the second highest selling family film in the domestic home entertainment market released to date this year New catalog deals and extensions of our current catalog deals also contributed favorably to revenue growth in the quarter Looking ahead to our feature film slate Kung Fu Panda will be released on January both domestically and here in China Early previews have been successful and well received by audiences And while we are excited to bring the third installment of Pos story to his many fans around the world I do want to highlight that we have a nontraditional release window for an animated film in the US market and currency headwinds from a strong dollar will continue to weigh on international performance Next up is Trolls a musical comedy which will be released on November and as weve recently announced the movie has an outstanding voice cast led by Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake Turning now to our Television segment where Common Sense Media recently named our original series Dragons Race to the Edge and Dinotrux among the best shows on TV for families with kids ages to years This distinction continues to highlight the high quality of our television programming and strength of our brand Turning next to Consumer Products where several initiatives around locationbased entertainment continue to reinforce the strength and value of our brands globally this quarter we extended the terms of our license with regional theme parks Beto Carrero World in Brazil and Dreamworld in Australia In addition we signed a new license agreement with Merlins sic Merlin Entertainment German theme park Heide Park for the use of promotion of our How To Train Your Dragon franchise in a new themed zone In addition weve capitalized on the launch of our hit television series Dinotrux on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with two exclusive launch partners Gymboree for apparel and ToysRUs for the toy line who named Mega Chompin Ty Rux as one of the musthave toys on their Holiday Hot Toy List Finally in our New Media segment the team at AwesomenessTV continues its success in producing and monetizing quality program across multiple delivery platforms screens and mediums The ATV team is off to a solid start delivering content for Verizons go Only days into the platforms launch and without any advertising and promotional activity around the go product Verizon highlighted ATVs Top Five Live and Betch as two exclusive pieces of content that are gaining early traction with millennials and generating encouraging revisits to their platform AwesomenessTV recently announced deal with DHX a component which takes premium shortform content built for digital and repackages the programming format for linear TV has also experienced early success debuting number one with teens in its time slot as part of DHX rebrand of the Family Channel ATVs owned and operated channels also continues to show solid growth third quarter with viewing up nearly yearoveryear And the DreamWorksTV channel on YouTube continues to demonstrate impressive momentum growing to nearly million subscribers with over million views On the Awesomeness Film side both Smosh the movie and Janoskians continues to perform on EST with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>picking up Smosh in the pay TV window Up next for the Awesomeness Film division is the Snervous Tyler Oakley which will be released on December Finally AwesomenessTV and Endemol Shine Group recently announced a strategic alliance building on the strength of the Awesomeness brand internationally and allowing them to extend their reach in key markets including the UK France Germany Spain and Brazil Today more than half of the viewers on ATVs networks are international This deal enables us to efficiently leverage existing ATV formats and the creation of local language in culturally relevant versions with a goal of launching new talent and content with strong advertising appeal that can be distributed across digital and TV platforms around the world So in summary we had a strong quarter Were looking forward to the release of Kung Fu Panda and Trolls in We also expect to continue diversifying our revenue mix by executing on our plans and other expansion opportunities in the TV segment substantially growing both the audience and revenues in our New Media business and leverage the DreamWorks brand to create new entertainment experiences for families around the world Thanks Jeffery For the third quarter of DreamWorks Animation reported revenue of million adjusted operating income of million and adjusted net income of million or per share As explained in our earnings release the adjusted third quarter results exclude the impact of a million pretax charge related to the companys previously announced restructuring plan Moving now to the segment highlights Let me begin with our Feature Film segment where third quarter revenues increased to million and segment gross profit was million The performance was primarily driven by worldwide home entertainment sales of Home which converted better that we had expected Worldwide pay TV distribution of the Penguins of Madagascar and international pay TV distribution How To Train Your Dragon also aided the quarter Library revenues were also favorably impacted by greater contributions from worldwide television distribution of The Croods and Turbo relative to the performance of titles released within the comparable TV window last year Feature Film segment cost of revenues increased to million in the quarter largely because the prior year period benefited from the success of Dragons which has a lower amortization rate than Home and Penguins That said based on Homes favorable performance in both the worldwide theatrical and home entertainment markets as well as benefits from several new and extended catalog deals we now expect full year revenue for the Feature Film segment to increase in the midsingle digit percent range exceeding our previous guidance Turning now to our Television segment where revenue more than tripled yearoveryear to million and segment gross profit increased to million with margin expanding to These results were primarily driven by a greater number of episode deliveries relative to the prior year period partially offset by upfront marketing costs associated with the launch of our first original <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>series Dinotrux as well as the he Mr Peabody Sherman Show With this performance we remain on track to meet our previously stated full year guidance for the TV segment The Consumer Products segment revenues more than doubled to million with the segment gross profit increasing to million in the quarter These results were primarily driven by various location based initiatives including new and extended license arrangements which have lower associated costs As we previously stated the strengthened dollar place challenges on international developers in DreamPlace That said DreamPlace continues to be a valuable asset for us and we are looking forward to the launch of several additional new locations in the US and the UK in time for the holiday season While some of the locations have yet to launch their reservation sites early results are very encouraging and in some cases various dates are already sold out A high percentage of the reservations are from repeat guests and many of these guests have been active in social media helping to generate new reservations Additionally weve received positive early feedback on the average family size of the reservations and the packages purchased And given the outstanding consumer experience and the wealth of consumer insight that comes with it were even more excited about the many new innovative ways the asset can create unique and differentiated consumer experiences in and beyond Its also worth highlighting the Consumer Products segment full year revenues are tracking slightly ahead of the revised guidance we provided on our Q earnings call Turning now to the New Media segment where third quarter revenues of million more than tripled in comparison to Q adjusted revenues and segment gross profit was more than four times higher at million the increases were primarily driven by higher revenue contributions from new licensing arrangements delivery of new content distribution of content on electronic sellthrough as well as from brand sponsorship arrangements Moving now to the remainder of the income statement excluding the impact of the restructuring plan GA expenses for the quarter were million The increase was more than explained by performancebased incentive compensation expense for that was recorded in the quarter In addition we saw an increase at AwesomenessTV in support of the growth and expansion of the business which was offset by savings associated with our restructuring plan Also in the quarter impacting the other expense net line on the PL we recorded a noncash charge of million related to certain investments that are no longer deemed to be recoverable Turning to taxes as I mentioned earlier this year with a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets the companys combined effective tax rate will be largely equivalent to our cash tax liability and includes amounts payable to the former stockholder Now our cash liability is a function of many factors including changes in our expected taxable income for the year which may be different from reported earnings Just one example of this that I shared last time was the gain associated with the sale of our campus which is recognized as taxable income in the year but deferred for reported earnings To the extent the changes in expected taxable income allow us to benefit from the tax sharing agreement a portion of that benefit is payable to the former stockholder As a result of these factors our reported cash tax liability and therefore our combined effective tax rate from quartertoquarter maybe both volatile and look unusual During the quarter our provision for income taxes was million or an effective tax rate of However when combined with a million increase in income tax benefit payable to former stockholder it results in a combined effective tax rate of for the quarter and negative yeartodate which is in the area of where we currently expect the combined effective tax rate to be for the full year Moving happily now to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with approximately million of total available liquidity including million of availability under the credit facility and million of cash on the balance sheet Adding it all up its clear that were entering the fourth quarter with good momentum and many opportunities ahead of us We also have a sizable number of content deliveries to carry out over the next two months While we continue to execute on all of our distribution deals its important to remember that the timing of various deliveries influences whether or not we recognize revenue in or subsequent periods For all of these reasons and then some its particularly difficult to be precise with guidance But at the beginning of the year we made an exception with the decision to provide several milestones around how to assess the companys performance because it is a transitional year for us So in keeping with that commitment and based on our performance through the first nine months of the year we now expect our full year adjusted operating income and cash flow to exceed our initial guidance of breakeven and to exceed million Thanks Fazal Before moving on to QA investors should note that we have members of the media on this call in listenonly mode Id like to remind the media that they are not authorized to quote any participants on this call either directly or in substance other than the representatives of DreamWorks Animation Great Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question So one for Jeffrey one for Fazal Jeffrey were seeing a lot of the major media companies now really talking about not renewing their license deals with SVOD and really <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>more in particular in order to sort of support the ratings and the ad ecosystem which theyre all sort of tied to Obviously DreamWorks doesnt have that problem So are you seeing any kind of incremental opportunities either with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or any of the other OTT services to actually increase the output of originals youre doing beyond the sort of current framework Yeah I mean we as you know have had a very long and a very very great partnership with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>It began with our feature output deal a number of years ago and then moved onto the television side They have been an incredible partner to us and we value it in an incredible way And we are constantly in conversations with them about things that we can incrementally do together both in the nearterm and in the longterm And being that we are in a unique position of being able to deliver high quality branded family entertainment in the first window it does really position us uniquely and very very favorably in the growing SVOD market So the answer again is yes Great And then Fazal one for you In the press release I think you sort of noted that the TV segment was benefiting from a favorable amortization schedule Is this new or has this been the case all throughout Great Two quick questions one on the TV side I was hoping if you could just discuss the upfront marketing expenses within that TV unit Maybe just the materiality of that line item and just maybe what the outlook from there looks like And then just secondly on the CP side I was just hoping maybe you could compare and contrast the opportunity for CP for your next two feature films Panda and Trolls So just maybe how you are differentiating that approach for those two different films Okay Thanks James Ill take the TV bit upfront I dont want to get into specifics on the marketing spend but I think weve said before with the launch of several new series it made sense for us to deploy some capital towards ensuring a strong launch particularly to the extent they have CP associated with them So its kind of an aligned interest for us and the distributor to make sure the series launches well So we evaluate it series by series and we saw an opportunity to be more efficient with the dollars we deploy this round Sure I think in terms of Kung Fu Panda there will be a modest program Panda has never been an exceptional property in terms of CP We do have a very aggressive program here in China so I think thats the one place where we have expectations for something that is meaningfully incremental from what weve seen in the past The biggest opportunity for us in the CP feature area is with Trolls which will be coming in the fourth quarter of And we are well along on mounting what will be the biggest deepest broadest consumer products plan around a property of DreamWorks ever And we will share more detail with you as we get closer and we start to be in a position where we can maybe size that better But we have a tremendous amount of enthusiasm across the board from all the major retail partners around the world As you know you really need to be working a good year in advance And so we do have a pretty good insight into the level of enthusiasm from our retail partners and its very very high and theyre very excited about it So are we Great thank you I have one for Jeffrey and a couple quick ones for Fazal if I can Jeffrey going back to TV I wanted to ask a little about your longerterm ambitions there When you initially did the deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I think we were skeptical about your ability to just produce that volume of content and maintain high standards of quality And at this point youre well on your way It seems like the operational risk is lower now So looking forward do you have ambitions to expand that further And it sounds like the relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is strong Do you think theres demand out there either from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or other parties if you do want to expand Well again the answer on all of those fronts is a very strong yes I think there are no real operational hurdles on the delivery side of this I think we have not only successfully scaled the enterprise to deliver the volume of content but frankly more importantly than that is is that we have done it with a quality and a consistency that has just been first rate And obviously what matters most of all is what does our buyer or customer in this case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>feel about the programming And I think they have been very very pleased with the quality of what weve been able to deliver to them and certainly we have met all of our schedules for delivery Beyond that as I said a moment ago we see a greater opportunity first and foremost with our partners at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>We continue to have conversations with them about new opportunities and we do think that television is going to continue to be a meaningful expansion place for us and our business in the coming months and years meaningful And hopefully well have more to share with you over the next couple of quarters Okay great Thank you And then a couple for Fazal on the New Media segment was there any revenue that was recognized from go in the quarter And how should we think about how youll recognize revenue for that And then to squeeze the last one in on FX you mentioned that as a potential headwind Can you help us quantify at all maybe looking back at historical films and international box what kind of pressure you might have seen given current rates Thank you Sure On the New Media side Ryan yeah there was some recognition for go Theyre going to recognize based on deliveries just like we do So as we said that deal with Verizon its a significant amount of content plus hours on a multiyear deal And theres been a rampup time leading to this part of the year So now theyre continually delivering and as they deliver theyll recognize the revenue And are those deliveries pretty lumpy or are they with that much content I would guess youd be delivering kind of on a pretty constant basis Yeah its not going to be probably not going to be too lumpy unless for whatever reason at some point Verizon decides that they want certain content in tranches which they may or may not choose But Im not aware of them doing that at this stage So as they deliver and this stuff has to be QCd and then loaded up to go So as that happens theyll recognize it Im not anticipating it being lumpy at this stage but I guess that could change later on if they change the way in which they want to ingest the content On the FX side its difficult to say Ryan because every film performs differently in different markets And then each market has its own currency issues relative to the dollar and then settlement rates also vary market by market So its a bit difficult to say I think weve said publicly looking back at the past few years our feature films have been about its been about of the revenue from our feature films coming from international markets But again its going to vary titlebytitle based on its individual international performance in individual markets internationally And we will go to our final question which will be from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets Please go ahead Okay Great Thanks for taking the question I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the momentum on the TV side as we go into I know you guys have guided for this year You have been lost to kind of go too far into next year but it seems like theres an opportunity for more deliveries under the current kind of deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and then renewals And so your thoughts about how you feel about the momentum into next year And also just remind us what the concentration is in that line from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>versus other sources that you could be selling to Yeah So Ill give it sort of contextually Barton the way I have before I think when weve spoken is or with others So were comfortable with the guidance for the segment now which is the million to million in revenue And Ive said before a disproportionate amount of that is Netflixrelated The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content weve seen or thats behind that this year is obviously a significant increase to the prior year And then heading into we actually expected to increase materially further And nothing has changed in that regard at this stage And we do have time for one more question and that will come from the line of Eric Wold with B Riley Please go ahead Thank you A couple of questions on home video and then one on GA You noted that Home has had the strongest digital download results of any film in your history Is this anything different from just the strength of that film in general and the general shift from physical to digital Or is this represent a different strategy on your part to drive this part of the business and how we should be thinking about that impact on margins going forward This is Ann I think its a combination of things I think there is a marketplace momentum as people become more familiar with the idea of consuming content digitally particularly transactional content digitally In this particular case there was a specific release strategy that we think also helped the increase in the digital sales as a percentage of the whole which again the digital release is in advance of the physical release And were seeing that that is giving more focus to the idea of consuming this content digitally And were seeing we think a positive result because of that strategy Thanks And then just a second one on the home video I know on the last call you talked about kind of a promotional strategy to ramp home video sales of Penguins towards the end of the year Theres only about a unit difference between Q and Q Was that more of a Q strategy into the holiday Yeah We definitely got promotional strategies around Penguins heading into the holidays and in particular Black Friday so some of that to come Okay And then lastly if I may for Fazal On GA million in the quarter excluding restructuring just remind us where we are in terms of what needs to come out of that going forward what cant come out of that and whats the right level to think about going forward postrestructuring Sure Eric So the million excluding restructuring keep in mind that also includes about a million incentive comp charge as I mentioned that we took in the quarter So I think for when youre thinking about sort of run rate purposes looking ahead you should be thinking in sort of the million to million range Excluding restructuring I think thats probably a good place to be And ladies and gentlemen this conference will be available for replay after PM Pacific today and will end on November at
