<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are currently trading at times this years expected earnings and times profit expectations for Even under a best case scenario we believe shares of NFLX would only rise to over the next three years That represents a annualized return With shares priced for perfection any negative news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could send the stock lower We recommend exiting the stock before earnings are released on Wednesday after the close Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQ NFLX are trading at a premium valuation ahead of the companys third quarter earnings release Analysts currently expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to have earned per share for the quarter and for the company to book profits of per share this year Looking farther down the road Wall Street consensus estimates for next year are for earnings growth to per share on revenue of billion which represents revenue growth over expectations Based on these expectations investors are currently paying times earnings expectations and times next years projections Its difficult to comprehend the level of optimism that could justify an investment at this level What Is a Best Case Scenario For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>To justify the companys billion market cap investors need to be able to make a case for profits growing exponentially for years to come And for these profits to accelerate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to see subscription revenue ramp at a very aggressive pace Weve already gone on record stating that we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has too much competition and too little profit to justify its current valuation But today we want to look at an optimistic scenario for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and see what kind of return longterm investors could hope to achieve For the sake of argument lets assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can grow revenue from the current annual rate of billion using analyst expectations for at a growth rate of over the next three years Note this is above consensus growth expectations and its very difficult to scale a billion venture at a annualized rate for three years straight Supposing the company could grow revenue at this rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would generate revenue of billion next year billion in and billion in To put this number into perspective at billion in revenue assuming NFLX keeps its streaming subscription price at per month roughly in annual revenue per customer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would need to have more than million customers worldwide Thats a customer base of roughly of the population of the United States including adults and children Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is an international business and at last count the company boasted a membership of million customers in countries But growing that million into a base of million over the next three years would be an impressive feat indeed Assuming that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was able to grow its membership and generate billion in revenue the next question is what that would mean for the companys profit margins At last count the company had a gross profit margin of as shown in the graph from YCharts below One could make an argument that gross profit margins will shrink as the company grows larger due to the likelihood of lower revenue per subscriber as the company expands into less developed countries But to keep our model optimistic and assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>maintains a gross profit margin that leaves the company with billion in gross profits billion times equals billion In the companys June quarter expenses related to marketing technology and development and general and administrative categories made up or of the companys revenues An optimistic investor may assume that as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>grows these expenses will not grow as fast as the companys overall revenue So lets assume that these expenses fall in comparison to revenue to just over of revenue in or billion By recording these expenses at just half of the current rate of these expenses were left with billion in annual profit for the year Now well assume that by this point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>no longer has any debt and does not record any interest expense So earnings before taxes comes out to billion And with a tax rate we can assume that total net profit for would amount to billion billion times billion in net profit Finally assuming no additional shares are issued well divide the billion by million shares outstanding to come up with earnings per share of Not bad considering the company is only expected to earn cents per share in What Would <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Trade At Under This scenario After growing earnings to per share in investors will likely have strong confidence in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and their ability to generate reliable earnings At this point the market would likely be fairly heavily saturated but lets assume that investors still expect robust growth out of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>In this case investors may be willing to pay as much as times earnings for this company Now thats a generous multiple for a consumerbased company that already pulls in billion in annual revenue But again were discussing a best case scenario right now In this example shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will trade at roughly per share good for a increase over the next three years But while a return may sound attractive at first consider the fact that it should take three years to generate this type of return Buying shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>today at and selling them in three years at a price of only yields a annualized return And thats a return based on the best case scenario that we can think of for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does not maintain a high level of revenue growth or if the companys gross margins contract or if marketing expenses do not begin to represent a smaller and smaller portion of the companys sales then forward profit models could wind up giving investors much more disappointing returns As mentioned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is slated to announce Q earnings on Wednesday after the market closes Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>have been moving higher heading into the announcement as investor optimism picks up We believe theres a significant risk that shares will trade lower following the Q announcement Broad economic weakness in emerging markets during the third quarter may have challenged the companys international subscription growth and the companys content creation costs still represent a wild card which could unexpectedly cut into earnings So with a potentially bearish catalyst on the horizon and a longterm investment scenario that needs everything to go exactly right to justify the current pricing we recommend avoiding the stock for now and possibly setting up a speculative bearish position to capitalize on a potential decline in the stock price We only use your contact details to reply to your
