interest in entering China The company could become an OTT provider or content producer with the right local partner Reuters reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX continues to look for ways to break into China At a stop in Seoul NFLXs CCO Ted Sarandos noted Chinas opportunity and that the company continues to look for ways to enter the country For the record I have been a critic of Sarandos for his lack of understanding of the Chinese market when he said that NFLX can enter China without a local partner see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Taking Middle Kingdom My view is that a local partner is absolutely necessary for NFLX to enter China given the bureaucracy and the content distribution licenses that are required Additionally localization of the content is also a necessity to gain traction given the competitive landscape with Alibaba NYSE BABA owning Youku Baidu NASDAQ BIDU owning iQiyi and Tencents owning QQ video Local content strategy is perhaps NFLXs Achilles heels and this could be a bigger issue in the future given the decelerating domestic user growth and increasing competitive landscape against Hulu HBO NYSE TWX and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN In short investors should not underestimate the competitive and regulatory risks associated with entering China China is a complex market for any foreign company to succeed In NFLXs case the company needs both the regulators and a local partner to obtain licenses for content distribution According to regulations set by the content distribution government body the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television content broadcasters must obtain relevant licenses to broadcast videos over the internet on mobile devices and via TV sets There is a license for local content broadcasting as well as a license for foreign content broadcasting The sheer number of licenses and the number of midlevel government officials that a content broadcaster deals with is mind boggling and exhausting However the process can be facilitated through a partnership with local players such as a wellknown media company that is usually backed by a stateowned enterprise or a local government body NFLXs China strategy could come from two forms OTTonly or content production NFLX had prior discussions with OTT platforms LeTV Wasu and BesTV Recall that NFLX has acquired the popular Chinese drama Empress of the Palace from LeTV for its US platform I see this to be an important step because LeTV is one of the few players that have all the necessary licenses for content distribution NFLXs partnership with LeTV could accelerate its content distribution in China potentially through a partnership with LeTVs existing partner CNTV LeTV currently has over k TV episodes and k movies and it would further give the company an edge over BIDU and BABA if it could stream NFLX content on its platform Superior content could also help LeTV in its hardware initiative namely in auto mobile devices and cloud services As for discussions with Wasu and BesTV both companies are stateowned enterprises that have the proper licenses However no conclusions were made with the OTT providers The second option is to become a content producer in the country NFLX approached Wanda Group that is better known for its movie theater chains in China Based on my knowledge Wanda does not appear to have all the necessary licenses to operate an OTT platform so I suspect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may be entering China to become a content producer rather than an OTT player This scenario is quite plausible given that Wanda Group also operates film and TV production having produced Jackie Chans Police Story and Beijing Love Story that turned out to be quite popular Given Netflixs track record in moving towards content production particular the recently released Beast of No Nations and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon it makes sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to take an alternative approach when dealing with the hypercompetitive Chinese market Rather than competing headon against a dozen other OTT service providers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could become the arms dealer for the OTT providers by supplying them with blockbuster content This is significantly more attractive than competing with OTT platforms backed by Alibaba especially after its acquisition of Youku see Alibaba Ecosystem Stronger Than Ever Going into movie production is also consistent with Netflixs existing strategy of partnering with local heavyweights in content creation and distribution I note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is already working with Fuji Films in Japan to cater to the local market see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Konichiwa HastingsSan As part of its strategy for Korea <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will also partner with local players see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Going Gangnam Style and the entry into India makes Eros
