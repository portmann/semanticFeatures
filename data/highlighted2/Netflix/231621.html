style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc has showed terrific revenue results for the nine months ended with yearoveryear revenue growth However other performance metrics show that the company is less attractive than the average industry player For example they are much worse than Time Warner Cables The best assumptions made in the DCF model show that the company is overvalued The comparative analysis confirms my findings I suggest that investors who love risk buy put options on this stock Riskaverse investors should not consider this investment at the moment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQ NFLX is a good stock for you if you are a fan of growth stories The company shows one of the best results in the industry The threeyear average compound annual growth in sales is which is circa times higher than the industry average and much better than Time Warner Cables The last K report shows that the companys yearoveryear revenue growth rate is in excess of which demonstrates the companys attractiveness as a growth player The platforms content library has increased by circa during the same period This is one of the best results shown by the company in its history However there are several questions that should be raised First of all take a look at the profit margins Although the revenue growth makes other growth metrics look positive the company is ineffective Its operating margin is and its net profit margin is These are significantly lower than the industry average To compare Time Warner Cable is circa more effective in each ratio The decreasing net profit margin makes net income growth much lower than the industrys average Consequently ROE and ROA ratios are both unattractive when compared to other companies in the industry On the other hand Time Warner Cables ROA and ROE are fantastic see Diagram The only thing we should consider Netflixs comparative advantage financially is its lowrisk credit profile The companys DebtEquity ratio is below the industrys average However the interest expense has increased dramatically during the last year The current interest coverage ratio of x is three times lower than the last years x a troublesome trend indeed On the other hand despite the better operating margins Time Warner is much more indebted than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with DE of x and the interest coverage ratio of x Due to an outstanding revenue growth the company has grown its market capitalization by times during the last five years while the SP and the Pay TV indexes have showed relatively modest results see Diagram The companys current market capitalization is about times its net profit and approximately times its book value Goodwill included Despite the projected forward PE of x these figures make me feel that the best moment for investing in the stock is long gone Now the stock looks substantially overvalued I bet Graham would be shocked to see this outrageous market inefficiency However it is usually better to check the fair price with the DCF and the comparative analyses as numbers are very important My DCF model is presented in Diagram In Diagram you can see how different metrics of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc will change during this period I have made several assumptions which can be easily seen in the Assumptions tab of my Excel file My model shows that after subtracting the market value of debt minority interest and adding back cash and investments the market value of equity is circa B in the Base scenario Consequently the fair value per share is about per share It is lower than the current price of circa per share The Super Stress scenarios implied fair price is per share which is lower than the current price level The sensitivity analysis is presented in Diagram According to the Base scenario and the assumptions for the EVEBITDA multiple and WACC the price range should be in the range of per share This price range represents a downside risk at current market prices My comparative analysis is based on three key ratios PE PS and PBV see Diagram The results are terrible The best case here is a decline to reach the Industrys topquartile level On the other hand these ratios do not embrace the effect of increasing revenue and net income growth However even the projected net profit CAGR of circa see my DCF model does not make the PE ratio attractive The lowest forward PE ratio my model gives me is x earnings in fiscal which translates in to an earnings power of EarningsMarket Cap ratio opposite to PE It is terribly low in the current situation especially given the uncertainty with the interest rate hike Both DCF and comparative analyses show that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc is overvalued Hence my recommendation is SELL with a target price range of per share This target price range translates into a downside opportunity However keep in mind that the company can show better results than I expect Therefore I suggest that only riskloving investors sell the stock short Moreover it is safer to buy put options than directly selling the shares Finally riskaverse investors should abstain from taking a position in this stock in either direction We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
