class='textDiv'>Why CordCutters Arent Getting The Holy Grail TV Of Streaming Services Just Yet Consumerist As a growing number of consumers drop or never sign up for traditional payTV services its easy to point to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a big reason And yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and similar services dont actually replace the TV experience especially when it comes to sports Newer offerings like Sling TV and PlayStation Vue replicate the live TV watching experience but falter compared to traditional payTV when it comes to things like DVR functionality Whats stopping the big players from offering an allinone online service now Its not necessarily a technical issue Streaming services like MLBtv Sling Showtime Anytime and others show that you can have both live and prerecorded content available on the same platform Theres definitely the issue of affordability at play In order for a streaming service to win over new customers it has to be at an attractive price point Alas amassing a vast library of ondemand streaming titles costs a lot of money as do liveTV carriage deals with the networks So far overthetop video services have decided to keep customers bills low by choosing one or the other If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>were to go to the broadcasting biggies to make a deal to carry live TV online theres no way it could afford to keep its monthly rate at the sub level that has made it so attractive to consumers Similarly if Sling were to try to bolster its ondemand library to match that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>its month base rate would be untenable Additionally part of the reason that Sling can afford to include ESPN easily the most expensive channel in any basic cable lineup in its base package of channels is by not allowing Sling users to record rewind or watch ESPN programming in a way that would let them skip the commercials A number of the bigname networks on Sling AMC TBS CNN have a similar arrangement that only allows users to view these channels live PS Vue has more ability to rewind and record but shows can only be kept for a limited time and attempting to fastforward through an ad break on a recorded Vue show is pointless the fastforward only moves you seconds ahead at a time but often requires more than that for the stream to buffer and restart Vue also currently lacks ondemand content other than the programs you have stored to the cloud The streaming service that currently comes the closest to offering something approximating live TV and a large movieTV library is HBO Now New shows dont technically air live on the service but they are made available within minutes of when they hit TV Of course HBO Now is several dollars more per month than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or Amazon and its TV show archives while sizable are limited to HBO Hulu Plus has a very large archive of TV shows including current seasons of some shows and movies but pays for them not just from month subscriptions but by interrupting many of these videos with repetitive sometimes glitchy ads Its possible that many TV viewers dont care if they cant watch Big Bang Theory or The Blacklist for a few days or months after they air live but the same cant be said of live sports Many people on the bubble about cutting their cord would probably say goodbye to payTV if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or Amazon started including live game streams Netflixs head of content Ted Sarandos was recently asked about the possibility of bringing live sports to the streaming service I will never say never he answered according to Recode I dont think the ondemand to sports is enough of an addition to the value proposition to chase Just look at NFL Sunday Ticket the premium service that gives DirecTV customers live access on TV and streaming to all outofmarket Sunday afternoon games Even though DirecTV reportedly pays more for the service than it gets from the Sunday Ticket subscription fees its so important for retaining DirecTV subscribers that ATT would have been able to walk away from its merger with DirecTV if the satellite company failed to renew its exclusivity contract with the NFL Its not like were going to get in and deleverage the leagues said Sarandos Were going to go in and overpay like everyone else does so it doesnt get me that excited Its inevitable that well eventually be presented with the option of an allinone streaming service that will be sufficient for replacing live TV and offer the convenience customization level and portability of streaming services The question is whether it will be more or less expensive than the patchwork of streaming and payTV services that millions of American consumers currently pay for Click to print Opens in new window Showtime May Soon AnnounceStandalo And this is the reason millions are giving the finger to the leagues and their demands for content and fees I cut the cord years ago and havent looked back I only utilize Hulu with a Roku box and find a way to stream live sports with Kodi Works good enough to keep me from paying an over a month satellite or cable bill Southwest Airlines Passenger Says Flight Crew Wouldnt Let Her Make Emergency Call To Husband Before He Died Family Switches
