</span>Inc NFLX Includes AMZN TWX This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech column looks at a study indicating the size of Netflixs US movie and TV show library has shrunk considerably since With Netflixs content spend still growing rapidly in spite of the shrinkage the company seems to be prioritizing spending on original content and hit moviesshows over catalog depth Judging by Netflixs continued US subscriber growth its strategy is working out But it could still give the likes of Hulu and HBO a chance to differentiate AllFlicks a site that gives US and foreign <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX subscribers an alternative means of browsing the streaming giants library reports <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>provided movies and TV shows to its US subscribers as of March respectively down and from the number provided in January A look at a list of the titles that arrived on and left <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in March or are set to do so in April drives home AllFlicks observation While new seasons of House of Cards or Orange is the New Black get more headlines as might Netflixs oneoff purchases for rights to movies such as Will Smiths Bright the amount of churn being seen on Netflixs platform is substantial The churn hasnt prevented Netflixs streaming content obligations boosted by international investments as well as rising content licensing prices from continuing to grow at a healthy clip They rose in to B In addition the company ended with a slight net debt balance after having ended with M in net cashshortterm investments At the same time the churn also hasnt stopped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>from continuing to see healthy subscriber growth in a US market thats nearing a household penetration rate For all the noise made by rivals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still towers over the US subscription streaming landscape Clearly theres a method to Netflixs madness Reed Hastings firm is nothing if not maniacally datadriven and in a bidding environment where the company has no choice but to pick its battles it has concluded its best bet is to invest in original content and a narrower library of thirdparty material thats more centered around hit movies and TV shows than it used to be While Netflixs decisionmaking appears sound for now anyway it still involves tradeoffs And those tradeoffs could still help rivals carve out niches among consumers interested in proverbial long tail video content Hulu and HBO arguably each have an incentive to do so Amazon NASDAQ AMZN has the resources to aggressively go after longtail consumers but its strategic goal with Prime Video has always been to grow Prime subscriptions and keep existing Prime subs loyal And Amazons target demographic for US Prime subscriptions is every American household that can afford one Thus it makes sense for them to pursue a Netflixlike strategy of appealing to the largest number of consumers possible and that means a healthy dose of original content and hit moviesshows Hulu on the other hand is a service that lacks Netflixs scale it had close to M Hulu Plus subscribers as of last April and has already created a niche among TV aficionados drawn to its large TVshow library and support in some cases for nextday streaming of new episodes Investing in longtail movie content would give Hulu another way to differentiate its content relative to Netflixs on a smaller budget HBO NYSE TWX meanwhile has been selling potential subscribers whether for the standalone HBO Now service or for the payperviewHBO Go package on its large and popular library of original programming This acts as HBOs tentpole Whats interesting here is that HBO is arguably pitching its services as a complement to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as much as an alternative Its effectively telling consumers Whether or not youre subscribed to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>youll want to subscribe to HBO to get Game of Thrones Vinyl and other popular shows you cant get on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Investing in niche movie content not found on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would be an extension of this strategy Theres no guarantee Hulu or HBO will try to differentiate by investing more in longtail material Hulu has long been hamstrung by the interests of its oldmedia owners And thanks to the deals it has struck for its payperview channel HBOs movie library has skewed towards newer films But Netflixs calculated decision to pare back the size of its library to focus more on original content and hit moviesshows
