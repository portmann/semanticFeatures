class='textDiv'>Is The NetflixStyle Binge Model Still As Viable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha NBC recently tried to emulate the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>model with its new series Aquarius which comes at a time where the binge model may be at a crossroads Showrunners executives and audiences are beginning to contemplate if the allatonce style rollout that made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a powerhouse is still the right strategy A number of new contenders are lining up with different ways of unveiling programming in an attempt to dethrone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or at least take away some of its market share TIMEcom perhaps summed it up the best saying NBC wants to be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wants to be NBC Its a true statement as just recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>made it clear that while everyone thinks cablers like HBO are in the companys crosshairs its actually the big broadcasters that should be worried What sparked this whole resurgence around discussing the streaming model was NBCs a subsidiary of Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK decision to stream all episodes of its Aquarius miniseries online following its initial airing last Thursday This is a move into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX territory at a time where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is trying to make a play into network territory As I mentioned before the battle lines are being drawn and investors need to be ready because Aquarius is just the tipping point One interesting trend though that was brilliantly explored by The Hollywood Reporter last week as part of this overall discussion was that the all at oncebinge rollout idea may be waning or at least losing some supporters Let me be clear Im not saying people are going to stop bingewatching especially if they miss three or four episodes of their favorite series but they may not be as quick to want to get involved with a new streaming series that is designed for binge viewing Think about it for a second at what point does watching a House of Cardslike show becomes more of an obligation than a pleasure Whether it is an established show like Cards or new one like Bloodlines does the pressure to finish the show in a small amount of time take away from the overall enjoyment of the experience For example if HBO decided all of a sudden to release all of Game of Thrones new episodes at once you would likely feel like you have to watch it or risk being spoiled because its such a wellknown series Yet by doing so youd lose that breather in between acts where you can reflect on what you just watched and really take in the wow factor Having that to be continued moment also carries the conversation into the mainstream and builds buzz which is vital to the business model of any content company I get the argument on the other side of the coin but even if you are a cord cutter you have to acknowledge the traditional model had its strong suits You will always have people who binge a series in a weekend and thats fine but its the ones that then complain they have to wait a full year for the next set of episodes that are the very reason why we need to explore new models They are the ones who want to have that discussion about the series right then and there but others arent anywhere near the same point in the series and that stifles the conversation Honestly though this whole thing is akin to giving a little kid a box of candy and telling them they can decide when they want to eat it but once its gone its gone Ill give you strong odds that kid has a hell of a stomach ache in about hours Can you really blame the kid though They really dont know any better and neither do we as viewers because this is how weve been trained Yet now when you have people like Orange is the New Black showrunner Jenji Kohan questioning her own series model and people like Mad Mens Matthew Weiner saying if he ever did a streaming series hed want to parcel it out versus releasing it all at once you begin to wonder if this business strategy is still sound When it was one or two shows that was one thing but now we have a large number of bingeable programming options In many cases it is not that a person doesnt want to watch that particular show but they need to catch up on the other ones that people are watching on a weekly basis ie Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead and have more of a sense of urgency to them Traditional network executives and audiences now more and more want that time in between to discuss these shared experiences Under this model you cant because everyone is on different pages and that takes away from those watercooler moments showrunners have worked so hard to create So does that mean a happy medium where streamers do a batch system of a few episodes every week Maybe maybe not but there has to be a balance of some sort between once a week and all at once yet for now this is where we are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for its part seems unwilling to move and recently told audiences at MIPCOM that the current one episode at time model is antiquated and used its internal data as a way to back its multiepisode structure Granted this is a company that made its bones on disrupting the current standard so you cant blame them for wanting to keep things status quo However whats interesting to ask here is that if the model begins to change again and rivals like Hulu and NBC are pushing for that direction will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>adapt or go into denial like broadcast and cable networks first did when it first came around I do personally find it a little funny and ironic that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is such a datadriven company yet it doesnt actually release the one piece of data that everyone wants its ratings Again I completely understand why but its a valid point For now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still in the drivers seat and even more so it answered one of its major criticisms with the successful launch of multiple new series Bloodline Grace Frankie Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Marvels Daredevil that paired with established hits like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black giving them a lot of ammo and continued momentum Yet this is still just the beginning and more and more youll see additional networks and services try alternate approaches These companies missed the boat the first time and they dont want to make that same mistake a second time Source Is The NetflixStyle Binge Model Still As Viable Disclosure The author has no positions in any
