class='textDiv'>Amazon Prime Video Just Did What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Never Would and Im Excited Debt RoundUp Here are the tools and resources that changed my financial life When youre a cable cutter like me you have to find ways to enjoy some on screen entertainment I dont go to the movies much because I dont like to eat the extra butter popcorn for and dont need a gallonsized soda I also dont like to pay prices that continue to rise faster than the cars in the last Furious movie Either way I still needs my fix from time to time We already dont have cable so we use a few TV antennas from my good friends at Mohu If you need an overtheair antenna you need to pick these up They are awesome Beyond that we do have a subscription to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but we also have Amazon Prime Its been worth it for us to have both but thats because I do a majority of my online shopping at Amazon Im a customer and I like their service and fast shipping The movies and TV shows from Amazon Instant Video is just an added bonus Ive had no issues with either <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or Amazon Prime Instant Video Both services worked well for me especially since I got two Amazon Fire TV sticks they rock by the way We have good WiFi signal around our house so streaming is not an issue One downfall of streaming in our current setup is we couldnt take our moviestv shows with us when traveling We have a nearly three year old who has sworn off napping these days Having a little entertainment in the car would be nice We do have a tablet but I got the version with only WiFi We also have phones through Cricket Wireless but Im not about to use all my data for streaming on a tiny screen no I dont have a huge iPhone Because of our current setup we just couldnt take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon Prime with us on the road At least that is how it used to be Amazon has decided to change up the streaming game a bit with a cool new feature for those who have Amazon Prime with their instant video feature There was one point in time a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>executive said they would never allow people to download content for use outside of streaming Now at the time that might have made sense <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is all about trying to beef up the internet speeds around the US Considering we really dont have good internet speeds compared to the rest of the industrialized world I assume they didnt want to use downloads as an option They wanted to push for faster internet connections around the world It does benefit them greatly to see more people connected at faster speeds In comes Amazon whos goal is to add more streaming users than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and they just announced that you can download some movies and TV shows to take with you This is awesome and Im excited about this I was just on a trip with my wife and son in the mountains and it would have been good to have the tablet powered up with a few good shows that he likes Since we already have Prime why not just download some shows and not worry about it Amazon has stepped up where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wouldnt and gave customers what they have asked for People have wanted to able to watch content when they arent connected to the internet Phones give us that but we pay a lot of money for data usage well I dont but other people do This is a big step for streaming services like Amazon Instant Video Now you can easily access the content you want to watch when you want to watch it You can download movies and shows for a plane ride train ride or even car ride No need to worry about data usage and mobile connectivity This helps you get through all of that and it should excite you It really should OK so you know that you can download the movies and TV shows when youre a Prime member but how can you do it Well Im going to show you and its really not that hard You can also just jump over to Amazon to learn more about the downloads First you must be an Amazon Prime Member If youre not sign up here for a day free trial You can download content on the iPhone iPad Android phone and tablets and the Fire tablet You have a lot of choices In order to watch the content on these devices you need to download the Amazon Video App You can get it from the App Store or through Amazon Underground Android If you have the Fire Phone or Fire Tablet then you can just hit Videos from the home screen Once youve done that you can fire up the app and search for the movies and TV shows you want to watch and download There will be a Download link or icon next to the shows and movies which are eligible for such processes Once you are ready just click download and let it go Amazon suggest you keep the Vieo app open and your phone plugged in Remember this should be done over WiFi and not through the cell data network That would be worthless and time consuming If youre going to download large files make sure you have a good WiFi signal and you wont be leaving until its done That is basically it Its not a very hard thing to do but know that not all shows on Amazon Instant Video are available for download That is just the nature of the entertainment industry Im sure Amazon will be pushing for more content to be allowed but they already have thousands of movies and shows which can be downloaded locally to your device If youre an Amazon Prime member what do you think about this new feature Will it keep you a member if youve been on the fence Im a business owner blogger father
