Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Two weeks ago I wrote an article about Netflixs perspectives in Russia On the th of January it opened the website for Russians I understand that CES was a good moment to claim that the expansion into the international markets had started successfully Two weeks ago I published an article where I described Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX perspectives in Russia and stated that a successful and wellprepared start can attract more than M subscribers and M in revenues over the next five years I highly recommend reading that article before starting this one in order to understand my point of view Before writing this article I tried to find out information about the first reaction of Russian users on Netflixs launch I was absolutely sure that there would be both positive and negative comments Imagine my surprise when I saw only skeptical and negative comments In Diagram you can see a screen from the users comments and their translation According to these comments I made several conclusions First The price is about per month I expected the same or less Second <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has not translated its website into Russia and has not provided both translation for the movies and subtitles and has not upload content popular in Russia Third Despite the high price some people see it reasonable if the content is good Moreover I tried to test the service by myself Im going to write about my personal experience of it Looking ahead it was not pleasant and most of the negative comments are understandable I do think that the CES haste was unnecessary because a strong and wellprepared start would have been much more effective on this local market Now Im going to share some additional statistics that may help you arrive to a conclusion about the possible market niche the company can take in the local market and secondly share my experience of exploring the Russian version of Netflixs website As I said in my last article the Russian market is currently not in the best shape for Netflixs expansion Peoples incomes have dropped dramatically both in the local currency and the USD terms and they cannot afford paying such a high price for content that has already been published on torrent sites However I also stated that there is a market niche in Russia which mainly consists of aboveaverage earners who have been watching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>through VPN for many years They represent about of the total population of Russia or about M people This part consists of people whose annual income is above K This is how I derived this number according to WorldBanks statistics Russias top of population owned of the total national income in The share represents M people while of the total national income was approximately B Hence the average income per the top earner is a year However the ruble devaluation in and led to a decrease in income in USD terms so the current average income is somewhere between per year According to Levada Center research only of Russians speak English However English is spoken by of people aged years and of people between years old see Diagram As per my experience people of this age represent the biggest part of the top earners The Russian Statistics Bureau states that there are about M people aged years and M people aged years Hence there are about M of young people and M men and women in their s and s who speak English This totals M people overall in this category According to Nevafilm Research about of people watch movies in the Internet I do not want to cook the statistics so I will use this number for those people who may potentially become <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>customers Consequently the total market niche is about M people We derived the total potential of Netflixs market niche to be approximately M people However this number can increase to M people as people are becoming increasingly familiar with the Internet This figure definitely depends on the usability of the service and the quality of the translated content In order to achieve the abovementioned market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had to enter the local market successfully However as I mentioned before the company was too much in a hurry The first negative thing I encountered was that the website had not been translated into Russian at all neither the home page nor the other pages as Diagram shows I have counted not more than words on the home page including the tabs Assuming that it costs about cents to translate a word was it too expensive to spend only and make the website userfriendly to of Russians This was my first thought However the design was quite attractive and the advertising offered a free month so I tried to sign up I chose a Standard plan again all information is in English and then proceeded to the payment details see Diagram As I forecasted the subscription price would not be much different from the one in the US However I also expected that it would be lower because most Russians cannot afford spending more than of their monthly income on this service Providing Credit Card Details For Monthly Charges Not a Good Idea for Russians In one of the comments to my latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>article I said that Russians do not like providing personal data if they do not see it is worth doing I guess that people who have not exited the site at the home page would close it at the payment page see Diagram After going through several windows with my payment details or it is really too much for a Russian who has the opportunity to watch free movies using a torrent website I found myself in a situation where I had to choose the devices I would use for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I was really surprised in a good way that in Russia you can choose the same features as in the US or Canada This was probably the only pleasant thing on the website that Russian users can find convenient usage of different devices to watch movies and TV series see Diagram After completing the process I expected to enjoy a good variety of content that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>provides in the excellent quality However I had to say goodbye to the company after I encountered the following First A disgusting search menu Here you can find a GIF picture where I recorded the process of scrolling the window I had stars in my eyes after doing it Anyway it is a subjective point for me and now I will provide more objective ones Second Most movies are available only in English Moreover no movies are available in Russian I really tried hard trust me Third Most subtitles are in English too Look at Diagram where I opened the Matrix I do not really understand the special significance of providing movies in English with English subtitles except for the educational purposes However I do not think most people watch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for improving their English <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does not provide a choice for Russian speakers see Diagram Finally There are no Russian movies or TV series in the system I tried to find a famous Russian film called Ivan Vasilievich Changes His Profession an old Soviet movies popular till this day it is really a culture thing and one of the most popular TV series called The Kitchen As you can see from Diagrams and I have not found anything The same is with other famous movies and TV series I tried to find Moreover I discovered that a lot of USmade films are not present on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>For example Interstellar which was in the movie theatres all over the world more than a year ago Or Sin City Or the other movies which can easily be found in an excellent quality on Ivi or many torrent sites Look at Diagram Its a print screen of one of famous Russian torrent sites with the Interstellar movie page The movie one cannot watch on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or should pay for watching in Ivi can be easily downloaded in one click in any quality one wants DVD BD Bluray with K etc After doing this qualitative analysis I want to summarize all the pros and cons I mentioned before and make a conclusion about Netflixs perspectives in Russia High quality of content but not the variety A lot of American and other movies and TV series are unavailable while the torrent sites and Russian competitors have them I see more drawbacks than advantages for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in Russia Hence I conclude that until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>fixes its mistakes and provides an excellent value for a reasonable price the service does not have a future in Russia or the CIS The market niche does exist as I mentioned in my latest article The only way to capture share in it is to be more rational and intelligent PS This article is qualitative analysis and my personal opinion If you like numbercrunching you can read another article of mine on <span
