this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Facebook is a cyclical stock that will be impacted by the slowdown FBs secular story wont be impacted meaning it will be a buy after the business cycle turns around The companys valuation is expensive FANG is comparable to the fertilizer stocks that led the market higher in and Facebooks NASDAQ FB stock performed well in I captured most of that upside I sold FB for a gain on December So far the timing looks good as it has corrected since then I didnt sell the stock because I was afraid of a fall I sold it to avoid a much bigger correction which is why this article still has value even though FB is no longer at its peak My first reaction after doing research on a possible recession in was to sell Facebook in order to book my gains in one of my best stocks for the year Its always difficult to sell a winner especially a firm with such a bright future as Facebook has I will remind you of these great expectations when I buy the stock back in a few quarters While Facebook has a bright future it will still be impacted by the recession that is coming FB will be able to grow its users and the percentage of total ad budgets it gets from firms but if the total spending pool drops Facebook will be impacted The company has been able to take share from other websites because of the size of its reach so this may limit macro effects However the stock doesnt need declining earnings to go down Even slowing growth will cause investors to sell because of its high valuation Facebook has grown its market share of mobile ad revenues and is projected to continue growing it in the future This trend wont change even if there is a recession Mobile will be the most important category as it is expected to comprise over half of the total digital spending in This growth is expected to continue over the next few years reaching by This trend towards mobile wont be impacted by the economy The final positive chart illustrates the growth in market share of digital spending Digital spending has been able to outgrow total media spending which grows in the low single digits by taking share This market share in digital has a limit which I would assume is somewhere under although it is possible everything becomes digital in couple of decades This implies slower growth over time for digital as it starts to mimic the slow total growth of the category This growth in market share for digital wont be impacted by macro issues Facebooks stock wont go down because of slowing digital growth because it would be impossible to forecast anything otherwise Its difficult to project just how an economic slowdown would affect Facebook because it is a new firm The only time period that gives us a glimpse into what could happen is the financial crisis If you dont think will be recessionary I still think this a valuable question to ask as there will be a recession at some point in the future US media spending declined by from to This is expected as firms cut their ad budgets to preserve cash during the recession Also it doesnt make sense to spend money on advertising to a consumer who isnt in the mood to spend The chart below shows the total US spending on online advertising I was surprised to find out that even during the earlier stages of advertising online spending declined in along with total spending Spending declined which was much less than the decline in total spending meaning it maintained its trajectory of growing market share It went from a market share in to in The later years in both charts are estimates so they should be ignored Facebook was in its infancy from to Therefore FBs market share was so small that it was able to grow revenues without worrying about the macro factors It almost tripled revenues from to and began earning a profit This time around Facebook is a much bigger company as you can see from the right of the chart which doesnt even include the amazing the firm had This means Facebook will not be able to grow its ad revenues during a recession There is a strong possibility that FB is able to outperform some of its peers because it has the biggest reach but it will decline unless the recession is benign The point is the company is more of a cyclical stock than it was in Investors will come to grips with this if there is a slowdown when they see their gains in the stock erode The growth in online market share also has similar connotations Digital spending has gone from the lowdouble digits to the low s as a percentage of total spending This means there is a strong likelihood that digital spending does worse on a relative basis compared to total spending in than to If total spending declines in or digital should do worse than decline The other problem I have with Facebooks stock is that it is a member of the sainted FANG group of stocks which is the acronym for the technology stocks that did well in Facebook Amazon NASDAQ AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL These stocks were popular because they led the market higher When bull markets reach their peak the breadth of the market declines as only a few stocks drive the averages higher At the end of the bull market these market leaders are brought down The decline in breadth is obvious as the Russell is now down about since its peak last year Although Im only I did start investing in the market in so I remember what happened in and The top stocks in the quarters leading up to the collapse in the market were the fertilizer stocks Potash NYSE POT Agrium NYSE AGU Mosaic NYSE MOS and Monsanto NYSE MON all had huge gains Looking back it now seems obvious that the market being led by a few firms that increase food productivity isnt sustainable The thesis of the Chinese people eating more meat which would require more grains encompassed the entire market This time its the FANG stocks that are the leaders at the end of the bull market There is no doubt that Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are much more expensive than Alphabet and Facebook Even though Facebook is the third most expensive stock out of the four it still isnt cheap As you can see from the FAST Graphs chart Facebooks price to earnings multiple is nearly twice the analyst estimated growth rate I think this excessive valuation was created by the stock having momentum and by money managers searching for growth in a market which has weak breadth If you look at the chart the stock hasnt broken down as much as others have in this nasty beginning of the year for the stock market The stock has support at the level It would need to fall below this to break its uptrend and begin to start making lower lows FBs stock is very important to the market because if its trend breaks the entire market is leaderless Apple NASDAQ AAPL has already broken down technically so a decline in Facebook would be a bad signal for the NASDAQ in particular which is at the cusp of a correction territory This weak economy will hurt Facebook The small business advertisers will be the hardest hit as they cut their ad budgets completely I still believe in FBs secular growth story especially with the growth in users on Instagram but the cyclical environment will provide temporary headwinds for the stock I am happy with my decision to sell at which was near the alltime peak of stock If I still owned it I would be taking profits now in the anticipation of a weakening economy Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
