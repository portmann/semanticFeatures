increasing storyline to watch with new television launches on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in and new Kung Fu Panda and Trolls movies in Shares of Dreamworks Animation NASDAQ DWA have had an up and down several years The company continues to struggle as its recent box office releases have been duds and led to several major writedowns This also comes at a time when shares rise and fall from acquisition rumors The good news for shareholders and potential shareholders is the diversification of the companys business into television and consumer products continues to accelerate and should reward patient longterm investors The recent surprise success of Home now in theaters could also provide a short term boost as well Back in the middle of March Dreamworks Animation announced a new content deal with Verizon which I believe strengthens my past arguments of the importance of television for the company going forward Under the terms of the deal Verizon will add hours of original video to target teens and millennials The content will include scripted and unscripted programming AwesomenessTV is one of the key pieces to the puzzle and likely a big reason why Dreamworks Animation received this content deal for Verizons upcoming video service Dreamworks Animation acquired AwesomenessTV back in AwesomenessTV now has more than billion views and million subscribers AwesomenessTV has helped create content for Dreamworks Animation like Tomboy the movie and Richie Rich which is part of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>deal On the conference call it was said that DreamworksTV with its boost from the AwesomenessTV family is the number one family channel on YouTube and has growth exceeding Disney Channel Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network AwesomenessTV is not the only part of Dreamworks involved as some of its most recognizable characters will be used in the multiyear deal This is similar to the strategy used by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX which utilizes newer Dreamworks Animation characters and also use some of the characters Dreamworks owns through its Classic Media acquisition Richie Rich in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>This deal with Verizon is a big one that should not be ignored One of the biggest reasons the Verizon deal is important is not only its diversification of the companys revenue but the diversification within its television section An analyst at BTIG argued on the last conference call that Dreamworks Animation was too dependent on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for revenue This turned out to be partially true in a later followup from the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>represented of Dreamworks Animations revenue million With several shows still to hit the streaming service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could very well make up a larger portion of the companys revenue in The Verizon deal now helps to boost the overall revenue impact of the television segment and also lower the dependency on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Now the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>deal is still obviously important to Dreamworks Animation in its diversification attempts The deal goes through with some episodes still being delivered until the year In the fourth quarter Dreamworks delivered episodes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>across four television show titles Turbo FAST VeggieTales All Hail King Julien and Puss in Boots In Dreamworks will deliver season of these shows and also seven new titles as part of its existing deal The other big television news I wrote about prior was Dreamworks Animation launching a television channel read more here in Asia later this year That channel will air in countries and provide a great point of entry for Dreamworks Animation for several of its characters which in return could boost consumer products sales and also box office revenue in the region On the fourth quarter conference call Dreamworks provided some details of this new channel The Chinese channel will be launched in the second half of the year with HBO Asia managing affiliate and advertising seals There will be over hours of content for the channel Prior to the Verizon deal announcement Dreamworks Animation said it was on track for television revenue to be to million with a gross margin of This is a sizable number for the company since last years entire revenue was million In the fourth quarter television revenue was million In fact in the fourth quarter television represented million of million the company reported Moving on from television consumer products are the other big reason I am bullish on Dreamworks Animation for the long term On the latest conference call it was said that We can see that our investment has begun to bear fruit when discussing consumer products In consumer product revenue was up Dreamworks Animation was a top ten toy licensor thanks to the success of How to Train Your Dragon which also represented of fourth quarter consumer product revenue Going forward Dreamworks Animation is very bullish on its consumer product lineup In the company will have two theatrical releases in Kung Fu Panda and Trolls Kung Fu Panda has generated strong returns before for the company and with the growing presence of the brand in China consumer product sales should see a large increase The theatrical release of Trolls I highlighted in a prior article is something the company continues to believe is one of the most important launches related to its consumer products segment From the conference call Trolls is probably going to be the greatest opportunity that we have had of any movie since we started the company Thats coming from a company that has the Shrek Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon brands so Trolls is clearly a potential catalyst to the company and its shares The entry into television and several new brands also bode well for consumer products Dreamworks Animation highlighted Voltron VeggieTales and Dinotrux as strong brands it believes in for the future VeggieTales has been around for years and recently got a relaunch on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Voltron and Dinotrux will get a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>launch in and will see strong toy launches around the brands The consumer product segment had revenue of million in the fourth quarter Reports show Home outperformed estimates and grossed million in its opening weekend This comes as welcomed good news for Dreamworks Animation as it represents a higher open than its last couple releases and also put the company in better financial shape from its only theatrical release Amazingly enough theHome opening weekend is ahead of How to Train Your Dragon and also its highest opening The bad news is Home is the only theatrical release for The good news is one of the most important and biggest potential movies will be launched in Kung Fu Panda is one of the highest anticipated movies in Dreamworks history The importance of the movie has increased with other Chinese studios behind the financing I wrote about the importance of Kung Fu Panda in a prior article Trolls also is highly anticipated by the company and should see strong interest with toy launches around the theatrical release Without getting too far ahead of the game keep in mind that a significant milestone is coming in the second or third quarter for the company Dreamworks Animation will announce its first original production for Oriental Dreamworks which it holds a ownership stake The company calls this announcement a very very significant milestone This movie would be scheduled for a first quarter release in While thats a long way out the announcement could highlight the companys investment in China whose box office is rapidly growing By being involved in local production the company has a strong position to continue to see its movies imported into China Due to a shift in the release schedule fiscal is not looking amazing for Dreamworks shareholders Analysts on Yahoo Finance see the company posting a loss of per share for the full year That comes from revenue of million which would be an increase of In fiscal analysts see the company returning to a profit with per share projected Revenue is estimated to increase to billion Shares of Dreamworks Animation actually rose on Friday to end the week at A sharp rise on Monday put shares closer to the midpoint of their week range to Originally I thought Monday was going to bring a sell off and a great entry point for investors but the Home success has now put shares in rally mode I think investors should carefully watch this stock throughout the next couple of weeks The results from Home could give the rally legs and lead to an out of reach share price and above Anything below is still a bargain in my mind with the coming
