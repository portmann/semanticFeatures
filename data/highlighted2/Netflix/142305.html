history the number of payTV Disney NYSE DIS is starting to feel the effects of that as the latest earnings report showed even its ESPN powerhouse experienced a modest drop in subscribers revealing the ominous impact this trend will have on traditional media companies After all if ESPN cant grow subscribers that means all payTV and its content providers are subject to decline He added the decline in the first quarter of followed the approximate million households in that didnt sign up for any service new households or who cancelled their existing payTV subscriptions The main catalysts behind cordcutting has been the wide acceptance of mobile devices and the resultant streaming media industry that rose up in response to growing demand for entertainment that could be viewed on Consequently consumers have gradually moved away from watching linear TV to consumer media in other ways That has put downward pressure on ad revenue even with the inclusion of new ways of measuring viewers of timeshifted TV like Live This is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX has become such a powerhouse and Hulu and Amazon Prime NASDAQ AMZN have continued to grow their streaming user base licensing deals with the new players but that has made them even more compelling to consumers as the quality of streaming content rises and a growing number of people see no reason to enter into payTV agreements While the cable networks unit of the company generated billion in revenue in revenue during the third quarter which accounted for percent of overall revenue Operating income from the segment accounted for over percent of all operating income in the third quarter for all segments of the company Disney isnt as confident as it has been in the past in regard to operating income as it downwardly revised its guidance from growth in the highsingle digits to growth in the midsingle digits for fiscal My major overall concern in the cable networks unit is the loss of subscribers with ESPN It is definitely a bellwether of the segment and if its losing subscribers it will be difficult to find ways to stem the trend of shrinking operating income I dont disagree concerning the pace of cordcutting mentioned earlier but that doesnt take into account the next recession When that happens which is inevitable the number of people abandoning payTV will accelerate The reason thats a surety is consumers start cutting back on nonessentials in difficult economic times Not only that but its my belief that once payTV is cut off the majority of consumers who will get used to different online content options will have no interest in getting back into payTV The gradual decline in payTV is a legitimate threat and that trend will continue But the threat will be exasperated by the recession and thats where Disney will experience some serious challenges concerning its operating income The company wont be able to avoid it Neither will its competitors From the reaction to the disappointing performance of ESPN and slowing operating income growth Disney is poised to take a big hit when the US economy slows No traditional media company with exposure to linear TV will be able to fend off the streaming trend Disney is no exception no matter how the company may spin it ESPN is proof of that being one of the strongest pieces of content aired by any media company An interesting observation about ESPN as it relates to cordcutting is either consumers love it and identify it as one of the major reasons for signing up for payTV or its listed as one of the reasons consumers hate payTV primarily because its the most expensive content and those having no interest in sports feel cheated in having to pay for costly content they have no interest in Its the same with a variety of content offered on payTV viewers have no desire to watch Thats of course the impetus behind the pressure to provide a la carte TV Disney and other media companies oppose that because the resist breaking up the content bundle The drop in profits in the music industry is a major reason traditional media will fight to the end to maintain the status quo Unfortunately theyre not going to win that battle as an increasing number of people will simply not sign up for payTV while existing consumers cut the cord Linear TV will continue to shrink as will ad revenue There will be new opportunities and pressure to license content but that wont replace the revenue and earnings the weakening business model of the industry used to provide Disney as with all major media companies will have to engage in a balancing act going forward There is no doubt the old ways of doing business are gradually disappearing along with profits in the cable business That means the company will have to make the changes necessary to remain competitive even as the business no longer generates the type of returns it has in the past There may be occasional exceptions but I dont see Disney returning to the type of cable results in had in the past That means an ongoing reduction in the pace of growth in its operating income and even My thought is operating income should be one of the key metrics to watch in the months ahead as that will tell the most accurate story of the health and future growth prospects of the company Source CordCutting Eating Into Disneys Operating Income
