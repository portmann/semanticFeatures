class='textDiv'>Apple And Hollywood What In The World Is Going On Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>have largely been dominating the streaming content field but the feeling is Apple will soon get involved Apple is currently working on a few original productions but none are expected to be the launching pad for a fullfledged roster Reports have surfaced that Apples delay in launching top tier scripted programming comes from a level of disorganization it hasnt seen in the past A general feeling is growing that Hollywood has thus far been unwilling to work with Apple due to its very handson approach and desire to move slowly into the space Apple likely knows that to make an impact it has to enter the market with a splash similar to what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>did with House of Cards While the attention in the streaming media battles has been on Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX reports have recently surfaced that Apple NASDAQ AAPL could soon enter the marketplace Of course weve heard these rumors many times before but this latest round sheds some light on why there is a holdup Although will it really make a difference The news about Apple starting an original TV division started popping up again earlier this year when a new Dr Dreproduced limited series was uncovered by the media However it soon became clear that while scripted this was for release on Apple Music and not part of a larger streaming TV empire for now Just the other week though Apple was in the news again regarding a show in development with Ben Silverman and william about the creation of apps This one while not confirmed seems like it will be an Apple TViTunes exclusive Neither the Dr Dre project nor the one about apps screams to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon watch out here we come but that just may be the point Apple is smart and its team doesnt want to just dip its toe into the streaming waters it wants to dock a massive yacht And if you think about it it makes sense Before House of Cards we werent talking about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a streaming giant and it took until last year for Amazon to really enter the conversation when Transparent and The Man In The High Castle caught on Then theres Hulu which after being around for years just became an actual player in the original streaming content game this winter when and The Path debuted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>knew signing Kevin Spacey and David Fincher was a big deal that would get immediate attention but it seemingly took Amazon and Hulu a little while to grasp that concept Now to be fair Im sure they had conversations about a bigger rollout and ultimately decided the slow and steady approach was smart but it has led to a massive imbalance of power here If Apple wants to compete from the jump they have to come in with a lineup of series that look like a broadcast networks fall roster on steroids And investors as well as analysts need to understand that type of roster takes time What Apple looks to be doing is the equivalent of what Hulu and Amazon did to start which is prepping smaller projects but here they are earmarked for other divisions That is an important distinction because this way the company gets the experience of developing new content but without the fear of it being underwhelming In a manner of speaking they get to have their cake and eat it to for the moment The twist is that reports are beginning to surface that Apples planning stage may be more intense than usual namely its becoming so disorganized that frustration is beginning to take over Apple reportedly spent most of the Sundance this year in secret meetings with the goal of luring top talent but it doesnt sound like it went well The problem is that Hollywood seems resistant to its approach which has been nicknamed the twolane method Basically the perception is Apple is content to trickle out these smaller projects now as a prolonged semibeta stage that gooses the numbers of its other key divisions While this is happening they can take more time to build an army of larger series that would rival Netflixs roster Industry executives however want Apple to jump right in now and that paired with Apples notorious reputation for perfection and owning all aspects of a project is not making for good bedfellows With that said while the disorganized rumors are spreading it likely wont impact the end result Apple is known for making sure its buttoned up before going wide with announcements and it is easy to imagine the madcap scramble that precedes a big reveal This is part of the scramble but its just getting amplified because its all so new Even though only a handful of people know what Apples big plan actually is and its current pitfalls the truth is Apple is very likely going to enter this space at some point It is also likely they will do so in a way that will appeal to consumers investors and analysts but in typical Apple fashion we arent going to know about it until they are good and ready Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this
