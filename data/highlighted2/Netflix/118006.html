Here, Apple would provide logistic support, including centralized billing, but the provider would be responsible for streaming and would "own" the customer and that revenue.Apple would receive a fee, a percentage of the subscription.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This would be similar to the app store (where Apple takes 30% and gives the rest to the app developers) and what's presumably done with HBO Now. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The question is: How much could Apple potentially make from a streaming TV service? (Uncertainty) </span>The NY post article reports that Apple is asking 30% (what it charges for apps and in app purchases in the App Store), but that this is being negotiated.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This seems hard to justify given the economics of the situation. (Uncertainty) </span>My guess is that 15-20% will be the final number for Apple's fee.To analyze this, let's look at some facts, all for the U.S. market.At the end of 2014, the US contained ~120,600,000 households.Of these, over 96 million had broadband internet.Also about 96 million are pay-TV subscribers of some sort.The number of cable TV subscribers in 2014 was 39,250,000, down from 41 million in 2013.Cable industry revenues from subscriptions for 2013 were $99 billion, up from $72 billion the year before.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The average monthly cable subscription fee was $86 in 2011 and is expected to be $123 in 2015, and may top $200 in 2020. (Uncertainty) </span>So how much of this pie can Apple expect to ingest?"TV Everywhere viewing, for example, has seen 282% growth year-over-year, with Apple TV devices doubling their share of premium video viewing quarter over quarter from 5% to 10%-overtaking Roku."( Adobe Digital Index - ADI) OTT services are growing rapidly, and The chart shows that Apple devices have an enormous lead in video viewing, and that the Apple TV has shown a remarkable gain (to 10%) over the past year to become the No. 1 set-top box.There have been many reports that cable cutting is becoming more common, particularly in the desirable 18-34 age range, where 90% stream video .Additionally, cable companies have terrible customer satisfaction ratings .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This means that Apple is now positioned to break out as the leader in OTT enablement and that a well accepted streaming service could very well provide the impetus to initiate a mass migration to OTT, cable-cutting services. (Uncertainty) </span>Note the plummeting blue line below.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That's Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ) and Time Warner Cable's (NYSE: TWC ) revenue going down the drain as consumers are increasingly cutting the cord in favor of set-top boxes like Roku and Apple TV: I am assuming that the service would work on the second model given above, with Apple being a facilitator and not a replacement cable company, and that Apple will receive a fee for its services. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So I'm focusing on the approximately $140 billion in cable and satellite subscription revenue just to get an idea of what's possible. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I'm projecting out three to five years and making the following assumptions that are a bit aggressive, but not irrational. (Uncertainty) </span>In five years 30% of current subscribers will switch from cable/satellite to OTT network TV provisioning.These subscribers represent 40% of revenues, that's $56 B, as higher paying customers see the most benefit, and thus are more likely to switch.Driver of switch is a 20% reduction in cost to consumer.(Also more flexibility in choice.)This reduction of subscription fees gives a total OTT subscription value of $45 B ($56 x .80).Apple streaming service provides 50% of this new, overall OTT service - $22.5 B. Apple takes 10% to 20% fee, for income of $2.25 B to $4.5 B.The result is that Apple sees an annual revenue stream of up to $4.5 billion - and this is just the US.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>At first glance, this does not seem that large compared to Apple's $212 billion ttm gross revenue, but one needs to remember that this would be almost all profit. (Uncertainty) </span>Apple would not directly stream any content.Apple TV would only make the connection and Apple would handle billing.The expenses for this would not be great since the infrastructure and procedures are already in place for related services.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Therefore, I would suggest that about 80% of Apple's cut would go to the bottom line. (Uncertainty) </span>(Note: this is not 80% of the streaming revenue.)If you add in international sales, then revenue would grow to the $3 to $5 billion range, and net would be $2.4 to 4 billion.This would add up to 8% of the last 12 months net income of $48 B.This is significant indeed for what's essentially a sideline to the main business.Interestingly, Barron's reported on a conference call with JPMorgan analysts discussing this very topic.While they were working on the model that Apple would provide a complete service with more or less fixed subscription rates, they used similar margins giving estimates for 5%, 17% and even up to 26%.They note: Turning to the cable and telco implications, Cusick noted that he's always been very skeptical about claims regarding Apple storming the TV content world.Said Cusick, there was always "a misunderstanding by tech investors of the complexity of the bundle," such as Disney-ESPN or Fox and Fox News.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This argues to my reasoning that the independent channel model may be more likely as it sidesteps these issues. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The downside here is that discounts for buying multiple channels may be difficult to manage. (Uncertainty) </span>This model also is supported by the NY Post article.Apple reported in January that it had sold some 25 million Apple TV units since the product was initiated.This reflected an increase of 5 million for the previous announcement nine months earlier.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This is tiny compared to the roughly 700 million iPhones sold worldwide to date. (Uncertainty) </span>While no one expects Apple TV sales to reach that number, clearly there is room for growth.With growth already accelerating, it is easy to see 100 million units installed in just a couple of years.A more powerful new product with new streaming, apps, games and Home Center should drive real growth, add a significant revenue stream, and bring new customers to the platform.As such, it is the epicenter of Apple's new strategy.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As we have seen, streaming video alone could easily add $2.4 billion to the bottom line (or even more if our assumptions turn out to be conservative). (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That would be roughly $0.50 per share. (Uncertainty) </span>It is important to note that this revenue is not the only motivation behind Apple's venture into streaming, and I think this is essential for the investor to note if he is to understand Apple.The other features of the device (apps, games, home control center) all add up to make it uniquely suitable to this function.As such, it will bring the Apple ecosystem to more and more people, as described here .An April 30 Parks Associates press release noted: "The paradigm is changing, thanks to the growing amount of online and OTT content available to connected CE, which has allowed streaming media devices to carve out a key niche in the connected home," said Barbara Kraus, Director of Research, Parks Associates."With the popularity of content streaming, CE manufacturers must innovate to create unique user experiences."Source: Apple Streaming - Potentially Worth Billions To The Bottom Line Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
