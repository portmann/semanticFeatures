bearish thesis from late is unfolding and we appear to have underestimated the extent to which the market may revalue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>At NFLXs current price of per share the company still trades at an irrational level we expect further selling pressure in and have lowered our PT Our price target is now or downside from current price as US growth slows significant challenges remain in international markets and NFLX raises additional debt On December when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX was trading at per share and the stock was approaching record highs we published <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is Positioned for a Major Stumble in and said the following Several warning signs are emerging at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and these cautionary indicators suggest that the stock has far outpaced the fair value of the business and a correction is likely to occur in Based on our outlook we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is overvalued by at least and there are several catalysts in place that may spark a selloff in In our view investors in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should proceed with caution in and prepare for the possibility of a substantial correction in the stock price given the extreme optimism the bull case is based upon and the implications of even a modest shortfall to these expectations With the stock now trading at and below the price at the time of our initial projection we are reducing our oneyear target price from per share to per share Earlier in the month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>traded briefly below per share before rebounding and regaining some of its losses However we believe this price momentum is temporary and the stock may fall an additional over the next twelve months We believe Netflixs subscriber growth momentum in the US streaming market will slow more dramatically than originally anticipated and expansion in the international streaming markets will be far more challenging than management expects particularly in China Given our revised outlook the still frothy valuation at an enterprise value of billion and the unabated selling over the past month we believe investors should remain cautious and stay on the sidelines until the stock reaches our twelve month price target of per share In our view the companys fourth quarter results show signs of fundamental weakness despite the fact that company exceeded consensus expectations for EPS adjusted EPS compared to estimates of and narrowly missed on revenue billion compared to estimates of billion We are concerned by the lower US net adds in the fourth quarter which were below our conservative estimate for net adds We have therefore lowered are forecast for We now expect total US members to reach million by down from our previous projection This revised projection reflects the continual erosion of Netflixs leadership position in the US as Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Prime gains momentum and to a lesser extent Hulu Hypercompetition in a saturated market will lead to lower prices which will put tremendous pressure on Netflixs operating margins In our view an increase in the US contribution margin to by is very unlikely With the margin currently at we believe it may tick up in to but the longterm trend suggests it may revert to the low s With that being said the most significant risk to the bull thesis is lower international growth Many of the bulls argue that robust international growth justifies Netflixs current valuation and even a substantially higher valuation We strongly disagree with this conclusion and believe investors are significantly overestimating the amount of growth management will achieve in international subscribers over the next five years as well as in the longterm In addition to intense competition there are three significant hurdles that will prevent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>from replicating the success of its US business on a global scale and the company will ultimately do very poorly by following its current international expansion strategy The first hurdle is the creation of content that is original relevant and matches the language of the local market Countries where there is a language match we would expect to see the company do well But in other markets content creation will be very expensive and success will be far from guaranteed In fact we believe in the next five years management will have to reevaluate which international markets are viable and have promise In countries where Netflixs business model is not viable we would expect to see an exit and an impairment of investments in the market Secondly the payment terms and systems in each market will pose various challenges for management There may be markets where many consumers do not have access to credit or debit cards The introduction of gift cards and prepaid cards will require significant investments and it is not certain whether the consumer will adopt these forms of payments Additionally consumers in certain international markets will likely be more price sensitive Thirdly the cost of complying with local regulations in the aggregate will be substantial In many countries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be required to build a presence hire staff pay local taxes and licensing fees and comply with censorship laws We believe this factor will provide an additional headwind for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>In the face of these significant hurdles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will also have to overcome existing and strong local competitors In our view the road ahead for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be very challenging and Netflixs valuation does not currently reflect this With management launching in countries on January th we believe expectations are far too high and only a small portion of these countries represent attractive longterm markets for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>For the most part the economics of the various international markets will be vastly different than the economics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has enjoyed in the US As a result we believe there will be significantly lower market penetration internationally and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will experience sustained operating losses in excess of million We believe the overly ambition expansion plans will drive operating losses in excess of million per quarter by Based on our projections for growth we now expect revenue to increase from billion in to billion in We expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to earn per share in At the current stock price of per share the stock is trading at times projected EPS The projections are not without risk If the company continues to burn through cash free cash flow totaled million in Q and million in to develop original content earnings per share will decline The company will be forced to issue net debt to cover the cash shortfall and interest expense and leverage will increase dramatically over the next five years The company already indicated that it will raise additional debt in late or early We believe this suggests that the company may fail to meet our conservative growth projections through which would lower the stock further below our price target Mark Cuban who disclosed his substantial stake in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in recently announced that he bought puts against his entire position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>This is not exactly a vote of confidence by a wellinformed longterm shareholder We believe he will ultimately sell his shares and may take advantage of the recent nearterm rebound in the stock price to the highs to sell a portion of his position Furthermore we believe many bulls who believe the increased competition and lower profits in the US will be overshadowed by sustained and robust international growth may be in for an unpleasant surprise With a trailing PE of well over forward PE over and EVEBITDA of we believe Netflixs stock price is still irrational and the degree to which the stock price contracts is unknown Based our reasonable assumptions for US and international growth we still see a further decline in the stock price in the next year of to per share The selloff may take the price lower and we will closely monitor Q results and provide updates
