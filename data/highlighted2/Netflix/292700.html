have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>faces growing competitive pressure at home This is nothing new but doubts over its ability to grow it US subscriber base is one of the causes of the stocks volatility <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its supporters hope to continue the success story through international expansion In this article I provide a European mediumterm perspective on Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX international expansion Further I want to quickly comment on the upcoming earnings Enough has been said about the growing competitive pressure from the likes of Hulu HBO Youtube and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Instant video At this point the bear thesis on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has in my opinion convincingly made the case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offering a commodity service that people will have no problem leaving for a competitor In the past weeks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has seen enormous intraday swings in both directions following various updates This past week ITG research released a statement expecting lower Q domestic revenues from slowing subscriber growth Earlier investors were surprised by the announcement to go live in more countries With earnings upcoming after the next trading day with Monday being a trading holiday investors will focus on two key metrics US and international subscriber growth Prior to the last ten days of carnage one could have made the argument that disappointing domestic subscriber growth has already been priced in However with global equity markets plummeting and no relief in sight any further negative news on subscriber count could send shares well below People did not exactly buy the whole credit card renewal story <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>tried to sell last time as a reason for losing some subscribers Hence I would feel very uncomfortable as a shareholder going into earnings right now Aside from this upcoming catalyst I want to quickly talk international expansion Thats right You probably did not hear that one first from me If you are American you might The majority of this sites audience is NorthAmerican and contributors myself included focus on US companies This might sometimes introduce bias when trying to make investment decisions Namely the composition fallacy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>US has sizable offerings on TV shows movies standup comedy both old and new content plus proprietary <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content This is generally not true for European <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>versions Apparently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has not been able to obtain licensing rights for major franchises available on US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Instead a sparse offering is propped up with some local shows that I suspect were cheap to license The point is that there is a different streaming culture in Europe Illegal streaming sites with thousands of movies are rampant and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>users here often try to access the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>through browserplugins or other VPN services In fact this requires zero technical expertise because VPN providers have understood that location spoofing for consumer content is a big market Consequently they market oneclick plugandplay location spoof services directly to media consumers eg Cyberghost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has now announced that they want to bring an end to this practice In my opinion this will cause them problems with reaching a critical mass of subscribers in many countries While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is shifting from licensing content to primarily distributing their own content this has not happened yet If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>were distributing just their own content a worldwide uniform offering would be straightforward It will take years to build a more substantial base of their own contents that could stand on its own Until then I view the limited offerings of international <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>versions as an additional risk Amazon has a distinct advantage in Europe through student offers many people get accustomed to the perks of Amazon Prime and thus also have access to Instant Video As Amazon grows its video content users will have even more reason to stay with Amazon Prime Meanwhile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is fighting an uphill battle if it wants to limit users to their own country and has to acquire licensing rights for European countries separately I see a substantial chance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>pulling a GoPro NASDAQ GPRO that is Investors realizing that just like small portable cameras streaming platforms are commodities that you can subscribe and cancel to whenever you feel like the competition has something better for you to watch Netflixs subscriber base might be a lot more volatile than management would like us to believe Investors have been focusing too much on subscriber growth and not enough on retention In this article I have outlined an additional layer of risk that is orthogonal to homegrown competitive pressure Combined with a collapsing equity market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could be hit extremely hard both immediately after upcoming earnings and shorter term from an investment climate that might seek to reduce its exposure to extremely high valued tech stocks If you can stomach the volatility I would recommend to wait out earnings and then buy puts with a strike price </div></body></html>
