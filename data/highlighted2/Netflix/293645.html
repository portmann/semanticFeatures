class='textDiv'>Nicks Picks Introduction And Core Positions Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL DIS JNJ MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article I know Im a little late here but the market has been volatile and keeping up with research has been taking up a lot of my writing time lately In this piece I discuss my outlook for and begin discussing my favorite individual companies to buy right now I will update this Nicks Picks portfolio throughout the year There will be no trading picks made in January are meant to last the year At the end of December well see just how well Ive done In late December when I began thinking about putting this piece together if you would have asked me whether or not would turn out to be a volatile year my answer would have been an assured yes I saw the market facing several potentially significant headwinds which worried me moving forward in the short term I thought that many of the issues that caused fear in the markets last August and September especially those pertaining to valuations corporate earnings and the current elephant in the room China werent really solved but rather overlooked as the market improved off of the recent flash crash lows Because of this Ive been selectively raising cash within my portfolio for months In August when panic struck in the markets I was sitting on cash Today Im at roughly a level I feel much more comfortable with due to market volatility and my own worries regarding a global economic slowdown But even with worries like these sitting much closer to the front of my mind today than they have in years I would have never expected to see the year start off in such a negative manner Because of recent market volatility writing this piece and several others pertaining to year end reviews and picks has been put on the back burner with much of my stock market related time being dedicated toward market research and individual stock due diligence as prices fall and companies potentially going on sale Hopefully for all of our sakes things will settle down on Wall Street Id love to have more time to write instead of checking and rechecking target price data as the markets fluctuate But either way I hope to find time in the coming days to knock my year end pieces out soon because New Years picks for being published in February or March just doesnt seem right Needless to say I need to get these pieces done soon I say all of this as an apology of sorts in my own mind I had a time table for a series of upcoming pieces Obviously now that time line is busted However I hope that you all will find this series which will be focused on my favorite investing opportunities for entertaining even though Im technically a week or two late So when it comes to due to my wider market concerns and anxiety my focus is on value names especially those with abnormally high yields I will be focusing on healthy balance sheets and positive cash flows I will be looking for well diversified companies with defensible moats and premiere market positions Simply put I will be attempting to reduce speculation to a minimum using fundamentals to target value rather than focusing on top line growth which has worked well for investors in recent years I think eventually well get to the point where the FANG phenomena will come to an end these are obviously great innovative disruptive companies though as risk assessment and management shifts more in line with global economic conditions I expect that capital will flow into more reliable business operations based on the fundamentals rather than speculative future growth I know that proponents of value investing have been saying that momentum type valuations will come back down to earth for years now I cant say for certain that will be the year though I feel much better right now putting new money into highly profitable value names rather than companies with sky high valuations solid top line growth but nothing to show for it in terms of earnings Im expecting to look a lot like with regard to market volatility and lacking growth I think that once again this will be a stock pickers market I wouldnt be surprised to see the major averages flat or down for the year again simply put I just see more headwinds and tailwinds right now I worry about commodity and credit cycles winding down and potentially bottoming out With that being said I dont think investors are doomed by any means I was able to generate a respectable positive return in which was a down year for the major indexes and I hope to achieve the same thing in regardless of market conditions Obviously this portfolio will be managed different from my own Here I plan on selecting stocks now in January and letting them sit through the year In my personal portfolio I will be much more active when managing positions However due to the apparent value I see in the market right now I think investors who are comfortable with a more passive buyandhold approach can be successful as well Only time will tell however I will revisit this Nicks Picks portfolio throughout the year on a quarterly basis to track performance I will admit that a lot has changed since I began thinking about this piece and putting together my favorite picks list for in late Obviously or so being hacked off of the major averages has created a lot more value than there was before What was a list of a handful of companies whose valuations were intriguing has grown in recent weeks and because of this Ive decided to break my picks down into sections rather than post one interminably long piece Ive decided to break down this list down by sector andor industry though this first piece will be a bit different When thinking about my picks Ive decided to create a portfolio of sorts which will enable us all to look back at my January picks in late December and see how well I did prognosticating one year out I hope to make this Nicks Picks a bit of a tradition I think it has a nice ring to it It will be fun to compare yy performance and I invite others to do something similara friendly competition of sorts Because of this portfolio format this piece will be focused on core positions for the year The three stocks that will make up my core are Apple NASDAQ AAPL Disney NYSE DIS and Johnson Johnson NYSE JNJ These three companies are what I consider to be the best of the best in their given areas of the market All three are selling at or below what I believe their fair valuations to be They are well diversified I know some of you may be rolling your eyes when I say this regarding Apple Ill discuss this in a bit and have wide competitive moats And lastly they each pay a highly respectable dividend either in terms of yield growth or a combination of the two Enough general pleasantries though I think its time we dive into the individual company specifics and my rationale for them holding dominant positions on my picks list Apple has long been one of my favorite holdings I see it as a defensive pick due to its gorgeous balance sheet and namely the massive cash pile its built up over the years Albeit most of this cash is stuck overseas until there are changes made to the corporate tax code here in the US However I can only assume the great minds employed by Apple can find someone productive to do with those funds in international markets Apples tremendous buy back is a bullish signal in my eyes I think the companys single digit PE ratio means the billions dedicated toward buying back shares have been and will continue to be well spent I know some dont agree with buybacks with phrases like financial engineering coming to mind but the way I see it if shares are significantly under valued then retiring them is a great thing for longterm owners in terms of value creation And speaking of valuation I dont buy into the mindset that Apple deserves a x PE ratio in line with other hardware companies Sure the vast majority of its revenues come from hardware and namely the iPhone but I think the company has built a vibrant ecosystem and brand name which justifies a premium on shares Apples hardware is of much higher quality that its competitors and because of this the company has a strong global following of fans some so serious that theyre accused of cultlike passion This sort of market place reaction isnt something that should be taken lightly Apples brand name is high recognizable and well respected This stock has been in trouble as of late but the company is doing just fine When you buy Apple shares today youre getting a blue chip technology company for x earning estimates Youre getting exposure to a company with nearly B in revenuesrevenues that increased last year Youre getting exposure to nearly B in free cash flows or roughly share which covers the companys dividend by a wide margin Because of this I expect for the dividend to continue to grow annually probably in the high single to low double digit range for the foreseeable future Looking over the financials really the only negative I see for Apple is the fact that the company has added a significant amount of longterm debt to the balance sheet over the last several years previously the company had none I dont like companies I own raising debt unnecessarily but I also imagine that management was happy to lock in the low rates while they were still around and it wouldnt take long for this debt to be paid down if the focus needed to shift to balance sheet repair rather than shareholder returns All in all I think that by investing money into Apple at todays price and valuation Im much more likely than not to see the value of those funds increasing years down the road Sure there may be more tough times as the market worries about things like iPhone sales falling margins and a general lacking of innovation But I am willing to put my faith and dollars with the great minds that Apple has amassed and their ability to continue to be the predominant big tech company in the world moving forward Do I know what the next hot must have product in the world will be No Do I think it will be the Apple Watch No But if I had to guess Id say that Apple is more likely to create this product than any other tech company out there and ifwhen it does Im sure it will fit in seamlessly into the iEcosystem that already exists further driving demand for and general fandom of all things Apple Im intrigued by Project Titan and although Im not a huge fan of the auto industry I think an Apple car could be interesting especially as cars become driverless and transition from a tool of travel to a pod of entertainmentproductivity I can imagine an Apple car acting as a mobile office or play room which is where the companys vast ecosystem comes into play Obviously this potential reality is years if not decades down the road But as a longterm investor these are the types of things I consider when investing I think the Apple TV which has been discussed for ages it seems could still be a huge success especially if the company were to use that massive cash pile to acquire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX or create a competitor in streaming of its own I dont imagine the barriers to entry here are too incredibly high licensing content could be costly though I imagine that the strength of Apples brand name would help with this and combine these entities into a hardwaresoftwareservice bundle that Im sure the public would love This transition into streaming could coincide with original content which is what were seeing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon currently I think Apple more so than most companies has nice potential synergies within its ecosystem for cobranding content I know what Im essentially doing here is turning Apple and its immense portfolio of offering in terms of both hardware and services into a Disneylike entertainment empire where one success trickles down into other areas of business eventually creating a snowball effect in terms of revenues I know there is quite a lot of speculation going on here I also know that I said I was attempting to minimize speculation when making these picks making myself a bit of a hypocrite though I really wanted to highlight the potential that Apple has with its cash pile which it has amassed due to its profitability However when I attempt to peer into the future while many things are hazy some arent so much I expect barring some sort of megacatastrophe that mankind will continue to invent new technologies and innovate exist ones making life easier I expect that many jobs will continue to be mechanized and efficiency in just about all aspects of life will increase This increased efficiency will likely create freetime I know some will take full advantage of this to continue to be innovative pushing society ever forever However many wont I expect that as free time increases so will demand for entertainment and content This is why looking at companies in the longterm Im bullish on those whose technology will play a part in this efficient future and those whose products and services will fill voids created by such When I look at Apple I see a company in a unique position to play a role in both which is why I am satisfied holding an overweight core position Apple is a core holding in my personal portfolio as well Just imaginean Apple car driving itself efficiently down the highway as you lean back doing business on a Macbook mounted on a shelf where the steering wheel used to be as your wife shops in the beside you on her tablet verbally relaying the family grocery list to Siri which will put in the order including payment with Apple Pay with the kids sitting behind you enjoying their favorite new Apple branded content on the Apple TV mounted to the dash Oh and I forgot everyone is constantly checking their iPhones for the latest status updates and notifications Sure no one is looking out the window enjoying natures bounty thats a bit depressing But later Junior and Sally will strap on their Apple virtual reality devices and explore the worlds wonders from the comfort of their beds at home Now if that isnt diversification I dont know what is But back to reality Most importantly in the near to medium term this is an article about picks after all I dont believe the world is peak smartphone levels I think Apple will continue to benefit from people switching to smartphones for the first time I also think Apple will continue to take market share from competitors in the smartphone market I worry a bit about pricing wars here and what that might do to margins but I also believe that the cream eventually rises to the top and Apples quality will prevail Eventually Apple will need to find growth elsewhere but I dont think will be that year If youve followed me for any time here on Seeking Alpha you know that Im a huge Disney fan I know you shouldnt become emotionally attached to your holdings but its difficult with this one Disney World is the happiest place on earth after all Needless to say this is one of my favorite companies to own I firmly believe that in the long run content is king when it comes to entertainment and I cant think of any other company with a better content offering than Disney CEO Bob Iger has done a wonderful job during his tenure of picking up and bolting on content brands to the already strong stable of characters that Disney has to offer The most noteworthy examples of this are the Pixar Marvel and Lucasfilm acquisitions all of which have turned out to be massive successes for the company paying for themselves in short order and solidifying the Mouse atop the mountain of todays popculture cinema It takes a keen eye to spot diamonds in the rough like the quickly fading comic book characters of the last century I know that Bob Iger wont be at the helm of DIS forever but while hes there I feel very comfortable accumulating shares But its not only the new additions that have been revived DIS has recently ingeniously began the process of revamping its legacy characters and their timeless stories with live action offerings These films wont be the mega block buster type hits like Star Wars and the Marvel films though they do a wonderful job of keeping the older content fresh in our minds bolstering the draw of the more classic aspect of the theme parks and merchandise offerings Like Apple above Disney too has created a thriving ecosystem for itself allowing success in one of its many areas of business to flow into the others creating organic demand and profits across the board With superheroes princesses and heroes from a galaxy far far away in the forefront of the publics mind DIS has once again locked in a generation of life long fans fans who will likely pass down this love of all things Mouse to their children refreshing the cycle behind my longterm investment thesis DIS has experienced pain in the markets lately because investors fear that cord cutting will do great harm to the companys largest revenue stream its cable division lead by the world wide leader in sports ESPN and its family of networks I see the data with regard to cord cutting and I think the theme is real However I see profits rising quarter after quarter in the face of this Also I find it hard to believe that if we were do go to a la carte television DIS will be able to charge a healthy premium for its skinny bundle due primarily to the importance of live sporting events on the ESPN networks Disney may have over paid but the content theyve locked down from the major sporting leagues will continue to serve them well regardless of what the future television models looks like I for one would be willing to pay a hefty sum to watch games year round Granted Im an avid sports fan and I know others arent though I think those like me wouldnt be willing to miss out on the live content that they love and would be willing to pay the price I think Iger is smart enough to navigate these waters and Im certain he and other top management have a plan in place for the shift should it ever become complete For specifically Im not only looking forward to the impact that its content will have on earnings but the major opening of the Shanghai theme park as well This park set to open midJune will make it much easier for hundreds of millions of people to experience Disney at its finest I like the move into the China market and I expect DIS to continue to build megaresorts like this in other high growth areas of the developing world especially if Shanghai in the success so many expect it will be This resort should not only drive revenue with ticket sales but drastically expand upon DISs worldwide fan base bumping up interest in future content in China as well With Star Wars boosting earnings in the first half of the year and Disney Shanghai boosting in the second half I expect another year of out performance by the Mouse Like AAPL I feel very comfortable investing in DIS shares Its upside content far outweighs and cord cutting downside in my opinion I continue to buy shares on weakness and with monthly flexible reinvestments I cant imagine a world without Disney and therefore I have a hard time imagining a situation where it doesnt hold an overweight core position in my portfolio I will say that as of late it seems like analysts are coming out of the wood work expressing fear with regard to DISs revenues some even downgrading the stock This has attributed toward recent downward pressure Now its up to investors to decide whether or not DISs selloff has created a buying opportunity or not Its obvious that Im not really all that worried about the issues highlighted by these professionals Granted Im sure that these men and women have reason for their negative publications Although Im not worried doesnt mean that I dont think its prudent to take these risks into consideration and put a hedge in place to mitigate them Cord cutting seems to be the biggest issue facing DIS due to the cable networks segment of the company making up a large share of its revenues although Barclays released a note adding studio segment growth to its list of DIS concerns Because of this the cord cutting not the studio growth I have no qualms with Disneys studio performance I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the obvious hedge for a long Disney position In the introduction to this piece I made it clear that due to macro fears related to the market Im focusing on value for I dont think there is any question that NFLX is overvalued trading at nearly x consensus earnings for However a hedge would be a relatively small position in this case so even if NFLX tanks due to valuation issues it wont be the end of the world for Nicks Picks performance in Also I will mention that picking up shares of NFLX at today sounds much better than it did a month ago at So not only am I picking up a small hedge for my core position in DIS Im exposing myself to a small turnaround play should my gut be wrong about markets in and the bull overtakes the bear moving forward in the short term Johnson Johnson has been one of the greatest wealth creators for investors in Americas history This is an absolutely wonderful company and serves as one of the most defensive picks in the market No matter how bad things get with regard to the worlds economy medicine will remain important and JNJ plays a huge role here This company has a diverse offering of products and services across the spectrum in the medical industry from surgery rooms in hospitals to the nurses office at your local preschool What I like even more than JNJs established businesses is its ability as of late to target potential blockbuster drugs and to create lucrative partnerships with smaller research based biotech companies using its cash as a bank roll for progress and its weight in the industry to usher along these drugs through the trial phases quickly I view JNJ as the Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKB NYSE BRKA of medicine meaning that JNJ has turned itself into an attractive destination for companies looking for partnerships in the developmental phases of their products Like BRK JNJ has proven in recent years to be a highly productive partner for these smaller firms And although it doesnt buy them outright like BRK might JNJ isnt a conglomerate after all I expect that moving forward JNJ will continue to profit from these sort of deals and potentially give itself a competitive benefit as far as pricing power goes due to the confidence that potential partners can have in the outcome of its cobranded research Heres a wonderful article written on this subject showing how JNJ intends to profit from these partnerships moving forward After its recent weakness JNJ is offering investors exposure to this low beta blue chip name at less than x expected earnings and x estimates These low valuations come with a yield that has been increasing annually for consecutive years JNJs fiveyear DGR is This isnt outstanding for a yield but it is highly respectable and works well as a defensive anchor for a portfolio in a wearisome macro environment JNJ has a low debt load steady free cash flow a very long and illustrious history of rising earnings and a diverse series of revenue streams This is the type of company that I think most would consider to be a conservative defensive core holding and like AAPL and DIS mentioned before I sleep well knowing that I own shares of JNJ Alright words later there we have it The three core positions for the edition of the Nicks Picks portfolio are Apple Disney and Johnson and Johnson The arbitrary figure that Ive decided to use for the value of this portfolio is I will weight each of these core positions at of the portfolio meaning that using the closing price for each company on Friday January th Ill own shares of Apple at shares of Disney at and shares of JNJ at I also will be putting the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>hedge into play at a weighting or shares at As we move forward I will put all information regarding this portfolio into spreadsheets and update readers on a quarterly basis Moving forward I will use market closing prices to buy shares on the day that Ive finished each article I will begin my SP comparison for the year on January th I plan on getting the rest of these Nicks Picks pieces published by the end of January giving my selections as much time in the market as possible this series isnt about holding cash its about making picks for the year </div></body></html>
