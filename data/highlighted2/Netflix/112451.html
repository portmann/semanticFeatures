class='textDiv'>Should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Add A Free Tier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has repeatedly insisted that they will not include ads into their service We suggest that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should consider adding a free tier with ads similar to Spotify Online video streaming giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX has had significant coverage in recent years with equal amounts of hope and doubt on either side We believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>though unbelievably successful could heighten that success by considering an addition to its business model We believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should switch its model toward a dualtiered model similar to the model offered by music streaming service Spotify <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should offer a free tier and a premium tier to its users The free tier would give a user full access to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>library while introducing ads during playback The premium tier would be the exact same service that current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers receive We believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should adopt such a model for two reasons First we believe that the introduction of a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>freetier would transform the video streaming market in Netflixs favor Currently Netflixs primary competitors in the streaming market are Hulu and Amazon Prime Neither of the two services offer free unlimited access to their library Hulu offers very limited access to their streaming catalog to free users Amazon Primes instant video library is only available to Prime subscribers In a switch to our proposed dualtiered model we believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would offer the strongest video streaming product at both the free and paid pricepoints Furthermore we believe that the new model would steal free viewers from Hulus and piracys market share Second and most importantly we believe that the adoption of a freetier with ads would grow Netflixs revenues With the size of Netflixs user base <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would become one of the most indemand platforms for online advertisers While there are many different online advertising strategies we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>adopting a CPM model cost per thousand views is feasible as it is one of the models that YouTube employs We modeled such a scenario based on subscriber and viewing activity reported by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in their most recent quarter There are currently over million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers These are the assumptions we used to model the new business model of users are paid of users are free the ratio of paid to free subscribers for Spotify Industry average CPM of chart below Every minutes there are ads similar to Hulu less than TV Free and subscription users watch the same number of hours of TVMovies Based on the previous assumptions we calculate a total revenue of which is higher than their Q FY results of To examine other possible scenarios we created tables with different assumptions on the freesubscription distribution hours watched and CPM price As you can see even at the lowend of CPM prices revenue has the potential to beat current Q results of The most influential factor for NFLXs management to consider is whether the daily view count would increase enough to make the switch realistic We believe that the switch would mean a significant increase in viewing activity especially in international markets In the war for library content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is already winning by a lot Thus the additional revenue would only increase their competitive advantage from a consumer standpoint through further content acquisition and more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>original titles Orange Is the New Black House of Cards etc We know that Netflixs current business model is strong but if management is trying to increase their viewer basis by larger numbers considering a free service would be the best option Source Should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Add A Free Tier Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions
