range from to above current prices Find out which one among <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Charter and Discovery offers the best stock performance and investment value All data are as of the close of Thursday April Emphasis is on company fundamentals and financial data rather than on commentary There is a very intricate trapeze act taking place in the CATV Systems industry No sooner does one player swing to the rafters high above the rest another swoops up to take his place only to be replaced by yet another at the top of his arc moments later Perhaps the best way to negotiate our way through this industry is to use the swinging vines maneuver where we catch each company on its upswing let it go right at the top of its arc and then catch the next companys vine taking us forward through its arc to the next vine beyond Just dont forget to belt out a Tarzan yell as you go Looking back at the CATV Systems industrys recent past we have already seen one company reach its peak and be overtaken by another More of the same is forecast for the future as the leadership in earnings growth is seen changing over the near term and changing yet again longer term Yet by the end of todays competition even these leaders are ultimately overtaken by another which isnt even a growth play at all but one of value Having already compared Americas Largest CATV Systems

completely dominated all three of their larger rivals putting on a dazzling trapeze show for all to marvel at as graphed below Where the broader SP index black has gained since then the th largest Charter blue and th largest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>beige have been swinging high above their peers repeatedly switching positions in the top two spots at least times At the time this most current snap shot was taken five of the six largest US companies in the space are beating the SP as ranked below th largest Charter with gains of th largest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with gains of rd largest DSH gray with gains of largest TWC orange with gains of and nd largest DTV yellow with gains of The th largest Discovery purple for its part falls just a little shy of the market with gains of though only just recently after three full years of market outperformance Yet over the past six months since the correction of Q our top two acrobats are at completely opposite ends with Charter still in top spot while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>drops to last spot slightly below the previous trailer Discovery Two of our three underdogs have been knocked back in their places as the only two of the six to be negative The trapeze act has reshuffled yet again since the pullback of late January We once again have two underdogs in the upper half of the grouping this time with Discovery in rd place while Charter is still on top <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for its part is now all alone at the bottom as its swing is decidedly on the down part of its arc By the look of future earnings growth projections this backward phase of Netflixs arc is set to continue for quite some time For the CATV Systems industry as a whole earnings growth is near the apex of its upswing as tabled below where green indicates outperformance while yellow denotes underperformance relative to the broader market During the next quarter the industrys earnings are expected to outgrow the broader markets earnings growth at some times its rate before slowing to a slightly slower but still forwardmoving times over the next five years Zoomingin a little closer Charter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are expected to continue their trapeze act trading places at the top at least once more as far as earnings growth is concerned as tabled below Over the current and next quarters combined Charter is still expected to lead its peers with a total of of earnings growth followed by TWC with in combined growth The remaining four companies are all on the backward parts of their arcs with net shrinkage ranging from to with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still at the bottom But over the next year Netflixs swing finally begins moving back up as it scores the nd best growth rate at Charter for its part is still in st spot with another impressive growth rate of with Discovery back in rd place with growth of The three underdogs are once again seen dominating their top three rivals Yet over the next five years our top two trapeze artists switch places yet again this time with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>flying above all others with average annual earnings growth of while Charter slips to the very bottom with gains of just averaged per year Discovery for its part climbs into nd place with growth of Once again we have two underdogs in the top two spots and one in the last spot just as when we first began in the first graph above only with some reshuffling of the trapeze Investors are thus given some choices If growth is your focus you might swing on Charters vine for a while which is still in its upswing and when it reaches its apex next year simply jump onto Netflixs vine to continue moving forward Value investors on the other hand have another option all together focused on the other of our three underdogs Discovery as the remainder of todays competition reveals Indeed there is more than earnings growth to consider when sizing up a company as a potential investment How do the three compare against one another in other metrics and which makes the best investment Lets answer that by comparing their company fundamentals using the following format a financial comparisons b estimates and analyst recommendations and c rankings with accompanying data table As we compare each metric the best performing company will be shaded green while the worst performing will be shaded yellow which will later be tallied for the final ranking Market Capitalization While company size does not necessarily imply an advantage and is thus not ranked it is important as a denominator against which other financial data will be compared for ranking Growth Since revenues and expenses can vary greatly from one season to another growth is measured on a yearoveryear quarterly basis where Q of this year is compared to Q of the previous year for example In the most recently reported quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>delivered the greatest trailing revenue growth yearoveryear while Discovery delivered the least Since Charters trailing earnings growth rate is not available the metric does not factor into the comparison Though it is worth noting that Netflixs earnings growth beat Discoverys which was negative denoting shrinkage Profitability A companys margins are important in determining how much profit the company generates from its sales Operating margin indicates the percentage earned after operating costs such as labor materials and overhead Profit margin indicates the profit left over after operating costs plus all other costs including debt interest taxes and depreciation Of our three contestants Discovery enjoyed the widest profit and operating margins while Charter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>split the narrowest margins between them Management Effectiveness Shareholders are keenly interested in managements ability to do more with what has been given to it Managements effectiveness is measured by the returns generated from the assets under its control and from the equity invested into the company by shareholders For their managerial performance Discoverys management team delivered the greatest returns on assets and equity where Charters team delivered the smallest returns in both losing some equity in the process Earnings Per Share Of all the metrics measuring a companys income earnings per share is probably the most meaningful to shareholders as this represents the value that the company is adding to each share outstanding Since the number of shares outstanding varies from company to company I prefer to convert EPS into a percentage of the current stock price to better determine where an investment could gain the most value Of the three companies compared here Discovery provides common stockholders with the greatest diluted earnings per share gain as a percentage of its current share price while Charters DEPS over current stock price is lowest even negative denoting loss Share Price Value Even if a company outperforms its peers on all the above metrics investors may still shy away from its stock if its price is already trading too high This is where the stock price relative to forward earnings and company book value come under scrutiny as well as the stock price relative to earnings relative to earnings growth known as the PEG ratio Lower ratios indicate the stock price is currently trading at a cheaper price than its peers and might thus be a bargain Among our three combatants Discoverys stock is the cheapest relative to forward earnings company book value and year PEG At the overpriced end of the scale where Netflixs stock is the most expensive relative to earnings Charters is the priciest relative to book and PEG B Estimates and Analyst Recommendations Of course no matter how skilled we perceive ourselves to be at gauging a stocks prospects as an investment wed be wise to at least consider what professional analysts and the companies themselves are projecting including estimated future earnings per share and the growth rate of those earnings stock price targets and buysell recommendations Earnings Estimates To properly compare estimated future earnings per share across multiple companies we would need to convert them into a percentage of their stocks current prices Of our three specimens Discovery offers the highest percentages of earnings over current stock price for all time periods while Charter offers the lowest percentages near term and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offers it for the next year Earnings Growth For longterm investors this metric is one of the most important to consider as it denotes the percentage by which earnings are expected to grow or shrink as compared to earnings from corresponding periods a year prior For earnings growth Charter offers the greatest growth for the near term where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offers it over the next five years At the low end of the spectrum where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offers the slowest growth for the near term Discovery offers it for the next year and Charter offers it over the next five years Price Targets Like earnings estimates above a companys stock price targets must also be converted into a percentage of its current price to properly compare multiple companies For their high mean and low price targets over the coming months analysts believe Netflixs stock offers the greatest upside potential and greatest downside risk while Charters offers the least upside and Discoverys offers the least downside BuySell Recommendations After all is said and done perhaps the one gauge that sums it all up are analyst recommendations These have been converted into the percentage of analysts recommending each level However I factor only the strong buy and buy recommendations into the ranking Hold underperform and sell recommendations are not ranked since they are determined after determining the winners of the strong buy and buy categories and would only be negating those winners of their duly earned titles Of our three contenders Charter is best recommended with strong buys and buys representing a combined of its analysts followed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with strong buy and buy ratings representing a combined of its analysts and lastly by Discovery with strong buy and buy recommendations representing of its analysts Having crunched all the numbers and compared all the projections the time has come to tally up the wins and losses and rank our three competitors against one another In the table below you will find all of the data considered above plus a few others not reviewed Here is where using a companys market cap as a denominator comes into play as much of the data in the table has been converted into a percentage of market cap for a fair comparison The first and last placed companies are shaded We then add together each companys finishes to determine its overall ranking with first place finishes counting as merits while last place finishes count as demerits And the winner is Discovery with a pioneering lead outperforming in metrics and underperforming in for a net score of followed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>way back on the trail outperforming in metrics and underperforming in for a net score of and with Charter waiting for a guide to show it the way outperforming in metrics and underperforming in for a net score of Where the CATV Systems industry is expected to outperform the SP broader market substantially next quarter and meaningfully next year and beyond the next three US companies in the space are expected to swing in different directions like a wellchoreographed acrobatic ballet with Charter leading all in earnings growth near term before slipping into last place longer term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bottoming out with the worst shrinkage near term before swinging back up to top spot longer term and Discovery hanging around somewhere in the middle near term before swinging into nd place longer term Yet after taking all company fundamentals into consideration Discovery Communications Inc is found to have the finest financials given its lowest stock price ratios widest profit and operating margins greatest returns on assets and equity highest EBITDA over revenue highest diluted earnings over current stock price highest future earnings over current stock price throughout and best low price target decisively winning Americas Next CATV Systems Companies competition Source Comparing Americas
