Shock Exchange New York Shock Exchange clicks NFLX sold off after the company missed on its domestic subscriber growth metrics Management blamed the miss on miscues related to new chipenabled credit cards that may have caused involuntary churn We dont believe management It needs more people to corroborate its claims The culprit for Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX recent fall was the companys underwhelming domestic subscriber growth Domestic and international subscribers were up QQ by and respectively The performance was consistent with that of Q where domestic and international subscribers grew QQ by and respectively Managements rationale for the domestic subscriber miss was involuntary churn In net additions they were down yearoveryear and that we explained and attributed to our involuntary churn or paymentsrelated churn We think partially that was due to the transition to the chip cards which is still ongoing And weve reflected that trend going forward into Q in our guidance Credit card companies are shifting to chipenabled cards If the expiration date security code etc changed on the newer cards the cards may not have worked properly Customers may then have been required to manually enter their new information and not doing so may have contributed to the involuntary churn This rationale simply does not hold water and management needs more people to corroborate its claims I Found This Odd For The Following Reasons Even if newer chipenabled cards did not work customers would have found a way to manually enter their credit card information if they wanted the service that badly I have gotten new apartments where the first thing I set up was the cable even before the furniture was installed I could not live without ESPN and watched it while organizing the furniture When I was younger and cashstrapped I tried to stretch my payables to stem cash flow However I always paid the cable bill on time I was addicted to it Managements argument is there may have been hiccups in the service yet consumers didnt frantically call to reconnect it In my opinion either customers are not addicted to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>much as we suspected or the domestic subscriber market has become saturated There are several other companies with customers who use chipenabled cards so why wasnt their subscriber base negatively impacted Had other companies made similar claims it would have lent more credence to Netflixs argument In fact some companies dismissed them But several firms and a retail industry association contacted by Reuters on Thursday including Spotify a music service with over million subscribers said they had not experienced issues with the new cards The National Retail Federation an industry group has heard nothing at all from its retail members about issues with the new cards according to J Craig Shearman vice president of government affairs public relations In Q domestic describers only grew sequentially falling shy of the expectation the stock sold off afterhours NFLX has been fueled by international subscriber growth Secondly the domestic market was thought to be saturated in Q when subscribers totaled million Why would the market expect subscribers to keep growing nearly sequentially off a Q subscriber base of million Either analysts were unrealistic or management needed to do a better job of managing expectations In addition to the renewed focus on Netflixs domestic subscribers I believe investors are now scrutinizing crowded trades Hedge funds have been making leveraged bets in the socalled FANGs Facebook NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL These firms topline growth in addition to tailwinds from QE and zero interest rates have driven their shares higher However over the past three months things have changed China threw the entire market for a loop when it devalued its currency in August It was a de facto admission that the worlds second largest economy was slowing China has recently been the biggest contributor to global economic growth A slowing China could portend a slowing global economy Secondly a Fed rate hike could stymie the general market If the Fed doesnt hike it could imply the US economy is weaker than expected which would not bode well for corporate earnings Over the past three months NFLX has been the worst performer among the FANGs having fallen about The other participants all had stellar Q earnings results which probably explains their better performance In my opinion the market has reached an inflection point pursuant to the FANGs Those that hit their metrics each quarter and continue to fire on all cylinders will remain market darlings Those that do not will sell off I do not believe managements claims about the chipenabled credit cards I believe Netflixs domestic market has become saturated and market sentiment has turned The company may hit its metrics in Q however NFLX will eventually make a misstep and the stock will sell off violently Avoid NFLX We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal
