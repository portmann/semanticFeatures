style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock is up this year We believe its overvalued by at least and has a oneyear target price of per share Netflixs US leadership position will be challenged by Amazon Prime and other competitors Further price increases will drastically slow US membership growth In our view Netflixs significant investment in original programming will be an ineffective strategy in the longterm as streaming services become more commoditized Significant downside risk for investors at current valuation Several warning signs are emerging at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and these cautionary indicators suggest that the stock has far outpaced the fair value of the business and a correction is likely to occur in We are particularly concerned that longterm investors who are holding shares in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQGS NFLX with a year investment horizon and expect considerable capital appreciation from the current level may be exposed to considerable downside risk The stock is up this year and currently has an enterprise value of billion With a ttm EBITDA of million the company is trading at x ttm EVEBITDA and at a PE of At the current valuation the bull case remains tenuous at best Many of the key assumptions driving the frothy valuation appear to be misguided and not supported by fact Based on our outlook we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is overvalued by at least and there are several catalysts in place that may spark a selloff in In the US streaming market Netflixs subscriber growth momentum has slowed dramatically The company reported a decline in net adds in the US in Q compared to Q We believe the proximate cause for the loss of momentum is the increasing appeal of competing services such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Also the recent price increase may have played a larger role in the slowdown than management will admit In our view its very unlikely that the past growth of nearly million net subscribers in each of the past four years will be replicated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for several reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>currently has captured of US TV watchers which is down slightly from in according to PricewaterhouseCoopers recent December report on the SVOD market The recent trend suggests that with such a large share and several new competitors with lower prices in the market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will face challenges in to expand this number meaningfully Secondly in our view the US SVOD market is already oversaturated and subscriber growth will likely slow to singledigits by for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>given their already large membership base and increased competition particularly from Amazon NASDAQGS AMZN In our view even though a secular shift from linear TV to ondemand internet TV will benefit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>over the next several years we believe Amazon Prime will continue to gain on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>In our view Amazon represents a legitimate direct threat to take a leadership role in the US market Amazon Prime which is priced at per month gives consumers access to Amazon Prime Video Prime Music Prime Photos the Kindle Lending Library free twoday shipping on certain items and discounted nextday shipping on certain items With over million Amazon Prime members the company is heavily focused on improving the Amazon Prime Video offering with aggressive initiatives to build original programming and by launching a new feature that gives members access to premium TV networks including Showtime and Starz In contrast we believe Netflixs exceptionally large billion bet on producing exclusive and innovative original programming will not protect it from the increased competition over the long term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a recent track record of success including developing the hit series Orange is the New Black as well as Narcos However we do not believe this a strategy which will give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a sustainable advantage over the competition Each streaming service is committed to developing original content but Netflixs large investment does not guarantee the company will continue to produce more successful projects than unsuccessful ones Moreover a December survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers confirms our view on this strategy and suggests that original programming is not as important as many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bulls would seem to believe The number of OTT subscribers who view original programming as very important is down in to from in The number also is down for those who view original programming as somewhat important in to from in Overall of OTT subscribers view original programming as not very important or not important at all We see the SVOD market as becoming more commoditized over time in a similar fashion as cable television As such Netflixs programming budget will add risk to the overall business and may only serve as a point of differentiation amid a trend toward the increasing commoditization of streaming services We therefore believe that total US memberships growth will continue to lose momentum and will result in a topline miss in We are forecasting total revenue of billion in It remains to be seen whether management can offset this stagnant domestic growth with remarkable international growth In our view there will likely be a drastic share price correction to reflect the lower projected growth Bull Case Overestimates Netflixs ARPU Pricing Power We believe the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bulls are overestimating the degree to which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can increase prices without a loss in subscribers Many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bulls argue that the two recent price increases one in May and another in October did not result in slower membership growth and indicates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has the ability to implement further increases in the future Furthermore the bulls argue as more exclusive and original programming is introduced by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>consumers will be compelled to the pay upwards of per month or beyond We disagree with this conclusion In fact we believe the recent price actions are the reason behind the loss of momentum in US membership growth and puts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>at a competitive disadvantage Ultimately in our view a significant number of consumers will move into other options such as Amazon Prime Video per month and Hulu per month that offer tremendous value Our projections for US membership growth are million net adds in and million in but we expect another price increase in early which will contribute to the slower membership growth beyond that point We believe the bulls are underestimating how costconscious customers of streaming services are and how willing customers are to switch to one of the many other providers including HBO Go YouTube Red or another new entrant Our fiveyear projection reflects the aforementioned market dynamics and the increasing competition in the crowded SVOD market We expect a topline miss and earnings miss in and project billion in revenue and EPS of for the year We believe this will serve as a catalyst for a correction in the stock price and bring the price within our oneyear target range of per share In the following years we are still projecting strong growth in revenue of per year This base case scenario illustrates how overvalued in our view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is Even with these assumptions of only slight weakening of fundamentals the fair value of the shares drops to per share We are still expecting strong EPS growth of per year over the fiveyear period and EPS in of There is a significant possibility that even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>exceeds our projection of EPS of five years from now by as much as to that the multiple on these earnings could be markedly lower in than the current multiple For example a PE ratio of in on earnings that exceed our reasonable estimate by would still put the stock price in our oneyear target of per share In our view investors in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should proceed with caution in and prepare for the possibility of a substantial correction in the stock price given the extreme optimism the bull case is based upon and the implications of even a modest shortfall to these expectations We will look to provide an update following Netflixs Q results We only use your contact details to reply to your
