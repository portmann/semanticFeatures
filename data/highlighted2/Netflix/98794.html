Alpha Report suggests <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could commence operations in India by Internet VoD subscribers in India estimated to reach million by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is reportedly turning focus to the worlds largest market for films and television shows by volume India According to a report published by Times of India the company is looking to commence operations in the country by While end consumers are delighted that theyll finally get to watch their favorite shows online legally the investing community is in a state of incertitude after hearing about this development After all the Internet television industry in India is in its nascent stages at the moment and there are several technological and demographical variables that could play spoiler for the Internet TV giant Lets attempt to gain a better understanding of Netflixs growth prospects challenges competition target clientele industry and technological hurdles it could face in India One of the distinguishing features for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is its vast streaming content library consisting of about film and TV show titles Its closest competitors Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Hulu operate with about smaller content libraries and none them have made their streaming services available in the country till date Prominent Indiabased Internet VoD services such as Hooq or Bigflix have about and smaller content catalogues respectively The absence of large competitors in the country is a big plus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have the entire Indian OTT TV market to itself Indias overthetop OTT video industry is poised to explode over the coming years There were about million OTT subscribers in the country during which Media Partners Asia NYSE MPA estimates will grow to million by and ultimately expand to million by a staggering CAGR of To have a better understanding of the scale OTT video subscribers in the US will amount to million by about lower than Indias projected subscriber base The timing to enter India is impeccable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would effectively be well poised to benefit from this impending exponential growth Another striking strength is Netflixs target audience A report published by Nielsen in reveals that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is popular mostly among the youth with of its subscribers falling in the age bracket of years This bodes well with its expansion plans in India as of all Indian Internet subscribers are reportedly under the age of This essentially means that the shows that appeal to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>US subscribers might as well appeal to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>India subscribers Netflixs massive base of million subscribers across nations should in turn allow it to expand with ease Striking licensing deals with Hindi content producers will immediately expand its reach to Hindispeaking audience based in countries such as the US England Australia and Canada where English is the official language More to the point striking such Hindicontent deals will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to enter countries such as Pakistan Bangladesh Nepal and Sri Lanka where Indian films and TV shows are widely popular something that would also contribute toward achieving its goal to enter countries by The countrys poor state of broadband infrastructure is often touted as a major challenge to almost every OTT video provider operating in the country The Akamai State of the Internet report published earlier this month reveals Indias average Internet bandwidth of mpbs was the second lowest among surveyed AsiaPacific nations The firm reported earlier in January that only Internet subscribers in India had bandwidth in excess of mbps There wont be many takers for k content in India with such a scenario but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>streaming wont be entirely unusable per se Its good and better quality resolution streaming consume a bandwidth of only mpbs and mpbs respectively Bollywood revenue collections may not be as high as Hollywoods but the Indian film industry dwarfs its USbased peer in terms of volume To put things in perspective about Bollywood films were produced during while only were produced in the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to strike several thousand license deals with media content producers in order to compete with rivals such as Hooq and Bigflix which consist mostly of Hindi media Considering the sheer volume of Bollywood films striking thousands of such deals could be costly and time consuming Piracy is another critical challenge that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to overcome Online piracy in China and India has reached alarming levels and the US had put India on its piracy watch list last year In order to curb illegal downloads and to discourage rampant piracy of its shows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to become competitive against cable TV and DTH providers in terms of catalog size and pricing This could mean more licensing deals and consequently higher content liabilities There are a few challenges that the Internet TV giant may need to overcome but the longterm pros appear to outweigh the shortterm cons Im optimistic about Netflixs entry in India and believe that commencing operations in the country could contribute to expanding its overall subscriber base substantially over the coming years Moreover licensing deals struck in India should allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to catapult the growth of its expansions in countries such as Pakistan Nepal Sri Lanka and Bangladesh with minimal costs Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Expanding Into India Opportunities And Challenges Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
