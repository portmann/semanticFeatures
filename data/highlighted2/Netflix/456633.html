blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator up the stream netflix streaming video crime news Last week a federal appeals court issued a ruling that has been widely reported to imply that sharing your password for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>of HBO Go is a federal crime that could get you locked up in federal prison However looking at the actual case involved in this ruling its more than a bit of a stretch to apply this decision to the common practice of sharing login info In USA v David Nosal PDF the defendant was accused of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for using illobtained login credentials to access data stored on computers owned by his former employer To the majority of the threejudge appeals panel its a pretty clearcut manner The CFAA imposes criminal penalties on anyone who knowingly and with intent to defraud accesses a protected computer without authorization The defendant Mr Nosal had his access to these computers revoked and then used someone elses login info to access data he had no right to obtain Once authorization to access a computer has been affirmatively revoked the user cannot sidestep the statute by going through the back door and accessing the computer through a third party explains the appeals panel Unequivocal revocation of computer access closes both the front door and the back door This is actually the second time that the Ninth Circuit has reviewed questions about the CFAA and its application to this case In the court ruled PDF that the former coworkers who aided Nosal by accessing and downloading proprietary data for him were not in violation of the CFAA because they had not accessed the computer without authorization Those employees were in violation of the companys policies and possibly of other laws but thats different from accessing the computer without authorization Think of it like this If I break into a Burger King to steal a pallet of hamburger buns thats not just theft but also breaking and entering If an employee at the BK while on the job takes that pallet of buns outside for me to take they did not have to break and enter to commit their crime The case before the Ninth Circuit this time involved the use of another employees credentials to illegally access the former employers computers This appeal is not about password sharing notes the majority Nor is it about violating a companys internal computeruse policies The conduct at issue is that of Nosal and his coconspirators which is covered by the plain language of the statute The panel found that Nosal knowingly and with intent to defraud his former employer blatantly circumvented the affirmative revocation of his computer system access In spite of the majoritys assertion that this ruling is not about password sharing the lone dissenting judge argued in his response to that this case is indeed about password sharing People frequently share their passwords notwithstanding the fact that websites and employers have policies prohibiting it writes Judge Stephen Reinhardt in his dissent In my view the CFAA does not make the millions of people who engage in this ubiquitous useful and generally harmless conduct into unwitting federal criminals Whatever other liability criminal or civil Nosal may have incurred in his improper attempt to compete with his former employer he has not violated the CFAA Pointing to the previous Nosal decision in Reinhardt notes that the Ninth Circuit and two subsequent federal appeals courts had emphatically refused to turn violations of use restrictions imposed by employers or websites into crimes under the CFAA Reinhardt says the panels application of the CFAA in this case threatens to criminalize all sorts of innocuous conduct engaged in daily by ordinary citizens He contends that the CFAA which was created in the preinternet era to combat the thennew problem of computer hacking isnt about violations as simple as passing off your password to another person In his view the employee whose credentials were used had authorized access to the computer network Thus using her login info with her permission to access the computer was not a violation of the CFAA The majority does not provide nor do I see a workable line which separates the consensual password sharing in this case from the consensual password sharing of millions of legitimate account holders writes Reinhardt which may also be contrary to the policies of system owners There simply is no limiting principle in the majoritys world of lawful and unlawful password sharing In response to the dissent the majority contends that Reinhardt is wrongfully transferring the employees network access authority to the coconspirators Viewing authority in that light would render meaningless the concept of authorization writes the majority and would remove from the scope of the CFAA any hacking conspiracy with an inside person That surely was not Congresss intent Under Reinhardts approach argues the majority an employee could willy nilly give out passwords to anyone outside the company former employees whose access had been revoked competitors industrious hackers or bank robbers who find it less risky and more convenient to access accounts via the Internet rather than through armed robbery The majority concludes that the circumstances of the Nosal case bears little resemblance to asking a spouse to log in to an email account to print a boarding pass The reality is that facts and context matter in applying the term without authorization While Reinhardts dissent contends that the ruling opens the door to more generous applications of CFAA prosecutions a dissent does not create precedent His argument against possible future uses of the law dont mean that sharing your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>account password is a federal crime As the LA Times Jessica Roy points out sharing services like HBO GoNow and <span
