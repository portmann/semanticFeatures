cult growth stocks fail to consistently execute on their promises when measured over years and so generally tend to devalue to more defendable valuations as the mania dissipates In many ways <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the quintessential story stock it offers a heady combination of disruptive technology high growth now and blue sky potential growth going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is trading to me anywhere between x its fair value hence my contention that it is the ultimate story stock For me the most memorable scene in the classic action movie The Matrix is where Neo Keanu Reeves enter the Matrix computergenerated reality for the first time and fights his mentor Morpheus Lawrence Fishburne in a kung fu battle Morpheus uses the experience to explain how the Matrix works to the rookie The Matrix has the same basic rules like gravity What you must learn is that these rules are no different than rules of a computer system Some of them can be bent others can be broken To my mind this is an apt analog for valuing stocks Most of the time companies trade on a multiple of future earnings or more precisely on a multiple of expected future cashflows themselves a function of future earnings in most cases Where higher earnings and faster growth is expected a higher multiple is accorded the same goes for greater visibility or predictability of future earnings The idea that earnings power or cashgenerating power drives equity valuation is so fundamental to the accurate valuation of all enterprises that if it did NOT apply to the vast majority of traded equities capitalism would cease to function how would you rationally value businesses otherwise It is the very glue binding capital providers investors banks venture capitalists etc to capital employers companies But as in life the stock market is a product of human emotion as well as rational calculation and so markets are periodically subject to bouts of mania and speculation bubbles in bull markets and massive crashes in bear markets that most all end in tears For short or sometimes long periods this can apply to the whole market or large segments of it But even when most of the system exhibits mostly rational pricing there remain pockets of outright irrationality where the normal rules clearly do not apply Hence as in The Matrix some rules can be bent and some can be broken Ive always found it fascinating how two companies in the exact same industry producing the same product can be valued so violently differently as to make all kind of rational explanation impossible forcing analysts to jump through all kinds of intellectual hoops to try to justify valuations that most sane neutral observers could not fathom General Motors NYSE GM vs Tesla NASDAQ TSLA is perhaps one such intriguing pair GM produces mm vehicles a year and is valued by the market at bn or x current year EBITDA TSLA is hoping to produce just k vehicles by the end of this year yet is valued at bn and trades at x EBITDA Im not trying to decry TSLAs valuation specifically rather I just hope to demonstrate that despite the common product the market is employing two fundamentally different sets of methodology to value these two companies and the analyst pool common to both companies has bought in to both at the same time In this sense localized manias sometimes isolated to particular sectors or even single names cult stocks exist all around us surrounded by otherwise reasonablyvalued normal stocks What makes some companies so lucky Why do they get to trade at astronomical valuations A massive share price premium is effectively a free gift from the market that can help expensive companies create their own reality by funding through rich stock the acquisition of less fortunate companies at cheaper multiples whats the secret sauce While the variants are numerous most localized manias exhibit some combination of the following a revolutionary new product or technology that promises disruption of existing large markets the opportunity for a long growth runway into such large markets blue sky growth potential clever management that massages and markets the company into story stock often by focusing attention on nonstandard performance metrics that suggest higher future potential and therefore valuation and of course the ability to execute and deliver on growth promises Most cult growth stocks exhibit all of the above but fail to consistently execute on their promises when measured over years and so generally tend to devalue to more defendable valuations as the mania dissipates Sometimes this happens gradually over years more often these stocks are repriced viciously in short periods a number of SaaS and biotech stocks suffered this fate last March for example Occasionally the very best names defy the odds and continue to hit high growth expectations or maintain the mystique at least quarter after quarter year after year An incomplete shortlist of these kinds of names would include Amazon Tesla Under Armor Salesforcecom and of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>But it is important to remember that these few cases are the exceptions in most cases reality catches up with the manias whether it takes a quarter or many years and rationality returns to the pricing mechanism of the market For those looking to benefit from the irrationality of the market other than riding the wave and hoping it continues you can try to figure out when the party could end This is difficult to be fair but eminently achievable and amply compensated by the potential rewards Furthermore it is intellectually valuable as an exercise to help avoid investing mistakes on the long side ie not falling victim to manias yourself Keeping this in mind lets look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX In many ways it is the quintessential story stock it offers a heady combination of disruptive technology high growth now and blue sky potential growth going forward it generates a boatload of revenue but no profits and burns a ton of cash it guides investors to look at companydefined metrics contribution profit rather than GAAP financials which are ugly it has a brilliant management team pulling the strings rather expertly and perhaps most importantly it is readily visible and tangible to retail investors crucial to a real cult stock is the irrational investor who loves the product and so blindly invests But before diving into the current picture its worthwhile taking a quick survey of where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>came from for the companys current situation is a function of the various transformations it has gone through Started as a mailorder DVD rental business Netflixs first vision <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was a pretty good business it provided a convenient service better than the lethargic competition ie Blockbuster and prospered in the earlymid s DVD rentals was truly a business with scale regular readers will know I am obsessed with operating leverage since adding customers doesnt require you to buy more copies of your DVD library Unfortunately for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the market changed DVD rentals were going the way of the dodo and so Reed Hastings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CEO and co made the ingenious move to invest heavily in becoming an overthetop provider of ondemand video content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>This worked great initially and subscriber growth accelerated But unfortunately the studios who initially had sold overthetop content rights for a song since the subscriber base started very small and presented little threat quickly realized that the more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>grew the more overthetop threatened cable subscriptions and hence the value of their content and therefore began to jack up the cost of their content to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>dramatically This neverending negative leverage cycle the more subscribers you attract the more expensive your content acquisition became threatened to destroy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>So management brilliant as they were decided to reinvent the company again around the provision of original unique Netflixcreated content House of Cards Orange is the New Black etc and in effect becoming the HBO of the internet or as you probably guessed what I call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Strategically this is where we are now The quality of the new programming was thankfully very high and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to attract subscribers quickly in fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for the last couple of years has been pushing aggressively to replicate their model internationally mostly because the US market is becoming saturated Unfortunately though nonNetflix content acquisition costs didnt come down as much as they hoped mainly because a a number of competitors HuluHBO GoCBS etc have entered the space often the media companies themselves creating bidding wars for content b as more Americans cut the cord and cancel their cable subscriptions the value of content in a broadband world has skyrocketed not just for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but to all of the media companies and c expanding internationally costs more in licensing fees than just distribution in the US alone Additionally the creation of topquality programming requires well a lot of money so the net result is content acquisition now a combination of original <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content and licensed from other studios continues to outpace revenue and subscriber growth quite dramatically The net result of all these gyrations can be summed up by a few simple stats In the tailend of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had mm paid subscribers generated bn revenues made gross profit spent on opex and generated operating margins Additionally the company generated a modest amount of free cash flow mm and had no meaningful longterm content liabilities This is decent if not stellar financial performance By squarely in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>mode the company has grown the subscriber base astronomically to mm roughly mm in the US and revenues to bn But gross margin has contracted to and opex has kept up with sales growth such that operating margins are actually lower despite the mammoth growth in sales and subscribers More worryingly the business has been consistently cash consumptive burning mm in cash in FY even though content acquisition costs and attendant cash requirements only accelerate into the future The company has bn of content liabilities of whichbn are not even on the balance sheet yet these liabilities have grown at roughly twice the pace of revenues since This picture would be scary enough except that it doesnt consider that DVD rentals a business that will eventually disappear still generates of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>revenues and of their contribution profit a nonGAAP measure that excludes content acquisition coststhat is still a huge chunk of the companys business for a segment likely destined to melt away I dont want to get too bogged down in the details here the market has already made its judgment the stock ripped yesterday to a new high with the market cap now bn At this point there are two basic tenets to the bull thesis and the stock wont go down until one or both of those tenets are seriously challenged They are that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriber growth opportunity is still massive the blue sky growth argument and that perhaps like Amazon there is tremendous operating leverage built into the model once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the dominant player hence we should not be worried about low profitability at the moment Lets dig a little deeper into the first point How massive really is the subscriber growth opportunity As mentioned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>ended last year at mm subscribers as of Q they are near mm over mm of which are in the US There are only mm households in the United States so we are already at penetration and assuming at least some keep their cable use other subscription services or frankly borrow their friends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>passwords Im guilty I really dont see how much more growth there is in the US In fact the company acknowledges this implicitly via the push to international and explicitly by reporting growth in US subs has tailed off in recent years As for the international opportunity clearly the absolute number of potential subscribers is much larger though the cost of getting to them is also exponentially larger given different geographies licensing requirements more competition and less broadband penetration In fact the company has not yet generated any profits internationally and it remains very much an open question whether the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>model can work abroad Nevertheless in terms of pure subscriber adds there is certainly green grass to be enjoyed overseas But what about the second and I believe more important pillar of the bull thesis At this point I think we really have to reconsider how much pricing poweroperating leverage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be able to extract Consider direct overthetop competition is only increasing cf the launch of HBO Go Hulu CBS streaming and likely some kind of Apple solution in the future and the cost of content is still accelerating Price hikes were achieved last year but as competition increases and other unbundled solutions become more available the inelastic demand enjoyed by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>so far will likely dissipate this at least is how consumers behave in other crowded competitive markets And on the cost side is it really reasonable to believe that content costs will come under control at some point If you dont believe revenuesubscriber growth goes on forever this is what you need to believe to think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a viable business let alone a stock worth buying up here But consider the nature of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>cost base Outside of marketing which could at some point exhibit a bit of positive leverage the vast majority is content acquisition incidentally this is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reporting contribution profit by excluding content costs is a complete joke on the market and all analysts who parrot it We have discussed why external content costs are unlikely to go down in fact how they have gone up as fast as or faster than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriber growth this is a big problem when subscriber growth slows As for internallygenerated content this is a fairly inelastic cost item on a perunit basis which is bad if you are trying to achieve scale Whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has mm or mm subscribers the cost of making highquality TV series is basically what it is TV shows are not iPhones And the more subscribers you have the more different shows you need to support the more diverse interests of your base This is another reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content costs are accelerating so dramatically they keep making new expensive shows I guess if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriber base fell massively the company could get away with making fewer shows though in that case clearly the company would have bigger problems But otherwise I just dont see how the company ever generates real operating leverage from the model There is simply too much competition There is one way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can extricate itself with honor from all this forget about external content abandon the plans for world domination via aggressively adding subscribers at any cost and become truly the HBO of the internet With a smaller loyal subscriber base the company could focus solely on a limited amount of highquality content and charge a premium price as a result this would be sustainable as content costs would come down dramatically and the need to increase advertising spend continually to enter evermore markets would also be lower Of course the company will not pursue this angle as then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would have to be valued as a boutique media company think AMC Networks Lions Gate or Starz perhaps all of which are valued by the market in the bn range <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is at bn currently Even in the most optimistic case where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is valued akin to HBO and really this is beyond extravagant as HBOs catalog has been built over yrs we are talking about bn in absolute in an acquisition scenario at least that is what Fox was apparently valuing HBO at when they thought about buying Time Warner last year this was x HBOs EBITDA Of course independent standalone valuations would be lower and even then this is below where the market is currently pricing the company Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is trading to me anywhere between x its fair value hence my contention that it is the ultimate story stock breaking most all the normal valuation rules applied in other parts of the market At this point I should mention I am NOT short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock While I clearly am skeptical the company can ever grow into and thus justify its valuation as long as the market focuses on subscriber growth at the expense of all else it is impossible to accurately time the short However the point at which subscriber growth meaningfully slows or the market turns its focus belatedly to earnings power will be an opportune time to short the stock even if your absolute starting point is much lower Source Even When You Win You Cant Win <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix
