style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had a great day in the market on Tuesday after releasing positive news and being the subject of positive analyst opinions Today well talk about what caused NFLX to climb on Tuesday whether or not the analysts hit the nail on the head with their opinions and what we can expect to see from the stock moving forward NFLX is doing a great job around the world Recent data out of Australia show that the company is taking a great percentage of the market share in the country On Tuesday the Australian Communications and Media Authority AMCA announced that the number of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers in the country now total about million While that may not seem like a huge number when you take a look at the overall population in Australia thats massive After all Australia is a country built up of only million consumers This means that roughly of consumers in Australia are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers However thats not the only good news investors saw surrounding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on Tuesday One thing thats sure to impress investors and move the value of a stock in the upward direction is solid earnings and according to MarketWatch thats exactly what we can expect to see from NFLX next year In fact the news firm recently reported that analysts are expecting to see a massive boost in earnings per share next year According to the report analysts are expecting earnings per share to rise by about next year When we look into the reason for the improving expectations its easy to believe that NFLX profits are going to rise Overall analysts are paying close attention to the consumer discretionary sector which is heavily dependent on economic conditions As jobs numbers in the United States continue to improve and economic conditions remain positive the consumer discretionary sector will remain relatively robust As a result consumers in the United States are more likely to subscribe to NFLX services leading to increasing revenue and earnings If you follow my writing here or elsewhere you know that I never advise anyone to take the word of analysts to be fact Ultimately theyre making predictions just like anyone else and in my opinion I think that they may be wrong in this case The reality is that the only positive economic data were seeing in the US is jobs growth which is likely to fall moving forward Also analysts have been mentioning low unemployment rates While these rates are low so too is the work force participation rate meaning that more and more people are depending on government entitlements Not to mention the Federal Reserve is likely to raise its interest rate in December This will take even more money out of the pockets of consumers as they are forced to pay more money in interest in the future All in all I do expect NFLX to grow profits but Im not expecting earnings to grow by anywhere near in Moving forward Ive got a relatively positive short term outlook for NFLX With positive data out of Australia and positive analyst opinions the stock is likely to rise in value However in the long term Im expecting gains to slow as early earnings reports in arent likely to be as positive as analysts are leading investors to believe If you enjoyed this post please consider
