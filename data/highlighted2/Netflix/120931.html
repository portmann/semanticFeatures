style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had another great quarter in terms of revenue and subscriber growth but weak in terms of earnings and free cash flow At some point subscriber growth will slow down When this happens <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will need to raise prices to generate the free cash flow to justify its valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX reported results Wednesday that were once again well received by the market Despite weak free cash flow and earnings the stock was up Thursday This is mainly due to another huge jump in subscriber and revenue growth that blew away the companys internal estimates Any investors who have been following <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for a while shouldnt be surprised by this Netflixs stock price has traded on subscriber and revenue growth instead of traditional metrics such as earnings and free cash flow for years now The result is a company whose stock price looks insanely expensive using any traditional valuation metric you can think of Much of the bear case points towards this valuation and the underlying fundamentals to conclude that Netflixs stock price will inevitably collapse when subscriber growth slows and the market realizes that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is little more than an extremely low margin media company that cannot actually generate cash flow for its investors This is absolutely a legitimate risk for investors in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>today but it is far from an inevitable conclusion to the NFLX growth story In my opinion it is just as likely that NFLX justifies its valuation and indeed continues to grow by utilizing its pricing power once the subscriber growth slows By utilizing the most recently released financial statements investors can get an idea as to how these price raises could impact the bottom line To show investors how a raise in prices would dramatically increase the profitability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I took the released financial statements linked above and entered in my own future growth assumptions First I found the Average Revenue Per User ARPU of each paid streaming subscriber per month I simply divided the quarterly streaming revenue by the total paid subscriber number and then divided this number by The result was I then projected what would happen if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>attempted a small incremental price hike over time to boost its revenue shooting to increase the ARPU by by the midway point of exactly two years from now Simultaneously I factored in a increase quarterly in cost of revenues investors should note that according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>SEC filings and the investor FAQ this is where streaming costs are accounted a increase in quarterly marketing costs and a increase in subscriber growth These numbers are roughly similar to the recent quarterly increases in each category although I tried to be a little conservative with my subscriber growth estimate To simplify these numbers for both myself and readers I only took the numbers from streaming ignoring the legacy DVD segment The results can be found in the table below As you can see from the above chart these estimates gave NFLX an EPS of by the summer of if they were to roll out a major price increase in the near future A future EPS of with further room for expansion and growth would easily justify the current stock price and likely mean that NFLX continues to outperform the market significantly Many bears assume that NFLX does not have pricing power and that if they try to raise prices they will be met with millions of cancellations However I disagree with this As outlined in a previous bullish article on NFLX I believe that the company has established itself in the mind of consumers as a significant media force The focus on original content and ever increasing library of such products only serves to further the brand power of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and I believe that the company could easily raise prices to between a month domestically without incurring major cancellations Internationally price hikes may be far down the road but as long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues the same business strategy it is likely that they will be able to establish pricing power in many of their international markets There is no doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is extremely overvalued but that does not mean it is a poor or risky investment Eventually the bears will be right about at least one thing subscriber growth will slow down It could take years or it could happen next quarter but eventually it will happen When it happens the market will be forced to look at the fundamentals to price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Currently the bears are absolutely right <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has very weak earnings and poor free cash flow However Netflixs pricing power can turn the only glaring weakness into the company into a strength relatively quickly This pricing power will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to not only justify its current valuation but continue to outperform the market over the long term Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
