class='textDiv'>How <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Is Proving Timing Is Everything <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Following a downgrade of its stock this week by a top analyst Netflixs stock took a dive but quickly rebounded on the news of two major deals The new partnerships with Comcast to allow them settop box access and with The CW for quicker delivery of its shows seasons continue to give the streamer new advantages <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has long proven to be a industry disruptor and even as analysts begin to point out potential longterm flaws the network seems to evolve just at the right time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue to make new inroads and as proven with Comcast those deals can even be with a longterm critic The expression timing is everything lends itself naturally the Hollywood hype machine It is not uncommon to hear a film did better than expectations because it came along at the right time or a show flopped because it debuted against something that sucked up all the viewers Yet with streaming media time stands still In that realm there is no set schedule and best of all no ratings I cant underscore just how important both of those elements are to the success of this medium However timing is still important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX as a whole as it continues to disrupt the mainstream model in stunning ways Take this week for example On July th investors woke up to Needhams analyst Laura Martin downgrading her recommendation of the stock Martin cited concerns that Brexit would mar the companys international growth in future years At the same time Guggenheims Michael Morris added the stock to his companys list of best ideas Morris cited optimism that the investor focus would shift to return to value proposition and pricing power Just as that news was settling in all of sudden two more stories hit about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>this time both positive and not only did the stock regain its position but it ended the day up The more likely of the two stories to move the needle had to do with a partnership between Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The two have reached a deal where Comcast will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>onto its X platform making it easier for users to access the streaming service This is significant for a number of reasons not the least of which is the fact that these two companies have a contentious history ReCode which initially broke the deal also has a nice refresher of their conflicts for those interested Yet given Comcast just recently acquired DreamWorks Animation and DreamWorks Animation has a longstanding distribution deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>these two companies were going to have a find a way to peacefully coexist on some level To remind readers though the basic feud tied back to the rules of net neutrality which for those of you still confused by it and its completely understandable let me refer to HBOs Last Week Tonight With John Oliver which brilliantly breaks it down The end result in this case though is that for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>this of course makes it easier for new subscribers to come aboard and gives Comcast a added selling point but the arrangement also has a secondary benefit Currently the FCC is looking into the big cable companies and a proposal has been made to force cable operators to open up their settop boxes to other companies In other words the FCC has heard your complaints about having to pay over a year for the privilege to rent a set top box and is working on trying to drive down the fees or eliminate them completely With this deal Comcast can say to the FCC look we are playing nice with our rivals and allowing them access The ironic part is that Comcast as well as all their cable brethren have largely fought the FCC on the proposal likely because theyd want to something like this on their own terms It was finally confirmed today that The CW NYSE CBS NYSETWX will make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>its exclusive home for its catalog of programming Until now The CW had deals with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Hulu which were made to benefit all three parties as when it was signed The CW didnt have the same success it is now and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Hulu needed all the programming it could get In the years since a lot has changed and Hulu told The CW in order to stay partners theyd like stacking rights to its shows As a reminder stacking rights refer to the ability to stack shows for streaming and not have to be on a rotating five system with only the five newest episodes being available Networks have long battled for these with studios because it makes it easier for new audiences especially those of serialized shows to pick up a show later on in its lifespan Yet stacking rights greatly influence both potential individual series streaming deals and advertising revenue so studios are not keen to give them out To me what the most fascinating aspect of all this is the newfound power it gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>As part of the deal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>not only gets the CWs library but it gets new full seasons faster Instead of having to wait until the start of the new season to get all of the previous seasons episodes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will get them just eight days after the previous season wraps To simplify that instead of being forced to wait until September to stream the newest season <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will essentially have them all by June Under this deal The CW will also retain the streaming five model giving its own site and the sites of its affiliates the exclusive ability to stream current episodes not long after they first air which gives them a big advantage While I agree the upside for The CW is that it gives audiences an entire summer to get caught up or latch on to its programming it also closes the window between live and streaming even more The biggest thing working against the cordcutting option is that traditional media has LIVE viewing for EVERY channel And thats the differentiator Yes as Im sure people will point out you have the ability to see live programming across places like Sling TV and PlayStation Vue but ONLY on select channels and only in a handful of markets does that apply to the national broadcast networks like The CW By closing the window even further The CW and CBS by extension is taking a risk here In the short term it will pay off but its that long run play that is put into question Will people eventually stop caring as much about seeing a mustwatch show live Likely it will depend on the show but for the networks to give audiences that option could prove dangerous Remember a large part of the streamers original success is because many networks saw the chance for a new revenue stream and the ability to make a quick buck by happily selling off digital rights to their programming All this did was give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and company time to find its footing and create its own original programming By trading off the popularity of its rivals programs streaming networks were able to build a solid foundation that have rivaled the traditional model Now that everyone realizes how strong theyve become its too late to do anything about it Business relationship disclosure All opinions expressed are the authors and no compensation outside of
