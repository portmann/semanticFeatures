class='textDiv'>Disney So Much Growth The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha Disneyland in Shanghai stands to be an excellent catalyst for the firm and comes at a time where pressure needs to be taken off of ESPN The summer box office will be much more lucrative for Disney even compared to last year Disney NYSE DIS is continually hovering around the level Its been a rollercoaster ride for shareholders since August when the shares peaked above and then crashed along with the broader equity market With fears around ESPN really becoming front and center over the last few quarters shareholders need to remember that this company has a significant amount of growth potential remaining There are several key catalysts that Disney has in its arsenal that warrant a price target of and a buy rating The best thing about Disney in the current market is that the company still has many tangible growth catalysts that can help rid the market of recent disappointment of the Q ER Also since the ESPN subscriber loss issue is continually being worked on by Disneys management these catalysts serve to offset these financial losses This is where investors should place their focus This is a landmark event for Disney and this catalyst is positive for the stock in that it will create a lot of media attention similar to how Star Wars The Force Awakens generated investor interest Fortunately the benefit from this park and resort doesnt end there as it will reduce the financial burden on more weighted parts of the core business like ESPN Disney has maintained an CAGR on park revenue since and is coming off its best performance ever last year While the deal between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and Disney is critical in Disneys process to diversify out of ESPNlinked revenues the Parks Resorts impressive CAGR is going to allow it to help offset the losses experienced due to ESPN This is even more true with Shanghai Disneyland now coming online Below is the Parks Resorts segment revenue for the last five years as well as the Y forward projection that stems past the billion mark The importance of this is that Shanghai Disneyland is going to be a significant addition to Disneys Parks Resorts segment as it will allow the company to maintain the strong CAGR it has experienced the last five years and carry it on through The only change in growth rate that Ive projected is this years growth rate because Disney is going to have to make up the expenses it invested in Shanghai Thus this initial year of operation will naturally make the park not as profitable as it could be The completion of this park is also critical in that Disney will likely generate a stronger level of free cash flow in the upcoming years as this park and resort has been a significant investment source Since capex has risen approximately million from billion to billion This park and resort has incurred over billion worth of investment This potential for increased FCF is crucial because it means that Disney can increase its dividend past the subpar rate that its currently at or it can accelerate an authorized buyback Both options return more capital to shareholders in a shorter period of time I really advise that investors watch the companys operating margin in compared to and beyond as it will be key in seeing how profitable Shanghai Disney is compared to Disneys other parks Additionally if the park is consistently generating a strong rate of return future parks and resorts can be built in Asia creating a continuous cycle of growth within this segment Shanghai Disneyland opens up June just a few weeks away Disney already has three strong films in the box office at the present moment with The Jungle Book Zootopia and Captain America Civil War This is one more than last year when Disney had Avengers Age of Ultron and Cinderella The only way that Disney posts lower box office numbers than last year is if attention is directed away from their summer blockbusters towards the election news coverage or towards the Olympics in August Other films that Disney has at the box office this summer are Alice Through The Looking Glass and Petes Dragon However dont expect either of these to cause material shifts in the companys stock due to their low probable sales relative to the other films in Disneys arsenal Perhaps shareholders are forgetting that Finding Dory is on track to not only be the highest grossing animated movie this year but a significant help in Disney reaching the Streets EPS target of Again this should help to offset any loss in viewers to the election andor the Olympics Im mostly focusing on Finding Dory and Captain America Civil War beating their domestic box office sales against expectations If Disney can do this itll post significant YOY growth that will undoubtedly serve as a strong rationale for investors to buy the stock The consensus estimates is that these two films are to do a combined billion in global box office sales however Captain America has already crushed the billion mark with at least another weak in major global theaters If Finding Dory can surpass the million mark expectations will be beat The reason I find this to be more than probable is that the average gross for the top Pixar movies is well over million Additionally for a sequel film theres precedents in Toy Story grossing billion at the box office and considering that Finding Nemo was the Pixar film grossing million worldwide the followon film if it is equally as successful will help Disney surpass expectations Disney Cruise Line should not be new to investors but the company is planning on launching two new ships in and Why is this important to the overall business and to shareholders Each cruise ship as of now averages million in revenue each quarter based upon and Q data While this seems like a small fraction of the billion average quarterly revenue in the same time frame it leads to an EPS impact of per quarter or about of GAAP diluted EPS per quarter The cruise ships financial performance are included in the Parks Resorts segment which is rather interesting when investors think about the major catalyst that is the new Shanghai park and resort Cruise ships on average showed a revenue increase of in but did decrease to just growth in Q underperforming YOY Given that this is a seasonal part of Disneys business the largest increases in performance should occur in the spring and summer the latter of which is right around the corner So while this summer will likely see the traditional support from the Cruise Line its important to consider the new ships a longterm catalyst GAAP diluted EPS right now is growing at about per quarter With the addition of two new cruise ships another cents in EPS could be added each quarter which would increase the bottom line growth rate past current expectations This catalyst isnt without its cost however as these cruise ships will cost a cool billion each and nearly half a decade to build Again this is a longterm catalyst but nonetheless important because it can impact the bottom line and lead to future earnings beats Disney has a great mix of positive catalysts that can more than help solve the subscriber loss problem from ESPN Disney Shanghai is the spotlight right now given that the park will open shortly and it will be a significant topline addition after Disney Studios continues to impress with a highquality suite of films this summer and Disney Cruise Line looks to be a longterm earnings boost with the addition of two ships after Disney is finding ways to protect itself against industry trends like cord cutting and will be able to return more cash to shareholders in quarters to come because of their decisive
