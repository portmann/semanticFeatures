#A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX shares have dropped from their high of back in August all the way down to a low on Tuesday of representing a decline and a loss of over billion in market cap This selloff frenzy ignited due to fears of competitors entering the streaming business particularly Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Verizon NYSE VZ But will these companies like Apple be able to grab enough market share to justify this huge loss in market cap for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>We must peel back the skin and further examine the competition Whenever someone hears that Apple could be a competitor they have the right to be terrified initially Its customers are incredibly loyal and they sort of have a reputation for creating the best products that man has ever seen Ever Apple is expected to announce new products such as a new Apple TV Wednesday morning at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco This could be when they also officially announce their plan to enter the video content subscription market But analysts dont predict this market penetration to begin until next year Even then it is unclear how Apples subscription service will fare against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or what type of subscription service Apple will even have It is unlikely that Apple could begin creating its own Emmywinning content like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has been able to anytime soon And although Apple is a dynamic company with incredible resources and capital to fund whatever it wants it seems that it is more likely that Apple would compete with the cable providers more than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Apples loyal customers are generally wealthier and would likely therefore pay for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Apples streaming services Apple entering the video subscription network would thus expand this market but possibly take away more market share from the cable companies than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>already has A great article written by Alex Pitti further explaining why Apple TV subscriptions wont hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can be found here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still has big opportunities for geographic expansion For example at the beginning of the month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>launched in Japan in a partnership with Fuji Television one of the flagship media companies of Japan They also signed a deal with Softbank one of Japans biggest telecom and internet companies to be able to market and sell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriptions in Softbank stores This market penetration into Japan is expected to noticeably increase subscriber growth largely due to the Fuji Network original content that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be offering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be able to use this same growth strategy and enter into any market that it pursues Additionally it is important to note that every partnership that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gains builds the barriers to entry higher and higher This firstmover advantage that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has is being underestimated Video streaming is a commodity but the partnerships that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has in place along with its original content is going to be very tough for any competitor to directly compete with Verizon announced earlier on Tuesday that it will be launching a new video service thats target market will be young people who choose to watch TV on their phone or tablet This service called Go still does not stand a chance against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>It is free but has advertisements Much of the content will only be available for Verizon customers including NFL games and shows from Discovery NASDAQ DISCA NASDAQ DISCB NASDAQ DISCK Scripps NYSE SNI and Viacom NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB such as The Daily Show What I am trying to say is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is way cooler than Go could ever be and being cool is important for Verizons target market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still has the cool factor that tech companies normally only enjoy for a couple of years Everyone loves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>If you are a person looking for a roommate you are instantly a more popular roommate candidate if you pay the measly per month for a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscription Also if you dont know what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and chill means you probably havent been on any social media accounts in the year That has become an increasingly popular phrase and hashtag used on the internet The phrase Go and chill will never be a thing unless you are an employee of Verizon Basically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a name that people associate with good feelings and many peoples Sundays would be much less fulfilling without it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has many key partnerships already in place that will make entering the video streaming business harder than the market currently seems to anticipate Apple is an incredibly popular company but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has the firstmover advantage and has the competitive advantage of specializing in this industry Other streaming services are likely to expand the videostreaming market rather than detrimentally reduce <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriptions The recent dip in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares is due to panic and has only speculative substance Buy the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>dip Disclosure I amwe are long
