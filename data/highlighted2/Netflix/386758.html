class='textDiv'>Amazons Boost To Studios And Prime Should Not Be Ignored Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Amazon is betting big on movies with the recent deals at Sundance and a big presence coming to the Cannes Film Festival Amazon takes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>head on with the offering of Prime Video on a monthly subscription basis Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN has grown to a massive size by introducing new categories of products for sale on its website and expanding its business segments Two important company introductions came in and with the respective launches of Amazon Prime and Amazon Studios These launches are two of the important reasons why Amazon continues to see a massive valuation despite low profit margins Amazon Studios appeared at its first ever CinemaCon last week CinemaCon is the annual convention of movie theatre exhibitors Amazon showed off several movies in its upcoming slate Amazon also discussed a strategy of working with movie exhibitors to keep movies in theatres the normal amount of time despite it being a streaming company Playing nice with the movie theatres is a strategy that could pay off after making big bets on highly anticipated films Amazon has had more success recently in acquiring movies versus rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX That might be because of its willingness to give movies a traditional theatrical run before bringing the movie back to the Amazon Prime Video service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on the other hand typically tries to release movies in theatres the same day they air on the streaming service This hasnt worked well in the past and hasnt exactly made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>any friends in the movie theatre department Amazon discussed its big ambitions for its theatrical releases in March The studio sees as many as theatrical releases coming this year By allowing movies their normal theatrical run Amazon is also hoping to be a bigger player in the awards season The company promised an expansive award campaign including one tied to the highly anticipated Manchester by the Sea Consider this Deadline interview with WME Global which represented two highly soughtafter Sundance Film Festival movies in Manchester by the Sea and The Birth of a Nation Amazon acquired Manchester and Fox NASDAQ NWSA NASDAQ NWS was awarded the rights to Birth despite <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offering more money for the latter WME Global was asked Why did you make the million deal with Amazon a streaming service but turn down million from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to take million from Fox Searchlight for The Birth of a Nation WME concluded that Amazon agreed to a traditional day theatrical window and to make Manchester a major awards play WME reminded the interviewer that movies sometimes get distracted by the money aspect and forget about other factors like marketing release date and the slate of films from the studio Investors should see that as a major sign of Amazon becoming a force in the movies category It should also show that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will need to change its strategy or create movies inhouse It is not going to be able to simply write massive checks to buy top awards play movies Last year WME did a deal with NFLX for Beasts of No Nation which got left out of the awards categories and failed to produce significant box office due to its same day showing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>streaming In sharp contrast to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>being outbid by Fox for The Birth of a Nation Amazon told USA Today that there were no movies that we were outbid on The company attended the Sundance Film Festival and did not do any bids Playing nice with movie exhibitors should have a good impact on Amazons Studio division as it builds an exciting lineup of movies Amazon is set to have a huge presence at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival May through The company will have five movies playing at Cannes in Caf Society is a big bet being made by Amazon Studios The studio arm of the ecommerce giant paid million to the rights for the movie starring Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg The movie will premiere at the Cannes Film Festival then head to theatres for a release before coming back to Amazon for streaming on Prime Video Amazon also won the rights to Manchester by the Sea Love Friendship million Complete Unknown million WienerDog seven figures and Author The JT Leroy Story million at the Sundance Film Festival Amazon right now seems content on acquiring movies and then releasing them The company is however working on making movies inhouse and could be a major force when that happens thanks to its existing relationships with top moviemaking talent and theatres The companys first original movie may even be The Wall based on a highly soughtafter script from the Black List based on a sniper pinned behind cover Amazon does not publicly disclose how many Prime subscribers it has This leaves the highly coveted figure as a guessing game A new study estimates that there are to million households in the United States that have Prime subscriptions That figure comes from studies conducted by Piper Jaffray including an annual study done with kids In the kids survey of households had Amazon Prime That is up from just two years ago A whopping of households with annual income of or greater were Amazon Prime subscribers On its firstquarter earnings call Amazon disclosed that Prime membership was up The company also disclosed it doubled the number of viewing hours for Prime video in the fourth quarter Amazon of course highlighted its recent Emmy and Golden Globe wins for Amazon Studios Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle two shows only available to Prime customers Along with boosting the streaming service portion that Prime members get Amazon is working on providing additional benefits The company recently announced a deal to give Prime members a huge discount on new video game releases The discount covers preordered new releases for their first two weeks The discount will save most customers off the normal new game price point The other big reason Prime subscriber numbers might go up is the latest move to the free shipping threshold After years of offering customers free shipping on all purchases over Amazoncom raised the price point to That also came after setting the free shipping bar at for years Now customers looking to make multiple purchases or smaller orders may find the Prime service that offers free two day shipping on everything much more enticing Remember those DASH buttons that looked so silly Amazon introduced Customers could hit a button on their washing machine to automatically order more laundry detergent through their Amazon service Well they seem to be catching on and Prime members are getting more and more DASH buttons to choose from Amazon recently tripled the number of DASH buttons to The buttons cost each but that amount is credited back to the account once a purchase is made Orders placed by DASH buttons are up in the first three months of for Prime users Over the weekend it was announced that Amazon will offer its Prime video streaming service on a standalone monthly basis For a month subscribers will get to view everything on the Amazon movie streaming network For customers can subscribe to Amazon Prime movies free shipping and more on a monthly basis This is the first time that subscribers can directly get the benefits of Amazon Prime without paying the annual fee upfront This move by Amazon may have been foreshadowed by a recent partnership with Sprint NYSE S Sprint was the first partner that would offer Amazon Prime on a monthly basis to its subscribers That price point announced then was which is the same being offered now directly through Amazon Sprint appears to have been lost in the mix and wont really gain anything other than those looking for one monthly bill The price point and offering of the standalone movie service come at a time when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is raising prices to its oldest subscribers After holding off on a raise to older customers the month of May will see Netflixs main plan price increase from to monthly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offers three priced plans ranging from to for new subscribers The prices range depending on if movies are shown in HD quality and how many people can stream content at the same time Amazons price point of a month will also compete against Hulu which charges for content with limited commercials or a month for content without commercials Of course customers paying the new monthly price will pay more than Amazon users who pay the annual fee of Amazon finally has caved to a growing population that is used to paying items monthly Time will tell if this translates to more subscribers but I have to believe that the answer will undoubtedly be yes The company noted that subscribers have been asking for monthly pricing for some time With the latest Prime subscriber range of to million we can again come up with a guess of how much money the company collects just in annual membership fees At the midpoint of the range million subscribers Amazon collects billion in annual membership revenue While Amazon doesnt break out all of the numbers for its Prime memberships it continues to tell investors how much more valuable these subscribers are Back in January when the video game discount was announced Amazon said its Prime customers spend more than other customers With low margins for the massive ecommerce leader multiple and repeat transactions matter Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and
