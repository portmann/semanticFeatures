class='textDiv'>Apples Retreat Means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Will Remain King Of Paid Streaming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Apple has reportedly suspended its ambition to offer a monthly subscription TVvideo streaming service The retreat of Apple should please Neflix investors Without the threat from Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue its robust growth rate In spite of its million cash hoard Apple NASDAQ AAPL reportedly failed to land a licensing deal with content owners After years of failed negotiation rumor has it that Apple has suspended its planned month liveTV service because content ownerspublishers wanted more money While this rumor is not an officialpermanent declaration that Apple will never compete in premium liveTV streaming its still great news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX investors NFLXs momolike valuation is largely due to its impressive growth in subscribers and annual revenue Apples reported surrender over its ambition to compete in the multibillion streaming industry deletes a potential headwind for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The old worry about Apples planned subscription TV ambition was that it could have been a zerosum game for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>There was the risk that millions of Apple TViPhoneiPadusing customers of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would defect to Apples streaming TV service Apples huge pool of iPhone and iPad users would really have made it a bigger menace than the combined competition offered by HBO Now Hulu Plus Vudu and Sling TV According to Adobes NASDAQ ADBE survey Apple devices accounted for of viewed streaming payTV content in Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its investors therefore should rejoice that Tim Cook did not capitulate to the fees demanded by broadcastcable TV content owners Strong In TV AnywhereMobile Streaming Since Apple has suspended its plans for a liveTV service a majority of iPhone and iPad owners will most likely continue to rely on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to get their fix of TV showsmovies Without Apples meddling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>remains the king of TV Everywhere Furthermore TMobiles NASDAQ TMUS favoritism toward giving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and not YouTube unlimited mobile video streaming means Alphabets subscriptionbased YouTube Red service also is not a threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Carriers like TMobile that want to attract customers have every right to favor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>over other streaming service providers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still the dominant mobile streaming entertainment provider The prospect of free unlimited mobile streaming at reduced resolution from other US carriers is another longterm tailwind for NFLX Smartphones and tablets are now outselling computers and settop boxes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will likely continue to post doubledigit growth in annual revenue The longterm growth momentum of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has always been due to its strong presence in US homes Aside from being the leader in mobile streaming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>remains the biggest fixed internet bandwidth hog in America The endemic popularity of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gave it share of all peak period downstream internet traffic in the US This is more than double that of adsupported YouTube Apple which also sells ondemand videoTV content via its iTunes Store only accounts for of downstream Internet traffic The Business Insider chart supports my speculation that the majority of iPhoneiPad users get their premium streaming entertainment from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>not from iTunes Another revealing fact in the chart above is the negligible web traffic of BitTorrent illegal filesharing which only accounted for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>previously discussed the threat of Popcorn Time earlier this year However torrentpowered Popcorn Time and its variants are already dead I opine that the cheap month subscription rate of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>makes illegal torrent services almost unnecessary Consequently the subscriptionbased video streaming SVoD service popularized by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>generates more revenue than downloads or payperview ondemand streaming SVoD will continue to rake in more than of all US commercial online video streaming until Netflixs leadership position in SVoD means it gets to gooble up the largest cut of this multibillion cake I endorse a longterm buy rating for NFLX In spite of the risks involved in betting on momo tickers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still has upside potential in With Apple now most likely out of the picture Hulu Plus Vudu and Sling TV are too small to challenge Netflixs dominant position in the US I also see the upcoming China expansion as another growth catalyst for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>China India and other Asian countries have a lot of iPhone and iPad users who can easily afford a month streaming service Asians who bought Android phones also are potential customers for the TV Anywhere service of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>It will reek of defeatism if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>just sits and watches Alibabas NYSE BABA new year service month dominate Chinas video streaming business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should learn from the lesson of Amazons NASDAQ AMZN pathetic share in Chinas ecommerce Amazons mistake is that it did not challenge Alibaba promptly and aggressively <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>therefore should accelerate its entry in China before Alibabas TMall Box Office service gets too popular Without a foothold in that populous country Netflixs global expansion efforts will be handicapped We only use your contact details to reply to your
