Alpha Despite expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has no plans on being the sole leader of the streaming TV market Netflixs unbelievable success has led to price increases from producers which are motivated to prevent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>from dominating the market due to less competition This article will overview <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management goals alongside my own predictions for subscriber growth to suggest some numbers as to where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be in Im writing this article to correct a common belief about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX that is the belief that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is actually on route to eventually replacing television altogether so that every household in the world will eventually have a screen and a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscription Despite analysts and investors expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has made it clear that they cannot achieve this goal and will instead grow Netflixs niche in content programming In addition this article will discuss how Netflixs own growth expectations will leave investors very disappointed based on todays current valuation On Netflixs investor relations website they have a section called longterm view I highly recommend that any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>investor or potential investor reads this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>initially discusses the accurate strengths of their business model over live television shows and goes on to discuss their belief of what the future of television entails I want to take one quote from this section Our licensing is generally timebased so that we might pay for a multiyear exclusive subscription videoondemand SVOD license for a given title In each market we license content from multiple suppliers mirroring the fragmentation of the content industry Typically our bids are for exclusive access to the SVOD rights and we are up against various cable and broadcast networks as well as online video competitors As a rule content owners always want another bidder and never want one bidder to become too strong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has done a fantastic job of being candid with shareholders in basically stating that the market will not allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to get too strong because it would give them a relative monopoly over distribution at a great expense to the producers If there were two primary streaming content carriers however this would encourage competition to bid up the price resulting in the producer getting more revenue Its very clear that the large numbers of producers out there will benefit from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>having competition and since they play such a key role in Netflixs success by dictating Netflixs costs they will not allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to become that powerful Management has had a great solution to this problem by creating original content Since then the market has cheered this news and has driven up Netflixs price even higher Although this was an excellent move by management it was the only appropriate response considering alternative strategies could be disastrous to the company as a result of the increasing competition that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is facing Despite this being a great management move it was ultimately a reaction to the less appealing market that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is moving into In a nutshell the previous quote just highlights that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has recently become a victim of its own success I want to run three different scenarios that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could engage in at this time to respond to the changing environment of higher content fees being demanded The first scenario would involve them making no changes and still trying to bid for top content but only receiving a relatively smaller proportion of higher quality content due to the lower costs This would result in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>being less appealing and would limit growth to the point that it could eventually reverse it The second scenario would involve them trying to establish themselves as the leading provider for all TV content making aggressive bids for content and making deals with the producers to try and get some sort of a volume discount This would result in bankruptcy occurring in as little as a few months as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>simply does not have the capital to pay for this content acquisition In addition to this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would further explode in revenue growth but this would not be able to keep up with the growth in expenses The third solution is what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is currently doing which involves maintaining their niche documentaries older hit TV shows older hit movies newer less popular movies etc while also growing their original content This is clearly the best business model for them as they can control costs better as well as obtaining scale from their original content investments which will carry no additional costs to be released in all of their countries that they operate in Up until the last couple of years this would have been highly impractical I cannot say enough how much I really appreciate how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management has handled the changing environment and I think that they are growing at a rate that is not unreasonable I believe that they have an excellent management team and I find their approach to be very rational I cannot say the same for the investors that bid the company up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has ran their company better than almost anyone over the last years and I absolutely love their plans for the future Furthermore I LOVE <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>itself and have used the service for years However if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decided next month that they would raise their subscription fees to per month I would immediately cancel my subscription this is the exact same rational why I would never pay for a share of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>despite it being a fantastic company although if it was selling for a share it would be one of my largest holdings By my own standards the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is very bright By current investor standards they are terrible This is because in order for investors to rationalize a market capitalization of billion they clearly see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as the future unabated champion of television In order for this number to be reasonable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should have a PE ratio after their rapid growth stage is over Due to their explosive growth over the last few years using a PE ratio with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>at this time is absolutely useless as is operating cash flow as a standalone measure However if we can estimate future costs and revenue we can get a general idea of what to expect in a few years First I wanted to discuss what I think will happen with Netflixs growth over the next few years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue to grow in the United States and Canada however these numbers will slow down significantly as the markets start to become saturated Over the next few years customers will have no problem paying increasingly higher fees as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>improves its content database <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue to grow in their English markets very well US Canada Australia UK Western Europe etc as their years of data mining will be helpful in establishing appropriate content as well as the possibility of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>achieving scale through producers eg a producer giving a price break when being offered in a large number of countries to minimize costs I believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will eventually be as successful in these countries as they are in the United States and Canada I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue its expansion into Latin America but with very limited success I believe the lack of data mining decreased scalability the increased use of piracy and the much lower average income will all result in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>being much less successful than many investors speculate Its also important to consider that one of the biggest draws to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in North America is the lack of advertising your subscription cost replaces your commercials and for most middleclass Westerners the opportunity cost of minutes of commercials every minutes is worth the few dollars per month I question if this will be the same in a family that has onetenth of the disposable income Also one variable that is almost never mentioned is the widespread sharing of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>accounts between friends and family Consider this variable in a LatinAmerican culture where we have on average larger numbers of people inside of a single home as well as more interconnectedness between extended family ultimately resulting in more sharing Finally Netflixs investment into Asia I believe will be extremely unsuccessful this is for many of the same reasons that Latin American growth will be limited in addition to the significant competition that is already present in Asia Also consider that China the heart of the Asian economy or world economy for that matter has Internet restrictions that so far have been very challenging for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to get past Also the limited relationships with Asian content producers will place somewhat of a strain on their Asian growth and limit their ability to scale Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>initially launched in other English speaking countries we have seen very impressive success so far This has led to many investors speculating that this trend will continue to other countries with much lower incomes more alternatives and completely different cultures I think this is where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>investors will be very disappointed Looking more generally at the future of all TV streaming I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management has it right percent To quote management on their long term views section We strive to win more of our members moments of truth Those decision points are say at pm when a member wants to relax enjoy a shared experience with friends and family or is bored The member could choose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or a multitude of other options Because the entertainment market is so broad multiple firms can be successful For example HBO is now growing faster than in years past while our business is also expanding Many people will subscribe to both HBO and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>since we have different exclusive content The transition to Internet TV with its greater consumer satisfaction will mean growth for many Internet TV services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management has once again been wonderfully candid with shareholders by describing that they see the future of TV as a compliment between a few major players They even went on to discuss the success of HBOs growth in tandem with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and suggested that rather than choose one or the other people will just choose both What does this tell us about Netflixs strategy I think it is fair to say we can rule out scenario B ever occurring Furthermore we also can rule out that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is planning on growing their fees dramatically with content over the next few years as I doubt many people would rationalize having three or four TV subscriptions at a month This just confirms my belief that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not planning on meeting the same expectations that investors have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management also has discussed their expectations for margins in the future Here is one quote from the same longterm view section Our US contribution margin structure is set mostly top down For any given future period we estimate revenue and decide what we want to spend and how much margin we want in that period Competitive pressures in bidding for content would lead us to have slightly less content than we would otherwise rather than overspending The same is true for our marketing budget The output variable is membership growth that those spending choices influence The US contribution margin structure we have chosen is to grow content spending plus marketing slightly slower than we grow revenue increasing our contribution margin to by We think we can grow to million members in the US based upon our trajectory to date and the continued growth of Internet TV Here we can get some more insight into the brains behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>They made it clear that they will be taking a more conservative approach to the US market so that their revenue growth outpaces their expense growth while also acknowledging that increased content costs would decrease their content everything else being equal Although this is a great strategy I question if Netflixs US revenue can grow fast enough to allow them to actually grow their content despite the increased content costs Given that content costs are growing fairly rapidly I find it unrealistic that revenue growth will outpace costs as so much of the US market is already saturated Increasing subscription costs I think will help but they have to do this slowly and carefully However I trust that they have ran thousands of statistical analysis as to the ideal price point for profitability In a previous article I discussed how unlikely it would be for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to reach their US goal of to million customers within the next few years although it is very reasonable for them to hit million in the next few years I outlined a number of reasons in a previous article as to why million households within a few years would be almost impossible This is not to say that eventually they could reach million subscribers But I believe that this would take well over a decade and would require a number of uncontrollable variables to work in their favor I created a table that compiles all of Netflixs estimated subscribers by the end of December accompanied by rough estimates of subscribers by country by based on the variables that I discussed earlier in the article The general assumptions that I made were that English speaking countries with a similar culture to the United States will achieve growth rates comparable to the US I assumed US and Canadian growth slows down considerably as the market reaches saturation I also assumed that Asian and LatinAmerican growth will continue but will slow down much earlier than their Englishspeaking comparables I also considered the relative size of the population of each country and the per capita GDP I also was very liberal with my estimates and this should not frustrate even the largest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bulls Note that I predicted very strong growth for the US Canada UK and Australia which I believe will be dominated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as the primary content provider For Asia it was very difficult to come up with an estimate as we have no data to go on as of right now I took a relatively wild guess at around million due to their lack of serious expansion into the area and my beliefs that this expansion will be unsuccessful This number may be modified over the next few months as we get more data on the success of the Asian expansion Also keep in mind that for my estimates where I provided a range I always used the highest number to produce an especially liberal estimate for Also note that I excluded several countries that had a very small number of users I used an estimated end of users by DigitalTVResearchcom to get a rough indicator of the current numbers which correlates very closely to the total Q numbers given in their Q financial statements In addition DigitalTVResearchcom recently published a report estimating that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have million subscribers by I was pleased to see that my estimate came within a few million of the alternative estimate although we seem to have different ideas as to where these numbers come from Considering that I have intentionally used extremely liberal numbers I am OK with overshooting their estimate So What Does This Mean For Valuation Since Im sticking with my theme of extreme optimism for this article Im going to make another list of relatively unrealistic assumptions First I will assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will meet of their management goals of growing revenue faster than costs Second I will assume there will be no recessions or market corrections for the record I do NOT believe this one bit Third I assume that content costs will not continue to grow despite every available indicator suggesting that this trend will continue unabated Fourth I will assume that further share dilution will not occur despite the fact that it has happened steadily for several years Finally I will assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will increase their fees by across the board I will also assume that this increase in fees will produce no decline in demand which for anyone who has taken first year economics we know is not possible Why did I make all of these unrealistic assumptions I had to try and come up with numbers to rationalize the current market capitalization With my liberal estimates this would suggest that the overall number of users would almost double to million is a growth rate of almost For simplicity sake and to emphasize a point I will round this up so that we assume that overall users will double by million total users therefore giving the estimate an additional million bonus in addition to all the other liberal estimates This would double the revenue to billion annually Q rev X x Then lets assume costs somehow only grow by over the same period Q operating expense x x which would result in around billion in annual costs This would produce operating earnings of billion per year or operating earnings per share This is a very fair price with a reasonable PE ratio assuming the tax situation has not changed significantly So I want you to reread the article from the beginning as well as my previous article to suggest all of the problems with the assumptions that I made to come up with these numbers In addition to this I used very liberal estimates for growth and rounded everything up Perhaps most unrealistically I assumed that costs would only grow at half the rate of revenue something that even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management has said would not occur they specifically said they want revenue to outpace growth but certainly not by A much more reasonable number for the growth of expenses would be around of revenue If we plug in the same numbers with a more plausible growth in expenses assuming growth in revenue this would result in expenses being around billion annually or billion in operating earnings or operating earnings per share This would suggest that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still very overvalued even with all of these false assumptions baked into the calculations Finally if we add the assumption of a growth in revenue to the last two calculations this would grow overall revenue to an impressive billion per year This would result in operating earnings of billion per share for the cost assumption and billion per share for the cost growth assumption Keep in mind that if we used the generous estimate that I originally came up with million annual revenue in would be around billion without a fee increase If we use the alternative research report of million estimated users this would produce revenue of billion compared with expenses between to billion This valuation is just some sample predictions that would have to occur to allow todays valuation to be reasonable I spent much longer trying to come up with a valuation using more realistic assumptions however I could never come up with anything close to the current valuation So if every single one of my unrealistic assumptions was met along with my unrealistic growth projections <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>appears to be reasonably valued for five years in the future Considering the opportunity cost of five years of investments Im not willing to wait for a series of unlikely events to occur to hope that five years from now my investment will be fairly priced When considering the threats of competition higher content costs sharing of accounts piracy legal issues and much lower incomes in Netflixs growth markets the estimates I suggested will in reality be much lower This suggests there is very limited upside to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with enormous downside When I look at the global economic picture right now compounded with interest rates set to rise in the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a company I wouldnt touch with a foot poll We only use
