class='textDiv'>Facebook Is Losing Ground Facebook NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Snapchat Instagram Twitter and Facebook have all shown declines in usage This shows that Facebook has bigger worries than those firms within its sphere We dont know what will take the stage away from Facebook but at a PE I am not sticking around to find out There has been a great deal of discussion about the competitive threats Facebook NASDAQ FB faces from within the social media space Some trends generally recognized are that Facebook has defeated Twitter NYSE TWTR in the battle for older users Gen X and Baby Boomers and that Instagram and Snapchat Private CHAT are gaining the younger social media users Following up on that concept it is concluded that Snapchat is Facebooks biggest competition Ill challenge that understanding in this article The reason for challenging it is because if you acknowledge Snapchat is Facebooks biggest competitor then you are most likely bullish on the stock as Facebook has the resources to compete with the upstart firm If you worry about overall competition from other sources with the entire social media space you may become more bearish One comparison to this scenario is how Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Eric Schmidt thinks that Amazon is Googles biggest competitive threat not Bing or another search engine The reason why he believes this is because consumers tend to go directly to Amazon to buy something instead of Googling it Consumers who have the intention of purchasing something are more valuable than someone looking up information This type of innovative competition instead of direct competition tends to be the way the internet progresses Another example is how Facebook is YouTubes biggest competition not Vimeo Redbox wasnt Blockbusters biggest competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was If you fail to see Facebooks biggest competitor then Id say youre valuing the company wrongly I think it is difficult to predict internet trends At one point most people used AOL to access the internet Currently Facebook is what most people use to connect with friends on the internet Will this continue I dont know However without metrics backing up my skepticism that Facebooks next years will be smooth sailing I have nothing Luckily I do have them below As you can see from the chart below from SimilarWeb Facebooks mobile Android app usage has declined in every country except Germany In America the usage went from minutes to minutes per day With Facebook becoming saturated in terms of total users the more important resource for growth can be the time spent per user According to IAB UKOM the average Brit spends hours and minutes per day online There is of course a natural limit the amount of people can spend online and the amount they spend on social media We may be near peak social media Adding to Facebooks woes the total time spend on Instagram is also down in all countries among Android users Time spent on Instagram in the US is down from minutes to minutes This means combined Facebook and Instagram have lost minutes in total usage in America Facebook can counteract these declines by raising the amount it charges per ad but eventually that reaches a limit as there are plenty of other ways to advertise online besides social media Snapchat usage is also down across the board US usage went from minutes to minutes This stat is what brings up my criticism for those who claim Snapchat is Facebooks biggest competitor Facebook and Instagram were able to decline without Snapchat picking up the slack In the social media prism Snapchat surely is one of Facebooks biggest competitors However we must look to other prisms to find out what is causing this decline which now adds up to minutes of declines in the US The final chart shows declines in usage from Twitter TWTR but I doubt many are surprised with this US usage went from minutes to minutes which leads the total declines in social media from these four apps to be minutes I focused on the US because it is the largest market for ad spending The following is a quote from SimilarWeb if you are questioning these statistics I usedWe have the largest international panel in the world pared with an internet crawler that categorizes and scans over Billion web pages a month We are also partners with International Internet Service Providers ISP and therefore we are able to see the anonymous data in order to understand internet trends In addition we also have a learning set of tens of thousands of websites worldwide that share their direct measurement with us Put all of this together with our proprietary algorithm and that is how we accurately get data from every website and app in the world The question as to what is taking share from social media is difficult to answer A top competitor to social media is entertainment so it is possible websites such as YouTube and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could be growing at social medias expense As weird as it sounds now there was a time when social media posting didnt exist Consuming news and speaking to one another on an individual basis as always existed These are tasks which can occur on social media but dont have to be The glue that keeps users on Facebook for news and messaging is the original posts Facebook has seen a decline in original sharing As I said it is a weird concept to imagine now that we havent always shared every part of our lives online This trend could be reversing In summary my hypothesis is entertainment messaging apps and news consumption can take share from social media in the future and may be doing so right now You can consume news on Facebook but you dont have to The reason why you are on Facebook to begin with is original sharing This decline would be devastating to Facebook if it accelerated Of course Facebook does have Messenger and WhatsApp to slow the negative effects of this trend but one has to wonder is Messenger will maintain its user base if Facebook usage declines The data I used was from one quarter The decline in original posting is also only one data point There is not conclusive evidence to say Facebook is doomed but any skepticism holds more weight when you have an expensive stock As you can see from the Scout Finance App Facebook stock is up since the IPO Facebooks valuation is expensive The PEPS is The valuation decreases if you look into the future but it is only cheap if you use estimates which show accelerating growth These estimates for and beyond could take a hit if advertisers start pulling back on spending on social media because of declines in usage The simplified summation of this article is that social media time spent across the board is declining on Android which makes up the vast majority of total smartphones in the world This could mean Facebook has bigger worries than competitors such as Twitter and Snapchat This decline combined with Facebooks expensive valuation makes it a stock readers should avoid Disclosure I amwe are short FB AMZN I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
