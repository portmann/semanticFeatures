class='textDiv'>The Spell Is Broken <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Is More Like A Traditional TV Network <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Weve long held the belief that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is nothing more than a content delivery platform one of many to be exact Recent developments indicate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is becoming more like a traditional TV network In the midst of this shift the stock continues to be wrongly valued as a tech stock which creates significant downside risk Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX plunged afterhours on Monday after its earnings report revealed weaker than expected subscriber growth Most notably domestic subscriber growth continued to slow More shockingly at million the companys projections for its second quarter net subscribers additions are far below expectations million We think this news should break the spell that has kept investors blind of the poor economics and competitive position of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>This stock remains highly overvalued Even if valued at a premium to its much more profitable traditional media peers the best investors can hope for the stock is share We think share is the more likely eventuality It is a simple law of business that any discretionary product appeals to fewer consumers when it becomes more expensive How many customers do you think McDonalds NYSE MCD would lose if it raised prices by across the board It would be a lot and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is no different In our original Danger Zone call on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in November of we predicted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would have to raise prices in order to have any hope of generating cash flow and that raising prices would undermine customer growth Our November report provides historical precedence for how price hikes affect the companys customer growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shed almost million subscribers in when it announced a new price for streaming and DVD rental services up from the previous amount of Customers in this space have many choices and they will quickly and easily flock to a lower price option whenever needed Investors should not be surprised that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>lowered guidance for subscriber growth for Q after announcing that many longtime users will face price increases starting in May <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>raised the price for new subscribers from to month two years ago and now longtime users are being ungrandfathered and will have to pay the new higher rate These users have many more options for streaming video than they did in For years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had one significant advantage over its streaming competitors its massive library of movies and TV shows As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has pushed more and more into original content recently it can no longer afford that massive catalog of licensed content Over the past two and a half years its content library has shrunk by Figure shows a data series weve graphed in multiple previous articles on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Before we discussed the massive increase in the companys content obligations Now its notable that those obligations have increased slower than revenue in two out of the past three years and We also predicted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would have to move into producing more original content in order to justify charging customers more We doubt few investors believed the company could ever generate enough cash flow to justify its valuation by charging consumers to see reruns Unfortunately for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the more it shrinks its content library and raises its price the less there is to distinguish it from the multitude of other streaming services flooding the market Investors should think of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>less like a highflying tech company and more like a traditional video content provider like CBS NYSE CBS or Viacom NASDAQ VIAB Both those companies have roughly double the revenue of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but CBSs enterprise value is lower and Viacoms is lower At its core <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is merely a content delivery platform and one of many From Amazon NASDAQ AMZN video services to CBS All Access to HBO Go Outerwalls Red Box NASDAQ OUTR and Dish Networks Sling TV etc There is no shortage of competition in this space and none of them stand out as offering anything that is really unique <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is attempting to separate itself by creating original content only available to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers but it is not the only player in that game The first mover advantage in streaming video for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has eroded rapidly It no longer looks like a singular entity in the ondemand video space Instead its one of many players in an increasingly crowded field searching for eyeballs Its still the leader but wheres the competitive advantage needed for pricing power Figure shows the striking valuation gap between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and TV networks such as CBS Viacom and HBO parent Time Warner Despite having a similar return on invested capital ROIC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is valued with an Enterprise Value Revenue ratio between times higher Sources New Constructs LLC and company filings One could argue that NFLX deserves a premium over these other stocks due to its international growth opportunities and popularity among younger viewers Still its hard to justify the massive premium at Assuming a generous x multiple to revenue NFLX is worth share We suggest the x multiple only for the sake of argument and do not believe the stock deserves a premium valuation to companies that actually generate significant free cash flow and have sustainable competitive advantages Even with the postearnings drop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has unreasonable profit growth expectations baked into its stock price In order to justify a share valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>must grow aftertax profit NOPAT by compounded annually for years In this scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would need to maintain an average ROIC of far higher than weve ever seen from a media company A more realistic ROIC target would be for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to hit the same as Viacom within the next decade If the company can do that and grow NOPAT by compounded annually for years the stock is worth share Even those expectations could be a serious challenge for a company that burned billion in cash during its last fiscal year This stock has a lot of downside risk As the market grows more aware of the competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>faces it will become harder to sustain its skyhigh valuation Investors would be smart to take their profits while they can Time Is Running Out Companies Cannot Lose Money Forever It is hard to see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can differentiate itself enough from the competition to charge the higher prices it needs to generate the profits already embedded in its stock price In fact we wonder if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can make any money and continue to maintain its new lower customer growth goals Per Figure Netflixs cumulative free cash flow burn since is over billion If they have not been able to make money so far what makes investors believe they will make more money in the future in an increasingly competitive market For how long will the market tolerate these losses in the face of slower growth and more competition The bottom line here is that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>business model is incapable of delivering the combination of revenue growth and cash flow implied by its valuation Original content creation is expensive and risky Most big networks and movie studies are owned by larger media conglomerates The strong cash flows and deep pockets of media conglomerates enable them to absorb losses when original content risks dont pan out eg Disneys John Carter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to burn cash and it will be forced to keep leveraging its balance sheet or diluting existing investors to fund operations So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has been able to pay employees with stock and take on more debt to fund its operations These funding sources could put the company at risk if the market turns against it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has billion in employee stock option liabilities If the stock price starts to fall all of a sudden those employees are making a lot less money and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could find itself with the same struggle to retain talent that crushed LinkedIn NYSE LNKD and Twitter NYSE TWTR recently We saw the market turn on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>today just from disappointing guidance numbers for subscribers We expect to see further disappointment on the subscriber growth front as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>tries to balance raising prices and fending off competition The company becomes more competitively boxed in every day Amazon recently announced it will offer its streaming video service as a standalone option for month less than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>As Amazon joins with Hulu to pressure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on the lowcost side HBO remains an imposing threat on the premium side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content chief Ted Sarandos has said the companys goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us The difference <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has million subscribers HBO has nearly million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wants to go head to head in original streaming content against a network with more subscribers more resources and a much longer history of creating the original programming that keeps subscribers coming back for more A recent survey found that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers say they wont accept any price increase That number is undoubtedly higher than the reality but it speaks to the increasing price sensitivity and the difficulty <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have in trying to raise prices and continue growing subscribers at the breakneck rate the market expects
