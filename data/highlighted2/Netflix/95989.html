NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha According to empirical research splits are indicative of stocks that are going to outperform While the split doesnt impact the financial statement aside from the per share denominator over various financial figures History is still on your side as companies who have the luxury of splitting shares tend to outperform the market Anyone who has followed me knows how much I like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and how much I believe in the underlying growth story The company added fuel to the fire by announcing a stock split effective July The impact from the stock split has less to do with the income statement and more to do with psychology In many cases stocks tend to move higher following a split so theres confirmation bias But notwithstanding broader biases I wanted to surface some arguments from academia The stock price is reacting positively to the news Its fairly obvious that the stock is in an upward trend but could the momentum really continue Source Jones Graduate School of Management Generally speaking across a broad population sample the mean performance of a stock following a split is over the next months according to the above study If we are to use the median the implied upside is around following the split Im going to go with the mean in this case because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is more of an outlier Since it probably fits within the top quartile of distributed possibilities theres a high likelihood that returns following the split will be in excess of When reading through the Jones academic paper the two main factors that really stood out was the underlying characteristic of the stocks that were split and the lag time for analysts looking to adjust their outward growth models at a bigger outstanding share base These two factors imply that over the shortrun market pricing can be inefficient because analysts are slow to adjust financial models and over the long haul stock splits are a reaction to overwhelming momentum in the stock My guess is that while the share split does little to do add or negate value from a financial context it does add confirmation to the fact that top performing stocks tend to experience stock splits So if we average the performance of stocks that split shares the next months tend to be pretty good So as long as the underlying fundamentals that drove the stock price higher continue to unfold Well in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>growth is starting to accelerate In an age where Internet bandwidth is becoming increasingly more abundant and at lower cost the advantages to OTT in comparison to linear television broadcast is driven by cost Furthermore the increasing base of subscribers makes it substantially easier for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to fund its own inhouse content or buy content from thirdparty producers In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can have just as much scale as the linear TV providers which has a circular effect of furthering its own economic advantage in comparison to lower scale providers that have to charge more Also foreign markets have lower barriers of entry due to the falling cost of bandwidth which expands the addressable market Given the expansion of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>into foreign markets and improving profitability domestically one can argue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a growth stock and that the underlying business model is highly predictable Because of the durability and noncyclicality of earnings from this kind of business model the valuation premium is trending higher Also the upside isnt capped because its highly unlikely that it will be bought out ie taken private <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>most closely resembles the future of global television And quite frankly who wouldnt want to own a global television network I address the more quantifiable aspects of the business in a prior article Source History Is On Your Side If You Decide
