class='textDiv'>Why Bears Are Wrong And Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Isnt A Bubble In The Making <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has outperformed this year and quite frankly its likely to exhibit solid returns when operating on a longer timeframe Accelerating growth improving margins and massive market potential have driven the yeartodate performance of the stock Fears of a tech bubble arent supported with sound analysis and Netflixs high valuation is driven by the underlying confidence that investors have in the business model and management While the business is difficult to value sellside analysts and management present fairly cogent arguments for investing into the stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is one of many tech companies that are victims of their high valuation Bears argue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is unstable because it has to enter into longterm content agreements or because content spend has trended higher diminishing the likelihood of margin expansion They go on to mention that the valuation is too high for their liking Competitors and various balance sheet factors could damage the assumptions built into earnings and free cash flow models according to the bearish community While various SA contributors may be justified in their rationale Im going to address some of the more recent commentary with fundamental analysis Here are a couple quotations from SA authors on the topic of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>For those looking to benefit from the irrationality of the market other than riding the wave and hoping it continues you can try to figure out when the party could end This is difficult to be fair but eminently achievable and amply compensated by the potential rewards Furthermore it is intellectually valuable as an exercise to help avoid investing mistakes on the long side ie not falling victim to manias yourself Jeremy Raper SA Contributor This market bubble is compounded in the tech sector Stocks like Facebook LinkedIn Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>trade with average pricetoearnings PE multiples of nearly x Even by pricetosales PS the multiples are strong ranging from to Ironically of this batch of stocks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is actually one of the cheapest with a PE of around and a PS of approximately J Mintzmyer SA Contributor The idea that Netflixs stock is overvalued has already been beaten to death but its still a valid argument As with many hot growth stocks like the cybersecurity stocks currently valuation is less of a concern as the company spends to expand But for shareholders that means a lot of room to drop if things slow unexpectedly Dave Dierking SA Contributor Admittedly the concern is valuation valuation and again valuation However when studying economics there are many factors that can drive demand so its hard to imagine how the authors are making a rational argument At the very end of the day the market is usually right when it comes to pricing any good or service whether that good or service is a bond note stock note or a mortgage backed security The stock is trending higher because very few are willing to sell the stock and theres a lot of demand for the stock People spend a lot of money on really frivolous things like a inch TVs yachts designer clothing etc Realistically anyone who pays more for a good or service by a value investors definition is acting irrationally regardless of whatever marginal value they can anticipate from the purchase The vast majority of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is institutionally owned and commentary from various sellside analysts remains upbeat for reasons that are fundamentally supported One can assume that if wellpaid professionals are willing to chase after the stock its probably because subscriber ramp pricing power and various other factors can drive significant upside in the stock Here are the four keytrends were seeing the valuation is trending higher regardless of the denominator solvency metrics are improving margins are declining and revenue growth is starting to accelerate On the other hand the company is unable to drive that incremental improvement to bottom line results as the company is favoring investment over retained earnings for FY and parts of FY Now typically people imagine an investment year to be capitally intensive But when you follow technology much of the investment comes in the form of RD SGA and COGS The valuation is supported by managements ability to scale its business Since the global streaming market is a large and untapped market its not surprising to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>rely on debt financing content spend and marketing to drive growth This seems like an appropriate strategy as significant scale will give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the ability to operate an unprecedented content library at lower average total cost So while rampup is expensive once the business reaches significant scale profitability will improve drastically Heres a series of quotes by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management that negates the arguments made by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bears And the second thing is a little bit of just the mechanics of how we allocate content cost by geography So by growing faster internationally and putting that allocation more toward international its going to provide some relief to those global originals in the global projects that we do have that are allocated to the US and we intend to continue to invest in that Thats also why we put in the letter that our target remains the same in David Wells CFO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>But there are variations And whats great about the viewing is if you look two years ago in this call we said it was billion hours in the Q and over those two years we have gone from billion to billion hours of viewing And so you can see along with our membership growth we are also having engagement growth which given all the new competitors improving television is really impressive that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is growing not only the subs but engagement also Reed Hastings CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>So we see engagement we see value for the content So it makes me more comfortable and confident that we are investing in something that has lasting value Two is that we really are scaling along with the business So we have grown from billion in streaming content commitments in the table to billion Thats about a yearoveryear growth rate and our streaming revenue has grown at yearoveryear as well So that makes me a little bit more comfortable David Wells CFO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Overall fears over margin and solvency were addressed in those comments Furthermore engagement trends indicate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does in fact have room to increase pricing even without a tiered approach because consumers are finding marginal value in the content selection even as content auctions are becoming more competitive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>isnt as exposed to the middleman argument because the other half of its content spend will come from its own inhouse productions which generates a great return on investment from the context of spend per billion hours of viewing It also acts a downside hedge For example if in the event content licensors were to charge aggressively <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could reallocate its content budget to original series and movies Also when looking at COGS its increasing at a slightly slower rate than domestic revenue which indicates that theres a mechanism for improving profitability Therefore improving profit margins is not some pie in the sky scenario There could be inherent risk to investing into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which is mostly driven by sentiment We have seen episodes where Netflixs stock would plummet overnight due to changes in its business practice causing panic and fear However after a couple quarters management largely mitigated the concerns as various steps to remain competitive despite higher content costs have kept the bears in hibernation for much of through I remain bullish on tech in general and I dont think the current market environment is anywhere near reminiscent of the com boom and bust era In many cases the dotcoms had really questionable business models that were supported by advertising rates that werent sustainable The relative ease in which IPOs could fetch really quick returns that were extremely generous drove speculation and stratospheric valuations Somehow investors thought those valuations would be supported by growth in adrates and clickthroughrates Obviously the opposite happened as consumers avoided ads and bought various spam prevention technologies reducing the effectiveness of ads Pretty soon the math of dotcoms changed and correspondingly the market started dumping the dotcom stocks Following Yahoos downward revision of outlook the bubble finally popped in Clearly the admodel of dot coms only worked when ads were sold to other dot coms but nowadays digital marketing is quickly replacing TV advertising due to its reach potential to convert consumers online and various marketplace ecosystems that diminish the likelihood of admispricing Various factors may damage tech stocks but are isolated to specific situations like litigation competition and obsolescence rather than sector overvaluation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>isnt an old tech company so it hasnt been given enough time to build the size of its balance sheet or improve profitability However over the long haul I anticipate that the company will possess the characteristics of a wellbalanced growth investment that trades at a more reasonable valuation while returning capital in the form of share buybacks and dividends Im not alone in this positive sentiment and I think that its weird for there to be such a divergence of opinion on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>In a recent report by Morgan Stanley Adam Parker Chief Equity Strategist in the United States states that tech companies in general possess great fundamentals As new business models have emerged and succeeded in the sector tech companies no longer resemble the makeshift operations that quickly burned through their cash more than a decade ago In fewer than half of the technology companies were profitable Currently while there are always going to be some headline examples to the contrary approximately of technology companies have positive operating margins and the tech sector has the highest freecashflow yield of any market sector In addition more than onethird of the trillion in cash on the balance sheets of US companies today belongs to technology firms Over the longterm Netflixs business model will address many of the concerns that bears have been making which is why Im optimistic Heres what I published earlier in the year So I estimate that by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have million international subscribers and million domestic subscribers totaling million subscribers Assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can switch more users over to its K streaming package and moves the average pricing to per month year basically a CAGR in pricing domestically and the company may generate billion domestically in revenue The international segment will likely keep pricing in the upper single digits perhaps per month so the international segment will probably generate billion When combined Netflixs revenue may reach billion over the next five years Following that line of logic the stock could easily trade at to times sales which would push the stock to a market cap range of billion to billion Now historically can I support this type of valuation Yes yes and yes Look at the historical PS chart of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in comparison to my projected sales multiple range Also my outward estimates are aggressive in comparison to other analysts but for good reasons Sales will accelerate due to the international rollout of streaming and the gradual increase in subscription rates Subscription rates will increase as users migrate to the higher tier package which will come as a result of households adopting UHD TV sets Now obviously NFLXs valuation fluctuates but with my suspicion of accelerating growth theres a decent likelihood that investors will chase the stock The valuation tends to modulate between a to times sales in the prior three years which is inline with my comments on a to times sales ratio range <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has the ability to exhibit pricing power subscriber additions and margin expansion This runs counter to the rationale made by bears but is supported by both sellside analysts and management Therefore investors betting against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are contrarians Theres a questionable risktoreward when betting against the stock I also want to mention that the stock isnt a part of another com bubble The company has a growing base of subscribers and has high retention rates For a nonad model to be treated like an unpredictable time bomb ready to setoff at any moment is absurd I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will exhibit further upside from current levels as bottom and top line growth is both sustainable and predictable NFLX is exposed to the overall performance of the broader market but can offset market volatility with continuing improvement to its operations Therefore I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on the stock Source Why Bears Are Wrong And Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Isnt A Bubble In The Making Disclosure
