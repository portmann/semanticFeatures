for Q This is part of a very positive and continuing trend Many of Amazons new products which should drive Prime results higher outperformed over the recent Thanksgiving holiday weekend This bodes well for Q results Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN has a largely deserved reputation for being the online marketplace It earned this reputation many years ago and since then it has been a Wall Street darling AMZN has been designated a momentum stock and its value has been run up beyond all reason Its FPE Forward PE is That number puts Amazon at a roughly a fold premium to most of its retail peers Does any stock deserve this kind of valuation I would have argued that no stock does However Q results from AWS Amazon Web Services may present a justification for all of the previous years of hype Given that the Thanksgiving long weekend Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday retail sales review by Amazon management is hugely positive that makes the stock a still better buy both for the long term and the near term The following is an exact excerpt from Amazons review of its Thanksgiving sales Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday The topselling products across all of the products available on Amazoncom this Black Friday were Amazon devices was Fire was Fire TV Stick Amazon Fire TV Sales are up more than x year over year this holiday shopping weekend From July through October Fire TV has been the streaming media player in the US across all retailers On its first Black Friday Amazon Echo was the best seller across all products on Amazoncom The new Fire Tablet is the fastestselling Amazon tablet ever with millions sold since launch Amazon tablet sales this weekend are up more than x year over year Historically Amazon doesnt present defined numbers in these performance announcements Still the above is probably as close as you will get to a rave review announcement by the company It indicates that its retail business is doing better than expected this holiday season It indicates a number of the companys longterm plans to gain market share are progressing splendidly This bodes well for the future of Amazons profits It likely bodes ill for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Aside from the regular sales which is the biggest but not the most profitable part of Amazons business AWS had what could only be called stellar results in Q In fact AWS has been having fantastic growth results for some time Recently it has become a much larger percentage of Amazons profits and AMZN expects that percentage to grow quickly In Q AWS reported B in revenue and million in profit Thats a rise in revenue and a rise in profit year over year AWS accounted for about of Amazons total revenue of B in Q Its million in profit in Q moved AMZN into the black for Q with million in profit per diluted share By comparison the company lost million per diluted share in Q Consider that Q each year is usually Amazons best quarter In the past that has meant that the ecommerce business has done well during the Christmas season With the bullish report above this season may be even better for the ecommerce business It is a little worrisome that the company is selling so many Fire Fire TV Stick Echos and Kindle ereaders they are usually unprofitable or barely profitable However that also means Amazon is getting a lot more streaming customers which is extremely bullish longer term Even if the ecommerce part of the business is unprofitable for Q the market will likely bid the price of the stock up due to the new customersubscription gains Amazon hasnt provided enough information to make the profitability call on the ecommerce business Source Amazon Investor Relations If one estimates a gain of about million in AWS revenues sequentially one gets to approximately B in Q AWS sales For Q about of the Net Sales fell to the bottom line of the Operating Income of B is about million If you then also look at the chart of the GAAP Operating Income you can see that the last negative quarter for this metric was in Q That quarter has already rolled off the trailing twelvemonth list of statistics Further what seems likely to be a big Q is about to cycle onto the TTM books AWS revenues and profits should add still more upside Given the good Thanksgiving Weekend news it seems likely that the GAAP Operating Income for Q will be significantly higher than the GAAP Operating Income reported for Q Q AWS results should help that along The much higher sales of the items cited above should help that along However the really important factors from an investors standpoint will be the outlook for AWS growth and the outlook for profits from the overall business As readers can see the TTM GAAP Operating Income has been increasing rapidly With the good Thanksgiving weekend news this very rapidly rising trend seems likely to continue in Q and beyond That makes Amazon a buy even though the stock is up considerably this year Remember the FPE is about However this references FY earnings Once Amazon reports its Q earnings early in the metric will shift its reference to FY That should the cut the FPE of more than in half Look at the AWS Operating Income chart above in combination with the GAAP Net Income chart below to see how true this is Q should be an even bigger replacement number for Q The PE should go down Consider also that AWS million in profit in Q will likely rise to more than B by QE Even if you conclude that the rest of Amazon will only reach a noloss noprofit state the roughly B in AWS profits should amount to roughly xx the FY GAAP Net Income If one postulates another approximate doubling of the AWS profit in FY that would yield a ballpark FPE about of the current PE of or about With an average analysts next five years EPS Growth estimate per annum of this makes AMZN a great buy especially for the long term A EPS growth rate with a roughly FPE would allow for good growth in FY with even better stock price growth in A common rule of thumb is that the FPE can match the expected fiveyear EPS Growth estimate per annum If Amazons other businesses become more profitable themselves the upside should be even greater The recent huge Fire and Fire TV sales argue that such upside is coming This is a great chart The uptrend has been hugely positive lately Some might think that this chart has to fall from here However the AWS profits along with the improving Prime metrics would suggest that this steep uptrend has at least a couple of years to go if not much more AMZN is finally becoming profitable and that profitability is likely to be great When the company reports Q earnings early next year everyone will be able to see the then much lower FPE Many people in the market only pay attention to PE and FPE numbers They dont know how they work They dont anticipate the changes Readers of this article have a chance to do that You cannot know for sure what the Q earnings report will bring but the results are almost sure to be interpreted positively AMZN is a buy We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact
