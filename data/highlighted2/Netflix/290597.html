wide variety of movies and TV shows but those offerings vary from country to country Some show that aired in Europe last year may not even be available for <span style='background-color:

but now the streaming video service is warning that these may soon not work There are a wide variety of proxy services and unblockers that trick <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>into thinking youre in whatever country you want to be in For a long time this worked to Netflixs advantage as users in countries without actual access to the service were transformed into evangelists for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spreading the word and increasing interest in the company before it even launched locally But now that after adding some new countries in a single day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is effectively available worldwide it looks like the reins are going to be tightened In a new blog post <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>VP of Content Delivery Architecture David Fullagar acknowledges that some users are using proxies and unblockers to access <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offerings in other countries but cautions that the company has the ability to curb this practice and intends to use it That means in coming weeks those using proxies and unblockers will only be able to access the service in the country where they currently are writes Fullagar We are confident this change wont impact members not using proxies The ultimate goal he writes is for every <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>user around the globe to be able to access the same content regardless of location Dont hold your breath for that one as media distribution is still incredibly localized No Hollywood studio wants to deal with figuring out licensing for hundreds of individual companies when they can hand off that business to smaller regional operations For now given the historic practice of licensing content by geographic territories the TV shows and movies we offer differ to varying degrees by territory writes Fullagar In the meantime we will continue to respect and enforce content licensing by geographic location The huge elephant standing in front of the TV in this room is China which still does not have access to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Users in the rest of the world can no longer justify using a proxy just to access <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but for viewers in China a crackdown may mean that these potential future customers will be blacked out until someone comes up with a way around whatever roadblock <span style='background-color:

there are plenty of good reasons for those concerned with security and privacy to use proxies reasons that have nothing to do with accessing streaming video Maybe I dont much like the government knowing exactly what web sites I choose to visit Maybe I dont much like my ISP good ol Comcast or anybody else tracking my web use for their own marketing or other purposes These are legitimate concerns here in the US especially given the recent history of data breaches and government overreach And in some countries not taking steps to disguise your geographic location while accessing certain web content could get you killed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to come up with a better solution that doesnt unfairly penalize those who arent seeking to circumvent licensing restrictions but have other legitimate privacysecurityrelated concerns In the meantime sophisticated techie types will likely find ways to get around the new restrictions anyway
