Dave Dierking Get Smart Get Wealthy clicks Theres much hype around any Apple TV announcement at the September th event but for now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still the content streaming king Competing services like Hulu Amazon Prime and HBO Now could all be viewed as either complementary to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or not a direct threat currently Apple could provide Netflixs biggest competition to date but its unclear what its original programming or the actual end product will look like Microsofts venture into content streaming was shuttered a couple of years back making Apples entry just slightly more murky <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has still been delivering strong subscriber growth will be launching into Japan shortly and has a number of international markets coming as well Apples NASDAQ AAPL big Wednesday event is sure to capture most of the markets attention and will provide a good benchmark as to where the company is at technologically and what it plans to unveil in the future An introduction of the new iPhone S and S Plus is expected as well as the possible announcement of an iPad Pro But Apple TV is what most want to hear about Apples decision to develop a video streaming service would obviously be a serious blow to a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX that is currently the alpha dog in that space and investors have been responding accordingly sending shares down significantly from all time highs While its easy to come up with reasons to be bearish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>right now Im actually thinking that this might be a good time to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares on the cheap You will find more statistics at Statista Its domestic subscriber growth is slowing as expected but the international markets are showing impressive gains The company is about to enter Japan and has a handful of other new markets on the horizon that should help support growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has managed to exceed subscriber growth expectations that last few quarters and theres not much reason right now to think that they cant continue this growth trend Increased competition will no doubt be a concern going forward with many more players entering the space but at this point its not as big a concern as one might think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has its limitations on purchased content but its won largely positive reviews for its original content Everybody is quick to mention House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black but it also offers a plethora of other high quality content like Daredevil Narcos and a slew of other comedies kids shows documentaries and specials coming over the next couple of years Its unclear how many people will subscribe for the original content but its content users wont be able to find on competing services Also consider that many of these services arent exclusive of each other Hulu provides mostly television programming and can be easily viewed as complimentary to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Amazon Prime NASDAQ AMZN offers a similar service to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but not nearly the content Much has been made of new services offered by HBO ABC and CBS but those services are still tied to a cable or satellite subscription in order to get the full benefit Given their limitations its difficult to see any one of those services becoming a replacement for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Most could however be considering complementary Which brings us back to the Apple TV We probably wont know what the end product of Apple TV will look like for a while but its reasonable to assume that it could be a replacement for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Thats assuming of course that Apple plans on creating original programming which while not yet confirmed is probably a safe bet Apple is sitting on a B cash pile and could easily purchase the streaming rights to just about any content it wanted An environment where Apple is able to provide original programming a greater content library and the heavily rumored gaming component could be a threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>But before that happens lets consider a few challenges that Apple has First the current Apple TV hasnt been a runaway success the way the iPhone and iPad have been Its been more like the Apple Watch in that its a nice addition to the Apple ecosystem but not necessarily a game changer Second an entry into the streaming video space still has the potential of being risky Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT also ventured into content a couple years back before pulling the plug although to be fair Apple is much better positioned than Microsoft to succeed in this area Third its still rumor at this point Apple might very well still be a ways away from debuting the actual product The concern with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>regarding the stocks overvaluation and its cash flow burn are very real and shouldnt be ignored Ive argued that very point in the past but it seems like for the time being that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>trades on subscriber growth In the meantime I feel that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock in the short term has been unfairly beaten down in light of the Apple TV announcement and could present a buying opportunity Over the long term time will tell who ends up winning in the streaming video space and Apple could very well end up being the winner In the short term though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still the king Other services have not yet provided meaningful direct competition to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Apple may not be providing it for some time to come While its possible that shares have yet to bottom in the near term I feel that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares are on sale and would consider establishing a position here Disclosure I amwe are long AAPL MoreI
