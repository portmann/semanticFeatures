class='textDiv'>Calculating Alibabas Video Streaming Potential Alibaba Group Holding Limited NYSEBABA Seeking Alpha Their soon to be launched video streaming service has a great deal of potential due to its combination of WesternChinese content and Alibabas strong brand Alibabas core business by itself is a cash producing machine growing by nearly a year but still trading at a ridiculously low PE of Amidst the chaos of Alibabas NYSE BABA continued stock price plunge some promising fundamental developments have been entirely ignored by the market One of these is the news that Alibaba has launched a video streaming service charging year for it This is actually a huge opportunity for Alibaba and they have the differentiating factors necessary to move the needle on their earnings and revenues Its true that Alibaba has a lot of noncore businesses it invests inowns that dont contribute all that much to their earnings Alibabas overall performance is still almost entirely determined by how well their ecommerce platform does regardless of their smart TV business their cloud business plane ticket booking sites etc Most of these side businesses simply dont contribute much in the form of earnings and they often generate losses in the short term However I believe Alibabas video streaming business is a game changer largely because they signed a massive movie deal with NBCUniversal NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK which gives them a great deal of western content to bring to Chinese consumers These include huge blockbusters like Minions and Jurassic World Of course Alibaba also has popular Chinese content as well but this Western content is really the key differentiator and why I think this side business has such a great deal of potential The language in the press release also leads me to believe Alibaba may have received some favorable terms in paying for the content the chairman stated that this partnership will continue to increase our reach in the market as well as driving additional revenues for us in Asia Notice how the revenues are added on second almost as an after thought The real benefit for NBCUniversal here is that they build even more mind share among Chinese consumers perhaps hoping to gain an edge over competing studios like Disney NYSE DIS not that they get a large stream of revenue from Alibaba licensing the content Alibaba also has other excellent Western shows due to its deals with Lionsgate such as Mad Men Moreover Western content and products in general tend to be very popular with the growing Chinese middle class giving Alibaba a key edge in drawing customers to its video streaming service instead of to its competitors such as Baidus NASDAQ BIDU Qiyi Now Ill get to the actual numbers a year is a pretty low price and the monthly price is a month which equates to a year Im going to assume the majority of people get the yearly subscription and estimate that the average revenue per customer will be a year At this price range all levels of the middle class are able to afford the service though the rurallow income populations will most likely not be able to Right now the number of middle class hovers around million and is estimated by McKinsey to reach million by Thats a massive addressable market Im also assuming that Alibaba will only find success in China with its streaming service The positives for Alibaba include that it essentially has the best streaming service on the market due to its combination of high quality Western and Chinese content so they have a first movers advantage because the VOD market is still fairly new in China so long as they get it out of beta soon and a strong brandmind share among Chinese consumers Im also going to be using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX as my point of comparison since it was also the first VOD service in America but did not have the benefits of a very strong brand unlike Alibaba Around of Americans consider themselves middle class which equates to around million people Of those million million are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers Note that a lot more people probably watchhave access to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>due to sharing among friendsfamily Alibaba may apply more stringent sharing controls than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>resulting in a higher percentage of subscribers But I want to be as conservative as possible in my calculations so I wont account for this or the fact that Netflixs American subscriber account is growing Regardless this equates to of middle class people subscribed to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Applying this to China you get million potential customers for Alibabas video streaming service Thats around billion in additional revenue by This would already higher than Netflixs current revenues by Netflixs operating margin for streaming services in before they started investing heavily in original content and expanding internationally was around Again its important to note here that the margin is dependent on the negotiations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was not the massive behemoth it currently is in giving it little negotiating power On the other hand Alibaba is a massive behemoth with a tremendous amount of scale and negotiating power This is likely to help margins Essentially Alibaba has set their streaming service up to be a multi billiondollar business within six years even when using conservative assumptions The Chinese middle class also wont just stop growing in so that leaves the opportunity for continued revenue and net income growth I dont think investors are really realizing that Alibabas video streaming service has potential especially given the beating the stock has received The potential valuation for such a business is around half of Alibabas current market cap if we again compare it to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>using revenue metrics with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>having a market cap of billion and Alibaba a market cap of billion Im a bit skeptical that its actually worth that much since I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is worth billion but its easy to see that the potential to move Alibabas earnings and valuation is huge None of this is priced into Alibabas stock or future estimates I would in fact argue that current estimates alone are enough reason to buy the stock hand over fist a forward PE of for a company growing at is absurd If that isnt good enough for investors I encourage investors to consider what Ive said about the streaming services potential We
