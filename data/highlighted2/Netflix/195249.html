indicative of a strong and rapidly growing international audience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is set to announce Q results after the market closes Wednesday October The earnings report is quite crucial as it comes amid several new expansion initiatives and changing macroeconomic conditions including multiple international market launches intense competition from Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Prime and Hulu globally emerging market weakness global currency devaluation and a strategic shift in company focus to exclusive content We believe current trends indicate strong domestic and international paid subs growth which will drive a revenue beat despite FX headwinds and Japan pricing weighing on international monthly ARPU Analysts are looking for billion in revenue for the quarter We believe that this estimate is an accurate gauge for Netflixs performance in the quarter and further believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will beat that number by roughly million According to our analysis there are strong paid subs growth trends to support healthy Q growth In terms of QQ sequential growth domestic streaming paid subs growth has slowed this year Q saw domestic streaming paid subs grow QQ down from Qs QQ growth of and Qs QQ growth rate International streaming paid subs QQ growth though saw a sharp snapback to accelerating growth after a down Q This is due to new market expansion in Q specifically including Australia and New Zealand market launches in March Moreover we can see a deceleration in the DVD subs loss rate In terms of YY growth domestic streaming paid subs growth has been consistently slowing from in Q to in Q with markedly lower YY growth rates this year compared to last year YY international paid subs growth rates were showing a slowing trend until a MRQ reversal due to new market launches Concurrently YY DVD paid subs loss rate has decelerated over the past year In terms of domestic paid subs growth Q sequential growth has outpaced Q sequential growth in the past years Q saw domestic streaming paid member count grow just over sequentially million to million while Q saw domestic streaming paid member count grow just over million to million By comparison Q domestic streaming paid member count grew QQ million to million and Q domestic streaming paid member count grew QQ million to million In the past years Q domestic streaming paid sub growth has outpaced Q domestic streaming paid sub growth by basis points Extrapolating this trend Q domestic streaming paid sub growth QQ should be greater than Qs QQ growth We believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will report domestic streaming paid members of million in Q This represents QQ growth roughly basis point acceleration from Q QQ growth and YY growth consistent with the current decelerated domestic streaming paid subs growth trend We also believe international growth will build upon its strong Q YY growth thanks to its Japan launch and continued expansion in European and Australian New Zealand markets Q includes roughly one month of the Japan launch and new nonEnglish originals like Narcos and Club de Cuervos ensure continued strong adoption in foreign markets We see international paid member count growing to million in Q as this represents YY growth While this may seem high relative to Qs YY international streaming paid member growth it is still slower than Qs YY growth Given new market launches we believe this growth in paid international streaming members is very achievable On the DVD subs side we believe YY loss rate will continue to decelerate We believe paid domestic DVD member count will be just over million at the end of Q a YY decline In terms of our calculated monthly ARPU which differs from the reported monthly ARPU and is simply revenue divided by paid members at end of period divided by we believe that domestic streaming monthly ARPU will continue to build on its upward climb We are looking for domestic streaming monthly ARPU of as YY paid subs growth decelerates meaning a higher concentration of full month paying subs We believe domestic DVD ARPU will stabilize at as domestic DVD ARPU has fluctuated around since In relation to international streaming monthly ARPU we believe that figure will continue to decline in Q as the strong dollar and Japans pricing structure will likely weigh on ARPU Although the Euro has somewhat stabilized against the USD most other global currencies weakened during the quarter and this should adversely affect international monthly ARPU Moreover Japans pricing structure offers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for per month for basic a healthy discount to MRQ monthly international ARPU of We are looking for slight international monthly ARPU compression QQ to We expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to earn roughly billion from domestic streaming customers in the quarter million paying members at end of quarter times monthly ARPU times just above million from international streaming customers in the quarter million paying members at end of quarter times monthly ARPU times and just under million from DVD customers million paying members at end of quarter times times In sum we expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to report record revenues of billion in Q an million beat on analyst estimates While this revenue beat is marginal at best it is a beat on an aggressive analyst number calling for YY topline growth We expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to top this estimate despite emerging economy and strong dollar headwinds and believe this is representative of a rapidly growing international audience For reference we have attached historical Q Q and Q data that we have used in this analysis All data is pulled directly from SEC filings except for monthly ARPU which we
