high from August These concerns are overblown and DIS is well positioned to capitalize on new streaming trends Content is king for media companies DIS owns the most soughtafter franchises in the world DIS has been investing heavily in its Parks Resorts and Consumer Products segments while cutting costs at ESPN The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS together with its subsidiaries operates as an entertainment company worldwide The company operates in five segments Media Networks Parks and Resorts Studio Entertainment Consumer Products and Interactive Disneys stock has still not fully recovered since its August selloff and is primed to surpass its alltime high of very soon The company owns the rights to the most valuable characters in the world and can deliver content like no one else can Disneys key strength is its ability to integrate a single successful franchise between its many business segments The company can generate cash in a variety of ways making it an excellent longterm holding Investors should not lump Disney in the same group as companies like Discovery and Viacom Sporting events are not streamed on services like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>while numerous shows from MTV are ESPN has an enormous market share and of all sports programming is watched live According to recent data it is clear that ESPN has a monopoly in its industry During Q of of all multichannel households tuned to ESPN while viewership for the VMA Awards on MTV fell from last year For now cable customers cannot add ESPN by itself but must purchase it in a bundle of channels including MTV TNT History etc which increases the price If consumers continue to move towards streaming services cable companies will be forced to create new channel packages that give customers cheaper ESPN without the unwanted channels Disney has contracts with top sporting events including rights to Monday Night Football the College Football Playoffs and the NBA Finals for the good part of the next decade The games are very popular with second ads in Januarys College Football Final going for million Ad revenues are increasing and ESPN has been cutting costs to become more efficient These sporting events will provide a steady stream of income for Disney in the nearterm and will be watched live not streamed later by a majority of viewers Looking further the company is actually well positioned to capitalize on demand for streaming services Disney owns a stake in Hulu and has recently launched a standalone streaming service called DisneyLife Minutes streamed per month on WatchESPN increased by last year showing that Disney provides quality content the method of delivery is the only difference Purchasing LucasFilm for B was possibly the best investment Disney has ever made Demand for the new Star Wars movie is incredibly high with the initial trailer receiving million YouTube views in its first week Tickets first became available on October th and have already broken every IMAX record According to MovieTicketscom of the tickets sold on their website that day went towards Star Wars This new Star Wars movie is also expected to be popular in China as the original Star Wars movies from the s and s premiered for the first time in China in June Overall the reaction to the movies was positive with the first episode receiving an average of out of on Doubancom a Chinese film review site It seems like the Chinese audience embraces Star Wars as an army of stormtroopers recently stood on the Great Wall to promote the movie Popularity in China could be key for driving revenue growth as box office sales in the country have increased dramatically from B in to B in Not only have international box office revenues been increasing but the amount of digital screens has also The amount of screens in the world has increased by and over the last years This shows that traditional movie theaters are still popular among consumers and continue to offer growth potential This is because theaters have priority access to major films while offering higher quality picture and sound than most home theaters While streaming services may cut into TV revenue box office revenues are more difficult to penetrate because content is provided through a different medium Because streaming services have been gaining popularity in comparison to DVDs Disney has made agreements to stream the Star Wars films on Tencent OTCPKTCEHY in China and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX in Latin America Tencent recently passed Alibaba NYSE BABA in terms of market capitalization and China is notorious for pirating films By signing contracts with these streaming services Disney will gain revenue that it otherwise might have missed out on Disney should also capitalize on streaming services in the US due to its stake in Hulu On August Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the construction of two new Star Wars parks in Disneyland and Disney World Disney will begin constructing the parks in creating Disneys largest singlethemed land expansions ever at acres each Because Disneyland and Disney World are the companys fastest growing parks in terms of attendance these acre expansions will provide Disney with valuable space to fit an increasing customer base In attendance at Disneyland and California Adventure grew by and respectively Although these growth rates are lower than the overall theme park industry Disney has roughly double the market share of the next closest competitor making even small growth meaningful This growth in attendance has come in spite of ticket price increases which have brought Disneyland tickets from in to in The park is often filled to capacity forcing Disney to stop selling tickets at certain times of the day meaning the company cannot make money from ticket sales or merchandise With per capita guest spending in theme parks up in FY Disney will generate more income by fitting more customers in these acre expansions On September Disney launched its first Force Friday event which marked the first time that fans could purchase new Star Wars merchandise This event was very successful as out of every spent on toys from August to September was spent on a Star Wars toy Star Wars products will extend much further than just toys as Disney has struck deals with a variety of companies including Covergirl Duracell HP Subway Verizon FiatChrysler General Mills EA Games and ANA Japans largest airline Partnerships with these brands will allow Disney to reach a wide range of demographics allowing the Star Wars franchise to be featured on all types of products from lipstick and cereal to airplanes and computers Disneys consumer products segment has been growing in sales as well as efficiency with operating profits increasing from in to in This is because Disney merchandise is extremely marketable making up out of the worlds top toy licenses While much of this past growth can be attributed to Frozen Star Wars will drive future growth in this segment Perhaps the most exciting growth prospects for Disney come from the Asia Pacific region The Shanghai Disney Resort is expected to open in Spring and features six themed lands two hotels a park and a shopping entertainment district The two hotels will be the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel and the Toy Story Hotel which offer and guestrooms respectively The resort is being constructed on acres making it roughly double the size of the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim The location of the park is perhaps its greatest advantage The park is located in the Pudong region which is home to Chinas wealthy financial district as well as the countrys rd largest airport Shanghai has been one of Chinas fastest growing cities in many categories including population income investment and tourism In Shanghais per capita disposable income reached surpassing Beijing to become the top city in China Disney is incredibly popular in China and the resort should be very successful The company is so popular in fact that on May st the worlds largest Disney Store in Shanghai China was forced to close one hour after opening due to overcrowding concerns These overcrowding concerns should be resolved when the gates to the nearly acre Shanghai Disney Resort open From the ratios above it is clear that Disney is becoming more efficient and profitable While revenue increased by only over the past years net income and cash from operations grew by and respectively Disney has been increasing its margins consistently and is generating more income for every dollar of revenue Much of this increase can be attributed to Disneys Parks Resorts and Consumer Products segments which have been increasing as a percent of total operating profits When combined these segments have gone from accounting for of operating income in to in Because of fears surrounding ESPN it is good to see operating profits come from other segments Asia Revenue not available for While accounting methods may skew net and operating profits cash from operations cannot be adjusted as easily Cash from operations has been increasing at a faster rate than revenue meaning that Disney is not only generating sales but also converting those sales into cash The Asia Pacific region has been the fastest growing for Disney with a CAGR of over the past years Growth in Asia is key for Disney as the company has invested heavily in the Shanghai Disney Resort The DCF model I ran resulted in a market undervaluation of Disneys shares The DCF resulted in a value of a discount of compared to Disneys alltime high Because Disney has invested so heavily in Star Wars a box office flop could prove disastrous for the stock price Trailers and merchandise can get consumers excited about something but Disney must still produce an excellent movie to be successful If critics and moviegoers do not enjoy the film the next movies in line will surely not earn as much Merging two huge names like Disney and Star Wars could be very rewarding financially but it is an enormous risk to the reputations of both parties However this risk is mitigated due to the proven success of the last Star Wars movies Even if the new Disney movies are terrible fans will still enjoy theme parks and merchandise based on the original plot Although Disney has partially recovered from the notsorecent selloff share prices still have plenty of room to appreciate There are many positive factors surrounding the stock which will create positive sentiment among investors Star Wars will continue to break records and Shanghai Disney will be immensely successful Disney will beat analysts estimates on the next few earnings reports helping DIS
