class='textDiv'>Planet Fitness <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Like Growth Planet Fitness NYSEPLNT Seeking Alpha Planet Fitness is growing as a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was years ago I discuss similarities and the unique business model of PLNT You Belong That is one of the mottos of Planet Fitness NYSE PLNT one of the fastest growing franchises and somewhat new publicly traded companies in the country I have been a member for years Some in my inner circle have described this name as the next <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Now I am not sure we can so as far as comparing the name to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as the companies are vastly different operationally However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>depends on subscribers Planet Fitness also depends on members subscribers Both companies offer very low rates This often prevents cancellations as even when cash flow is tight these types of low dollar memberships are often the last to go Why else is the comparison somewhat appropriate Well PLNT is growing as a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was years ago Planet Fitness has an aggressive and wildly successful advertising campaign similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>especially the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>of years past While Planet Fitness doesnt have the global reach and is in an entirely different sector the growth path and member models are strikingly comparable However while we all know what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does there are likely readers who are unfamiliar with Planet Fitness Briefly Planet Fitness runs fitness centers ie gyms The beauty of these fitness centers are they are geared toward everyday people Simply put they are not for serious training The atmosphere is designed to be clean and inclusive Weight dropping grunting shouting are all highly discouraged and can result in public shame through the patented lunk alarm or worse membership revocation The company is operating a casual fitness center In fact Planet Fitness is more of a social gathering place than a gym in many regards Many college students state employees and finance sector friends routinely meet up at my local branches to get a workout in before happy hour Some use it as a happy hour Most offer tanning free pizza once a month and a limitless supply of tootsie rolls They also sell beverages health products and merchandise The business is low asset and relies on steady member fees But the draw is that you dont have to be in fantastic shape to feel like a part of the culture You belong But does the stock belong in your portfolio Is it the next <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I dont think it is the next <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but then again I never thought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock would surpass Hindsight is indeed The truth is the company is profitable and is just getting started The company just reported its Q and was quite successful I dont think it is in hypergrowth mode which is a good thing Instead the growth is manageable and steady I much prefer this approach A total of new Planet Fitness franchise stores were opened in the quarter bringing the total to This helps the company see revenues increase yearoveryear to million while system wide same store sales jumped This suggests both higher membership rates and increased merchandise sales What I think is strong to note is that despite revenues climbing just net income almost doubled This demonstrates the margin power of this business Eerily similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>yes But such a long way to go Net income was million versus million last year Contrast this with Netflixs billions in revenues and hundreds of millions in net income per year Still Planet Fitness moves are encouraging Income per share for Planet Fitness grew from to Christopher Rondeau Chief Executive Officer said this about the quarter The year is off to a strong start We continue to be successful attracting new consumers to Planet Fitness which combined with systemwide same store sales growth of contributed to our outperformance in the first quarter compared with guidance Awareness of our affordable nonintimidating fitness offering continues to increase driven by the combination of our powerful national advertising strategy and continued unit expansion We remain confident that we have a significant runway for growth based on how well our concept continues to resonate with the large population of casual and first time gym users At the same time our group of well capitalized franchisees is on schedule to open a record number of new stores this year and the pipeline is robust looking beyond We believe our differentiated asset light business model has our company well positioned to deliver enhanced profitability and greater value to our shareholders over the longterm There is your growth evidence The company is newly publicly traded and here in the company is on pace for record openings with a strong pipeline beyond On top of the growth the company is looking to be shareholder friendly Why Well despite being newly publicly traded the Board of Directors has authorized a million repurchase program for the companys common stock The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase The share repurchase program does not have a specified expiration date Still not considering the name The company also raised its full year outlook It now sees total revenue of to million with to new stores It upped its earnings guidance to to So what do you think Is this growth name worth your consideration Are you
