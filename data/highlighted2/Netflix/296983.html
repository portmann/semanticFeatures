class='textDiv'>Netflixs VPN Blocking Could Significantly Reduce International Growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are short NFLX MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article I discussed in previous articles how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to eventually start attacking VPN software to prevent unauthorized access to US content which is much superior to the alternatives Estimates of VPN software use to access US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are higher than many think and it is likely that a large number of these users will cancel This article discusses the estimated VPN usage to access <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and how this will impact international growth in the future One of the variables that I have consistently discussed in my previous coverage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is the impact of VPN software on their longterm growth I stated that it was only a matter of time before content providers get fed up with this blatant abuse of the system and start pressuring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to crack down on this soft form of piracy It turns out my prediction was right in a relatively short period of time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has announced that they will be targeting people who use VPN software to access US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>from other countries I stated previously that this impact will be much larger than the market anticipates and I am writing this article to discuss in more detail just how big of an impact this move will have on subscriber growth The first part of this article will offer some statistics as to just how many international users are currently using VPN software to access US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The next part of the article I will try and come up with practical estimates as to what percent of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers are likely to cancel their subscription after being blocked from US content Finally I will compare this reduction in users to some analyst subscriber predictions in order to come up with a more realistic picture of Netflixs growth over the next couple of quarters I also finally wanted to mention that this may only be a temporary headwind for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as if they are eventually able to obtain enough global content rights there will be no need for VPN software However given the tremendous difficulty that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has had in achieving this it seems reasonable that there will be a decrease in international subscription growth US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Vs International <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>For most American <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>investors they are aware that VPN software exists yet I dont think many people appreciate the scope of just how common this is used in other countries I live in Canada and the twopart <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>question goes as follows Do you have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>American or Canadian In my experience the majority of Canadians actually have US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>set up Keep in mind however that Im yearsold and I imagine that this trend would be more pronounced in my demographic I was eating Christmas dinner at my grandparents house when my yearold Grandpa informed me that he was on US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>thats when I started looking into the numbers a bit more closely To provide a bit of background information that many of the US viewers may not be aware of the international content just simply does not hold up to the US content This article offers a good comparison on the extreme differences in content being offered between various countries B y just the number of title available it is clear that US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has almost double the titles of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Canada and more than quadruple than that of much of Europe What these numbers dont show however is that the average quality of each show is much lower in Canadian <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as well As a Canadian for example it is extremely practical to pay per month to get access to content that is much more than better than Canadian <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>If Americans were offered Canadian <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>at a discount I guarantee almost nobody would take it When attempting to estimate the number of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>users that use VPN software there are a number of challenges First there is the question regarding how honest people are about doing something that is technically illegal This has made data about the use of VPN software highly suspect Second the percent of users using VPN software will be a function of how much better US content is compared to ones own country as well as the similarities in viewing preferences For example in countries such as Brazil I would imagine there would be less of a demand for VPN software compared to countries like Canada or Australia where people often watch similar content on TV to Americans Looking at some of the limited studies that have been done so far it seems that the best examples come from Australia and Canada One recent report suggests that approximately of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Australia users currently use a VPN product as well Keep in mind that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had just rolled out in Australia and therefore it seems likely that there would be more VPN users in a country that has had <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>longer as this would have allowed viewers enough time to be unsatisfied with their countries content The best example for a comparison is Canada which one study estimates that approximately of Canadians use VPN software My own anecdotal experience suggests an even higher number However there is another way to estimate the number of VPN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>users the number of users that are currently signed up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in countries that did not offer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>at the time The grand total suggests that over million people accessed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>from a country that does not offer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with the vast majority coming from China Given that it is estimated that only onethird of these are paying subscribers this would leave just under million paying users that are using a VPN product or more than I personally find these numbers very hard to swallow which is why I will take them with a grain of salt With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>now essentially being a worldwide company it is extremely plausible that many of these users would simply pay for their now locally available content which is why now was a somewhat logical time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to crack down on the VPN software However with over million users coming from China the least likely market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>success due to competition and regulation issues the attack on VPN software may have a huge impact on international subscriptions Just because someone has a VPN product does not necessarily mean that they will cancel their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscription On the contrary there are many users who likely will justify paying the extra few dollars per month for better content while also still being OK with paying less money for inferior content Therefore I will estimate that only half of the VPN users will actually drop <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>altogether If we use a conservative estimate of of worldwide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>users currently accessing it by a VPN this equates to million of the million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>international subscribers If we presume that only half of these people cancel this would equate to a loss of million subscriptions for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Lets also look at Canada a little closer there were an estimated million Canadian <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriptions last July so lets assume that number is close to million by now If estimates are accurate that of Canadians are using VPN software this equates to million users If half of these people cancel Canada alone would be responsible for a unit decrease in subscriptions Using the more liberal estimates of VPN usage being over this would bring a total of million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>international users that are at risk or up to million canceling I summarized a few scenarios in a table to estimate the number of cancellations based on the various data that I collected that uses and international VPN users and using various cancellation rates for the million international subscribers Looking at this table you can see that there is an enormous range of absolute cancellations that are strongly dependent upon the actual number of VPN users as well as the percent of people that are likely to cancel Even using the most conservative estimates on both sides this would still equate to million lost subscriptions This would meaningfully impact the million subscriptions they hope to achieve in Q However it seems more plausible that this trend would occur over the next year and not all within the next few months How will Future Growth Be Impacted By VPN Software Although it is important to consider the relatively shortterm impact on subscription cancellations with the new war on VPN software we must also consider how growth will be impacted Up until now nonAmericans were able to pay a small premium to access US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which clearly stood out in a league of its own in terms of content Now these same people will have to consider their limited content in comparison to the content offered by the competition Although I believe that most of the die hard fans will have already accessed VPN software it is likely that a lot of future users will be turned off by the lack of content and will not signup for US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Therefore it is only reasonable that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>international growth rates should be lowered to adjust for this likely trend Yet from everything that I have read no adjustments have occurred at all This means that the market has not priced it in which suggests even more evidence to Netflixs overvaluation I hope that you can forgive me for the large range of predictions that I have attempted in this article However it was difficult to calculate these numbers based on statistics that are very difficult to obtain in an accurate way Furthermore the percent of cancellations and impact to future growth will be dependent upon a number of variables including the quality of content offered in that country which may improve enormously with global licenses the effectiveness of the antiVPN campaign will it be a game of cat and mouse with technology and the quality and pricing of Netflixs competition in these countries Also with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>proactively targeting pirated content they may be able to improve their relationship with content producers which may be helpful in a competitive market At the very least Netflixs most recent move to ban VPNs was inevitable Although the impact of this change is highly speculative at this time I can confidently say that the impact overall will be negative towards Netflixs growth and that this variable has not been priced into the company </div></body></html>
