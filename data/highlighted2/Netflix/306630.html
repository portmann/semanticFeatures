not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Apples share price appears to have fallen into another trough reminiscent of mid Apple needs to convince investors that Apple has a future beyond iPhone Back in May when Apple NASDAQ AAPL was in a trough in its share price I wrote an article titled What Tim Cook Must Do To Turn Apple Around At the time many Apple fans questioned the very need for a turnaround but a turnaround in the share price was much desired by Apple investors Today Apple investors face a similar situation in terms of share price and market sentiment regarding Apple In this article Ill revisit the recommendations I made then as well as offer new ones that I believe would enhance growth and restore investor confidence In the AprilJune time frame Apples share price reached lows of split adjusted prices around share as the chart above shows Its not even clear that weve reached the bottom currently but the recent performance of the stock demonstrates that market sentiment has turned somewhat against Apple The experience in shows how disconnected market sentiment can become from reality In the negative perception of Apple was largely driven by Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT release of Windows and Windows Phone in the fall of These were supposed to kindle the rebirth of Windows and create new markets for Windows based tablets and phones And of course Apple would bear the brunt of this new reassertion of Windows dominance Combined with this was the belief that the commodity PC model would triumph once again and Apple would be thrust back into its proper status as a niche player It took Mr Market the better part of and to figure out that wasnt going to happen but the dream of Wintel dominance just will not die It has been resuscitated anew by Windows and fueled by assertions of Peak iPhone and the imminent decline of Apple I wanted to point out this recent history because I find that business and technology writers are not particularly good when it comes to history My point is simply that market valuation is based on market perception and Apples current valuation is based very much on the markets current perception of Apple I wouldnt say that the perception is completely off base Apples revenue growth clearly slowed in the December quarter and looks to go negative for the March quarter based on slowing sales of iPhone I think the perception that Apple is too dependent on iPhone has some validity Whether weve seen Peak iPhone or not there will be a peak eventually All products go through a sales trajectory and iPhone will be no different Theres still a great deal that Apple can do to forestall that peak but Apple also needs to evolve its business model into one that is more services oriented My new recommendation revolves around this But before I go into the new recommendation let me revisit what I recommended in My views have evolved since then and Apple has evolved as well Back in I was a lot more concerned about market share than Im now I had a lot of arguments with fans who claimed that Apple didnt care about market share Apple management has been a little inconsistent on the issue When an Apple product such as iPhone was gaining market share management was only too happy to tout this fact When market share falls management tends to fall back on we just want to build the best device Sometimes we get both messages in the same conference call as we did this week CEO Tim Cook fell back on the We just want to build the best device message for iPhone but CFO Luca Maestri also touted iPads market share in the US for tablets above Market share is about new sales share as opposed to usage share share of current users Apple announced on the December quarter conference call that it had reached a milestone of billion current users of all its various platforms But market share is important in order to ensure that the user base continues to grow Apple hasnt been doing all that badly in terms of market share especially in calendar IDCs most recent report for calendar Q confirms that Apple gained market share in even when all the white box Android devices that IDC counts are included I prefer to exclude white box Android devices since they dont really contribute to Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL bottom line in any meaningful way In the chart below I show Apples share of the top five smartphone vendors on a quarterly basis using IDC data Unit shipment growth slowed for Apple in calendar Q as Samsung OTCSSNLF and Huawei easily outgrew Apple in unit shipments as the chart below shows When you look at Samsungs December quarter earnings report its obvious how Samsung was able to grow unit deliveries yy Samsungs smartphone revenue actually declined by even as unit shipments were up by Samsung cut prices and sold more phones Which brings me to my fundamental recommendation that I made in and reiterate today compete on price This is not a recommendation that Apple cheapen its products or do anything different in product design This is about giving back some profit to consumers I agree that its cool that Apple takes of the smartphone industrys profit but does Apple really need to do that Is Apples current cash pile of billion not big enough Its already gotten to the point that Apple cant find anything to buy or invest in beyond what its already doing and Apple cant even give most of the money back to investors since its sitting offshore The most productive thing that Apple can do with its current profitability is give consumers a break in pricing Its a winwin for consumers and Apple Consumers especially in emerging markets get to enjoy Apple quality at more affordable price points and Apple gains market share and an enlarged user base I acknowledge that accepting lower margins would not be popular with investors in the near term It never has been But Apple can certainly afford to give up some operating margin which stood at almost in the December quarter My other recommendations from have been acted upon by Apple to varying degrees I recommended that Apple double RD spending It almost has doubled increasing from billion in calendar Q to billion for the December quarter Heres my new RD recommendation double it again That would bring Apples RD spending more or less in line with its competitors In I recommended that Apple diversify the iOS and Mac OS product lines Apple has done this and its been hugely successful for the company especially in terms of offering consumers reasonable choices in iPhone screen size Apple should continue to diversify the iPhone product with a small screen iPhone But please not a regurgitated iPhone s Apple should offer its new generation iPhone phones in three screen sizes They should all be identical in basic design and they should all be new phones Apple also needs to better leverage the superiority of its ARM processor technology Apple may make the fastest smartphone on the planet but its not readily apparent to consumers at the store counter Apple missed an opportunity to bring iOS multitasking to the iPhone s Plus iOS multitasking features such as slide over and split screen could have been implemented in the s Plus and would have provided consumers with a tangible discriminator against other smartphones Hopefully this oversight will be corrected for iPhone Apple still has much work to do on the Mac Apple should provide touch screen capability for Mac OS X If Apple is trying to keep iPad from being cannibalized by touch screen Macs it isnt working The cannibalization is simply being performed by Windows tablets and ins Yeah I agree that touch capable operating systems like Windows represent a compromise But Apple could still do a much better job of it than Microsoft And there are many creative professionals who want to use a touch screen with professional software packages such as Adobe Creative Cloud Right now those pros have nowhere to turn except Microsoft Finally I recommended that Apple take some risks It certainly has with the Beats acquisition and Apple Music even the latest Apple TV My latest recommendation take some more and bigger To add to the old recommendations I have just one central new one Apple pointed to its cloud services as an important revenue stream in its latest earnings release I was glad to see Apple put that in front of investors However theres one huge gap in Apples cloud services picture and thats enterprise cloud services The closest that Apple comes to this is some cloud services that Apple offers iOS developers in the form of APIs called CloudKit CloudKit allows developers to build cloudbased databases which would reside in Apples cloud servers Cloudkit apps have the ability to access these data bases Its a useful capability but its a small subset of the types of enterprise cloud services being offered by the major providers such as Microsoft Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Alphabet Ultimately all cloud services revolve around server side programming in various forms Think of this as apps that run on the cloud server rather than the users device Typically these cloud side apps interact with the users device through a browser or special purpose app These cloud side apps power everything from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to Google search Apple probably could never hope to compete with the big cloud providers but it could provide server side programming to its sizable developer base who would undoubtedly find useful ways to incorporate this capability into their apps Ultimately this would make iOS apps more useful by allowing developers to offload more tasks to cloudbased computation If Apple enabled developers to build apps that would run as a service on Apple cloud servers it would create a recurring revenue stream for Apple based on enterprise developer customers And Apple could even get some more mileage out of Swift by using it as the basis for the server side programming language Im not overly concerned about Peak iPhone but I acknowledge that the day will come and Apple needs to be ready for it Beyond diversifying its hardware product line Apple needs to diversify its revenue sources Im convinced that enterprise cloud services of the type I describe above are a huge opportunity for Apple Apple has tremendous infrastructure and expertise that it can bring to bear on the cloud services problem Apple just needs to put that capability at the service of developers so that they can develop serverside programs to augment their client side apps Many of Apples existing cloud services such as iCloud drive and Siri already play that role of augmenting apps at the device level Providing developers with a way to create serverside apps and services that go beyond what Apple provides would be a boon to Apples developers and to Apple itself I think the opportunity is so large that Apple is probably already moving in that direction The introduction of CloudKit was just laying the groundwork for the future The bottom line is that Apple still has many potential revenue streams left to exploit in the cloud services area I remain long Apple and consider it a buy for those with a longterm several year
