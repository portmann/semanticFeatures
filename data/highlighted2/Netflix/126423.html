class='textDiv'>Any Room In Big Tech For A GARP Investor Seeking Alpha Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Google and Amazon are building highgrowth widemoat businesses with strong network effects At the same time none of these businesses are focused on immediately returning cash to shareholders All are richly valued If you invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Facebook NASDAQ FB or Google NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG over the past years youve done very well for yourself Below you can see what those stocks have done in the last decade Facebook is above its IPO price from mid The question is have these highgrowth stocks appreciated to the point that theres little upside left For investors like me that are looking for Growth At a Reasonable Price GARP the growth is there but is the price reasonable This article will examine that question Whats remarkable about these performances isnt just the incredible growth and volatility but that all four of these companies have very little commitment to returning cash directly to shareholders None of them have ever paid a dividend nor do they consistently buy back shares <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a debtequity ratio of and negative tangible equity that has gotten consistently more negative over the past five years Amazon has reported losses in five of the last quarters Facebook will always limit the obnoxiousness and thus revenue potential of its ads although it may be able to better monetize the newsfeed It also may not be doing as well with current teens Google Glass flopped and some of its other RD projects may be of dubious investment value But at the same time all of these companies run highgrowth widemoat businesses that are flatout exciting Whats interesting is that the share price reflects the latter reality not the former We can see with Stock Rover that the pricing for most of these stocks looks pretty rich compared to the SP average and their respective industries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon have incalculable PEs since theyre outspending their revenue stream and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has negative cash flow as well Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also have book values far out of line with the SP or even the other companies on the list However not all pricing is as rich as others Google and Facebook are in line for relatively normal PEs and Googles book and cash flow valuations look like a reasonable premium for a highgrowth company Amazons sales valuation is also in a pretty normal range When we look at the industry deciles for these companies we see a similar story All rank well in growth but poorly in pricesales a lower decile number is better Here we see pretty well crystallized an inverse relationship between growth and valuations for earnings book sales and cash flow Looking at the charts below we can see that Googles valuations have come down over the last years in a way that isnt true for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon Netflixs PriceSales is back to where it was before the Qwikster fiasco of when the company tried to spin off its DVDsbymail business and subscribers ran for the exits Although its hard to see in the graph Amazons PS of is also on the higher side of its historical range Looking at PriceBook tells a similar story Google was on the lower end of its respective ranges until shares spiked recently The cause Google showed discipline with expenses and beat earnings estimates Thats especially relevant because I think the reason Googles multiples came down over the past few years was investor cynicism about its fiscal priorities While most of what Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spend goes directly to furthering their businesses more warehouses or another season of House of Cards many investors felt Google was spending on side projects unrelated to its core search business As awesome as that search business is I think the market felt that Googles freespending ways warranted a lower valuation Googles recent fiscal discipline has hinted it is becoming a different kind of company than the rest more like an Apple NASDAQ AAPL than a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Investors seem pleased about that In a way these kinds of stocks are unhinged from reality Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>really times more valuable than it was years ago Has it really become more valuable every year for ten years Thats an average growth rate of every quarter or every month for years When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>executed a stock split last week the companys stock was up the same day possibly because investors could now buy a stock instead of a stock even though the new shares are th as valuable as they had been <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has to pop I would never short it but the bubble has to pop But in another way these companies possess many of the aspects that GARP and value investors often look for widemoat business loyal customers network effects and high growth No one will ever replace Google search Amazon online retail or Facebook much as no one will ever build another North American railroad Yet the pricing is far out of line with what most value investors or even growth investors would normally pay I consider owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or Amazon primarily a momentum trade while Google and Facebook are better seen as growth investments Amazon has been taking the long view on reinvesting in its business for years It could keep spending on more warehouses and drones forever and never get around to directly returning cash to shareholders Amazon Web Services could be a great business but I dont know how large a portion of Amazons revenue it could ever become <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could continue ramping up its content creation budget but may not be able to replicate the extraordinary string of hits it has had so far These companies might continue to prioritize those investments over putting cash directly in shareholders pockets for the foreseeable future I wonder if investors will someday take the same cynical approach with these companies theyve had with Google and drop their valuations As for me Id rather own Google or Facebook companies that are moving towards a more realistic earnings valuation Those businesses are similarly irreplaceable but with less room to come down if investors become bearish the way they
