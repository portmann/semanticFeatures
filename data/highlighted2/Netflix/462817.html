NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>failed to meet quarterly expectations and stock dropped in afterhours trading Many customers are unwilling to pay more international growth is a bit slower than expected and content costs are rising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should be viewed as less of a tech company where PE ratios and other financial indicators are not as closely scrutinized and more as a media company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX shares were down more than percent in after hours trading following news that the company missed its addedsubscriber goals for the second quarter reeling in only net US subscribers vs guidance of and million international subscribers vs guidance of million Given how steep the drop was and the general investor love for NFLX it wouldnt be a surprise to see the stock bottom out quickly today and then rebound Still while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may not bloody the water too much today a serious problem in the companys business model is making itself apparent subscribers dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is worth much more than what it is currently charging Increased customer churn following the end of Netflixs two year grandfathering clause which protected a large portion of Netflixs customers from price increases suggests that many customers are unwilling to pay extra for the service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>provides A survey by UBS found that of subscribers would be unwilling to pay more for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>While these surveys are often exaggerated in the sense that customers underestimate how much more they are willing to pay the recent increase in churn for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shows that a larger portion of customers than previously thought may really not be willing to accept a price increase UBS thought that roughly to of customers would drop the streaming service and that total US net additions would come in at Obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>didnt meet their expectations Over the past few years investors have shown a willingness to stomach triple digit PE ratios treating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>like a tech startup and disregarding shortterm earnings Problem is the best days for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may not be ahead of it but instead behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a mature company and is going to face a lot of headwinds in the future as content grows more expensive and competition increases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>isnt the only tech company given leeway when it comes to earnings Amazon NASDAQ AMZN also suffers from similarly high earnings Unlike Amazon however <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will likely never be able to achieve a near monopoly on the streaming market AMZN enjoys high barriers of entry making it extremely difficult for competitors to achieve the size of scale and market penetration that Amazon has Point is it would be far easier to set up an online streaming service than to launch a fullscale online retailer with two day shipping and low prices Still NFLXs earnings of cents a share vs expectations of cents is welcomed news Further while the company failed to meet expectations in added new international subscribers revenue and subscriber growth abroad still looks impressive even if a correction was due Regardless NFLX remains overvalued in my opinion and the company needs to be considered by investors not as a tech stock but instead as a media company where high PE rations and nonexistent profits are not so easily overlook In its letter to shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>did note the increase in competition but that said competition did not contribute materially to their Q miss In my opinion people are beginning to recognize that there are numerous alternatives to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and that the company may not be worth its current price let alone increasing prices With Content Costs Rising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is Facing a Squeeze <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will spend about billion on content this year far more than most of its competitors While the company is proving that its willing to spend and spend big such high costs will make it difficult to produce substantial profits any time soon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is now faced with a serious challenge Studios want more money for their content and many are now streaming their content through their own services or with deals with Amazon and other competitors Adding highquality content from other studios is simply growing more expensive Producing inhouse content will become more necessary for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but such content can be expensive to produce The upcoming The Crown series about Queen Elizabeth will cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>at least million over six seasons ten episodes a piece Orange is the New Black costs million per episode while House of Cards costs million Sense meanwhile costs an astounding million per episode making it the most expensive show on earth In order to maintain and increase growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will likely have to rely on new inhouse content The company already has acknowledged that this is the future in original content but as the above numbers illustrate producing said content is expensive and if the company misses and pays a lot of money for content that subscribers dont enjoy the losses can pile up quickly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does have a bright future as a content and media company However the US market appears to be nearing full saturation while international growth may come with its own headwinds like the need to add localized content In my opinion for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to become a more attractive buy its PE ratios need to come in line with media companies like TimeWarner NYSE TWX at the very least Disclosure Iwe have
