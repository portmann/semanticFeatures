estimates of future revenues expenses and earnings as well as possible outcomes in timing of contract negotiations litigation business strategies deployment plans and product plans These forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially from todays forwardlooking statements Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forwardlooking statements are described in Rovis Form Q for the quarter ended June and other SEC reports and filings made from time to time And we encourage you to review the discussion of these factors in those reports and files All statements are made as of today July based upon information available to us as of today And except as required by law we see no

with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States And investors and potential investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of nonGAAP financial measures included in our earnings release The most directly comparable GAAP information and reconciliation between nonGAAP and GAAP figures are included in the Q earnings press release which has been furnished to the SEC on Form K and is available on the investor relations section of Rovis web page at wwwrovicorpcom The live webcast of this conference call is available in the Investor Relations section of Rovis webpage and a replay of the audio webcast will be available on the website shortly after this webcast ends and will remain on the website until our next quarterly earnings call Thank you Peter Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining our Q earnings call Ill start with some context on our second quarter and then Ill briefly cover our revised financial expectations for the rest of the year Tom will then discuss our ongoing progress for the upcoming major license renewals and actions we are taking to drive revenue growth in the second half of Finally Samir Armaly our EVP of Intellectual Property and Licensing will join us to address the recent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>ruling and speak further to the opportunity the upcoming major license deals represent First a few notes on some of the agreements we signed during the quarter As a reminder we signed an important agreement with Charter in Q which we believe fairly values our IP portfolio in todays payTV marketplace Since we announced this renewal Charter has announced its acquiring Time Warner Cable and Bright House Communications If those deals are completed Charter will become the secondlargest cable operator in the United States For Rovi these acquisitions if completed will eliminate the need for a separate renewal of the acquired companies and raise our North American ARPU consistent with the general guidance we have provided regarding the increased licensing fees we are seeking in connection with the pending renewals Additionally weve renewed our IP licensing agreements with leading consumer electronics manufacturers VIZIO and Funai and added SK Broadband one of Koreas main IPTV providers to our list of leading companies worldwide that have recognized the relevance and value of Rovis intellectual property Tom will speak about our product business later in the call Turning to our Q results We are disappointed with our second quarter results While revenues were just slightly below consensus expectation they were disappointing to us as we went into the quarter expecting to beat the consensus numbers That said we can either focus on actively managing our cost and as such our EPS was in line with expectations despite the softness in revenues Tom will speak to the reasons our results were disappointing including management distractions with a proxy contest this past quarter and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>litigation as well as our expectation as a result of our sales reorganization Second quarter revenues were down from the same quarter one year ago Specifically Q revenues of million were down million or when compared to the second quarter of For the second quarter of service provider revenues of million were down when compared to million in the second quarter one year ago This was primarily due to delays in closing new business this year and the comparable period one year ago including onetime revenues from the acceptance of Passport for deployment at Amrica Mvil Consumer electronics revenues were million down million from Q primarily due to prior year catchup payments in conjunction with an expansion of our Samsung license and bringing TP Vision back under license Other revenues of million were down as expected as the decline of revenues from our analog products continues Yearonyear other revenues were down million In terms of our business segment IP licensing revenues of million were down million yearoveryear As mentioned IP revenue from CE manufacturers benefited from catchup payment in the prior year This was partially offset by an increase in the service provider subscribers under license On the product side Revenues of million were down versus million in the second quarter of primarily due to the hard compare for onetime acceptance revenues associated with deploying Passport to Amrica Mvil last year Looking at our product revenues by sales verticals Service provider product revenues were down and CE product revenues were down Other product revenues primarily analog products were down Turning to cost We continue to focus on keeping our cost structure prudent For Q nonGAAP total COGS and operating expenses including depreciation were million down when compared to million in Q Operating expenses fell in Q due to lower spending on legacy products which was partially offset by additional spending on Fan TV and analytics We will continue to focus on managing our cost wisely while investing for longterm growth As shown in our GAAP to nonGAAP reconciliation in our earnings release our nonGAAP total COGS and operating expenses exclude million in cost related to our contested proxy solicitation In Q we generated million in cash flow from operation We used million in association with our first half share buyback including shares repurchased at the end of Q but settled in Q And we used million to pay down debt mostly our Term Loan A as we strengthened our balance sheet in advance of our bigfour service provider renewal After taking into account these outflows our cash and investments at the end of June were approximately million We believe our restructured debt and reinforced balance sheet provide us with critical flexibility and financial strength particularly in advance of the bigfour license renewals As of June we had approximately million remaining under our share repurchase authorization against which the company intends to repurchase an additional million of the companys shares in the third quarter of Turning to our full year expectation As you may have already seen Rovi now anticipates fiscal year revenue of million to million and fiscal nonGAAP diluted income per share of to The low end of this range assumes there is no new or onetime revenue in the second half either from new licensing deals or product deployment While we believe this is unlikely we want to make sure we are transparent as to our perception of the lowest range of possible outcomes The midpoint of this range assumes approximately the same level of new or onetime revenues in the second half the year as the company achieved in the first half of As a reference point in the first half of Rovi recognized approximately million in new and onetime revenue I think its important to note that while the high end of our current revenue estimates is below the bottom of our previous revenue range the high end of our nonGAAP diluted income per share estimate of now exceeds the previous bottom end of previous estimates by a full nickel This reflects our ongoing cost efforts We have also tightened our estimate range for nonGAAP diluted income per share to show our intention to keep our cost structure in line with our operations As Tom will explain shortly Rovis internal plan is focused on overachieving the high end of this range That said given the time it can take to close IP licensing deals and the uncertainty regarding the timing of negotiations and deployment of new products by customers the company wants to be transparent and conservative in the range of estimates it provides In that regard I think its important to note that we continue to be committed to closing deals on appropriate terms for Rovi and do not intend to accept bad deals Now over to Tom to adjust our ongoing progress for the upcoming major license renewals and those actions we are taking to drive revenue growth in the second half of the year Tom Thanks Peter And thanks to everyone joining us on the call today As Peter said I am going to talk briefly about the quarter and what steps we are taking as we focus on meeting our targets in the back half And then Samir will talk about the recent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>ruling and how it fits into our view and expectations for our broader IP business Importantly although we have to address the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>ruling in our ongoing negotiation discussion we do not expect it to materially impact the ultimate results of our ongoing bigfour negotiations We renewed Charter in April and the ATTDirecTV merger closed last week With this deal closed we can now engage directly with the combined entity Turning to the quarter Peter already mentioned some of the IP licensing agreements we signed during the quarter I will cover some of the progress we made on the product side this past quarter On the discovery front we have several key proof points of customer traction and product momentum As previously announced DISH licensed Rovis search and conversation services allowing for voice recognition inputs Verizon the largest US wireless communication service provider also licensed Rovis advanced search technology Our cloud services releases continue with additional APIs that include video discovery remote management search and recommendation and metadata distribution further bolstering our cloud services offering Earlier this month Comcast Wholesale announced their HITS service now supports Rovis DTA Guide for its customers Additionally we are in advance discussions with several service providers for our Fan TV solution Internationally JCOM Japans largest cable television operator will deploy new features for GGuide which enhance the discovery experience by adding among other features videoondemand catchup TV and enhance search capabilities On the metadata front We made Rovi Knowledge Graph available to North American customers to enhance their search capabilities with popularity local and training data and semantic and contextual links We also released an enhanced Rovi Popularity Package in North America offering crowd source rating trending content and alltime popularity for people and programs Rovi also announced availability of bound and unbound data in the Philippines bringing the total countries supported by Rovi to And regarding analytics our multiple commercial deployment and trials of our ad optimizer and promotion optimizer solution continue with service providers and major broadcast and network families Overall we continue to advance the bigfour license renewal negotiation and made progress building out the capabilities of our nextgen products while also announcing a number of new agreements during the first half of the year including advanced search and recommendation licenses with two major service providers That said we experienced slowness in the sales cycle during the second quarter due to a few factors and are working aggressively to meet our plan for the back half of the year We were impacted by the proxy contest which took up a fair amount of the executive managements time and attention We are glad to have that behind us and well be intensely focused on sales execution during the back half of the year We also saw some overhang from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>proceeding As we had said before and as Samir will discuss in more detail we dont believe the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>case will have a material impact on our ability to license our IP or the value we get for our IP especially with our traditional customers That said it appears to be elongating the sales cycle as some licensees require more education around what is happening and why developments in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>litigation are ultimately not relevant to their need for a license to Rovis IP It is also important to note as Peter did earlier that we are committed to doing the right deals for Rovi and its stockholders even if that means closing the deal takes longer Finally we reorganized our sales team As I mentioned before weve brought some great new talent into Rovi including Dave Longacre as Chief Revenue Officer who joined late in the first quarter We are actively building up the sales organization under Dave We expect to benefit from these leadership and personnel changes and expect sales to accelerate in the second half as the reorganization of the sales teams takes hold in a meaningful way As such and as Peter mentioned we are revising our estimates for the year That said we remain extremely focused internally on meeting our prior revenue target for the year We are all well aware that there is a lot of ground to cover on that front but we expect the changes we have made to the sales structure along with a more direct sales engagement from senior management including myself Samir and John Burke will contribute to a better performance in the second half of With that Ill hand it over to Samir to discuss <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and our IP licensing opportunities in a bit more detail Thanks Tom The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decision was a real disappointment We respectfully disagree with the court And after carefully reviewing the decision we believe we have strong grounds for appeal which well be filing shortly We remain committed to continuing to enforce our intellectual property against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>until the necessary licenses are in place This will include new litigation as appropriate that takes into account the current patent landscape including Alice More importantly while the recent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decision will need to be addressed in our upcoming licensing discussions we do not expect it to materially impact either our ability to license our patents or the rates we license at especially in areas where we have had traditional licensing success This includes our ongoing bigfour negotiations To better understand this we believe its important to put the initial <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decision into appropriate context The overwhelming majority of Rovis license agreements are concluded without litigation or the threat of litigation That said during Rovis plus years of licensing its intellectual property there have been times when we needed to litigate There have also been some litigation disappointments during that time In fact an initial loss in litigation proceeded are signing of the original agreements with the bigfour payTV operators that are expiring later this year and next While we were ultimately successful on appeal its worth noting that the current agreements with the bigfour were completed before that appeal was concluded We believe this example helps illustrate the broader context in which any ongoing litigation of individual Rovi patents should be evaluated Keeping in mind that broader context many have asked us what does or doesnt the initial <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decision mean for Rovis bigfour renewal discussion The quick answer is while it will be covered in our commercial discussions we dont believe it will materially change our ability to successfully renew these important agreements In large part this is because the initial <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decision is not representative of the broader bigfour renewal opportunity First the initial <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decision involves only five patents Rovis US patent portfolio includes more than issued patents and pending applications As we have indicated previously we are not reliant on one or a select few patents Moreover our patent portfolio continues to grow We continue to get newly issued patents on a regular basis patents that are being issued by the United States Patent Office under the newer Alice test We have not seen any reduction in the rate or quality of newly issued patents to Rovi since these new tests were implemented Second its important to remember that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>service that is at issue in the current litigation is an ondemand only service The services being offered by payTV operators provide far greater functionality beyond ondemand content including the likes of live TV and recorded content And as such they are important components of our ongoing renewal discussions with the bigfour payTV operators that are simply not relevant to OTT services like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Third while today Rovi has products services and solutions for the OTT market thats a relatively newer part of our overall offering In contrast Rovi has long been recognized as a leading provider to the traditional payTV market For over years we have been developing innovative products services and solutions for the payTV market The core of Rovis intellectual property portfolio has come from development efforts like that These are innovations of developers and engineers throughout the company solving realworld problems by providing new features and functionality into realworld products The resulting intellectual property from these innovations is inherently more technical in nature which makes it better suited to prevail in todays current patent landscape Finally all the patents that issue in the initial <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decision were selected and put into litigation preAlice The patent landscape is always changing And one of the benefits of Rovis extensive and continually growing patent portfolio is that we are wellpositioned to adapt to those changes We have successfully done so in the past and we are confident that we are able to successfully do so in the future Alice is still a relatively new law and we expect the implementation of Alice to evolve as more cases are heard and appeals are decided If history is any guide we would expect the landscape to moderate from here Frankly we see our appeal of the initial <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decision as part of that process As we move forward in any future IP licensing discussion or with potential litigation we now have the benefit and opportunity to factor into our patent selection the current frameworks of Alice While this might result in a different selection of patents from our portfolio than would have been the case preAlice given the depth breadth and coverage of our extensive portfolio we do not believe it results in a different outcome Specifically concluding agreements to license the relevant Rovi patents on commercially acceptable terms Against this broader context hopefully its clear while we continue to expect to successfully renew our bigfour license agreements Please keep in mind though successfully renewing these agreements may take time and we believe its in our stockholders best interest to sign the right agreement not just any agreement That said we believe we are wellpositioned to do so in our multiyear investment in and preparation for this unique opportunity will pay significant returns in the long term Tom Thanks Samir In summary while disappointed with the soft Q and the need to reset our full year expectations I am still very optimistic about both our product and intellectual property business opportunities I also strongly believe that the threepronged strategy to grow the company in intellectual property discovery and monetization is still the right one for Rovi Rovi is fully focused on our second half goals including achieving our sales and profit objectives managing our costs continuing to progress with our bigfour renewal negotiation securing meaningful design wins and deployments for our products and managing our ongoing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>litigation Youre still talking about the bigfour renewals but I think with your agreement with Charter there probably isnt a renewal agreement or a renewal negotiation with Time Warner Cable So should we be thinking about that as the bigthree now And does your guidance assume that Time Warner Cable goes out of license in the fourth quarter So it is safe to say once the Charter deal closes Time Warner and Bright House as we mentioned on the call will be covered by Time Warner As we mentioned on the last call we may well in fact go forward with a shortterm extension for Time Warner to cover us for the rest of the year And with AT and DirecTV is there any similar type of impact where DirecTV might fall under your agreement with ATT No Basically what we have to do is renegotiate the agreement to cover basically the new legal entity And look were happy that the deal between DirecTV and ATT is now done because it gives us an opportunity now to deal directly with one entity And thats effectively what were doing at this point And Tom you talked about some of the licensees requiring additional education or post the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>ruling So are you getting feedback from the potential renewals that they view that as something that would impact their willingness to engage with you No I dont think we look at it that way I think certainly the whole question of the Netflixs case and Alice has put a cloud over patent licensing But I think Samir did a great job in his prepared remarks to hit a couple of key points about what is different in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>case versus what were trying to do in the bigfour which is really our sweet spot in terms of the intellectual property we have So the use case in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>versus the use case in traditional cable operators is much deeper It includes overthetop it includes DVR functionality remote core channel listings so many different things And as weve said before on a lot of these calls were going into these negotiations We had a significant number of patents to that we showed to each of our bigfour licensees And its meaningful numbers and certainly there is additional patent behind that So while it is certainly something that comes up in the conversation we dont expect it really to have a meaningful impact on the Big And certainly a question is coming up from other licensees that we have to answer and explain But once we get through that we think well get back on a normal course and speed Tim and Samir can expand upon this One thing to keep in mind is weve been in conversations with the bigfour for an extended period of time The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>case has been out there for a while Theres been a lot of publicity around it So weve had these conversations already about why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Alice isnt relevant to them That said as Tom points out theres other licensing conversations we are underway that havent nearly had as long a term of engagement And thats where you will really see the impact And just one last question if I may And Samir I dont know if you can talk too much about how youre approaching the appeal but I think that the decision especially around the patent seemed to be a fairly aggressive extension of the abstract idea Alice process But is there a specific patent that you would be hoping to appeal or is there some other grounds that you see for appeal Were still obviously havent yet filed our appeal but are close to finalizing that step We have a few more days here before the timeline is due As we have said previously the Alice test is a patentspecific test so certainly were evaluating the initial decision with respect to how we look at each of the individual patents And it wouldnt be a surprise if we elect to appeal on fewer than all of the five patents Theres a different assessment for each one of them but as you suggest some of those patents we felt a little more surprised that how the initial decision came out than others So I realize that this patent environment is kind of in flux after Alice But what I would like to sort of address is while the courts sort of fixate and find a standard for what is conceptual and what is methodological can you sort of address in terms of your portfolio this whole idea that in the service provider environment you have a better and stronger position than you might have in an overthetop environment or in the linear environment versus the ondemand environment And how does that come to terms with the idea that these are longterm arrangements and these service providers are very much changing the way that they distribute content That its actually morphing into an infrastructure that may look a little more like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in the future As we said a little bit in the prepared remarks one of the things that we suggested provides Rovi with strength in its licensing program is the more features and functions that are available in an offering usually the more individual patents that that service kind of touches And so if you take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as we said as an ondemandonly service there is certainly a lot of functionality in that offering But its all ondemand content You dont have anything associated with live TV you dont have anything associated with recorded content whether thats locally recorded or stored somewhere in the cloud And so as the traditional payTV offerings continue to morph they might be moving to an IP infrastructure but they are still continuing to offer all of those things that they had offered in their traditional infrastructure So the basis for the types of patent discussions the segments of the portfolio that we have that are relevant to the traditional payTV operators is always going to be different than something thats a pure OTT ondemand service And with respect to why we think our patents are better suited in that space as we said if you think about Rovis history we have a longstanding history of providing innovative products and solutions to the traditional payTV marketplace Products like our iGuide product like Passport like the metadata weve provided there for a long time and increasingly now things like search and recommendation and others functionality We also have offerings for the overthetop service but those are newer offerings for us And so when you look at the type of innovation thats gone on at Rovi for the last plus years the core of that innovation started in products services and solutions for the payTV environment And as a result the intellectual property thats come out of that development is inherently more technical in nature So in the kind of postAlice world where youre looking for whats abstract and whats more technical implementation we feel like the portfolio in our traditional payTV environment is bettersuited for that type of an analysis Not that the stuff that we have in OTT wont survive but obviously weve got more coverage for payTV the nature of innovation there is a little bit different and those are some of the reasons And if I could kind of followup on that How much of that is related to infrastructure which Rovi has been able to prevail on before which also Rovi might have provided as Gemstar thats embedded in these networks as kind of legacy settop boxes legacy guides Do you feel your position in terms of the technology that these companies are developing going forward is as strong as the position that it was historically And is there a scenario many people were looking at the DISHTiVo litigation and thought DISHs strategy was in many ways to hold TiVo off long enough that they could just cycle out of the technology so that they could avoid making a costbenefit analysis on an injunction So how can you help us get comfortable with the idea that this is not just related to legacy technology and in fact technology thats going forward and tied to a current product portfolio that you may have which may not be specifically devoid with these in terms of your products but similar products So yes certainly its not tied to legacy infrastructure Certainly its something that we believe continues to be relevant going forward And just some examples of that that we could site so for example while clearly there is a large installed base of settop boxes today as the device on which Im getting my live TV or as Tom mentioned the device that Im setting my remote recording on maybe thats a remote recording to my local DVR maybe its a remote recording in the future to a DVR in the cloud space All of thats still is built on fundamental Rovi intellectual property So the underlying infrastructure might change It might move from a traditional cable plant to an IP network from a settop box to a different type of device but the core functionality we have around those types of services is really platform and technology agnostic in that way So weve been able to adapt When we first started doing the licensing that we had things like DVR wasnt out there things like videoondemand werent out there from our payTV provider customers at least in significant numbers things like second screen and multiscreen experiences werent out there But as the industry evolved as more features and functions were offered by our customers you can see that not only did our licensing continue but in many cases like the second screen experience our licensing program expanded to cover those new use cases And lastly here do you feel that there is a closer tie to a certain mode of distribution either cable or satellite or telco Or do you feel that its applicable across all sorts of all means of distributions in terms of modality Applicable across all and you can look at our list of licensees We have the largest cable providers We have the largest directtohome satellite providers We have the largest IPTV providers So we feel pretty well situated irrespective of the modal of communication there to be in a good position Is there any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or other new OTT revenue previously factored into the secondhalf guidance And is that part of the reduction in fullyear revenue guidance Or is it really just a function of less traction in some of the deals that you were working on because you were distracted by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and the proxy situation There is no new OTT guidance or no new OTT deals that we are including in our estimates What this really comes down to is a combination as you mentioned Weve stumbled a bit Were focused in the first half of the year But also keep in mind as we talked about in our guidance at the beginning of the year some of our licensing revenue is IP deals that we are working on offshore Samir and Tom can speak to it whats going on there in a little more detail But some of the deals that we had begun conversations with last year and anticipated pulling across have become more complicated as theyve gone from twoparty discussions to threeparty discussions as some service providers have pulled in some box manufacturers are under indemnification clauses Were going to get those deals done but having three parties instead of two is much more complex Tom I think its really an important point right I want to make sure everyone is clear on Weve adjusted our guidance after we went through a pretty thorough review with our sales team over a couple of days And its not because there arent enough deals out there there is certainly enough to get to where we want to get to And frankly the way Im driving the businesses I want to get to our original budget which was above the high end of guidance from the original guidance I think the thing we see to Peters point and it has a very valid point a number of the deals we are working on are big Its a licensing business and licensing has a tendency to be lumpy These are international deals with big players They get complicated when you add a thirdparty into it because of things like indemnification issues So I think the point I want to make sure everybody takes away its not that things are slipping away in terms of deals in pipeline The pipeline is certainly still there to get us to not only the high end of the current guidance but Im really pushing our organization to get back to our original plan So theres stuff out there but certainly they are more complicated And then you mentioned the combined Charter Time Warner Bright House ARPU would be similar to a typical range Does that suggest that the ARPU for the combined entity could be in the per sub per month range or I guess is that the typical range that youre referring to Mike I think my comment one is actually that once the deal is completed this will raise our North American ARPU consistent with the general guidance weve provided regarding increased licensing fees we are seeking in connection with the pending renewals Yes That said keep in mind in terms of our LASSO and the share impact youre talking about a quarter of the year benefit So I know that I have no idea what software patents are valid anymore So at the risk of sounding blunt why does confidence around applicability matter when it seems like validity is the big question these days And does anybody really know what the bar for validity is So I think when we talk about it we dont talk just about applicability We talk about applicability of valid patents So were not trying to parse the two So if there were something in our previous statements that didnt get that across certainly hopefully thats understood now We would suggest that the new Alice test has not created a lot of certainty in terms of how people should evaluate these types of patents but a couple of things are important to note Number one not all of our patents are pure software patents Second once we know what the test is under Alice we are in a much better position to select the right types of patents from our portfolio that we think are better able to withstand that test As we mentioned for better or worse the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decision and our litigation started at some time ago and all of the patents that were selected for that litigation either by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or ourselves were selected before the Alice ruling came down And so we feel like were going to be in a much better position obviously being able to factor into our patent selection should future litigation become necessary The current tests and standards whether they are as clear as we would like or not we certainly will do our best to make sure that as we select patents We believe that even under a less clear statute of how those types of issues are going to be evaluated by the district courts or by the appellate courts were going to be in a better position And given the breadth and depth of our portfolio we think not only they remain applicable but they remain valid in that way I guess then just a followup to that is given that there is ongoing uncertainty though is that stuff going to clear itself up in the next six months or are we going to be talking about two years of litigation Not you specifically but just in general litigation before we know where the bars really are I think if you look at the historical trends as we said in our prepared remarks you usually see some moderation over a period of time So we do believe I mean we are in the licensing business for the long term so were going to continue to ensure that we go out and strike the right types of deals And just because there might be a little more uncertainty today we dont believe thats going to be where the status quo is going to shake out in the future And I think that you will look at sophisticated parties on the other side that understand the same thing So yes we will all have to work with a little more uncertainty in the short term but over time I think that will shake out And what weve seen in the past is as the patent landscape has changed Rovi because of the business it has because the portfolio it has has been able to evolve as that landscape changes And those changes in landscape havent materially changed our ability to continue to go out and strike new licensing deals As Tom and Peter mentioned maybe it requires a little more discussion in the process but the ultimate results for us we believe will be the same Thanks for taking my followup I have two or three questions But first on the product pipeline I think that you had originally hoped for a rampup in the back half I think your new guidance suggested a less pronounced ramp but you do have a lot of irons in the fire Where do you think that we might see the most traction on the product side in the second half As we have reported and talked about on previous calls we do have a lot of good traction going in several of our new product areas particularly and notably around advanced search and recommendations conversations search So some of the design wins that we have announced previously with folks like DISH and folks like Verizon are certainly going to be contributing in the second half of the year We have other notable design wins that we hope to be closing and announcing shortly that will also contribute in the second half Weve been getting some good traction in other parts of our discovery portfolio Notably the interest level around our Fan TV solution is high And look to be moving that forward and having that contribute And then certainly in the other pieces of the business as Tom and Peter had commented too in their opening remarks particularly in the area of metadata were seeing some real strong interest developing from a lot of web scale players and other channels that beyond the traditional service providers and consumer electronic players that weve been working with And the analytics platform continues to get really strong interest Weve got a number of trials and commercial deployments underway that are continuing to scale And as we had set expectations previously we see the scale and ramp of these new solutions starting to contribute meaningfully second half of this year rolling into next year And then on the buyback how do you I know you have plenty of cash on the balance sheet to weather any prolonged negotiations or even litigation that you might pursue with BigFour or others but how do you weigh the idea of preserving that liquidity versus showing confidence in your stock and buying it Clearly Tim we look at all three components of our capital allocation that weve talked about the past We continue to invest in some of our organic initiatives Weve also made some investments tuckin acquisitions to expedite particularly on some of the new product opportunities And we look at share buybacks Candidly given where our price is right now we dont have to spend that much to knock out a fair chunk of stock So million it seems to be measured buyback It allows us to hold significant liquidity on our balance sheet continue to look formidable in the face of the upcoming Tier negotiations but also hopefully demonstrate the belief we have that our shares are undervalued and we think its a good return to be deploying million at this point in time given that price To follow up on that I think Peter is exactly right Theres a balance here but as we step back and look at it and we had a conversation with our Board at these kind of levels we can take out a significant number of shares And we think its absolutely the right thing to do this We firmly believe that our stock is incredibly undervalued because of the things that are happening in the marketplace relative to the licensing business And we believe very strongly that licensing on a goforward basis is still going to be a very meaningful part of what we do as company And I certainly believe in the revenue growth thats out there So I think as we get through this challenge period right now and we do things like have a solid second half of the year and make progress on the BigFour renewals that we have the revenue and earnings for this company will be a lot better than what they are now And just a couple last questions but Tom if you could give us any insight into the b plan that youve started and what that entails and over what time frame and how much stock you might purchase And then you had mentioned the Board discussions you have a couple new Board members Is there any changes that might come about with a new Board And is there any consideration to splitting the company into a patent licensing business and a product business ala QUALCOMM So look on the b I put that in place a number of months ago As a company policy we have a program where all the senior executives do a b on a buyer of sales So I put in a buy and that was a standalone b that executed on the trade that you saw not that long ago Frankly I have another b put in place and Im going to buy more shares So its like our company buying shares I believe that our shares are undervalued and frankly Im going to take advantage of the opportunity for myself and buy some more Rovi shares On the Board question its a great question because I think there has been the proxy fight was a tough thing to go through for the company Besides distraction there was just a ton of time put into that effort And I think what did is it certainly with our employees and maybe even externally gave people a sense of maybe something big and different is going to happen in the company You roll forward to where we are now with the two new Board members that we have Raghu and Glenn Welling The reality is one Ive known those guys for number of years now so it wasnt my first introduction to them Ive had a good working relationship with both of them prior to actually becoming Board members Leading up to the official Board meeting that we had yesterday our normal quarterly Board meeting a lot of oneonone dialogue and interface with all the Board members just to try to make sure that there was a positive dialogue and working relationship And I think thats absolutely happened Even before this Board meeting on our normal quarterly Board meeting we had a couple of other Board meetings so everybody has already had a chance to work and interface And I characterized the meeting yesterday as very positive We went through all the main elements that we needed to talk about as a group Had a very good detailed dialogue and I think it was very constructive so I have no concerns at this point about how the Board is going to function As we look at so the committees we said that weve formulated all the committees down One of those committees is a strategy committee We already had one obviously We lost a couple of members due to the proxy contest so we have new folks on there Raghu Rau is going to be the chair of that committee and that was unanimous from all the Board members We did meet this week as part of our regularly scheduled Board meeting and had a separate strategy committee meeting And really the way I would characterize it is there is really no change in the plan of record at this point We are going forward with a plan that says we are a hybrid IP and product company Were going to focus on intellectual property Were going to focus on discovery Longer term we want to focus on analytics and monetization like were starting to do now Certainly I think the new Board members are going to have to get educated on the process of what we do from a strategy perspective here at the company We need to get them educated on the current plan of record and why were doing what were doing So I would look at it right now as plan of record is what were going forward with Company generally has at this time of year a normal review and this is nonBoard directed We go through a process where we take a look at the strategy we go back and reassess all the assumptions we try to do a longrange plan from a financial perspective look at investments look at markets et cetera and go through a validation process as to whether or not thats still the right thing to do or we need to make tweaks that kind of thing And basically what were going to do is have the Board subcommittee get involved in those meetings so they have an opportunity to get engaged a little bit more on the strategy and review where we are those kind of things So certainly the strategy subcommittee will look at strategy and get engaged with what were doing but there is absolutely no plans to do anything different other than the plan of record All right well listen I just want say thanks everybody for joining the call I know there is a lot of other calls going on now and its a pretty busy time Really the way I wanted to end it is just say look we are certainly disappointed with the soft Q and the reset Hopefully we were able to give a little more insight on that The main message I want to give to everybody is that we are still very very focused on our original plan and thats what we are working towards So I really still feel very confident in the strategy I still feel confident despite the reset in the second half the year and also with what were trying to do in the BigFour So hopefully we can get into a little bit more detail as we have some followup calls But again thanks for your time Appreciate it Thank you This does conclude todays conference call You may now disconnect Copyright policy All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking
