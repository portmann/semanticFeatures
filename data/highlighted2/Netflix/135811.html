And so we feel like we're going to be in a much better position, obviously being able to factor into our patent selection, should future litigation become necessary.The current tests and standards, whether they are as clear as we would like or not, we certainly will do our best to make sure that as we select patents.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We believe that even under a less clear statute of how those types of issues are going to be evaluated by the district courts or by the appellate courts, we're going to be in a better position. (Uncertainty) </span>And given the breadth and depth of our portfolio, we think not only they remain applicable, but they remain valid in that way.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I guess then just a follow-up to that is given that there is ongoing uncertainty though, is that stuff going to clear itself up in the next six months or are we going to be talking about two years of litigation? (Uncertainty) </span>Not you specifically, but just in general litigation before we know where the bars really are?I think if you look at the historical trends, as we said in our prepared remarks, you usually see some moderation over a period of time.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So we do believe, I mean we are in the licensing business for the long term, so we're going to continue to ensure that we go out and strike the right types of deals. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And just because there might be a little more uncertainty today, we don't believe that's going to be where the status quo is going to shake out in the future. (Uncertainty) </span>And I think that you will look at sophisticated parties on the other side that understand the same thing.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So yes, we will all have to work with a little more uncertainty in the short term, but over time, I think that will shake out. (Uncertainty) </span>And what we've seen in the past is as the patent landscape has changed, Rovi, because of the business it has, because the portfolio it has, has been able to evolve as that landscape changes.And those changes in landscape haven't materially changed our ability to continue to go out and strike new licensing deals.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As Tom and Peter mentioned, maybe it requires a little more discussion in the process, but the ultimate results for us, we believe, will be the same. (Uncertainty) </span>Thanks for taking my follow-up.I have two or three questions.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But first, on the product pipeline, I think that you had originally hoped for a ramp-up in the back half. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think your new guidance suggested a less pronounced ramp, but you do have a lot of irons in the fire. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Where do you think that we might see the most traction on the product side in the second half? (Uncertainty) </span>As we have reported and talked about on previous calls, we do have a lot of good traction going in several of our new product areas, particularly and notably around advanced search and recommendations conversations search.So some of the design wins that we have announced previously with folks like DISH and folks like Verizon are certainly going to be contributing in the second half of the year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We have other notable design wins that we hope to be closing and announcing shortly that will also contribute in the second half. (Uncertainty) </span>We've been getting some good traction in other parts of our discovery portfolio.Notably the interest level around our Fan TV solution is high.And look to be moving that forward and having that contribute.And then certainly in the other pieces of the business, as Tom and Peter had commented too in their opening remarks, particularly in the area of metadata, we're seeing some real strong interest developing from a lot of web scale players and other channels that -- beyond the traditional service providers and consumer electronic players that we've been working with.And the analytics platform continues to get really strong interest.We've got a number of trials and commercial deployments underway that are continuing to scale.And as we had set expectations previously, we see the scale and ramp of these new solutions starting to contribute meaningfully second half of this year rolling into next year.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And then on the buyback, how do you -- I know you have plenty of cash on the balance sheet to weather any prolonged negotiations or even litigation that you might pursue with Big-Four or others, but how do you weigh the idea of preserving that liquidity versus showing confidence in your stock and buying it? (Uncertainty) </span>Clearly, Tim, we look at all three components of our capital allocation that we've talked about the past.We continue to invest in some of our organic initiatives.We've also made some investments, tuck-in acquisitions to expedite, particularly on some of the new product opportunities.And we look at share buybacks.Candidly, given where our price is right now, we don't have to spend that much to knock out a fair chunk of stock.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So $50 million, it seems to be measured buyback. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It allows us to hold significant liquidity on our balance sheet, continue to look formidable in the face of the upcoming Tier 1 negotiations, but also hopefully demonstrate the belief we have that our shares are undervalued and we think it's a good return to be deploying $50 million at this point in time, given that price. (Uncertainty) </span>To follow up on that, I think Peter is exactly right.There's a balance here, but as we step back and look at it and we had a conversation with our Board at these kind of levels, we can take out a significant number of shares.And we think it's absolutely the right thing to do this.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We firmly believe that our stock is incredibly undervalued, because of the things that are happening in the marketplace relative to the licensing business. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And we believe very strongly that licensing on a go-forward basis is still going to be a very meaningful part of what we do as company. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And I certainly believe in the revenue growth that's out there. (Uncertainty) </span>So I think as we get through this challenge period right now and we do things like have a solid second half of the year and make progress on the Big-Four renewals that we have, the revenue and earnings for this company will be a lot better than what they are now.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And just a couple last questions, but Tom, if you could give us any insight into the 10b5-1 plan that you've started and what that entails and over what time frame and how much stock you might purchase? (Uncertainty) </span>And then you had mentioned the Board discussions, you have a couple new Board members.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Is there any changes that might come about with a new Board? (Uncertainty) </span>And is there any consideration to splitting the company into a patent licensing business and a product business ala QUALCOMM?So look, on the 10b5, I put that in place a number of months ago.As a company policy, we have a program where all the senior executives do a 10b5 on a buyer of sales.So I put in a buy and that was a standalone 10b5 that executed on the trade that you saw not that long ago.Frankly, I have another 10b5 put in place and I'm going to buy more shares.So it's like our company buying shares.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe that our shares are undervalued, and frankly I'm going to take advantage of the opportunity for myself and buy some more Rovi shares. (Uncertainty) </span>On the Board question, it's a great question, because I think there has been, the proxy fight was a tough thing to go through for the company.Besides distraction, there was just a ton of time put into that effort.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And I think what did is it, certainly with our employees and maybe even externally gave people a sense of maybe something big and different is going to happen in the company. (Uncertainty) </span>You roll forward to where we are now with the two new Board members that we have, Raghu and Glenn Welling.The reality is, one, I've known those guys for number of years now, so it wasn't my first introduction to them.I've had a good working relationship with both of them prior to actually becoming Board members.Leading up to the official Board meeting that we had yesterday, our normal quarterly Board meeting, a lot of one-on-one dialogue and interface with all the Board members, just to try to make sure that there was a positive dialogue and working relationship.And I think that's absolutely happened.Even before this Board meeting, on our normal quarterly Board meeting, we had a couple of other Board meetings, so everybody has already had a chance to work and interface.And I characterized the meeting yesterday as very positive.We went through all the main elements that we needed to talk about as a group.Had a very good, detailed dialogue, and I think it was very constructive, so I have no concerns at this point about how the Board is going to function.As we look at, so the committees we said that we've formulated all the committees down.One of those committees is a strategy committee.We already had one, obviously.We lost a couple of members due to the proxy contest, so we have new folks on there.Raghu Rau is going to be the chair of that committee and that was unanimous from all the Board members.We did meet this week as part of our regularly scheduled Board meeting and had a separate strategy committee meeting.And really, the way I would characterize it is there is really no change in the plan of record at this point.We are going forward with a plan that says we are a hybrid IP and product company.We're going to focus on intellectual property.We're going to focus on discovery.Longer term, we want to focus on analytics and monetization, like we're starting to do now.Certainly, I think the new Board members are going to have to get educated on the process of what we do from a strategy perspective here at the company.We need to get them educated on the current plan of record and why we're doing what we're doing.So I would look at it right now as plan of record is what we're going forward with.Company generally has at this time of year a normal review and this is non-Board directed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We go through a process where we take a look at the strategy, we go back and reassess all the assumptions, we try to do a long-range plan from a financial perspective, look at investments, look at markets, et cetera, and go through a validation process as to whether or not that's still the right thing to do or we need to make tweaks, that kind of thing. (Uncertainty) </span>And basically, what we're going to do is have the Board subcommittee get involved in those meetings, so they have an opportunity to get engaged a little bit more on the strategy and review where we are those kind of things.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So certainly, the strategy subcommittee will look at strategy and get engaged with what we're doing, but there is absolutely no plans to do anything different other than the plan of record. (Uncertainty) </span>All right, well, listen I just want say, thanks, everybody, for joining the call.I know there is a lot of other calls going on now and it's a pretty busy time.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Really the way I wanted to end it is just say look, we are certainly disappointed with the soft Q2 and the reset. (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Hopefully, we were able to give a little more insight on that. (Uncertainty) </span>The main message I want to give to everybody is that we are still very, very focused on our original plan and that's what we are working towards.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So I really still feel very confident in the strategy. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I still feel confident, despite the reset in the second half the year and also with what we're trying to do in the Big-Four. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So hopefully, we can get into a little bit more detail as we have some follow-up calls. (Uncertainty) </span>But again, thanks for your time.Appreciate it.Thank you.This does conclude today's conference call.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You may now disconnect.
