settings or contact your network administrator Verizon is pretty much over this whole FiOS thing They still support their existing networks of course but theyre pretty much done building out new ones That however does not sit well with the city of New York which is still waiting for Verizon to finish the citywide build they promised to have done by last year The citys Department of Information Technology and Communications DoITT this week announced the results of an audit they conducted of Verizons FiOS implementation and the news is not good In the telecom giant agreed to extend FiOS to any household that wanted it across all five boroughs by June But with that deadline nearly a year gone that goal is far from met even though Verizon announced it had met its obligation and completed its build in November of last year Through a thorough and comprehensive audit we have determined that Verizon substantially failed to meet its commitment to the people of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement Broadband is a key component of this Administrations fight to create opportunity and sustainable economic development in every corner of the five boroughs As Ive said time and again Verizon must deliver on its obligation to the City of New York and we will hold them accountable New Yorkers have been complaining for years that Verizon isnt getting FiOS to them and the data from the audit bears that out Among the major issues the citys auditors found Verizon has not actually run enough fiber to do what they say they do Callers are being told their address cannot and will not get FiOS service despite living within the agreedupon area ie one of the five boroughs Over requests for service were left outstanding and unmet Of those tens of thousands of requests had been left outstanding for over a year Verizon tracks complaints from subscribers but not from people who want to subscribe even though the agreement with the city requires them to do so The

some of the predictable delays like infrastructure challenges and the unpredictable ones like Hurricane Sandy that slowed down the build But after that it got a little hazy As progressed the report says and Verizons buildout approached percent DoITT began to receive anecdotal evidence largely in the form of consumer complaints suggesting that Verizon was simultaneously taking credit for passing households and declining to accept orders for nonstandard service installations from those households In November Verizon told the city they had passed all residential households in the city meaning they could and would be obligated to accept orders for service from all residential buildings in the city But complaints kept mounting to the point where the city developed concerns that these anecdotes did not reflect occasional irregularities but possibly broader failures by Verizon to fulfill the obligations it undertook in the franchise agreement However even the audit took longer than it needed to the report says due to Verizons persistent intransigence and delay following Verizons pattern in previous audits Verizon failed repeatedly to supply data that the citys auditors requested and denied them access to Verizon systems the report claims In their response report to the city Verizon claims that auditors present a distorted view of their performance ignoring the truly significant accomplishments Verizon has achieved so far The company as one would expect pushes back hard on the findings claiming that they have in fact met their goals and are perfectly cooperative Aside from its erroneous conclusions and procedural flaws Verizon writes the Reports lack of balance and its clear agenda is also disturbing Verizon seems to miss the point of an audit intended to delve into the truth of repeated customer complaints continuing One would expect a performance review to include an assessment of both the positives and the perceived negatives of Verizons performance In start contrast however the Report makes no positive findings despite the fact that Verizons submissions during the review provided DoITT with several opportunities to do so Many New York City officials found Verizons response and performance unsatisfactory We would have universal broadband in New York City if only Verizon had kept its promise to provide universal fiber to every home as was required by the franchise agreement Countless New Yorkers have tried to get fiber in their homes only to be told it was unavailable and I know because I am one of them said Council Member Ben Kallos Manhattan Borough President Gale A Brewer echoed the sentiment saying Verizon promised to provide a new option in a market with too little competition but for too many New Yorkers that promise has proved empty so far While there is no question that rolling out fiberoptic service in New York City is a massive undertaking Verizon must be open and honest about the availability of its services and must make good on its commitments Click to print Opens in new window Verizon Nearing End Of Plans To Build FiOS Network Cablevision Sues Verizon Claims Fastest WiFi Ads Are Misleading <span
