analysts keep touting farflung growth of countries of broadband users reside in countries excluding USA and China Sometimes the numbers make your eyes pop out An analyst from Oppenheimer recently estimated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX would command a market share worldwide of broadband connected devices and accordingly the price target was ramped up to This good news is of course following the cadre of similarly bullish statements that weve seen these past couple weeks I compiled a list of broadband users from Wikipedia so the source integrity can be taken for what it is Then on my open model on GoogleDocs I performed some handicraft to estimate overlap and provide a wildguess at total addressable devices From there I estimated market share gains from now until The goal is to try to really absorb from a business point of view what some of these analyst reports are basing their price targets on First China I dont believe any analyst that claims to have an estimate of million users without including China The only way to get to that figure is to assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>commands dominant market share in every country it enters and thats a long stretch in my opinion If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>succeeds in achieving such a worldwide market share and sustains it hats off and I should have been a leveraged long position China has a broadband connected base of more than million users according to my calculation And it should be noted my calculation is only intended for relative sizing and wildguessing so dont use any decimal points or presume too much specificity Excluding China the following countries matter Based on the above market sizes to reach the forecasts that were seeing these days which look something like this implies a growth pattern of something like the following Getting about share in China by Getting about share of tier countries by less in some countries like India where only is required Commanding share of targeted tier countries by they dont have to enter all the tier only about half of them so one can ignore Uzbekistan Sudan Ukraine and even Singapore Ive begun taking a subjective view of these countries and incorporated them into a countrywise forecast on GoogleDocs Still more art than science but worth looking at to structure your thinking and for generating scenarios to support growth assumptions The purpose of the forecast is to help illustrate the scope and scale of the required expansion no analyst will correctly forecast all these country targets Try to dig into the analyst forecasts to understand the growth thats being estimated to support the share price If this growth pattern is going to be sustained and remain significant like were seeing in the forecasts the following types of things must happen First and foremost success in China Japan The company can safely ignore certain large markets like Russia Egypt Nigeria and Saudi Arabia Continued growth in Western Europe and Tier countries with market penetration tending towards dominance penetration New market entry and success in Korea India Vietnam South Africa Hong Kong and similarly sized countries where broadband penetration exists One can safely ignore launch statements about countries like Portugal Singapore or Thailand they dont even move the dial as far as the assumptions are concerned Theres only a few countries that matter and the analysts are assuming that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NFLX will excel at ALL of the important markets In order to support a global expansion juggernaut the growth pattern implies that the offerings stay competitive relevant and unique enough to not only attract new viewers but also to maintain a loyal multiyear user all around the world It implies that growth continues in the face of competition and that legal and regulatory issues are satisfactorily addressed as and when they arise And thats just on the sales side The price targets were seeing also imply a continually improving contribution margin tamping down on growth of GA Tech and Marketing starting in about paying a good dividend starting in or buybacks and maintaining enough pizzazz to still sport a PE multiple of around in the year Source <span style='background-color:
