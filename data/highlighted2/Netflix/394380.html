</span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha The strong amount of recent negativity surrounding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>after the companys earnings report has provided a good opportunity for patient investors The companys best asset literally is growth in its content library which is primarily led by the addition of streaming content and increase in content obligations There is a correlation between content library growth revenue profitability and future free cash flow expectations this is fundamental to both short and long positions As Netflixs growth in original content continues to increase the potential for free cash flow will potentially become greater <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQ NFLX is one of the more broadly recognized FANA stocks including Facebook Inc NASDAQ FB Amazoncom Inc NASDAQ AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Alphabet Inc NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL FANA does not sound as dangerous or risky as FANG but we all have Google to blame for changing its name quite poorly I might add Investors love to pounce when a FANA stock has experienced less than expected results Facebook has arguably been the most successful of late from an earnings perspective as the company is rallying today in after hours and dominating the digital advertising market Contrastingly investors have been bombarded with negative articles on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>since the companys earnings report These critiques have stemmed from saturated domestic markets to slowing global growth to the amount of content obligations being unsustainable I am sure new comments today will add many more Netflixs stock price valuation has been the primary culprit as has been typical throughout the recent years But I would portend that many of these criticisms stem from a lack of focus on what drives Netflixs business and where the companys potential lies to become successful in the near and distant future based on these drivers As an example most investors would agree that Netflixs subscriber growth will be important to drive the business model but not all would agree that increasing content obligations from todays billion level is equally or even greater in importance I offer the viewpoint that increasing content obligations will be instrumental leading to further subscriber growth profitability and free cash flow This is based upon Netflixs transition into a media company which will drive increased changes in streaming content liabilities Additionally the correlations between Netflixs content library growth and the companys subscriber revenue and contribution margin growth and future profitability and free cash flow growth all will benefit This gets to the discussion revolving around Netflixs decision to heavily invest into its original content development The company does not break out its proportional spend between original content and leased content but has stated that the former will not be as costly over the longer term Additionally both are expected to grow but original content new releases have grown substantially for the lineup Based on this the most telling factor impacting Netflixs free cash flow is the companys additions to streaming content which accounted for over percent for all content additions There are two important takeaways here First original content requires more upfront cash which also creates a lag for expected profitability Second the percentage rate for both amortization of content whether leased or originally purchased and changes to streaming content liabilities will be the most crucial for driving future free cash flow The other important point is focusing on Netflixs growth in combined contribution margin This will allow for the company to increase its profit margin The obvious and most easily forecasted factors include Netflixs paid members and average revenue per paying member growth By combining these variables the time frame becomes a critical point where investors should expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to be generating substantial free cash flow approaching the billion level This is quite a contrast compared with todays trailing twelvemonth TTM negative billion in free cash flow generated But investors need to ask themselves whether they really think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is going to be spending billion today and billion or more by in streaming additions to continue losing over billion in free cash flow If they think so they may be missing the opportunity as the company is expecting its investments to generate substantial returns <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is in the early stages of developing the companys original content Earlystage successful shows have included House of Cards and Orange is the New Black and newer shows have garnered strong performance as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>measures all of the companys content based upon hours of viewing in determining the value for each show or movie This is an important component for renewing leased content andor continuing with original content As such investors should realize that Netflixs substantial portion of growth has been driven by the companys leased content and that original content is at a stage where its impact has been less of a driver and determining the value in supporting further growth is not well reflected This is not a guarantee for future growth but rather a distinction regarding Netflixs transition into original content Netflixs aspirations to become as successful as HBO are well documented but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is attempting to become the dominant Internet TV media company while acknowledging the many other media outlets the Internet has to offer The relationship between Netflixs content library and paid member growth is highly correlated Content is what will continue to drive new member additions as well as lead to retention of existing paying members through the midst of price increases over time This gets us back to Netflixs core metric of hours viewed for its shows and movies This metric is combined with the companys breadth of member activity information which iteratively improves the companys services and will undergo fundamental changes as original content development increases For example gaining further control of content by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will allow for opportunities to better immerse paid members into a personal andor customized experience The reason for considering these factors is to get buyin regarding the companys desire to grow its content library and corresponding content obligations If investors do not buyin at this point regarding how crucial it is for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to build original content through a library and obligations then there is no way to consider an investment in the company This is not a bad thing either if the business does not make sense Based on this one cannot evaluate Netflixs business by only assuming paid member growth rates leading to revenue contribution margins operating income and diluted EPS to truly value the company It is imperative to focus on what drives the companys member performance and free cash flow Accounting for content additions amortization and obligation changes will provide the best transparency for investors and similarly will be Netflixs focus on returning value to its shareholders Content Library And Content Obligations Are Connected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has witnessed substantial growth in its content library since Investors should realize that gross content assets are amortized to provide both current and noncurrent net content assets termed as content library net respectively on the balance sheet bs Source Company financials and personal database As the figure above displays Netflixs content library net has grown by an average of percent per year since to over billion currently This growth includes the first quarter of so the rate of growth should be expected to increase once the fiscal year closes Source Company filings and personal database The company has taken on content liabilities which represent current and noncurrent payments coming due for either original or leased content As the figure above illustrates the rate of content liabilities growth per year through has averaged percent per year to billion a growth rate slightly slower than content library net But as the figure above displays <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a significant amount of streaming content obligations which are not reflected on the bs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>explains these amounts as agreements that include an obligation to license rights for unknown future titles and that the ultimate quantity andor fees are not yet determinable The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS and other TV series license agreements are cited as examples The growth rate per year for streaming content obligations not reflected on the bs has grown at a slightly slower rate since at nearly percent to billion However since the growth in Netflixs content liabilities has grown nearly percent per year while the growth in streaming content liabilities not reflected on the bs has grown nearly percent per year This is a clear reflection of Netflixs increased spending to purchase and produce original content This also reflects a stronger correlation between content liabilities and library content net on the bs based on this divergence in growth Moving forward investors interested andor invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should hope to see a continued correlation Investors should understand that there are five general line items within the operating cash flow section for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which ultimately determine the companys free cash flow These include net income additions to streaming content library change in streaming content liabilities amortization of streaming content library and other The other category includes all other line items typical for media companies and has displayed consistent positive performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has been forgoing net income growth in order to grow the companys streaming business as such recent TTM net income was slightly above million The other line item generated an additional million in operating cash flow for a combined million when included with net income Source Company filings and personal database The figure above provides the three most relevant line items for operating cash flow as well as a merged line item streaming additionsamortization net Clearly the additions to streaming content library has been the primary contributor to Netflixs negative free cash flow of billion during the TTM period Acquisition of DVD content library reflected only million or less than percent of all content during Two of these three line items including additions to streaming content library and amortization of streaming content library or streaming additionsamortization net provide investors with a similar correlation to additions to streaming content library This amount reflects the changes for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on the bs as the company adds content and it is amortized Investors should also realize that amortization is also accounted for in the total cost of revenues During <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>witnessed a substantial increase in additions to streaming content library This increase significantly outpaced the increase in amortization But changes in streaming content liabilities increased at an even greater rate nearly doubling Original content costs require more upfront cash and is most likely the driver for the increase in streaming content liabilities With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>utilizing an accelerated amortization approach increased changes in content liabilities is a good thing as it will being <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>towards a more traditional media model where additions to content assets and changes for content liabilities are near parity To this point it is worth attempting to look at possibilities but more important is to understand what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to accomplish in order to generate free cash flow Investors should be expecting to see substantial free cash flow generated or else the investment thesis will fall apart As far as a catalyst goes for shorts I believe that the next year or two is going to provide a tipping point if original content cannot generate significant growth in free cash flow not much else will In order to construct an estimate for Netflixs free cash flow there are several steps to take The first one is the easiest determining Netflixs revenue by The next few steps involve determining Netflixs future contribution margin diluted EPS and free cash flow based upon the core identified operating cash flow line items above The recent article written by Seeking Alpha contributor Edward Hoofnagle Bring Out The Butter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Is Toast provides good assumptions based on some of this information The position in this article disclosed was short so I like using this as an example since I am long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I am managing the Lean LongTerm Growth Portfolio LLGP and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was added at around the same price it is at today back in February for a total return of nothing so far What investors will be able to compare between this information is that two investors with long and short positions have pretty close estimates for This will allow investors to focus on the key line items as time goes by and to make their own decisions as to what valuation they would consider owning the company if at all Source Company filings and personal database The key driver moving forward with a direct relationship to Netflixs revenue is paid member growth for both domestic and international streaming The DVD business segment will still be around during but its revenue contribution will be significantly less Through an annual growth rate at nearly percent per year was assumed which would translate to million domestic paid members By it has been assumed that an average monthly price per paid member of would occur which represents an increase of percent from the March amount Netflixs price increase throughout the year should provide growth towards and it is anticipated that another increase would occur by For international paid members an average annual growth rate of percent per year is assumed which would translate to million subscribers By it has been assumed that an average monthly price per paid member of would occur which represents an increase of percent from the March amount <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will similarly be increasing its current international prices globally Additional price increases should occur as markets mature but certain geographies will have much lower amounts For the DVD segment paid members are assumed to decline nearly percent to million by Average monthly prices per member are assumed to remain fairly constant with minimal declines to When combining these assumptions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>total revenue estimates for would be at billion Source Company financials and personal database all numbers are in thousands Revenue has been estimated as mentioned above and most other estimates getting to the bottomline have been made For example cost of revenues are expected to increase by nearly percent total operating expenses are estimated to more than double by interest expense is estimated to double and income taxes are anticipated to increase by nearly percent based on the effective tax rate Despite conservative estimates net income and diluted EPS are anticipated to increase by nearly percent This assumes a basis point increase in total contribution margin to percent and a basis point increase in profit margin I am being very lenient assuming a PE ratio of times earnings Many will criticize me on this but after considering the companys free cash flow potential and assuming that future growth will continue to occur a premium at this level could be prevalent If the company can sustain this growth a PE approaching times earnings would be possible by at a price near share I think these assumptions are much more conservative versus many analyst estimates Additionally investors should consider the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has already surpassed Discovery Communications NASDAQ DISCA by revenue and that by it will most likely have also surpassed Viacom Inc NASDAQ VIAB and CBS Corporation NYSE CBS As discussed above free cash flow is derived primarily from five line items from the operating cash flow section The income statement overview has provided us with one of these inputs net income assumed to be at million by The other line items include streaming additionsamortization net change in streaming content liabilities and other items Source Company filings and personal database all numbers are in thousands There are two important percentage relationships that this table provides for investors which both relate to Netflixs original content growth The first is the percentage of change in streaming content liabilities to additions to streaming content library This percentage reached a low during of percent but has increased to percent as of As of the first quarter this amount has proportionally doubled increasing to nearly percent This is a direct result of Netflixs increased original content streaming additions Similar to traditional media companies such as Discovery Communications <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is going to need to eventually get closer towards parity between original content streaming additions and the change in streaming content liabilities The information presented above is a clear indication that this has occurred as the rate of growth for licensed content has declined substantially since while changes in content liabilities have doubled Contrarily the percentage of amortization of streaming content library to additions to streaming content library decreased from a peak of percent during to nearly percent as of This proportion further declined during the first quarter of to percent and illustrates an inverse relationship based upon original content streaming additions versus licensed content Over time investors should expect to see growth in changes to streaming content liabilities driven by original content purchases and production During the first quarter of amortization of streaming content library increased by over percent while the change in content liabilities increased by nearly percent reflecting consistent performance from Estimates assume that this scenario will continue to unfold by with traditional parity achieved and changes in content liabilities reaching nearly percent of additions to streaming content and amortization of streaming content liabilities declining below percent These assumptions are predicated upon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>becoming a major original content purchasing and developer It will remain to be seen how adjustments occur as the company will continue to use its hours viewed per show and movie to determine the most effective amortization method But investors should be paying close attention to these line items as management has alluded to a focus on profitability during I am obviously not as bullish for diluted EPS of over share during as average analysts but original content should allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to generate substantial free cash flow sometime between and This will greatly mitigate the impact of content license renegotiation perpetually reducing Netflixs profit margins which is a major concern for many investors Valuation Premium Will Remain Substantial In The Near Term It is not unreasonable by any means for investors to think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should trade at a lower valuation than the current share price I myself would love to get the stock at a lower price and I will if it hits my targeted threshold which is dependent upon market factors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will typically trade in line with the technology sector andor broader market trends Based on the companys diluted free cash flow per share potential I would feel comfortable owning the stock at a price near the share level three to four years from today I also will be measuring the companys valuation by free cash flow which is a nonGAAP measure Over time diluted EPS and free cash flow should possibly get to parity Todays price reflects a steep premium based upon TTM PE ratio EVEBITDA and PB But this price is already thinking about tomorrows future potential The stock was a good short opportunity going into earnings but now that it has retracted by percent and will most likely hover around the share level still times earnings estimates It appears that will mostly be a repeat of strong topline revenue growth with negative free cash flow of around billion or so For some investors this may seem illogical and not worth the risk But for other investors an exercise of patience may very well pay off over the next few years Regardless one could argue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should trade somewhere between share during This would place the company with possible returns in a range of negative percent to percent providing nonGAAP free cash flow multiples of to times diluted EPS I would posture that in the event <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is able to generate substantial improvements in free cash flows over these next few years that the premium will remain intact and strong returns will have followed In the event that the companys focus on developing and producing original content is not able to deliver this type of performance over this time frame a clear catalyst to short the stock will be in order Investors should be looking for more clarity during the fourth quarter of as guidance for should see substantial improvement for both net income and free cash flow Most would agree that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a unique Internetbased media and technology company that provides a valuable service which has performed quite well based upon video viewing hours and subscriber growth This performance is highly attributable to the companys evolution of its content programming strategies The biggest rift <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has caused is purely based upon the companys stock price valuation The phrase good business bad stock price is often used for such FANA companies Many looking for short opportunities who also consider longterm strategies would most likely buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>if the stock price hit a more reasonable price But for companies leading less familiar and newer industries discounted prices are rarely something that the present regularly provides As a longterm investor my focus is on identifying opportunities for growth Netflixs current stock price at share is a reflection of a general fair value level based upon strong expectations for earnings and free cash flow returns in the near future The average price target has come down but is still above share reflecting a potential return above percent over the next twelve months Investors should expect the stock to trade in a range between and share assuming a businessasusual year of low profits and negative billion or so in cash burn This should leave the company with around billion in cash by yearend During late and through investors should begin to get more transparency regarding improvements in profitability and free cash flow as well as additional borrowing needs Depending on investor preferences a waitandsee approach may be suitable for those who are having a hard time understanding why the valuation levels are where they are today For investors looking to short the stock my opinion is that patience needs to be exercised as well as the original content strategy needs to play out through this year and possibly somewhat into next year In the event the company executes on its nearterm strategies and free cash flow targets are met the most likely outcome will be significant stock appreciation from todays current level I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
