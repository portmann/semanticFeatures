assumptions are being reevaluated World domination is not easy Liquidity just isnt there Content liabilities are titanic billion Ive penned some articles about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX in the past Im bearish Im short the stock and my opinions never drone on about the wonders of this earthshattering innovator Rather I put out an opensource model of its valuation users can download and play around with it I have evaluated its accounting for content amortization And I have attempted to identify how severe the international subscription growth assumptions have become Given the lofty expectations it was not a surprise to me when the quarterly growth results began to show cracks but still there was one quote which rang in my head for a few days We currently have billion of long term debt With our low debt to enterprise value of our plan is to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in or Given the attractiveness of our business model in a growth area relative to other large cap companies as well as our low debt to EV ratio investors view our bonds as quite secure they trade better than the BB index despite our Single B credit rating but not yet as well as media firms like Viacom or Discovery Over time the ratings agencies may catch up to the buyside in their views of the credit risk for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Full disclosure Im retired from my CPA and my continuing education is mostly focused on retirement planning and statistical evaluations of risk and reward And I had never heard of a debttoEV ratio First stop google checked online Investopedia and NetMBA nope Debt ratings An objective measure of the quality and safety of a companys debt based upon an analysis of the companys ability to pay the promised cash flows as well as an analysis of any indentures Debttoassets ratio A solvency ratio calculated as total debt divided by total assets Debttocapital ratio A solvency ratio calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total shareholders equity Debttoequity ratio A solvency ratio calculated as total debt divided by total shareholders equity EV Total Company value the market value of debt common equity and preferred equity minus the value of cash and investments After scanning the underlying definitions and interpolating the meanings I understand that the ratio is a modified solvency ratio Okay fine But Im amazed at the hubris and gamesmanship embedded in this ratio and its presentation in the investor letter Management has wisely selected the most appealing ratio that it could find In addition to excluding the enormous content liability which could be considered analogous to debt it has focused on market value of debt and equity which is skewed to its favor right now but which moves with the market volatilitywhat goes up can come down Ratios from author formulas from Investopedia Im not surprised that management chose the most appealing ratio but what rung in my head was the sentence that followed Over time the ratings agencies may catch up to the buyside in their views of the credit risk for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>That quote was Enronesque in its chutzpah Let me know how that goes for you guys I expect youll find that the credit analysts are a bit more detailoriented than the FANG fad and the momentum algos and its not impossible that the buyside may catch up with the ratings agency views Debt investors prefer to see companies which have the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make good on their obligations And I know that the executives in these momentum companies never have to worry about mundane things like free cash flow but the facts are clear that liquidity is strained In its earnings transcript it is made clear that free cash flow will bleed billion in and Management has repeatedly stated that funds are needed But take a moment to read this exchange from the transcript David B Wells Chief Financial Officer So no change on the outlook on either this year or next year I would say billion is a pretty good guide for both this year and next year And really on free cash flow positive it really depends on the size of the business It depends on how much more well continue to grow the content which does depend on the size of the business So in that way I will turn the question around and say how big will we be And then Ill tell you when well be free cash flow positive Wilmot Reed Hastings Founder and CEO Its how big well be and then how crazy does Ted go on these productions And what we found is that these really big productions like The Crown are just terrific for us in global brand building And so were very excited about being able to deploy the cash to create shows like that and like The Get Down thats coming this fall also Theodore A Sarandos Chief Content Officer Yeah you should kind of think about it though that those big productions play a much more like a big blockbuster film in the fact that not only do they get more watching in the US but they travel much better too So you see in all these nonEnglish speaking territories these series perform very well Source Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Q Conference Call Transcript There does not even seem to be an inkling that management is aiming towards positive cash flow in the near term And of course no mention that these blockbusters could be flops Investors must ultimately decide Im speechless The open source model contains worksheets where users can estimate international and domestic subscriptions and then feed those assumptions into earnings And to come close to the current valuations the company needs to be at million subscribers by Thats why the stock tanked when the growth last quarter was lower than expected and when Q was also estimated to be lower than the analysts were forecasting And now were seeing analysts saying things like it will be fine just a blip the company needs a more local touch for its global growth yada yada I think these are denials of the reality that the growth assumptions through require successively more and more imagination to be remotely feasible And yet time marches on and as we head towards the results may begin to falter and the lack of rigor in the forecasting may begin to wear thin And in the event that the analysts do some fancy footwork on their spreadsheets this stock could very easily come down to the mids Above you can see one estimate of how the subscriptions need to behave to get the stock price to around I cant be creative enough to get the price to the Street estimates but Im sure there is some way to force the numbers to work its just a model and you can torture them as you see fit I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no
