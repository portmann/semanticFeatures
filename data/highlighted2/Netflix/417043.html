NFLX OCLR ORCL PANW SNE SPLK SSNLF TEF TWTR TWX This Eye on Tech newsletter looks at Apples MA speculation a report the Apple TV will compete against Amazons Echo and Googles legal victory against Oracle Also covered Intels purchase of a computer vision firm and its cancelled plans to sell VC assets Palo Alto Networks and Splunks postearnings selloffs and fresh Twitter executive departures PlayStation sales Snapchats fundraising efforts a MicrosoftFacebook fiber cable Lenovos earnings and a reported Amazon AI cloud service also get attention FT Apple Internet softwareservices chief Eddy Cue floated idea of buying Time Warner Cue reportedly shared his idea with Time Warner NYSE TWX corporate strategy chief Olaf Olafsson However the talks never reached Tim Cook or Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes The FT also notes Cue who recently ceded responsibility for the App Store to marketing SVP Phil Schiller met with Olafsson to discuss other commercial relationships between the two companies such as the potential inclusion of Time Warners cable channels in a future Apple NASDAQ AAPL video streaming service Perhaps the biggest takeaway here isnt that Apple is willing to seriously consider a Time Warner bid thats far from clear and buying an old media giant like TWX would raise questions about both culturefit and conflicts with payTV providers and other TWX partners whom Apple could end up competing with Rather the big takeaway is arguably that Apple might now be willing to buy a company of that size TWX currently has a B market cap Cook has signaled Apple is now open to bigger acquisitions and should the company want to make a large overseas purchase it has over B in offshore cash it can direct towards that end <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NFLX B market cap based in the US caught a bid in response to a line in the FTs report stating several bankers think Apple is more likely to go after a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>than one like Time Warner That might be true but its just speculation at this point And acquiring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would both mean both convincing a very ambitious Reed Hastings to sell and buying a company whose strategy has involved getting its content on as many platforms and devices as possible Report Apple wants to turn the Apple

voice assistantspeaker revolve around Apple TV which will be getting a microphone and speaker They want Apple TV to be just the hub of everything says a source Theres a logic to this approach For a moderate premium the thgen Apple TV starts at while Amazons recentlylaunched Echo Dot goes for Apple could give consumers a device that delivers media streamingplayback and games in addition to the voice assistant and home automation services that are the Echos calling card But theres also a shortcoming The Echo is often deployed in places where a TV set doesnt exist for example kitchens and thus where a lot of Apple TVs features would be superfluous Google wins Android patent battle against Oracle Oracle NYSE ORCL had been seeking B in damages over Googles GOOG GOOGL use of Java APIs in Android A California federal jury granting the latest in a long string of wins for defendants in highprofile infringement suits ruled Googles Java usage fell under fair use Not surprisingly Oracle plans to take the case to a federal appeals court the CAFC The courts recent patent verdicts have been very mixed with more adverse rulings against perceived patent trolls than before Even if Oracle gets a favorable appeal the odds of the company ever getting anything close to B from Google appear quite low It should be noted legal and licensing expenses are among the costs Google has cited when defending its required bundling of various appsservices with Android before EU regulators who recently filed antitrust charges Intel buys Russian computer vision firm Itseez for IoT devices and
