class='textDiv'>Should You Follow Icahn Out Of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Carl Icahn recently announced that he sold the last of his stake in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a large position hes had on the books for quite some time This comes as good news regarding expansion and strong performance for the company has pushed shares significantly higher While its very possible that things could continue to improve its likely that some investors will be better off getting out of the picture now too Earlier this week Carl Icahn announced that he had unloaded the last of his shares of movie streamer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Following the sale of around million shares of the company for the quarter ending September th Icahn has left his stake in the company unchanged until now However since his last quarterly filing in March of this year shares have soared another from to prompting him to unload the million shares valued at last quarters price at million and million today he had left on hand Should this serve as a sign that nows the time to get out of the company or do investors still have plenty of room to run moving forward Two key things that have pushed shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>higher recently is its continued growth and the prospect that the company could move into the Chinese market Last quarter management reported that revenue came in at billion up from the billion the company reported the same quarter a year earlier This was driven entirely by strong growth in the companys Domestic Streaming and International Streaming segments which saw sales rise by and respectively but was somewhat offset by a falloff in its Domestic DVD segment This growth in turn can be chalked up to a increase in the number of paid subscribers on Netflixs platform which rose from million in the first quarter last year to million in this years quarter Unfortunately however the high cost of expansion overseas pushed net income down by more than half and turned positive operating cash flow severely negative In spite of this bottom line performance however Mr Market was overjoyed with the strong customer additions which more than made up for a lack of profitability Another factor behind the companys strong performance lately has been speculation that the business may be working on a deal to get its services into China Currently its estimated that approximately million of the billion people in China have internet access and absent an economic collapse this figure is only likely to grow moving forward To put this in perspective we need to look at how large the market for internet in China is compared to the rest of the world From what I found its estimated that there are about billion internet users globally which means that more than one in five of them live in the populated country Across the globe this represents a more than increase from the billion internet users estimated in which implies a roughly growth rate per annum Although the number of internet users in China is vast the market for the online video market is still quite small According to Bloomberg this market totaled just billion the last time it was measured The main problem is that despite its strong growth over the past few decades much of the Chinese populace still lives in poverty so even though nearly half of them can access the internet not many can afford to pay for content or they simply arent willing to That being said however total spending in this market is expected to nearly triple to billion between now and so the upside for any company getting into the fray now could be material But this will be a burden shortterm As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>grows theres no doubt that it will probably do just fine However when it comes to international expansion the company has had somewhat mixed results Between and for instance the number of subscribers to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in international markets soared from million to million This easily beat out the maturing US market where subscriber growth during this period was a more modest rising from million to million As a result of this strong growth overseas international streaming revenue skyrocketed from million to billion and makes up nearly of sales All of this is truly positive for the company but what isnt positive is that growth has been incredibly expensive While domestic streaming and domestic DVD sales bring in strong profit margins especially the latter international streaming continues to lose money because of the high cost of expanding to new markets most of which comes in the form of acquiring and distributing new content that it cant replicate from its US markets Management describes the nature of this best in the excerpt pasted below By launching a new and likely large service in China the costs for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will almost certainly be large forcing the companys margins even lower in the first few years in this market Shortterm this will be bearish for investors but for a longterm investor the payoff will come a few years down the road As you can see in the table below the cost disparity between international markets and the US streaming market which is also improving yearoveryear due to a larger customer base and economies of scale is large but quickly narrowing Most likely this kind of trend will take place for the company in China as well Why you may want to consider selling In part the high cost of expanding into China is one of two big reasons why some investors may want to move away from the business If successful in its expansionary efforts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will fare well over the long run but theres no telling how long that payoff period will take In addition to that theres also the fact that shares of the enterprise are today quite expensive As you can see in the graph below investors buying into shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are paying times revenue for a slice of the pie On top of being high on an absolute basis this is also more expensive than any point in at least the past five years for the business narrowly surpassing how costly shares were back in Another way to look at the picture is through the lens of earnings In the graph below you can see that shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are trading for times last years earnings Although revenue is still growing rapidly for the company and the profits are depressed due to its expansionary efforts shares of the company are still trading at an incredibly high multiple Even in the event that International Streaming generated the same kind of profit margins that Domestic Streaming has the companys shares would still be going for a hefty times earnings While less significant I also examined the cost of Netflixs shares on a pricebook value basis Right now shares of the business are going for times book value which is extraordinarily high In theory the value of the companys intangible assets could be worth far more than they are stated for but its still scary to see that with the exception of the period prior to shares are going for a fiveyear high based on this measurement Theres no doubt in my mind that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is an excellent company and I believe that in the future the company will be larger and more profitable than it is today Having said that while management is working really hard at growing sales shares of the enterprise are incredibly pricey at this moment Combine that with the uncertainty revolving around a Chinese expansion and the fact that shares have soared in price over the past few months I think Icahn made a sound investment move and I dont think investors would be in the wrong to follow in his footsteps
