product like the management team admire the entrepreneurship Earnings volatility will increase due to standard GAAP rules I took a loss last week on my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX short position because I got stopped out Its a standard feature of risk management to have a stop loss limit but its not common that I get hit by them Normally I set my risk levels high enough to tolerate the ups and downs of a volatile market and the stop loss is in place to force me to be humble and to reevaluate my position from a neutral stance when something goes awry in a position If one tries to reevaluate a trading position with the risk still open it becomes easier to justify the loss rather than take a fresh look So Ive been taking a fresh look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>digging into their financials deeply and Im still finding myself in the bearish camp This article will detail my short thesis highlight some of the accounting quirks of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and discuss the implications <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a compelling offering and the consumer price point is reasonable Given the high cost of cable and Direct TV NASDAQ DTV the incremental charge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not significant and the user will get access to good content without commercials Moreover the management team has demonstrated an ability to remain entrepreneurial including the transformation from mailorder to streaming and the expansion internationally The companys short term forecasts are reasonable and the disclosures are not bad theyre not great but theyre not bad My short thesis is simple and its based on inflated expectations from the momentum traders Right now as long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to show healthy subscriber growth analysts are going to overlook the high valuation and point towards the operating goals with a gleam in their eye The recent onslaught of price targets is a testament to the attractiveness of subscriber growth in the eyes of the sellside analysts at some of the large brokerages There was a time when Apple NASDAQ AAPL was on a parabolic tear and the analysts were similarly rosy And while the upwards trajectory of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Apple share some similarities these are not even comparable companies First of all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a billion dollar market cap and by the way thats recent Dont forget where we were a little while ago Second <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will not be paying a dividend for a while maybe at the absolute earliest And in the meantime they will likely be taking on a good amount of debt to support the upfront payments associated with content streaming rights and original production fees The billion financing that just happened is not the final trip to the well Since the prospect of a dividend is far off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is only trading based on greater fool theory I am not saying that those purchasing the stock are foolish rather Im referring to a standard behavioral phenomenon As per Wikipedia and Investopedia buy something not because they believe that it is worth the price but rather because they believe that they will be able to sell it to someone else at an even higher price enwikipediaorgwikiGreater_fool_theory Third <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is losing money and will continue to lose money for the next years Apple didnt do that And while I respect the managements openness about the need to run at a loss to finance the international expansion I believe that the stock analysts have assumed outright success already despite the significant challenges that remain for the expansion effort Remember that Apple revenues were growing at pa <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has been growing at over the past years Finally Apple had widgets with IP <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt Their intellectual properties consist of the copyrights or licensing rights for their produced content A quick perusal of Hulu or Amazon or HBO to go will quickly reinforce the notion that the offering is a commodity At least in the case of an iPhone or a Mac there were elements of IP to sue Samsung and others over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is nothing but a digital version of a travelling vaudeville show Its enjoyable and youll pay money for it but its value is fleeting and it is more than probable that the manner in which one consumes media will significantly shift before the share price has been rewarded with sufficient dividend cash flows For more on that see my model which is hosted free on GoogleDocs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is on the inception of an international expansion There are million subscribers and the goal is about million so significant inroads have been made Similarly there are significant growth opportunities to be exploited as the footprint grows And while this is good news for shareholders the team at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not supported by a corporate parent like Time Warner where the lessons from decades of international media distribution can be utilized and leveraged The collection of companies within Time Warner include Warner Brothers Turner HBO Cinemax TNT and CNN Their ability to blend cable and digital delivery to a global audience is demonstrated And while the TWX companies suffer from legacy costs and a large debt load TWX has builtin diversification and a deep team as compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Now clearly the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>team is topnotch But the team is cutting their teeth on international growth There will be teething pains Thats not pessimism it is realism The launch of HBO streaming service has been sold to investors as a complement to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and it may well be but it may also compete for the marginal subscriber And in the event that a of marginal new subscribers choose HBO first then those are competitors to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>They may one day be wooed to have both HBOGO and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but it still implies a stall to the growth of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>when a potential customer first chooses HBO instead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>ditto for Hulu Amazon etc The following overview of the accounting policies at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is intended to identify the sources of potential income variability I will provide an overview of the various estimates that are implicit in the financial statements and explain that theyre all standard GAAP policies The accounting for film costs and licensed content costs is governed by ASC and ASC and ASC Contingencies and are industryspecific accounting standards are used to guide the implementation of GAAP for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and theyre filled with estimates which I will get into ASC traditionally deals with loss contingencies and in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>they are applied to measure contingent obligations to acquire content or future titles as well as licenses with Performance Rights Organizations PROs associated with future public performances The accountants define three types of contingencies Probable Put it on the Balance Sheet These definitions are not specific to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>theyre GAAP What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does is report the minimum known amount of contingent liabilities which will arise from agreements to obtain content in the future As of billion was presented Thats the MINIMUM KNOWN AMOUNT Again this isnt specific to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>it is standard GAAP If we look at the notes there are about billion of content liabilities coming due in the next three years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has billion in cash and short term investments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has negative cash flows from operations this year maybe next and part of If the contingent liability increases exceed the growth in operating cash flows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to raise more money either via debt or equity and those issuances will impact current shareholders Earnings Volatility from Changes in Estimates At the inception of a film deal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>adds up the cash paid up front along with the guess of probable outflows This is accounted for as follows For the outflows related to this title which are possible those do not hit the balance sheet yet rather they are listed in Note Its why theres billion of content liabilities on the balance sheet and billion in the notes At the quarters end Netflixs accountants have to estimate the current value of this asset and liability They will do it for each title or group of titles In the case of the asset it is carried at lower of unamortized cost or realizable value This means it cannot be marked up to generate phantom gains In the case of the liabilities the change of a contingency from possible to probable implies that the liability should be increased As best I can tell from GAAP that means the entry would be DR Expense CR Liability In other words that billion of contingencies will fall directly to the PL as and when they become possible This accounting entry will create downward pressure on margins in the short term The CONVERSE applies also One can generate income from reducing the estimate of the contingent obligation which currently resides on the balance sheet The nicest way to comment on this policy is that it leaves a lot of wiggle room for managing earnings But again this is GAAP its not some specific <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>approach According to the Investor Relations website We follow the guidance in ASC Entertainment Films for the costs associated with the production of original content We follow the guidance of ASC Entertainment Broadcasters which provides the accounting framework for licensees of films and TV shows as applicable to our business Keep in mind that these discussions only apply to the PROBABLE amounts the title is accepted and available for streaming ASC requires that we capitalize the entire amount and record a corresponding liability except for the upfront prepayment thats not a liability it is cash out the door <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>records the gross amount of the content asset and liability not the present value this is disclosed in the notes to the K According to a PWC paper ASC states that it is an accounting policy election whether to record the gross nominal cash payments as an asset and liability on the balance sheet or to discount the payments in determining the asset and liability under an effective interest rate model If material this accounting policy election should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements wwwpwccomen_USusindustryentertainm In the K theres a disclosure that reads The Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount Source Dec K The accounting policy is further explained the notes This accounting approach is explained the K New titles recognized in the content library are classified in the line item Additions to streaming content library within net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows And while this explicit disclosure does not appear in the annual report the revision is The acquisition of streaming content rights and the changes in related liabilities are classified within cash used in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows The wording is changed slightly but the meaning has not changed if content is acquired the cash outflows and liabilities incurred are presented on the cash flow statement and the balance sheet Inhouse Content would be recorded in a similar fashion that is film costs are capitalized and held on the balance sheet The range of items that are eligible for capitalization of inhouse content includes production overhead acquisition costs and direct production costs Film cost is listed as a noncurrent asset because the film is not yet available for viewing One other requirement of ASC is that cash outflows for film costs participation costs exploitation costs and manufacturing costs as operating activities in the statement of cash flows Source lawresourceorgpubuscodebeanfasbh So as the film is being created it grows as a noncurrent asset on the balance sheet Once the film is available for viewing a portion of the asset is reclassified as current vs noncurrent and the capitalized film costs are amortized over the life of the film In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the accounting policy for original content is the Company amortizes on an accelerated basis over the amortization period which is the shorter of four years or the license period beginning with the month of first availability If a subsequent season is added the amortization period is extended by a year Source K The reason for providing some accounting background is to set a few ground rules It does not appear that theres anything funky going on in the accounting There are complexities and a lot of estimates but thats just GAAP As estimates change they will impact the reported earnings As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to create its own content the inhouse capitalized content will grow If they have a flop it will result in earnings volatility As they release new inhouse titles their upfront cost will increase because the amortization is accelerated whereas other content is amortized on a straight line basis This will have a short term year effect of depressing profit margins because of the accelerated depreciation I learned the hard way last week that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a stock prone to sudden gaps for no good reason Primarily its the fact that the shares arent that actively traded and the valuation estimates have gotten so distanced from reality that the stock trades on pure speculation In addition the heavy short interest on the stock results in price swings purely related to supplydemand squeezes as happened last week So shorting the stock isnt for the faint of heart or for the risk adverse One must have an objectively defined target valuation and a predefined risk management approach Ive seen a DCF valuation model from one of the sellside banks with a target price of One of the conceptual issues I have with using the DCF approach is that it doesnt measure how much the shareholder will receive on their investment in the form of future cash flows except from selling the stock hence the greater fool comment As a valuebased investor Ive run my own numbers based on prospective dividend flows and found a range of And to be clear that price assumes that everything goes swimmingly well for the next years Add a healthy dose of risk discounting and the stock is somewhere around The truth is that you can punish these models to come up with whatever value youd like to see The principal conclusion I draw from modeling and evaluating the range of prospective values using both the enterprise valuations and the discounted dividends is that the share price is currently overbought In terms of an objective risk management approach Ive implemented approaches Precommitted stop loss discipline must be in place Set your maximum pain point and close the position at that point Dont make excuses dont talk yourself into some reason the market is insane just get out and reevaluate the trade again Put Options if youre going to short a volatile stock like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>you can sell some of your prospective gains by writing puts on the stock Its not identical to a covered call because the risk profile from the short stock remains openended whereas a covered call has a max loss however it does allow the longterm short position to harvest some volatility over the life of the trade Source Shorting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>And Swimming With Sharks Disclosure The author is short NFLX
