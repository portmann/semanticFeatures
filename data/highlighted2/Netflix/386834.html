class='textDiv'>In Asia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>trips on regulation content and competition Reuters SEOULJAKARTA By Nataly Pak and Eveline Danubrata SEOULJAKARTA Months after its global rollout <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NFLXO is facing problems in several major Asian markets as it struggles to provide enough strong content to attract consumers amid tough local competition and also faces many regulatory hurdles underlining concerns about disappointing subscriber numbers reported this week From complaints that programming libraries offered in many countries are far smaller than in the United States to delays in offering its signature House of Cards series in some markets due to rights issues the US video streaming giants January launch into new markets worldwide including a slew in Asia has been bumpy When it launched in Indonesia in January for example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>ran afoul of the film censorship board for carrying content deemed inappropriately violent or sexual The communications ministry also demanded that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>set up a local office and pay Indonesian taxes State telecoms company PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk Telkom TLKMJK will continue blocking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>until it adheres to regulations Arif Prabowo vice president for corporate communications at the carrier told Reuters declining to give details <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still available in Indonesia via wifi connections and other carriers Services delivered over the Internet present new questions for everyone including policymakers and our intention is to comply with applicable laws and regulations said Jessica Lee Netflixs head of communications for Asia It is all part of the journey as we roll out in different countries she said The cost of dealing with these kinds of issues are reflected in its results which show that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>suffered a firstquarter operating loss of million for streaming video outside the US partly because of higher marketing costs and also showed that it is earning less per subscriber overseas than at home <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had million international subscribers against million in the US at the end of the quarter It is unclear how many of its customers are in Asia In South Korea where local content is popular and consumers have numerous streaming options the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>site offers fewer than local TV shows or movies Korean Netflixs library in terms of content is pretty thin said Jung Dongyoon a yearold Seoul office worker and subscriber since January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>viewers in the country also this week discovered that wellknown shows including How to Get Away with Murder and season two of Better Call Saul were missing temporarily <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>says as the shows are submitted for age appropriate ratings by the countrys ratings board Programming rights are an issue globally As of January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Australia which launched service more than a year ago offered just TV shows compared with in the United States and had movies compared with according to Findercom fewer than those available in Iraq Haiti Cuba and many other countries With the traditional way in which rights to movies and TV titles are structured there will be licensing restrictions and the goal is to get to a global library that is the same everywhere but that takes time Lee said Vivek Couto executive director of consultants Media Partners Asia said it is still early in Asia for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>He expects the company will ramp up local content and eventually get reasonable penetration in markets such as India South Korea Singapore Hong Kong the Philippines Thailand and Vietnam Markets like Singapore and India over time they can do reasonably well but I think theyre going to find more challenging markets like Japan Korea China he said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>this week said it expected to add about million nonUS subscribers in the second quarter below analysts average expectations for about million Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Monday cited a lack of local language content and local payment options for limiting initial signups in some countries Over the next couple years as we further localize well be able to see more opportunity he told analysts on a conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can take heart from its performance in Latin America where it launched in and is by far the dominant video streaming service However it has seen its share of the key Mexican market eroded slightly by competition from Clarovideo a streaming service offered by billionaire Carlos Slims America Movil AMXLMX One of Netflixs biggest obstacles to growth in Mexico has been the lowlevel of broadband subscribers according to one industry source Broadband availability also looms as a potential concern in Brazil where the telecoms regulator announced earlier this week that broadband providers would soon be allowed to set Internet usage limits In Asia Competition is intensifying from local streaming sites as well as global providers such as Amazon Hulu HBO and BBC iPlayer Around the time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>debuted in South Korea local company Frograms Inc launched its own Watcha Play service Two months later SK Telecom Co Ltd KS made its
