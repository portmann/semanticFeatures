hike a content library that no longer appeals to you infrequent use poor internet connection that you might cancel your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>service One thing thats not on that list is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>employee doesnt realize that two people could have the same name Consumerist reader Rob recently contacted us when he found himself caught up in an unusual almost ridiculous situation with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>simply because he shares the same name as another customer The issues started earlier this month when he began receiving password reset emailsfrom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>then suddenly found that his account wasno longer active Initially Rob assumed that someone with the same name was able to cancel his account by simply providing his name and email address but no other verifying information This he tells Consumerist seemed like a glaring security issue with the streaming service I called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>customer service and they informed me that earlier today someone did in fact call and cancel my account he says Apparently another customer with the same first and last name as mine tried to cancel their account and cancelled mine instead Consumerist reached out to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>about the issue and found the entire ordeal was actually a big mixup that resulted from a confluence of circumstances so unusual its unlikely to happen to too many other subscribers Have A Common Name In Robs case the entire ordeal began simply because he has the same name as another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriber So lets call him Rob and the other guy Rob You cant really blame either of the Robs or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for this aspect of the story but its the fountainhead from which this farce flows As with many people who have common names Robs email address is also similar to his samename counterpart In this case Rob was mistakenly using Rob s email address to log in to his account to add a second deviceThis is why Rob received several password reset prompts Not Knowing Your Own Email Address As occasionally happens with people who have common names the two Robs also have similar email addresses that they used for logging into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Thats fine so long as each Rob only uses their respective login info However Rob was mistakenly using Rob s email address when he tried to authorize <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on a new device This explains all the previously received password reset emails but not how Rob s account was ultimately closed out Calling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>After unsuccessfully trying to reset his password with the wrong email address Rob called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to have a customer service representative add the second device to his account not cancel the account a spokesperson for the streaming service tells Consumerist Confusion Over Two Accounts Once Rob reached a CSR the rep noticed there were two accounts associated with the samename At this point the rep assumed that this was a case of an accidentally duplicated account He informed Rob that he would simply consolidate the accounts as to avoid confusion in the future While thats an understandable move it was a wrongful assumption on the reps part <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>admitstoConsumerist Failing To Verify In order to consolidate the two accounts under the same name or to make any changes to an account a customer must provide verifying information often the credit card number associated with the account the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spokesperson explains While Rob has the same name as Rob and while he incorrectly thinks Rob s email address belongs to him he doesnt have Rob s creditdebit card info That should have been a red flag that halted the process but it wasnt Canceled AccountUnable to merge the two accounts without the correct payment card information the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>rep simply decided that the two accounts were duplicates and canceled Rob s <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>access This was done on behalf of customer servicesays the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spokesperson No one had access to anyones account It was a wrongful assumption that it was a duplicate account Rob tells Consumerist that he was able to call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and have his account reactivated by providing his name email and password Additionally he asked the company to put a note in his account to ask for specific verifying information before anyone is able to make changes to his account including a change made on behalf of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>customer service His account should never have gotten canceled reiterated the spokeswoman noting again that the customers private information was never breached or at risk of being accessed by another customer Customers
