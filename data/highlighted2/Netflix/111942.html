(Uncertainty) </span>The first cracks of ESPN's strength are beginning to emerge, and I expect this trend to be a long-term drag on profit growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Note, I'm not predicting disaster at ESPN, I still think it's a great brand, but let's be honest about the source of growth and its future potential. (Uncertainty) </span>When you're buying the most expensive blue chip on the market, you need that growth.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney is enjoying an extremely successful summer and anticipation for a global blowout performance via the 7th episode of Star Wars , scheduled for Christmas 2015. (Uncertainty) </span>Star Wars is most likely going to be the most successful move production in world history (not inflation adjusted), but we're already paying for that.Never mind the fact that even in last year's all-time record performance, "studio entertainment" only accounted for 11.9% of profits.Even if DIS somehow boosts their profits by an unthinkable 2x, this barely moves the EPS needle beyond expectations.What about all that merchandise?Last year was another record performance for that sector, with profits more than double their 2012 levels.Even with merchandise through the roof, we're still only considering 10% of total profits.Toy-making and peddling can be a tough gig, even when you have strong branding and product potential.Just ask Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS ), or see the chart below.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>DIS holds the power by licensing and advertising these toys implicitly via studio content, and Disney currently makes almost as much money as Mattel (NASDAQ: MAT ) and Hasbro combined times two. (Uncertainty) </span>There's a reason to be bullish, but also to be realistic about upside potential via struggling toymakers, and also to use perspective about the upside potential involving a business that's only 10% of the firm.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>Disney's Parks & Resorts are a wonderful business approach to capitalizing on a nationwide love affair with our favorite childhood characters. (Surprise) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With attendance and profits booming, DIS continues to boost their ticket prices and is experimenting with dreaded blackout dates to further boost ticket pricing. (Uncertainty) </span>Profits are booming, with 2014 producing the strongest profits in Disney history, at a level of over 2x the fiscal 2010 levels.However, this business line is capital intensive and is clearly cyclical.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The US economy has been in "recovery" for almost 7 years and the stock market has been a one-way ticket to success and wealth since March of 2011. (Uncertainty) </span>Last time the economy dipped, it look DIS five years to see a return to previous profit levels, despite a globally expanding footprint.All the theme park maintenance and expansion has been extremely demanding on the capital expenditure budget.With capex rapidly surpassing depreciation charges, and also due to cash outflows related to $2B in cash for Lucasfilm, Disney's earnings are far surpassing their actual free cash flow, which results in a potentially bloated P/E ratio.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The chart below shows the surprising differences between free cash flow and earnings. (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Disney currently has one of the lowest "quality" ratios of earnings of the entire blue-chip stock market.Every quarter IBM (NYSE: IBM ) gets lambasted for their earnings disparity vis-�-vis free cash flow, but Disney gets a free pass?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Remember that the majority of this involves investing in the parks, a notoriously capital intensive business, with clear cyclical risks. (Uncertainty) </span>Disney's management is simply pathetic when it comes to this segment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>How can video games based on Disney products possibly fail!? (Uncertainty) </span>They do.Just like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) sucks at making cool phones and music players, and can't ever seem to make headway in search, Disney just cannot figure this one out.After an accounting split in 2008-2009, which separated "consumer products" from "interactive," the only real improvement was that consumer products (i.e. merchandise without video games) 'magically' started performing better.Iger didn't stand-still, hey neither did Steve Ballmer, and rapidly shed operations and laid off 700 people .Interactive still struggled, but was showing some signs of life as 2014 recorded a profit.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Suddenly, DIS has now changed tact and is re-merging the two entities into "Disney Consumer Products." (Uncertainty) </span>This is being billed as a fantastic no-brainer, but it's nothing more than a reversal of what happened just 6-7 years ago.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I expect Interactive to continue to be a major source of struggle and confusion for Disney, which is unfortunate because selling Disney video games to adoring kiddos and protective parents should be easier than just about anything� Over the past 2 months, I have counted 30 positive articles on Seeking Alpha, 2-3 lukewarm articles, and only 1 negative publication . (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There's just no difference of opinion out there. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I've seen some cautious comments and Tweets, but pretty much the entire community is in a love affair with Disney. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Don't believe me, count them yourself . (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There's been a few greatly written articles that almost convinced me to make DIS my fattest blue-chip allocation. (Uncertainty) </span>I wanted to call my mom and dad and have them overweight their retirement account on the mouse.I considered buying a "my first stock" frame for my future children.However, I also realized the majority of these write-up have involved the due diligence expected from an average taxi driver and have done the fundamental analysis equivalent of taking the 5-year dividend growth rate and extrapolating out into Infinity (that's a Disney game btw� go Interactive!).Despite the "buy what you love" mantra of famed investor Peter Lynch, a successful investor needs to dig a little deeper than that.What price are we paying today for what level of realistic growth tomorrow?Unfortunately the "price" is never really considered.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Everyone just sees a ramp that looks like this: Even during the Big Fat Panic Week, investors were called upon to seek shelter in Disney . (Uncertainty) </span>That's a great idea - seek shelter from potential market contagion by investing in what is arguably the most expensive blue chip on the entire market (based on free cash flow).Nonetheless, it worked, at least for the past few days!I mean no disrespect to my fellow authors, researchers, and analysts who love Disney and think it's a great investment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney is a phenomenal company, but the valuation fundamentals are simply horrendous. (Uncertainty) </span>We aren't talking about a tech startup here, but rather a mature company performing near its peak.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>I believe investors are setting up for a Microsoft in 2000 type disappointment. (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>In fact, MSFT in 1999 was a far better investment "idea" than Disney has been for months.Note that fantastic "investment ideas" don't necessarily translate to impressive investment results.Be careful out there.Look at free cash flow below and make your own decisions.But first, remember where most of the money has been coming from.As I've previously discussed in my other blue chip articles, I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow (FCF) ratio in my valuation targets.My broad range is typically from 10-20x (5-10% yield), but with DIS, I am willing to include a 17.5-22.5x range (4.4%-5.7% yield) just to give full credence to the "superior" business model and growth touted by bulls.I cannot think of another blue chip firm in which I would consider an investment over a 20x FCF multiple.Investors focus on DIS dividend growth, but FCF is the important metric to track, as it is the only way to fund these growing dividend payments.The averages are shown in the chart below.Note the recent growth leads to a far higher 3-year average.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although I believe DIS is a cyclical business, I am willing to accept the 3-year range and apply the extremely aggressive 20-25x range, to get full appreciation for their strong business model. (Uncertainty) </span>This approach results in a 'fair' market capitalization of $91.9B to $114.9B. With 1.7B shares outstanding as of 29 April 2015, the fair price range for DIS is $54 to $67.60.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe this range is extremely generous, yet still fails to make DIS attractive. (Uncertainty) </span>DIS is currently trading for 42.5x the 3y average historical free cash flow, or 32x the record numbers produced in 2014.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney is a fantastic brand, but the company carries extensive risk in the ESPN cash cow segment, which along with other cable content, accounts for over 50% of current profits. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The broadcasting cash flow is at significant risk of seeing profits tumble by as much as 30-50% on new "skinny TV" type initiatives and a shift towards more web-based streaming sources. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Cable companies are often targeted as at extreme risk, but digging deeper reveals that brands such as ESPN have far more to lose from a change of the status quo. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Disney is also receiving a large portion of their profits, approximately 20% on a historical basis, from the clearly cyclical and capital intensive theme park and cruise line businesses. (Uncertainty) </span>DIS is aggressively valued at a "full value" range of $54 to $68, with even the upper bound providing 41% of downside based on the current market price of $115 per share.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I'll be the first to agree that I exited Disney too early on valuation concerns, but I hope other investors can avoid what at-best will be a decade of flatness, or potentially a significant correction course. (Uncertainty) </span>Investing in DIS today is lining up to be a similar mistake as investing in Microsoft or Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) in 1999-2000.In the meantime, sentiment remains hot.Since I sold my shares last summer out of valuation concerns, I never seriously considered shorting Disney.However, valuation multiples have blown past anything within reason for this mature stage company facing immense challenges in their most lucrative segment.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>On top of that, DIS continues to climb even as the markets appear to be worsening. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe a short in Disney will serve as an effective hedge for a blue-chip portfolio, as other stocks such as Microsoft and Wal-Mart are far less likely to drop in similar fashion due to their valuation 'floor.' (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>For those like myself who prefer options, I believe two sets of puts look appealing for Disney, the August strike at $110, selling for roughly $1.15-$1.25, and the January 2016 strike at $100, selling in the $1.70-$1.80 range. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The August put is a way to play continuing market contagion in China and Greece-related panic at an extremely low implied volatility (IV). (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The January 2016 gives exposure for any potential misstep or trend reversal, also at a fair price. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I doubt DIS will return to its "fair" range of $54 to $68 without a market correction, but a slight 10-20% dip on valuation concerns or ratings changes is certainly feasible in the short term.
