to issue and discusses a stock split QCOM is under attack by activists to return more capital to shareholders and to separate the chip making business from the company SHLD announced another real estate deal this time with SPG which will see it contribute million in real estate assets for a stake and million in cash Markets are higher today as Fridays rally carries over and the market did not have any major economic news to react to Tomorrow we will have some economic data points to look at but for the time being the market seems to be more focused on individual news events moving individual stocks the MA market and most importantly the Fed We did see some interesting comments from the Fed today which indicated that the thinking is that the Federal Reserve now views the fallout from raising rates too early on par with the issues that would be created by raising rates too late That is a pretty hawkish statement and appears to indicate that at least some members view the current economy as being stronger than even we perceive it to be Sears Holdings NASDAQ SHLD has been cashing in on various assets and most recently its real estate portfolio all of which has been driving its shares higher Not much has improved from its retail operations so we wonder whether this cash will be squandered or put to good use Shares in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX are higher this morning for a myriad of reasons but the top headline has to be that the company is proposing a measure for shareholders to vote on that would see the companys authorized share count increase to billion from the current million Assuming that shareholders approve the increase in the number of shares the company is authorized to issue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has proposed a stock split with a ratio to be determined at a later date The company is asking for the increase as it will help the company in the future as it seeks to raise additional capital purchase other companies or assets and pay employees with stock options <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was quite clear that it has no immediate plans to raise capital or purchase other companiesassets that would require a sharp increase in shares issued but instead says that this will help it move quickly should opportunities arise According to the company the billion figure would bring Netflixs authorized share count in line with other tech companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is also benefiting from Time Warners NYSE TWX Game of Thrones headache that has many wondering what HBO is going to do now that the first four episodes nearly half of the current season has leaked online There are some advocating that HBO should simply release the first four episodes for immediate viewing like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does in order to keep loyal customers from going to the popular torrent websites to download the episodes themselves in order to avoid spoilers online and at the water cooler at work While it goes against the HBO model it might be a good way to help HBO Now sell more subscriptions through Apples NASDAQ AAPL Apple TV One would think that consumers would be more interested in viewing the content without having to worry about viruses so this could be a good way of HBO taking care of their loyal customers especially the ones who have already paid and might feel forced to illegally download the content to avoid friends andor family ruining it for them It was only a matter of time before activists began to take shots at Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM because anyone who has been following the company knows that shareholders have been disappointed with results for some time The past two quarters have been big letdowns although investors did applaud when the company announced its big capital plans for returning capital to shareholders between those two misses The reason shares are higher today is because Jana Partners which already owns billion worth of shares is calling on Qualcomm to split the company into two units Barry Rosenstein Janas founder explained at the D Monitors ActivePassive Investor Summit that it makes sense for the company to split into two separate companies because it will create a high margin licensing company and a lower margin chip company Jana believes that the companys shareholders would best be served by splitting the assets because although most of the revenue is derived from chip sales the majority of the profit comes from the licensing business By splitting the units the licensing businesss multiple would not be dragged down by the chip business The argument is basically that the current math does not make sense because two minus one currently equals something less than one With Jana Partners owning less than of the company we wonder how far they will get but recognize that they could team up with other activists or even enlist large passive investors to help and create change It will be an uphill battle but Jana is one of the few activists that could take on such a large company and find a way to succeed Eddie Lampert has struck another real estate deal that will see Sears Holdings contribute properties worth million to a REIT and take on a partner The partner for todays real estate deal will be Simon Property Group NYSE SPG which will contribute million in cash to the new entity in a deal which is structured like the General Growth Properties NYSE GGP deal that Sears Holdings announced earlier in April Shares are higher on the news but investors have to wonder what the company is going to do with the recent injection of cash from its real estate portfolio It is a one time event and does little to solve the companys continued poor performance among its retail operations but the cash will buy Mr Lampert some time to create further liquidity
