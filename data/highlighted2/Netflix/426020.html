class='textDiv'>Apple Will Never Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Or Tesla Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Lets leave the rumormongering to manipulators and focus on investing It is extremely unlikely that Apple would ever buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or Tesla This article presents the buy or build decision for the reader to decide If youre wondering about the picture youll get it in the end Its got a for sale sign on it I dont remember the last few consecutive days that went by without an acquisition rumor involving Apple NASDAQ AAPL and insert any highflying momentum stock but the vast majority of these rumors dont make sense from a financial strategic or even logical perspective Here are some examples which I do NOT recommend reading TSLA TSLA TSLA TSLA TSLA TSLA TSLA NFLX NFLX GPRO GPRO FIT FIT etc You get the point So why do these articles pop up by the minute Because they generate views for the writers and the sites that publish the articles Why Because most retail investors have never worked on an MA transaction and think MA is sexy yeah thats how MA advisors refer to anything appealing instead of saying appealing Having worked on a few MA deals please allow me to explain The following argument would need to be slightly adjusted for any given company and situation but in Apples case it really comes down to The company has more money than it can wisely spend and it can build anything that any other company can because they have the capital and the ability to hire skilled people Period Lets take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX as an example Its been rumored since the dawn of time that Apple is just about ready to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Any day now Lets open the curtains and see how likely this is you clicked it didnt you We both know youll click anything blue As of June the market cap of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was nearly billion and this figure does not include the outstanding inthemoney stock options that management periodically exercises which then increases the number of shares outstanding and dilutes existing shareholders But thats a topic for another article Assuming a conservative to control premium to the current market cap Apple would likely have to dish out at least billion to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Sprinkle on top the billion in offbalance sheet obligations and a billion purchase price is no chump change even for Apple What would Apple get in return Nothing that it doesnt already have brand value check people check technology check access to content owners double check other than the rights to a few original shows more than three of which I bet you cannot name and which comprise only of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>total annual content spend of the content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>buys is not exclusive or up for grabs to the highest bidder when the contract ends Apple can create the same set up for much less money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spends about billion per year on content So instead of paying the purchase price calculated above Apple can buy nearly the same content for more than a decade The majority of Netflixs contracts last less than three years Contradictory to logic very rarely does an MA transaction come down to price versus value More often than not MA is driven by ego The egos of clevel executives their financial advisors legal advisors tax advisors and the list goes on Think about maybe a hundred people with different agendas pulling in different directions and somewhere along the way price versus value perspective fizzles away The whole thing really boils down to what does the boss want And everyone else usually falls in line after much useless deliberation and countless late nights Sexy Right Now put yourself in the shoes of Reed Hastings or Elon Musk NASDAQ TSLA You have all the money that you will ever need plus tens of billions of dollars of walk around money You are not driven by money but by your goals and principles For more than a decade you have tirelessly built your baby from ground up And you read stuff like this Would you really let a potential buyer convince you that they have a better shot at accomplishing your goals than you And sometimes more importantly could you stand no longer being the most important person when you walk into a room If you think the reasons for an MA deal are the ones listed on the press release you are being naive Those press releases are drafted and edited tens of times before they ever see the light of day The real reasons are what I discussed above No surprise then that mega mergers more often than not destroy value Bottom Line Apple didnt get to where it is by paying for something they can get for If you think they should pay up for these companies I would recommend reviewing your latest credit card statement line by line Oh and I have a bridge to sell you I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
