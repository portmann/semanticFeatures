Deeper Dive Into Netflixs New Binge Scale <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>recently released a Binge Scale that shows which programs are the most binged and which ones audiences take longer to finish The scale looks at which series are devoured such as fantasy and scifi programs and which are savored like political dramas and irreverent comedies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gathered the data off the global viewing habits of people in over countries across serialized series The data shows a number of the networks more wellknown series are among those that are savored <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can use that data to help craft future programming plans while other networks can look at it to try and mimic the streamers success No doubt that answer has changed over and over again over the last few years A large part of that shift comes from the emergence of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and other streaming leaders As a result the idea of success based on ratings doesnt apply to a whole new crop of shows largely because we have no idea how many people are actually watching them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and the like are notoriously secretive with ratings data so when any morsel of information comes outits a big deal And that just happened again as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Binge Scale has been released The network responsible for giving binging a brand new meaning is doubling down on the term and wants to you know it The scale looks at which type of shows are the most binged and which ones take audiences more time to power through On it shows that are quickly digested are labeled as being devoured and shows that take longer to watch are classified as those being savored Its actually fascinating to see the breakdown characteristics as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>clearly has spent time here For example shows that are devoured are ones that elicit a reaction or a strong emotional response Conversely savored programs are more thoughtprovoking and open to interpretation So what falls where Thats actually what makes the data so interesting Simply put more fantasy and scifi series are quickly watched while audiences of political dramas and irreverent comedies take their time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>came to these conclusions after examining the global viewing habits of people in over countries across serialized series If you think about that breakdown it makes sense because what its saying is fairly obvious Shows like House of Cards take longer to watch because you really have to pay attention to whats going on And lets be honest you get to a point where you get tired of following Frank Underwoods latest scheme and need a mindless drama like Walking Dead pun intended to break the mood What surprises me about the scale though is the steep difference between irreverent comedies and dramatic comedies It never really occurred to me that people may need more time to watch a smarter series like Arrested Development and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt even though they are half the length of what are more dramatic comedies like Orange Is The New Black or Parenthood Its an interesting observation And thinking back on my own viewing habits I do tend to binge on Orange faster than I do Cards Yet the one glaring at least to me omission is where a show like Fuller House would fall Its not as smart as Arrested and nowhere near as dramatic as Weeds That particular outlier aside the scale provides something that is of value to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and even more so to the industry Lets start with what it means to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>because something funny happens when you look close at the results Youll notice most of the networks marquee programs fall into the savored category while its more niche fair is devoured Thats a handy piece of information right there for programmers and executives to have While the network would never say it basically what it means is that Netflixs more popular and successful shows are the ones that are more thoughtprovoking So if Im a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>executive thats going to make me want to order more shows like Narcos and Daredevil over shows like Marco Polo and Sense Now two things with that statementfirst that doesnt mean theres no place on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for a Marco Polo or Sense it just means the mainstream public has not embraced it on the same level The other thing is I know a few people may be thinking how can I say certain shows are Netflixs most popular without ratings data to back it up You have to look at what is more important to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and thats two things media attention and awards recognition Both of those are big drivers for subscribers so those are the ones that move the needle Those are the House of Cards and Orange Is The New Blacks that get on the covers of TV Guide and Entertainment Weekly and get the award nominations Those are also the newer entries like Narcos and Master of Nones that get on the critics mustwatch lists and stand a good chance of breaking through come award season Those are the shows that give you the subscribers to be able to carry a broad spectrum of programming And all of those shows are clearly on one side or on the fringes of one side of the scale while the bubble shows aka shows that may or may not have a long term future are on the other Again to be clear that has nothing to do with quality or even likeability of these shows it just has to do with what TV viewers are seemingly drawn to at this point in time Certain shows just click better Unfortunately for the rest of the market the scale doesnt really help as much when it comes to advertisers needs For them they are going to buy time based on what shows they think are going to be watched live in the moment Yet with the new emphasis on stacking rights these learnings do start to apply to a larger field Also what this does for Netflixs rivals is help them pinpoint more about the viewing habits of its base and which programs seem to resonate more with which personality As a result they can then develop similar programming rosters that could draw eyeballs back to their network and THAT becomes valuable for advertisers While some of those results should be obvious look at a show like Bojack Horseman How many people guessed that was more binged than House of Cards Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this
