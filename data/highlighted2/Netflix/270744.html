Star Wars movie has set an opening weekend box office record for the US of an estimated million Between merchandising and other sources the movie could generate billion in revenue If there were any doubts about the billion purchase of Lucasfilm by the Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS the opening of Star Wars The Force Awakens is erasing them Estimated worldwide box office for opening weekend is million just slightly below Jurassic World Can a single film move the needle for a sprawling media conglomerate like Disney Yeah it really can More importantly the film marks the start of a new and immensely popular movie franchise along the lines of Marvels Avengers another Disney property Disneys corporate structure is designed to extract maximum value from hits such as The Force Awakens TFA In the table below I summarize Disneys operating segments as well as revenue and operating income from Disneys fiscal ended in September K A movie that grosses around billion definitely moves the needle for Disney but ticket sales are just the beginning As Goldman Sachs points out the movie could result in a total of billion in revenue from merchandise video games and home entertainment sales Disney also has the potential to extract further revenue from TV series as it did with Agents of SHIELD and the Avengers In August Disney announced that it will be constructing a Star Warsthemed land at Disneyland in California So virtually every operating segment will get a piece of the new Star Wars pie There is even some talk of TFA taking the record for alltime global box office which is now held by Avatar at billion Given that TFAs opening didnt include China in which it is set to open January TFA taking the record is now considered a distinct possibility Most importantly a new Star Wars series will follow the Avengers and other series such as X Men pattern of building a fictional world consisting of different compelling characters and plot branches This is far removed from the old Hollywood approach of simply recycling plots actors props and sets in an unimaginative sequel that losses audience interest but maximizes near term profit As George Lucas showed with Star Wars episodes a film series can be built that spans generations both in terms of audience and in terms of characters The success of TFA indicates that this approach will be very productive for future Star Wars products including feature films TV series video games etc Lately mostly in conjunction with my coverage of Apple NASDAQ AAPL Ive encountered negative analyst sentiment regarding the socalled hitdriven studio model Whether the analogy between Apple and a movie studio is really valid is an interesting question for another article Clearly Disney is hitdriven Is that a bad thing I would claim not Disney like many other media companies is highly diversified and this tends to mitigate the impact of poor performing movies or TV series There are always flops as well as hits Everyone in the business has learned to take this in stride Successful media companies such as Disney have learned to extract maximum profit from hits while minimizing the damage from flops Disney has all the bases covered in this regard Disney has been able to grow consistently over the past couple of years Revenue grew yy by in fiscal and in fiscal Operating income grew by yy in fiscal and yy in If theres a problem with Disney its one that many US media companies share and thats its positioning in old media infrastructure In Disneys case that is its ownership of ABC TV stations As Ive pointed out many times main stream TV broadcasting and cable will eventually be overtaken by Internet content delivery Disneys attitude towards Internet content delivery seems more enlightened than most of its media peers It has an interest in Hulu It distributes free ABC TV apps that allow mobile device users to view ABC TV content without need for a cable subscription Disney distributes to and derives significant revenue from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Clearly Disney sees the future and is positioning the company to maximize benefit from it In what will probably turn out to have been incredibly bad timing BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield did downgrade Disney to sell on the basis of ESPN having purchased get this too much sports content for too high a price He claimed that TFA would have to gross more than billion in worldwide box office revenue That now appears to be almost a done deal Nice try Rich The downgrade and news that the EU was opening an antitrust investigation into Disney sent shares lower EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager appears to have decided that US multinationals are to blame for Europes economic malaise Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM and Apple have recently been targeted The EU investigation involving Disney is of arrangements between content providers including NBC Universal part of Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA CMCSK and Sky UK The European Commission is alleging that Sky UK and the studios are blocking access to the studios content outside of the UK This is supposedly anticompetitive since it hinders cross border trade Although there is the potential for large fines probably the matter will be settled by consent decree Many European companies and multinationals are still catching up with the newly vigorous enforcement policies of Commissioner Vestager All told I dont see the BTIG downgrade or the EU investigation as reasons to sell Disney On the contrary Disney has an enormously profitable
