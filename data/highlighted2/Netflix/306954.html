class='textDiv'>Gaiam Yes Theres Value And Yes It Can Be Measured Gaiam Inc NASDAQGAIA Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long GAIA MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article A month ago Gaiam went into the toohard pile for me After some passive reflection and a decline in the stock since I have a very different narrative to construct now Yes there are problems and risks with the SOTP valuation approach but it is the only appropriate way to look at Gaiam and it highlights attractive value About a month ago I revisited Gaiam NASDAQ GAIA after reading a good article on the stock on SA and seeing the stock had declined or so from when Id looked at it a year earlier Originally I was a bit uncomfortable with my downside I felt some of the valuation assumptions were kind of arbitrary and I just couldnt get comfortable I began writing an article summarizing the bull case and then introducing some doubts to the thesis after which I planned to conclude that the stock was not truly a conviction buy yet I didnt finish writing the article because I was concerned I didnt have something worth publishing and was feeling diminishing return on time in the research effort Since then Ive passively given it more thought and the stock has declined another As a result Im now much more bullish As such this will be a bullish article but I am also including some of what I had a month ago to show the change in sentiment and an example of how irrational I am It also offers a more balanced perspective and I think some of the old points are very valid Like most human beings I tend to think in narratives Once you learn the investing lingo like value trap sumoftheparts economies of scale etc and if youre reasonably intelligent as I sometimes think I am you can make a decent argument for most any stock as a buy or sell That framenarrativeargumentwhatever you want to call it doesnt mean its actually a good or bad idea It just means youre good at making yourself and others think it is Theres a big difference So this article will lay out a bull case for Gaiam but also serve as a little case study in the psychological flaws of an investor Who knows maybe I was right a month ago and wrong now A month ago when I was looking at Gaiam and trying to figure out how to value it I wrote Ive learned to become skeptical of SOTP stories and catalysts though They are often too good to be true The SOTP story at Gaiam has been welldocumented for years Investors have also been wrong about the catalysts before I remember looking at Gaiam in late when they were just beginning to talk about the Gaiam TV spinoff Investors assumed it would occur early in and serve as a catalyst The company did file a Form in early February to initiate the process but several amended filings later and no guaranteed board approval yet the catalyst has not yet played out For some reason the SOTP approach also seems to encourage aggressive valuation level assumptions maybe because comp analyses are often used and these tend to be aggressive In this case I think its very dangerous to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a comp because that assumes that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is fairly valued NFLX trades at x EVS and almost ksubscriber Ive not done any research on it and dont feel fit saying whether its valuation is fair or not but I think the numbers mentioned above are at least enough to cast some doubt on it Im not saying that there isnt value in GAIA Im just saying that the story is not as tight as it may initially seem I realize now that the reason I struggled with valuing Gaiam a month ago is that it cant be valued the way I normally do it I normally like to load years of financials into an excel template I have run a macro to format it pretty generate a bunch of averages etc and then plug numbers into a table I have that is driven by EBIT multiples In hindsight it should have been obvious to me that I couldnt take that approach with Gaiam First the year financials are not nearly as meaningful as they normally would be because Gaiam has had a ton of investments and divestments even just over the last few years One that comes to mind is Real Goods Solar an asset entirely unrelated to Gaiam Brands and Gaiam TV which is now gone Gaiam TV has only been an initiative of the company over the past few years The year financials dont really reflect the past performance of the current assets and they definitely dont reflect the prospective performance of either of these assets Gaiam Brands is growing double digits and beginning to show its op margin potential given its historic gross margins and increasing scale Gaiam TV is growing and management has said straight out in recent calls that they could make it grow yy if they wanted to its just a matter of subscriber acquisition spend and lifetime value No these businesses need to be approached differently Ive decided to get away from the line items and just offer a little narrative explaining what I am valuing all the value components at and why There is still some arbitrariness in here and the risks of using SOTP still apply but Im more comfortable with it now because a conservative SOTP with Gaiam is a much better approach than pigeonholing it into an inappropriate alternative model x revenue for Gaiam TV is very arbitrary Ive always thought revenue multiples are However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>trades at revenue and enterprise value of almost B Gaiam TV is profitable even with tremendous subscriber acquisition spend that is expensed and of its titles are exclusive This is a valuable asset and I do think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>another media company or someone interested in the demographic like Lululemon NASDAQ LULU would be more than willing to pay x for the whole thing This is not just me using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a comp and saying Gaiam TV could be worth that If you think about what a strategic buyer would pay for all of Gaiam TV I think revenue is fairly conservative mostly exclusive titles for seems like a reasonable price to a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which has blockbuster movies that have boxofficed hundreds of millions of revenue though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has only paid a small fraction of that In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>agreed to pay around mm per year to license Disney NYSE DIS content That Disney content is obviously far more valuable than what Gaiam TV has but its not an applestoapples comparison because thats a mm annual payment whereas mm for Gaiam TV would be a onetime payment for outright ownership The other thing about the x revenue is that thats not reflecting full monetization This service has only been out for a few years and its doubtful that its anywhere close to reaching its potential Even years from now thats likely to still be the case x T revenue could very easily work out to x T revenue There is a lot of danger to thinking too much about valuation this way because at the end of the day its about the profit potential of Gaiam TV not revenue but on balance I do think x revenue is reasonable Its not worth a techbubble valuation but its not worth nothing either Gaiam Brands is an asset Im really impressed with This may be one of the market leaders in consumer products focused on the yoga spiritual demographic next to Lululemon at least Nike NYSE NKE and Under Armour NYSE UA probably have big market share but they are not focused exclusively on this demographic and they are probably not perceived as being as genuine and truetoroots as Gaiam is Anyone interested in Gaiam must must must read up on the companys chairman Jirka Rysavy Hes as genuine as it gets when it comes to reaching that demographic For a mm company its surprising to me that some people in my family who are by no means hardcore yogis own and embrace Gaiam DVDs blocks mats etc On Amazon of the companys products are in the Top Best Sellers list for the Yoga Equipment category Gaiam Brands has a ton of doors in chains like Target NYSE TGT and Kohls NYSE KSS Growth and margin expansion are not pipe dreams It grew revenue last quarter and YTD In my analysis Im only assuming and respectively The overall company has had gross margins for years and while I think the longterm numbers are generally not representative I do think Brands has consistently done gross margin Typical SGA for a consumer products company at scale is as much as so the Brands should be capable of at scale or as a division of a bigger company like LULU As a standalone now with all of Gaiams heavy corporate overheard included it is doing margins and that improved to in Q I think is very feasible in a few years even as a standalone and could prove conservative if its bought which I think is possible To a large consumer products company looking to penetrate the yogaspiritual demographic Gaiam Brands must look pretty attractive Previously I mentioned the pending spinoff of Gaiam TV but I only dedicated one sentence to it This is actually a big deal The way I see it now this is a catalyst regardless and a heads I win tails I dont lose much situation regarding the various outcomes Shareholders have been waiting patiently perhaps impatiently based on the recent stock move for over a year for the spinoff Apparently the spinoff may not ultimately be approved by the Board It seems like what the company is trying to do is sell Gaiam TV Its worth much more to a holder than in the public market as a standalone With only mm of runrate revenue right now public company costs would be of revenue and it wouldnt have the resources to grow at the rates it wants to As a small piece of a big buyer that story changes entirely A sale would fetch a good price and the cash would be here and now rather than a few years from now Thats the optimal outcome but its probably not very likely at this point The other outcomes are that Gaiam keeps it and cancels the spinoff which is a good outcome and what I assume in my valuation The worst outcome is them actually doing the spinoff but while this would be structurally unattractive longterm for the reasons I mentioned above it could trade at a frothy multiple in the public market as a standalone temporarily because of comps like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in this market environment Readers should note that the way Im framing Gaiam is as it is now and how I expect it to be in the next few years that is profitable but this business has a history of large losses changes in strategy and wasteful capital allocation For a long time the company seemed to have a demographic and vision but not a monetizable business strategy and certainly not one they stuck to Theres always the chance the strategy changes again the operations are neglected and revert to losses capital allocation does more damage etc It is certainly worth doing a survey of this companys history and taking that into consideration To some extent the argument that Gaiam has been a value trap dead money before is unfair because various factors have changed that make the stock more attractive here For one the companys businesses havent both been growing at greater than in the past The company hasnt always been so focused The company had forays into solar nontheatrical video production real estate the office building in Boulder etc With the spinoff and expected sale of the building we get something thats been a longtime coming for Gaiam two focused pureplay businesses Whatever happens it doesnt make sense for Gaiam to trade lower and lower as we get closer to closure regarding the spinoff and as business performance in both segments improves dramatically I still have my doubts what if they do something really stupid on the capital allocation front It wouldnt be the first time That combined with Gaiam TV actually being spun off and not perceived well by the market could still create a bad outcome but Im more comfortable now with my way of assessing reasonable outcomes here and I think they look pretty good in terms of expected returns and downside risk With the recent decline Gaiam is a at a multiyear low and I think now is a good opportunity to take a small position and begin following it more intensely </div></body></html>
