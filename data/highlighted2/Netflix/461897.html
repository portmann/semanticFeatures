after management reported that sales more or less matched expectations but that earnings easily surpassed forecasts The pessimism has come from a low subscriber add count which is causing investors to fear that its growth prospects may not be that great moving forward I believe that all in all this is true of its domestic operations but its international operations still have a great deal of potential This is part of Netflixs transition away from growth but as its international segment outpaces its domestic business investors should be prepared for volatility Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX fell as much as after the market closed on July th in response to news that its subscriber count fell far short of managements own forecasts earlier this year As a result of this the firms market capitalization plummeted as much as billion bringing the firms total market value down from billion to billion In what follows I want to give my own thoughts on what happened and what this means for investors and the business as a whole moving forward The quarterly performance for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>actually wasnt that bad Management reported sales during the quarter of about billion rounding up which matched analysts expectations and was up from the prior years quarter of billion Meanwhile the companys bottom line blew forecasts out of the water While analysts had been forecasting earnings for the quarter of per share down from the prior years second quarter when earnings totaled per share the firms bottom line actually came out to Even after adjusting for interest and other income which was up materially from last year and accounting for taxes accordingly the business still generate pershare income of Based solely on this you would think that shares of the enterprise should be soaring not falling like a rock However for many investors who find <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>appealing the most important thing is not profits but rather how large the company can grow and how quickly it can accomplish this growth This is due to the hope that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can achieve the largest market share possible it will have a nearmonopoly and should have in theory the potential to dictate terms for customers and business partners in any way that it sees fit It is because of this mindset that shares fell You see while management did pretty well on sales and phenomenal earnings subscriber growth was lackluster at best In its Domestic Streaming segment only subscribers were added though were added as paying customers The fell short of the estimate given by management earlier this year Internationally the company added just million subscribers million paid a miss from the million previously forecasted Because this growth is now lower than people had hoped the timeline to that nearmonopoly that growth investors want just got longer which means it is all the less appealing No company can grow at a fast pace forever At some point all companies achieve or come close to achieving market saturation and its difficult to move too far out of your core competencies though certainly not impossible in order to grab hold of growth potential elsewhere My own theory is that to some degree that is coming to pass with their Domestic Streaming business It is true that churn due to customers leaving after having prices increase is attributable to much of the shortfall this past quarter and its probable that next quarters growth in this segment will be larger than we saw this quarter but when you look at the sheer number of people in the US growth cant go on for much longer You see as of right now there are around million people in the US and only million of them are paying for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>each month This comes out to about of the US population However we also need to consider that individuals within a household are likely to share the service and although there may be some cases where people in the same household have separate subscriptions this is likely the minority With an average household size in this country of people if we make the assumption that the max on average number of subscribers per home equals one and if we are generous and assume that people dont share their passwords I know plenty of people who do the largest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could grow here would be to million customers So instead of having people out of every people in the country paying for the service they are actually at or out of every As I already mentioned this does not factor in sharing and it also does not factor in the fact that some people will never pay for the service either because they are elderly and not into technology because they are cannot afford it because they have alternative means of watching content or one of any other number of reasons people can come up with I do think that while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue to grow modestly in the US for a while its International Streaming segment has a great deal of potential Compared to the same quarter last year the segments paid membership count is up and at only million people is still very small compared to the rest of the population of the world The problem here though is that its terribly unprofitable During the second quarter the segment generated a contribution loss of compared to a gain of in the Domestic Streaming segment The important thing though is that this represents a meaningful improvement over the same quarter a year earlier when the loss was a whopping Although the cost of sales of the service dropped from to during this period it was the marketing expense that really helped which plummeted from of sales to At this time I have no plans to buy shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>because I want to see earnings increase more andor the share price fall more than it already has However I am of the firm opinion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is in the middle of an exciting transition that will take it from being a growthoriented enterprise into being focused on two areas margin expansion in the US and fast growth everywhere else On the bottom line it may be difficult to achieve this margin expansion in the short run but it will likely happen at some point However I do suspect that the road for the business will be extremely bumpy moving forward This is because as the firms International Streaming segment which already makes up of sales compared to of sales last year eventually overtakes its Domestic Streaming segment the low but improving margins outside of the US will hurt overall performance At this moment its clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is transitioning and this is really the first major step on its road to maturity At some point in the future I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will likely be far larger than it is today but most of that will come from the fastgrowing poor margin overseas sales During this time investors should not be surprised to see the companys profits behave erratically and this will almost certainly cause unwelcomed volatility for many of its shareholders On the other hand for those of us monitoring this transition and waiting for the right opportunity to buy this is a very welcomed sight and when we do buy it means that the risk associated with the business will likely be lower than it is today Disclosure Iwe have no positions in
