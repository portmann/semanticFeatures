They're wrong.This is about lowering churn, not competing directly in the streaming video market.That doesn't mean Amazon isn't working at making it an excellent service.Because it is.What it means is the priority isn't to become the top video streaming company in the world.The goal is to become the top digital retailer in the world.Streaming video is a means to that end.Since Wal-Mart will have to come up with its own perks to attract and maintain subscribers, and since it's taking a page directly out of Amazon's playbook, it'll be interesting to see if it includes a streaming service as part of the subscription price, in a similar way Amazon has.Another feature that keeps consumers from abandoning Prime is its cloud photo storage service, which allows for an unlimited number of photos to be saved there.There is also the free two-day shipping feature which is very popular with subscribers.In this regard from the introduction of Shipping Pass, Amazon has Wal-Mart beat, as at this time it only offers free three-day shipping.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As mentioned about the threat that could come from the next recession, Amazon will have to continue to add value to Prime to the point it'll be hard for consumers to leave it. (Uncertainty) </span>Battle for subscribers already underway It didn't take long for Bezos to respond to the new competition, as he announced there will be a gigantic sales event on July 15 which will be only available to members of Prime.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The strategy is to circumvent Wal-Mart's new service by getting press coverage and further exposure of Prime to the general public. (Uncertainty) </span>The end result is Amazon is using the new competitive environment to generate further interest and win new subscribers to the service.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>That could also lower interest in Wal-Mart's still relatively unknown Shipping Pass, which could lower the interest in signing up for it. (Uncertainty) </span>WMT has responded to "Prime Day" with its own sales initiative, where it has the marketing pitch it will include ""more deals than Black Friday."Even though Amazon got the first strike in, Wal-Mart is launching its sale the day after Amazon's, offering over 2,000 discounts through its online channels.Also, to be more competitive, WMT decided to change its initial free shipping offer from orders of $50 to orders of $35.To attract a large number of potential subscribers, Wal-Mart will offer the sale over a period of 90 days.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I have no doubt Amazon won't just sit there and let Wal-Mart do that without further responses. (Uncertainty) </span>This has the potential to be a serious threat to Amazon, in light of the fact Amazon Prime is the way it decided to move toward being sustainably profitable.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Amazon has online sales of approximately 6 times the $12.2 billion Wal-Mart has, but that could change quickly if Wal-Mart can do this right. (Uncertainty) </span>As already mentioned, the big challenge will be when the next recession comes, as consumers are socialized into gravitating toward Wal-Mart to stretch their dollars during tough economic times.<span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>With its added value at this time and under these economic conditions, I would be surprised to see AMZN's subscriber base abandon Prime and try out Wal-Mart instead. (Surprise) </span>How WMT adds value going forward is a key to the competitive level it decides to compete at.There is also the added costs of adding value that must be considered, and as Amazon already found out, it had to boost its Prime subscription fee in order to cover rising shipping costs.Wal-Mart will eventually be faced with similar challenges.What remains to be seen is if the online retail subscription market grows from all of this, or Amazon and Wal-Mart fight over mostly the same consumers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It appears there are many millions of consumers to compete over that aren't part of Prime at this time, and it will force a powerful response from both companies in order to attract them. (Uncertainty) </span>The cost to do so is what is of concern to me for both companies, and that is already going to put pressure on margin, based upon the decisions of both to offer major discounts in the early stages of the battle.On Wal-Mart's part, the company knows this is the future of retail, and as younger people age, the existing customer base that prefers to shop at the physical store will shrink, which means it must find a way to get ahead of that before it crushes the company.For Amazon, this is really the first time since it become the online retail market leader that it faced this level of threat from a company large enough to do some serious damage.It has put it on the defensive in the segment of the company that is being counted on to generate consistent earnings.How it responds will dictate the future of the company.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe Prime is that critical to it at this point in time.
