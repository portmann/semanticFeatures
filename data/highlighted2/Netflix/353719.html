Seeking Alpha Three key indicators point to the logical conclusion that there is a subtle shift in Netflixs approach to home as well as international markets Video streaming and video advertising are both showing strong growth which means YouTube excluding Red and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can both grab market share in their respective segments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is one of those companies that has given adaptability a new definition After starting out as a DVD rental company they swiftly moved into a video streaming model that boasted a library of thousands of movies while licensing content from third parties From there they started gradually building their own content Now even the movie library seems to be shrinking as fast as an arctic glacier in the Bahamas And all this has happened as the company kept expanding its footprint all over the world and although I do have my reservations with respect to how they are going to bring localized content suitable to the different cultures and demographics spread all over the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>seems to be on a mission to keep improving and experimenting with all their might In this article I cover some subtle trends that have developed over the last few years These are clear signs that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is arresting control over its home market in brilliant ways They are also validations that the company will be able to replicate in measure this same success in overseas markets Essentially Ive broken them down into three indicators each of which shows one facet of what is happening with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>According to Deloittes th Digital Democracy Survey of more than US consumers of respondents binge watch an average of five episodes in one sitting with of millennials doing so on a weekly basis Viewers are also beginning to fully embrace streaming video with of Americans subscribing to at least one streaming video service and young millennials ages to consuming more online video content than live television This is just a small random sample but it is representative of the average video streamer in the United States In that respect the insight gained from this survey is priceless because it shows several things First video streaming is on the rise compared to televised content Second nearly half the population is on at least one streaming subscription service Third the intrusiveness of video advertising is eliminated with a streaming service at a premium of course but the option is there Fourth and probably the most important one is that the Business Insider survey shows that of the respondents are already streaming YouTube videos and in my opinion each one of them is a potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>customer The Deloitte survey also reveals some interesting statistics on video advertising Video ads are in fact one of the fastest growing segments in the online ads space Yet Deloitte shows that more than of Americans use some sort of ad blocking software From the survey itself it was seen that of respondents actually preferred streaming services because they werent bothered by ads Obviously the growth in video ads isnt going to respond negatively to streaming services Most bottomend paid streaming options retain video ad content and even YouTube Red excludes paid content from the adfree experience it provides Red subscribers The point Im making is that YouTube is the king of adsupported streaming content while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>dominates paid streaming Both segments are growing equally fast and theres room for both these players to grow at a healthy pace If this trend continues together they can push everyone else into the fringes and have the lions share of their respective segments I specifically note this because it would seem that video advertising was lower down the food chain than premium video content and hence would be affected by premium adfree streaming which is not necessarily the case Indicator Shrinking Licensed Content Vs Growing Original Content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not interested in just licensing content anymore They are after original programming or at the very least they want a global license Its all or nothing This transition has been happening slowly and so much behind the scenes that its easy to miss it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>used their movie library as a bait to get customers in and once they were growing by sizable numbers the company used the money to create original content something that they own forever Whats happening now is that it seems they want to keep growing original content and push everything else down But I dont think theyre going to go the distance with this First of all people want to see popular content at leisure after it has aired for the first time on TV Many would pay a premium just for that and thats what they did when paid streaming first became available They want to watch episodes they missed when they first went live on demand and they want it on any device of their choosing So what are they doing by shrinking their movie library and focusing on original content I think theyre posturing as much as they are pursuing a relatively lowrisk strategy to outwit major production houses When Comcast essentially pulled the rug out from under them by gaining rights to the first season of House of Cards Comcast was sending them the message Dont mess with us This is Netflixs answer to that in my opinion They want to send back an equally clear message that they can run their service primarily through the power of original content and this time theyre not stopping at regional or limited rights The public reason theyre giving is that original content gives them more value dollar for dollar but that doesnt explain why they would give up pursuing rights to thousands of movies so quickly In this article from Varietycom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos says this Thats a clear indication that theyre not willing to bow down to the whims of big production houses any more They either want global licensing or theyre willing to walk away from the deal The statistics are simple and remarkable in January of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offered its USbased users a selection of movies and TV shows for a total of titles As of March they offer just movies and TV shows titles in total Thats fewer titles In other words Netflixs catalog has shrunk in less than two and a half years Indicator Downstream Data Points to Netflixs Strength If I hadnt seen the data for myself I would not have believed it After all I spend a lot of time on YouTube and I know how much time my son spends as well and hes all of years old Most of us do that But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>seems to be running away with downstream traffic in North America downstream traffic in internet terms refers to people streaming content down to their devices as opposed to uploading content YouTube has far more users than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>so how could this be The only explanation possible is viewing time YouTube has a huge number of visitors that spend maybe a few minutes to an hour a day watching short videos <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on the other hand has a smaller number of people often watching as the survey indicated up to episodes at a time And if theyre watching daily episodes of several series it adds up Of the three indicators I mentioned I believe this is the crucial one that shows how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is growing engagement in a market that is getting saturated by the quarter In Netflixs Growing International Losses I wrote in detail about how their stock price is closely related to quarterly subscriber growth rate As growth rate slows they need more engagement from their mature markets And this is exactly whats happening right now Engagement is growing the industry is growing and viewer habits are aligned in their favor Investorspeak The Prognosis Remains The Same In the previous article that I linked above I spoke about the challenges they will have to face with localized content for various markets Their decision to strongly focus on original content or global licensing of third party content is bound to exacerbate this problem For now theyve found a stopgap measure that will help popularize their service in the countries they operate in dubbed content Their marquee original Daredevil aired simultaneously in all those countries this past week and may signal a shift in the way they handle international markets initially That however will be like trying to convert everyone across the world to the same religion but allow them to worship in their own language I dont see that as a viable longterm hook for keeping people signed up Theyre going to want truly local content popular series that air on domestic cable networks local language movies and so on They need this if they want to achieve anything more than superficial penetration in many markets The one thing thats definitely going for them is their recommendation algorithm It sorts out garbage data that most would consider highly relevant like geography for example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>believes that people are different but not in ways that we would normally think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has accurately identified that unifying thread and this will help them secure their positions in an international market that looks like a United Nations member headcount For now this is what they seem to be doing Strengthen their home market with original content over piecemeal licensed content Secure their initial international subscribers with globally available English content also dubbed for the local audience Replicate home market success with original or licensed local language content in one or a few regions at a time Be that as it may unless that filters down to the bottom line it doesnt count not even when accompanied by such aggressive top line and subscriber growth And thats not something were seeing yet Whats the impact of that on stock price As I mentioned in my previous article the best time to get in on NFLX is when you see soft numbers on subscriber growth which is bound to happen as they get closer to US saturation You can wait until their PS ratio drops to a more acceptable level but with a long runway for international subscriber growth with no signs of flagging you may need to wait a while I invite
