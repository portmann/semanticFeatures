Alpha Netflixs increased cost of international expansion has resulted in a substantial decline in earnings growth yet the companys stock price has risen dramatically Analysts are confident about the companys ability to achieve growth by tapping into international markets yet the growth for subscribers projected is not higher than past growth experienced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is extremely overvalued and a risky portfolio holding I am bearish on most US listed equity anyway but found this to be a stronger case worth noting A valuebased investment approach to USlisted equities will become increasingly relevant given the current market volatility and economic uncertainty ahead An examination of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX clearly reveals that now is a strategic time to sell as the days of high growth and low valuation are over Netflixs PE is substantially higher than average and it has experienced a very recent decline in earnings growth The true success story was between and while its current situation warrants a correction in its stock price A bullish view of the companys potential and prestige should be balanced with the rational recognition that the stocks rise is no longer justifiable and a correction is befitting The international growth that is projected throughout is impressive but nothing new from what the company has experienced in the past As examined later in this article the growth in earnings between and was substantial which certainly justifies the rise in stock price However at its current price and valuation a reconciliation is befitting Net Revenue growth has been consistent since and was during The true success story regarding earnings growth took place between and at which point it is safe to say that the sharp ascent of the companys stock price was befitting Yet the most substantial increase in its stock price took place between and at which point growth had slowed On top of this earnings declined substantially during Q While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has been able to continue achieving constant growth through the current expansion is being spearheaded by international growth as this accounted for of the companys growth during the nd quarter of The high cost of international expansion negatively impacted the companys bottom line as its earnings dropped by over Despite the drop in earnings the company was able to add million subscribers during the nd quarter of which accounts for around of its current subscribers Its net revenue increase of can also be considered a positive driver While its international expansion has been impressive and resulted in high revenue growth it is not strong enough to justify the companys high valuation Moreover the threat to the companys earnings has been substantial and the process of reconciliation of the companys earnings will be timely As domestic subscribers still account for a substantial percentage of the companys subscribers it is safe to say that international expansion needs to be more aggressive to justify the companys high valuation and recent decline in earnings The companys PE has consistently been rising since mainly resulting from the high costs of international expansion which resulted in recent decrease in earnings For the past years the companys PE has been between and Other financial statistics provide further areas of concern in addition the companys high valuation and decrease in earnings Management Effectiveness ROA and ROE were not very impressive at and respectively Q The stocks price increased by while earnings declined by A continued rise of the stocks price and perpetual high valuation may be understandable in light of the anticipated international growth although the following factors should be noted to offset an overly optimistic view of the companys growth While international growth was extensive and on track to increase it should be noted that this only resulted in the companys net revenue increasing by Meanwhile the companys stock price has increased nearly triple this amount Nomura Analyst Anthony DiClemente projected that the company would be able to grow to have million subscribers Based on this projection the company would be able to increase subscribers by reflecting growth of approximately per annum until To put this growth into context we can compare it to the growth in subscribers achieved before Q If growth goes as projected it will still be lower than the average growth experienced in previous years This is a red flag given the companys current high valuation The company may be good value based on its ability to tap into new international markets but its growth will not be strong enough to justify its historically higher valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does have good things coming ahead of it but a reconciliation in its price is befitting Its current PE can not be justified Netflixs stock price is incredibly overvalued Its plans for international expansion are impressive but do not represent a substantial increase from its past growth The high cost of international expansion has resulted in a rapid decrease in earnings yet the stocks price still remains high It is not at a point where it would be a wise endeavor to preposition oneself to profit from the international growth that is ahead If you are optimistic about this growth and are able to justify investing in companies with extremely high valuation then it would be best to wait for lower valuation The companys future outlook is good but seems to be sensationalized As financial experts have been saying that stocks in the United States could fall by its safe to say that investors should be rational and search for good value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a clear case of a company that could very well be victim to this fall
