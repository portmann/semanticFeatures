style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a category dominator With not even a close second Dish Networks Q results featured an subscriber loss and provide another data point that linear TV is a declining industry The only way for PayTV to grow is to raise ARPU which further validates the value proposition for OTT players The Linear TV to OTT transition will be messy incumbent PayTV operators seem like avoids given the potential disruption over the next to years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX bears should heed the words of Charlie Ergen from Dish Networks NASDAQ DISH Q conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is most powerful content aggregator in the world today And theres nobody thats even close I dont think from second point of view I dont think theres anything they couldnt buy that they wanted today on original content for example They pay a fixed price If they go buy something from Discovery they pay fixed price for it And as their subs grow their cost per customer goes down So when we buy something from Discovery we pay a variable costs and we pay the same for each customer No one else is even close to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Not Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Not Hulu Not Sling TV And Charlie Ergen knows a thing or two about the TV business Here is the key content aggregation distribution and production is a scale game driven by subscriber growth and the disintermediation of content and traditional content distribution And there is no one better at driving subscriber growth than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>given it has an unbeatable streetlevel value proposition month for a growing original content library and good enough free agent third party content to justify the subscription fee Equity value of course is driven by future cash flows and life time customer value of subscribers For Dish linear TV represents a mature to declining business subscribers were down in Q with high subscriber acquisition costs up to per sub Yes they will grow their OTT service Sling TV from three sources cordnevers cord cutters and PayTV supplementers but the PayTV business will likely face strong headwinds going forward If it is uneconomical for Dish to acquire subscribers at less than a ARPU x higher than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>ARPU that is a tough sell for consumers who are actively seeking to lower their content consumption costs So how does Dish sustainably grow its PayTV business from the million subscriber base I dont think it can To grow sales with a declining subscriber base the only option is to increase the price ARPU was in Q up from in Q But increasing the price for PayTV will only make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and OTT players more attractive and will likely accelerate cordcutting In my view this looks like more evidence of a pernicious cycle for PayTV operators as consumer behavior shifts to lower price OTT options creating a virtuous cycle for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>While there is likely a lot of latent value in Dishs spectrum recent regulatory uncertainty around the FCC rejecting a billion discount in a recent AWS auction casts more doubt around the competitive environment in which Dish operates Im not smart enough to figure it out so Dish is an avoid not a short for me But I am fairly certain and I think Mr Ergen is too that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the category dominator in the content business and has a long runway of growth ahead of it looking out over the next years Source Dishs Charlie Ergen Gives A Nod To <span
