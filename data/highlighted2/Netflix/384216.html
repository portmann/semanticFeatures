in growth will have shattering effects on the share price The valuation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NFLX is a house of cards a small shake in expected growth could bring it down Will Netflixs stock tumble like a house of cards or will it win in the game of streaming Episode will demonstrate how you can justify the current stock price However this valuation is just as stable as a house of cards Episode will look at competitors pricing in the game of streaming and episode will sum it all up Episode An intent to justify valuation Figure shows a clear linear tendency in revenue as well as subscriber growth the green and blue lines show these trends and the narrowing indicates that revenue per subscriber is falling The following two figures kind of speak for themselves so Ill limit my commentary However the basis of my later estimates is that the growth in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>revenue and paid subscriptions have been incredibly steady Later I use these trend lines to extrapolate Netflixs revenue into the future and provide an estimated net profit margin and come up with a future PE Figure shows that the revenue per paid membership has been steadily falling over the last four years which isnt very positive obviously So the next table shows the extrapolated quarterly revenues into the future the trend is still that the revenue per subscriber will fall This extrapolation is obviously error prone but as I will demonstrate I believe that the current valuation is based on similar extrapolations I do believe however that this extrapolation is a very optimistic scenario because I imagine growth will begin to stagnate before Table basically shows a continuation of the quarterly linear trends that figure s trend lines provided Table illustrates that with a net profit margin the future fiveyear PE at current market cap is around and around for the year future PE Buying a company that at current market cap MIGHT have a PE around in years seems quite speculative to me The point of this exercise was to show how I believe the market values <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>right now This way of looking at the company extrapolating revenue and subscriber growth and then adding some estimated net profit margin is quite speculative and slight changes in todays growth metrics will have a compounding effect in the future This explains why only slightly disappointing or encouraging changes in growth numbers can make the stock fall or rise with doubledigit percentages which it has done many a times after quarterly announcements So many unknowns are built in the shares relatively high price tag right now The questions we dont know the answers to are What is the limit to the number of subscribers million million billion What will the net profit margin be in the future Will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>be able rise the subscription price because of unique blockbuster content Can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>somehow price discriminate for instance by charging more for K content or according to geographical location I do not pretend to know the answers to these questions but I do know that wherever the limits to growth margins and pricing will be key to providing a real value estimate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>In my earlier estimate I arrived at over million paid subscriptions in years from a strictly linear approach but who knows if it cant go to million or higher or maybe it will start stagnating within five years and top out around million I would love to hear from the readers any good arguments one way or the other That being said I can shed some light on pricing as the monthly price tags from competitors are readily available Episode <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and the other streaming services So table shows the monthly subscription cost for other video streaming services which is between zero and With Fox Play you have already paid for it through your cable or satellite TV provider and in the case of YouTube you pay through watching ads The point is that pricing power seems limited even though each of these providers has unique content It seems like is what people are willing to pay for unique adfree quality content With many providers already in the market it seems unlikely to me that this will change in the future unless we see serious consolidation to the point where we get a mono or duopoly in the content and streaming business Some people argue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be able to raise prices significantly in the future but competitors current prices seem to indicate otherwise HBO NYSE TWX has great content especially Game of Thrones which airs first episode of the new season this Sunday Fox NASDAQ FOXA has hit shows like The Walking Dead Black Sails and Homeland <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has House of Cards and Orange is the New Black YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has a lot of independent content creators that provide entertainment and educational content Amazon NASDAQ AMZN also is trying to create its own content but Prime should be seen as a broader branding move to make customers stay loyal to its primary business You can easily imagine a situation where customers have several subscriptions I have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>HBO and Fox so it is not necessarily the case that customers will choose one over the other But the key is if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue to produce quality content that will make customers renew their subscription there are no guarantees there I do believe however that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>carries a bit of an advantage currently as it has the best software and apps for most smart TVs something HBO and Fox Play is lagging behind I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a great company but it is very highly priced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>valuation right now is a house of cards since small changes in growth numbers will have the perceived effect of nudging down future earnings significantly The valuation shows a very optimistic bias that will only be valid if current linear extrapolations do come true and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is able to produce superior content for a long time compared to its competitors Raising subscription prices heavily seems like a dangerous game because competitors are setting their prices in the same range Answering or estimating correctly the questions posed in episode is the key to give a correct valuation for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Small changes in the growth outlook will have dramatic consequences for the share price It seems like a stock mostly suited for shortterm speculative plays However consolidation in the streaming business might be a game changer that could increase pricing power Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
