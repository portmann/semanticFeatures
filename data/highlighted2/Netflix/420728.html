gets invented to do a human job And other times it can be a relief because the job was really terrible for any human to do And thats the tactic Facebook is taking with content moderation now getting its AI to identify and quarantine offensive content before any human has to As TechCrunch reports Facebook has recently hit a major milestone in their AI training software now report more offensive photos on the massive global platform than humans do and thats big When the internet was entirely made of text content moderation was one thing Mods could more often than not take the sticks and stones approach and delete or disemvowel nasty vitriol as needed But now were in the multimedia era and content moderation means shifting through piles of truly horrific HD video and images to determine just how horrific they are That means moderating content can be a really awful job Imagine content so bad you actually flag it for someone to remove now imagine having your fulltime job to be staring at all that content eight hours a day Hate speech threats child pornography and animal cruelty add up it takes a toll on any human worker Even writers who only have to moderate comments to their articles as opposed to a whole site like Facebook can get badly burned out by the constant swarm of images So Enter the AI Using tech to filter is nothing new but its a lot easier for a machine to identify a character string that spells a naughty word than it is to correctly identify the contents of an image or video At least it has been Facebook though has access to a lot of data A LOT of data And they can use all that data and all their computing power to make their software smarter So they are In fact AI is the major cornerstone of Facebooks entire current tenyear plan Facebooks AI Facebooks Director of Engineering for Applied Machine Learning Joaquin Candela explained to TechCrunch is doing everything from audiocaptioning images for visually impaired users to individually ranking items in your news feed for you And now with video hosting and live streaming being major parts of the Facebook experience the AI is getting smarter about video too Facebook wants their AI to be able to automatically tag users in videos through facial recognition the same way they do in still images Along with that theyve built a system for automatically categorizing video by topic so that all the cat videos can present themselves to you on cue Creepy Yeah probably But it does come with a silver lining if youve got a machine that can automatically recognize and categorize content that also means it can flag the really problematic stuff One thing that is interesting is that today we have more offensive photos being reported by AI algorithms than by people Candela told TechCrunch The higher we push that to percent the fewer offensive photos have actually been seen by a human With a platform Facebooks size thats a simply staggering number of images Globally new posts are published every minute thats about million per day and another million comments are left on public pages about billion daily That is in the aggregate a crapton of data You need robots for volume alone and if it spares some human eyes so much the better Another Facebook developer told TechCrunch that the same tech is in use or going to be in use across every Facebook property Instagram already uses it WhatsApp uses parts and theyre working on ways to get more of it into Oculus where terrible content would not just be a thing you see but a thing you experience Theyre also sharing outside of Facebook Developers told TechCrunch that the tech giant has held meetings with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Google Uber Twitter and others to share their AI applications and discuss design details Is it altruistic Sure as much as taking over the world by getting all the competition to use your tools ever is But Facebook says its more than that I personally believe its not a winlose situation its a winwin situation If we improve the state of AI in the world the developer told them we will definitely eventually benefit But I dont see people nickel and diming it Google Calm
