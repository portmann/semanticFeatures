<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>chooses between two methods of amortization straight line and accelerated Neither approach is accurate they have superior models inhouse The purpose of this article is to evaluate the amortization of streaming content assets for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and its impact on earnings I have explained in a prior article the accounting process involved in streaming content assets please review that document for the background data This article evaluates a mundane aspect of accounting and it proposes that management could provide substantially better information on lifecycles of their digital assets as well as a more modern approach for amortizing the assets Streaming content assets and related obligations continue to rise for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>approaching billion at the end of including the obligations which are offbalance sheet In addition the amortization of content is increasing faster than revenues are growing Given that the major component of CGS for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the choice for amortizing content any implicit error in the approach is material to the evaluation of profitsloss The current approach of using accelerated depreciation is a relic of a prior time when computation engines and big data were not available to be used in evaluation and modeling of potential useful lives Historical methods of depreciation are based on wear and tear on physical assets things like bearings wear out engines get dirty tires wear thin etc Digital entertainment assets are vastly different and do not wear out over time rather a digital asset becomes pass as and when the potential universe of consumers have viewed it and it ceases to be viewed in a meaningful way But first a note on the actual process of accounting for streaming content In the K the following is noted The Companys estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment Changes in estimates could have a significant impact on the Companys future results of operations In the third quarter of the Company changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content The effect of this change in estimate was a million decrease in operating income and a million decrease in net income for the year ended December The effect on both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share was a decrease of for the year ended December The key takeaway from the above note is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>maintains a fairly robust record of estimated viewing patterns as they should And yet these details are not consistently applied to the amortization of streaming content assets Management typically chooses between straight line and accelerated depreciation for their content And the above note is most likely due to some shows being placed on accelerated from straight line The percent is applied to the asset each year and the amount flows into profit and loss via amortization So for example a million series of House of Cards would be amortized at million per year under straight line or and million per year under the accelerated method From the above it appears that management has chosen a conservative path by depreciating more of the content in year one than would be followed in a straight line approach Yet given the current mode of binge viewing the approach of only amortizing of the costs in the current year for a newly released series is debatable Lets assume that the useful life of four years is valid but who really knows The accountants in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>have a large database of viewing patterns which can be used to identify the lifecycles of their digital assets And what if an evaluation of viewing patterns suggested a much different deceleration Amortization modeled on total estimated views Lets create a model of potential views for a show taking into account two factors A diffusion model as an estimator of viewing habits The fact that new customers are being added Although the above models are not related to consumption of digital content the hypothesis is that they might prove to be useful to consider as a surrogate for modeling of viewing of content at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The key takeaway is that the first of adoption or consumption happens quite quickly and that the remaining is fairly static With that in mind lets imagine a scenario of a hit show for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which gets viewed by of its customers in year then has a steady stream of views from the original customers over the next three years Lets further assume that of the new customers over the next year view the content and that there are similar small view patterns over the subsequent years Finally lets apply some latency to the fad and assume that in years and only of the new customers view the content and that there are similarly small constant views occur thereafter Source Authors estimate of a diffusionbased model with new customers being added each year Yes there are many assumptions embedded in the above forecast and rest assured that management at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a much more accurate view of these factors One also can rest assured that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management have chosen to not report or utilize such metrics for their amortization It is strange that the new paradigm company is basking in old paradigm models of amortization presumably because it serves their purpose and because the accountants have signed off on the approach In the above example where the content was evaluated based on potential future views the amortization pattern would have been Comparing the three methods the annual rates of depreciation would differ as follows In terms of PL this would imply that NFLX lost money in The impact on reported earnings of a change in amortization expenses from in year to could be as high as billion although it would be offset by a smaller year depreciation as compared to the current approach Without additional disclosures it is not possible to have a definitive answer but the size is such that it could easily swing the company into an operating loss I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
