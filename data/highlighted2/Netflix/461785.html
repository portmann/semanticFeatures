PM Freddie Gray has taken the focus off of Baltimores painful economic plunge that can be laid squarely at the feet of Charm Citys long embrace of antimarket economic policies by Sprott Money Jul AM There is only one mode of legitimate analysis for markets A lot of people seem to have forgotten these principles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Plummets As Growth Story Comes To A Halt Company Says We Are Not Growing As Fast As We Would Lke While NFLX moments ago reported Q EPS of that beat expectations despite missing badly on international streaming adds of just mm Exp MM the reasons the stock is plunging after hours is because it appears that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>growth story is officially over and not just because the company guided far lower on international net additions seeing only million below Wall Streets forecast of MM but because as the Company itself admitted we are growing but not as fast as we would like or have been Disrupting a big market can be bumpy but the opportunity ahead is as big as ever and we continue to improve every aspect of our business It wasnt just the abysmal international guidance NFLX also reported that it expects a paltry net US streaming additions in Q less than half of the streets forecast NETFLIX Q INTL STREAMING NET ADDS M EST M NETFLIX SEES Q INTERNATIONAL STREAMING NET ADDS M EST M NETFLIX SEES Q DOMESTIC NET ADDS M EST K It appears that unscalability of NFLX barriers to entry was a little exagerated As Internet TV rises in popularity so do the SVOD offerings In the US for example CBS All Access Seeso Amazon Prime Video Hulu YouTube Red and many others are all growing Our view however is that we are all growing primarily against linear TV hours and that competition did not contribute materially to our miss in Q First increased competition would show up mostly in soft gross additions rather than churn Second we experienced a similar uptick in churn in early April in Canada where there has been no recent increase in SVOD competition but where ungrandfathering is also underway This is how Reed Hastings justifies the ugly forecast Our global member forecast for Q was m and we came in at m Gross additions were on target but churn ticked up slightly and unexpectedly coincident with the press coverage in early April of our plan to ungrandfather longer tenured members and remained elevated through the quarter We think some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the completion of two years of grandfathering Churn of members who were actually ungrandfathered is modest and conforms to our expectations With our large subscriber base slight variances in retention versus forecast can result in significant swings in net adds particularly in a seasonally small net add quarter like Q Our global membership forecast for Q includes an impact from the spectacle of the Olympics on par with what we experienced four years ago and does not include any boost in the US from the Comcast X launch due to uncertainty on timing as we and Comcast will only release <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on the X when the viewer experience is great For Q we forecast US net adds of million as ungrandfathering continues We expect US contribution margin to improve year over year in both Q and Q and we anticipate meeting our US contribution margin target by or even earlier International net additions in Q came to million compared to our million forecast Ungrandfathering occurred in Canada UKIreland Latin America and the Nordics during Q where like the US we saw a similar earlierthanexpected impact on retention In our newer markets we continue to learn and believe that growth will unfold over a multiyear period similar to our International revenue rose year over year Excluding the impact of FX million impact on a yy basis international ASP increased International contribution profit totaled million as content spending was slightly lower than our forecast For Q we expect international net additions of m Our approach in expanding our global footprint in January was to launch a service targeting early adopters and then to listen learn and iterate quickly Now that we are six months in we will localize <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in Poland and Turkey with the addition of local language in the user interface subtitles and dubbing Localization in other markets will take place over time as economically prudent International contribution loss in Q is expected to be million as improving profitability in our earlier foreign markets funds the investment in newer international territories We remain confident in these investments because of our success in all of the markets launched prior to which are individually profitable on a contribution profit basis These launch markets are on track to deliver aggregate contribution profit of around million in This is what market saturation looks like NFLX posted its first decline in internet traffic share in years So NFLX growth is slowing down Is its cash burn Nope In Q free cash flow amounted to million compared with million in Q We finished the quarter with cash and equivalents of billion while gross debt was unchanged at billion We still plan to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in early Our capital requirements continue to be driven by our investment in original content particularly programming that we produce which requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content Original content provides <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with many benefits new programming that debuts on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>exclusivity greater creative and business control global rights and brand halo These merits outweigh the timing of cash payments And visually the company has burned more than billion in the past year with MM in Q cash burn compare to MM a year ago And then there is the great Chinese myth Unfortunately this year the regulatory climate in China for our service has become more challenging Disneys streaming service launched in conjunction with Alibaba was closed down as was Apples movie offering We continue to explore options and in the meantime have plenty of work to do in our newly opened markets The sad summary that may well have closed the chapter on NFLXs growth story Our global expansion is an exciting opportunity that will unfold over many years Continued US growth will be a part of it and there is no change to our view that in the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can reach million members We continue to expect to run around breakeven on a net income basis in and to generate material profits in and beyond We will drive operating profit growth in by reducing our international losses and continuing to grow US profit raywolf EmmittFitzhume Jul PM Gaius

booboo EmmittFitzhume Jul PM Bunga Bunga EmmittFitzhume Jul PM TradingIsLifeBrah Jul PM So happy that I contributed to this in a small way They sent an email that my subscription would go up from to or something like that so I promptly cancelled Havent logged into the site in at least months anyway last thing I watched was Daredevil I had forgotten to unsubscribe but their notice was a pleasant reminder to do so FuckEm bloostar TradingIsLifeBrah Jul PM U eee aaa TradingIsLifeBrah Jul PM They tried the same stunt with me The ultimatum was to take in increase or get downgraded to lower bandwidth I said finedowngrade the bandwidth I am this close to moving to Crave on principle I am also getting sick of paying them to produce second rate garbage that they consider winners that are only full of violence and a very heavy LGBT indoctrination Hey I dont pay you to brainwash me netflix Im there to be entertained and you are failing on that account Why couldnt you do a deal with criterion instead of producing your own junk and actually bring some quality movies to you site and stop taking your movies out of the bargain dvd bin It is embarrassing for a supposed leading movie provider some of the stuff you try to sell to me Penelope Dreadful U eee aaa Jul PM When they start queernorming I stop watching the show and usually the series I turned off Shades of Blue Rosewood The Catch and several others when they started throwing in obligatory lezzie sex and back alley blow jobs Nope too much out there to watch listen to read and do to put up with a bunch of perverts and freaks trying to brainwash me Also I dont shop at Target J C Penneys and I stopped buying Campbells soups They used to have a pretty good selection of classic and silent films but you cant even do a goddamn genre search on Nutflix anymore Foreign films are my favorite but their selection has become tiresome to say the least H H Henry P P P Jul PM When you already have every person on the planet subscribed to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>why would investors think there would be any additional growth prospects <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt release phones every year they dont sell additional services Its a one trick pony and they have to find another revenue machine to generate from not just a monthly subscription Nothing new here Peaking around to before the split seemed a little ridiculous Call me when it gets to I used my sisters login to check out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Under new releases all they show is all of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>series and every once and a while a movie I tried to find any of the big movies released last year and couldnt find any of them For a movie service they seem to have very few movies worth watching AND REALLY IS A BEAT FOR A COMPANY TRADING AT PE I think international is slow because nobody couchpotatoes like Americans not to mention shitty ISP Is there enough gross tv watching internationally to warrant a paid membership I guess not ThrownOffZHTwice Jul PM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>used to have a lot of good movies Now the selection is not very good I have not dropped them yet but I am considering it SlingTV is pretty good I have the basic package Seems every couple of weeks they have free days of HBO and channels like that I look at the two or three movies that HBO has that are worth watching so it works out pretty well Id never subscribe to HBO I got days of Amazon Prime for free You have to pay extra for any good movie what a load of shit Amazon Prime was crap Crackle which is always free has a few good movies but also commercials but that is okay Too bad about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>selection It used to be good <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should spend their money putting good movies online and not waste it on their own lousy productions I spent minutes Saturday looking for anything worth watching The New Releases suck The Just Added is old content And there mustbe dozens of shows they are producing themselves It is also worth mentioning that the average <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>movie seems to have stars It is streaming crap on demand Great for a public sewer Rio would LOVE to be able to do that But not so compelling for a video service On a more Serious Note Sony is starting their own streaming service through the PS probably coming to other platforms sooner rather than later Sony of course owns roughly of all the IP in entertainment So they are extremely well positioned to absolutely BURY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in the next year or so Anyone else have a NFLX account Mrs Homey has one and for shits and giggles I logged on recently and tried to find about a dozen or so of my favorite movies NFLX had NONE OF them Then tried to find a few episodes of my favorite old time TV shows again NOTHINGSo I asked Mrs Homey why we still have it and she said the content has gotten much worse and we are cancelling To be honest I can find about as much if not more for free on the interweb and YouTube as on NFLX I took a flyer last year and bought shares at right after the split rode it to and sold when I saw their earnings and laughed my ass off on their aquisition cost per customer and debt financing To me this is at best a stock I disagree with you guyssorry but I pay bucks a month and altho the movie selection is not so good I have found a few good ones each monthI find t least a dozen a month that makes each movie I watch about centsthe messengers was good just watched marco polo etc I think netflix is fine but you guys are correct they have crap moviesso afr tho its been worth my bucks a month Captain America Winter Soldier Iron Man Age of Ultronand most of the Marvel series hell on wheels prison break the messengers say what ya want but for bucks a month I dont see a problem the reason netflix is having a problem is because people are sharing their passwords with other peoplenetflix is clamping down on itAnother reason netflix is not doing good is because people starting downloading the movies and sending them to others for freeNetflix has already taken care of this alsoIt is of my opinion that the real reason that netflix is doing not so good is because PEOPLE DONT HAVE ANY MORE FRIGGIN MONEY I hate artciles such as thisnetflix is not plummetting they are at an average situation when looking at their stocksThey are a little low right now but far from plummettingI cant trust zerohedge anymore with headlines such as thisI am going to do my own reserch from now onlook at the year stock in the link below ZH is losing my attention with their gloom and doom headlinesYes I know the world economy iw collapsing but dont make things up to get more views try to stick to truth Mr Tyler Durden Distilling this down Apparently that whole pitch about spending to buying market share that every startup seems to be peddling isnt a winning business plan it just results in an unsustainable PE and when they raise prices people drop them just like they did with the companies theyre trying to disrupt Now the question is how long companies like this can keep up the charade before people start chasing actual returns Ill pay a bit more if you put better shows and movies on streaming of what is there is garbage I download all my movies and tv shows from a few sites get the best of netflix and other tv shows plus the latest theater releases I hope the nsa isnt lurking ASIAN DAILY ECONOMIC RELEASES CALENDAR NOW AVAILABLE IN THE RESEARCH ASIAPAC SERVICE
