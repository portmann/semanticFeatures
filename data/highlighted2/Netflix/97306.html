split is no reason to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Greece negotiations collapsed again and so did the market On top of that Carl Icahn said that the market is overheated I thought Icahns beef was more with the lack of worth in the highyield bond market than with equities especially given that he still owns a ton of stocks said Cramer He said that Icahn did not say to short sell the stocks Instead he meant that stocks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX have had big moves and its time to take profits He still found value in Apple NASDAQ AAPL and said that it should be bought on dips One negative story that has been hanging on the market forever is Greece We simply cannot have this darned thing hanging over our heads and still believe we are going to get a big fat nonGreek rally which is one of the reasons why I didnt want any Fed governors talking about one or two rate hikes until the fat lady sings and Zorba the Greek dances said Cramer If all this wasnt negative enough Deutsche Bank NYSE DB downgraded Citigroup NYSE C and Goldman Sachs NYSE GS to hold Then Citigroup downgraded cyber security stocks Fortinet NASDAQ FTNT and FireEye NASDAQ FEYE Cramer however warned investors not to sell cyber security stocks as next time a data breach happens they would wonder why they sold them Final nail on the coffin was the decline in transports So you crush the banks and cyber security plays sending down the two biggest sectors finance and tech then you get run over by a freight train and a big brown truck on a day when Greece is back messing up the narrative and you arent going to go picking among the red hot rubble until it cools said Cramer The market is indeed overheated and one should wait till the weak hands leave the stocks Is Baxter NYSE BAX turning around Baxter was up on a down day It is a giant medical supply company which is in the middle of a break up which could translate into a turnaround The company has been too big to manage Its taken a lot of time for the company to spin off its biosciences business After the break up the slimmed down version of the company is one that investors would want a piece of Its been a tough year for Baxter but the longawaited breakup is almost upon us And once the company spins off its bioscience business as Baxalta NYSE BXLT I think the upside could be tremendous said Cramer Goldman Sachs has also upgraded the stock The company has divisions medical products that accounts for of revenue and biosciences that accounts for the other The biosciences division is being spun off and it has a small monopoly in this business The medical products line is the boring and steady business Post spinoff shareholders will receive share of Baxalta for each share of Baxter The stock has been a laggard as the company kept missing its own guidance and decided to stop providing guidance at all The bears pounced on the company as Baxter has been facing competition and has a lot of patent expirations The dividend safety was also in question The bull case for the stock now is that all the pain is behind it Since the estimates are very low the company will beat them Baxter has also been punished by the strong dollar and with the dollar peaking now it will be advantageous for the company The new company will be clean and simple Cramer recommends it Mondelez International NASDAQ MDLZ When Kraft broke itself up in its division Kraft Foods NASDAQ KRFT got a lot of attention Its now being acquired by Heinz The other division Mondelez International is almost forgotten Mondelez is a snack and beverage company that owns brands like Oreos Chips Ahoy Triscuits Ritz Crackers Trident gum Cadbury chocolate and Toblerone The thing is that Mondelez has hit some serious bumps in the road in recent years Its suffered from poor margins and sluggish revenue growth However lately Mondelez has gotten aggressive about fixing its business and the stock has suddenly become an outperformer said Cramer The stock is up yeartodate Does it have more room to run Mondelez is a global brand and it gets sales from North America from Europe from Latin America and the remainder from APAC This means that the strong dollar has affected the top and bottomline miserably but with the dollar peaking Cramer expects the headwinds to be tailwinds in the next months The company has been a leader in the snack and candy market globally Since its spinoff the company has been trying to streamline production and cut costs The revenue has been shrinking as the company has been discontinuing many of the lowermargin product businesses The activist Nelson Peltz has a stake and is pressurizing constantly to eliminate corporate overhead and improve margins I think Mondelez has what it takes to go higher even if Peltzs dream doesnt come true said Cramer He thinks there could be lot of growth down the road Cramer went off the tape again to review a privately held company that is doing a great job He reviewed Embrace Innovations which was a nonprofit created to provide infant warmers in developing countries They invented a cheap and portable baby warmer that can be used in place of an incubator which a lot of the developing countries populations do not have access to The business became popular and they decided to spin it off and create a profit business called Embrace Innovations so they can commercialize the technology They have a line of baby warmers called Little Lotus that were designed as a swaddle and sleeping bag product for parents in the US Cramer interviewed cofounder and CEO Jane Chen along with Kataoka the artist who codeveloped the Little Lotus line Embrace to date has reached babies with our infant warmer across countries But the goal was always how do we get to a million babies The challenge was always to find the funding to do that to scale sustainably said Chen Due to incubators being expensive almost babies die globally per minute as they cannot keep warm Little Lotus solves that issue at a fraction of the cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was up on the split news and it crashed down after Icahn said that its time to take profits We know that broader ownership is key in a market like this one where home gamers tend to own stocks and institutions tend to rent them Thats why I dont turn up my nose at Netflixs sevenforone split even as I recognize that a stock split creates no value said Cramer The split is no reason to buy a stock If you split a pencil into half you will have pencils and not more pencils Right now lots of institutions and funds hold the stock and management wants more retail investors to own it Fund buying and shorting in huge quantities is causing the stock to be volatile Cramer said that it is volatile as it is tough to value on traditional methods Heres the thing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a company with a product that is enjoyed by the masses and this sevenforone split allows users to buy more shares which can entice them into the stock he added The longterm road looks good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>At the end of the day if you want to own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>you should buy it because the opportunity is so great and not because you can buy more shares with fewer dollars said Cramer On the flip side the stock should be sold if it looks over valued and not because a fund manager said so Ford NYSE F The yield is fine but weve to see Latin America Europe and China turn That is a lot of turning Second Sight NASDAQ EYES The stock has doubled Buy it below and I think it could get there Sysco NYSE SYY They have lot of business to other players I want you to stay away Unilever NYSE UL Make a stand If the dollar has done going higher then buy Procter Gamble NYSE PG else by Unilever Jim Cramers Action Alerts PLUS Check out
