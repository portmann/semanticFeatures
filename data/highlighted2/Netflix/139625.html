majority of its profits and while lower this quarter Q for Disney is showing much promise International operations are set to increase with Shanghai construction nearing completion We now have separate hedge funds carrying around billion in Disney NYSE DIS stock with all of those benefiting from the YTD trend of the stock being up over The company has now passed the billion market cap threshold is leading the Dow and now its time to look to future quarters as indicative of how the House of Mouse can grow even larger The sharp decline putting Disney down on the day after quarterly earnings creates an exceptional entry point as ESPN ad revenues and movies are going see great upside in FY Q I personally love goofy market sentiment that doesnt understand Disneys stock Theyre selling off because of fear that revenues werent high enough and that Disney cant sustain the alltime highs I however believe in quite the opposite Overall the company beat on EPS by six cents and missed by only million on revenue billion vs billion which is hardly grounds for negative sentiment Every segment showed growth except Interactive but it was competing against a prior year comparison of strong sales from its initial launch and Infinity wont launch until the end of this month providing support for stronger Q earnings Were seeing significant international expansion with the Hong Kong Disneyland expecting to open a third resort on site by costing Disney only million This location hasnt been as popular as other international locations but this new addition could certainly provide a good boost With a stake in the Shanghai Disney resort theme park two hotels and a entertainment center the company has staked about billion in the project and will be finishing in early Overall Im not worried about the theme park segment as I know Shanghai is about to really increase revenues and with guests now spending more per person along with attendance being higher in American locations Im content with the business Back in October of when this company bought Lucasfilm for billion I thought the acquisition price was a little steep I now realize that this was the best decision the company has made to reduce dependency on ESPN With projections for the new Star Wars The Force Awakens film to make billion at the box office before merchandise or any other ancillary stream I have full confidence in the stock trending up The company has Episode VIII and Episode IX lined up as two multibillion dollar films to be released over the next five years There will also be two films that are more characterspecific involving Boba Fett and Han Solo respectively Think about it thats five total films based on one franchise that just at the box office could bring anywhere from billion dollars in revenue over the next five years That doesnt include their extensive pipeline of upcoming releases with Pixar and Marvel better detailed here Heres the largest caveat with movies they only account for of Disneys total revenue Even with having some of the biggest titles in the industry they need to keep bolstering this number up in order to diversify their product offering a bit better Unfortunately Tomorrowland and Big Hero were basically written off in wake of Ant Man and The Avengers Age of Ultron as they were high budget low return titles this past quarter Even with those flops the studio entertainment segment was still up and did billion in revenue Analysts here and here for example were betting on Disney to post big losses with ESPN and media channels but that wasnt the case at all Revenue for ABC ESPN and Disney channel combined were up to billion With ESPN now accounting for of Disneys total profits the sports network has seen significant upside on the year despite falling subscribers Exclusive rights to a large amount of NFL and college football games is going to create an autumn worth remembering Id expect to see subscriber rates go up because of this Sure low ratings hurt ad revenues for these three major channels but we have to think about the seasonality of the business Baseball is currently the only sport going on with games all over three hours that a majority of individuals channel flip when commercials come on inevitably leading to lower ad revenues The overlap that Football and Basketball are about to provide will surely help ESPN ESPN has lost million subscribers LTM but thats old news and was previously exaggerated to be much higher CEO Bob Iger stated in the earnings call that ESPN is a must have with any tv package and that of all sports are watched live which really reduces their worries for the segment Furthermore any advocates of the cordcutting argument have to bet on ESPN being one of the last channels thatll ever fall victim to the switch given that statistic Iger on the earnings call even said that streaming services like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX are friends not enemies The consumer products division has the most upside With more Star Wars merchandise rolling out September merch from Disneys Frozen led the growth in Q With the segment growing to million in revenue This exceptional growth and while it only accounts for a small portion of quarterly revenues can certainly get bolstered with franchises like Star Wars returning to relevancy This is an incredibly difficult stock to bet against given its years of returning exceptionally positive results Iger sees this eighth straight quarter of earnings beat as just another indicator of the firms longterm success and despite forex problems causing half a billion loss in revenue for the quarter brighter days are ahead for this stock Disney still pays a comfortable dividend at and Id be honestly surprised if the company didnt hit by the end of the calendar year I think initial receipts from Star Wars The Force Awakens will provide a great catalystbase for boosting the stock as well Im happy about the recent correction in the stock and believe its a great time to get in Oh and if a record quarterly profit of billion wasnt good enough then I dont know what is Source For
