class='textDiv'>The Cost Of Keeping The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Story Intact A Record Million In Q Cash Burn Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site The rest of the FANGs may be crashing and burning but one story stock refuses to give up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Moments ago Reed Hastings ubiquitous streamer of videos right into your bedroom reported Q EPS of vs the expected on BN in revenue a fractional miss to expectations however as everyone knows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does not trade on fundamentals Well the story is simple all about eyeballs or in this case subscriber data and here it gets a little dicey because while NFLX reported a miss in net domestic adds which at million were just fractionally lower than the million expected and perhaps more troubling Q US net adds were down year over year m actual versus m prior year But it was the surge in lowmargin high cost international subs that saved the day at million this number was far above the million expected Additionally as part of NFLX guidance while the domestic growth appears to be tapering with the company expecting MM net adds in Q down from the MM a year ago it predicts a surge in international net streaming subs which should grow by MM from a year ago to MM Some more findings Q total streaming contribution margin of declined to the lowest in driven by the drop in the international streaming loss which at million was a profit margin versus the domestic profit margin In other words while NFLX domestic growth appears to be trailing off this will be the cash flow basis which the company will use to grow internationally even if so far at least the profit contribution from offshore is wildly negative And a little more to the story from the letter In September we launched in Japan followed by Spain Portugal and Italy in October We are very pleased with the first few months of membership growth in these markets Our international contribution loss of million in Q increased sequentially due to these launches We anticipate Q international losses of about million In early January at CES we announced the availability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>everywhere in the world except China Pricing is comparable to our existing plans and we have added support for Korean Arabic and Simplified Traditional Chinese languages Our move into additional countries broadens our addressable market by million broadband homes on top of the million we counted at the end of While the opportunity is large our growth in these new markets will unfold over many years as we improve our service We are starting by primarily targeting outwardlooking affluent consumers with international credit cards and smartphones As with every market weve launched our approach is to listen learn and improve rapidly adding more content additional languages and a better <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>experience over time Our global availability sets us up for continued growth for many years and we continue to expect material global profits beginning in In the US we ended with nearly million members although our Q US net adds were down year over year as expected m actual versus m prior year Our high penetration in the US seems to be making net additions harder than in the past Our forecast for Q US net additions is m against a prior year actual of m New creditdebit card rollover continues to be a background issue In Q and Q well be releasing a substantial number of our US members from price grandfathering on the HD plan and they will have the option of continuing at but now on the SD plan or continuing on HD at a month Given these members have been with us at least years we expect only slightly elevated churn Our US contribution target remains at and we are already at In the last remaining major market China we have work and uncertainty ahead We are building relationships understanding the market and seeking the conditions we require to provide our service to entertainment lovers there Our expectations are modest and longterm We may be able to get started this year and thus deliver on whole world by end of or it may take longer Most of our focus is on the countries we launched on January which are now embracing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a new entertainment option What was the cost of keeping the last FANG momentum story alive A record million in cash burn in the quarter Free cash flow amounted to million in Q and million for the full year As a reminder our investment in originals particularly owned content requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content which will continue to dampen free cash flow We finished Q with debt of billion unchanged from the prior quarter and with cash equivalents and shortterm investments of billion Given our expected cash needs we are likely to raise additional debt in late or early We are managing our balance sheet to lower our blended cost of capital over time while maintaining financial flexibility Despite being FCF negative as we grow our original content and invest in international our bonds trade like a BB credit vs their single B rating due in part to the longterm growth of Internet TV globally and our low debt to market cap ratio which provides bond investors with a very thick cushion of protection Of course as everyone knows the lack of cash flow doesnt matter until it does As for NFLX bonds trading like a BB credit thanks for reminding us to check what the repo rate on those is Tue nuubee What kind of nonsense is this Cash flow suffers when you invest in original programming How many seasons of House of Cards have they done and they dont have positive cash flow on their original programming If CBSNBCABC behaved this way years ago they would have gone bankrupt Tue Mentaliusanything Tue Quasi Whoever is in charge of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is batshit insane They spend all this money on original programming and then fail to advertise it If it isnt House of Cards no one knows they have it I found Marco Polo and fell in love The problem is it took me over a year to figure out they had the damn show It never showed up in any of their idiotically generated lists for me despite watching plenty of asiankungfu cinema Kimmy Schmidt Didnt know about it till a friend turned me on to it Never showed up in my lists despite watching plenty of Rock These guys really need to get their act together And while were at it drob the pregenerated list bullshit and let me browse your goddamned selection Oh and they also paid NBC a metric shitton of cash for the exclusive streaming rights to The Blacklist Unfortunately they only stream episodes after the season is well over So guess what They basically paid millions just so Hulu cant stream the episodes the next night They didnt even get a single fucking customer with the deal If you need to know why theyre losing money hand over fist this is why Tue mandalou Tue JenkinsLane Tue upWising Tue Xatos Still waiting for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to snag The Big Short Cant help but feel some inevitable irony coming with that one Negative cash flow does not necessarily means loss and may be due only to a mismatch of expenditure and income Chronic mismatch however may indicate ineffective credit management leakage of funds through fraud or actual loss Temporary mismatch is covered usually by arranging an overdraft facility Tue EndlessSummer Tue DetectiveStern Tue EndlessSummer Apparently that feature is going away They want country specific content If it happens we will probably add HBO or such to our regular programming There also may be VPN alternatives wihch may still work That or we will have to read more Tue Fester Tue Yen Cross Tue besnook i m taking my amzn short off tommorrow because it will certainly spike on slower retail growth you know because the cloud is where the money is at Tue EndlessSummer I live outside the US and Amazon really provides great service or more and free international shipping and it is FAST They have also introduced Amazon Mexico which doesnt have the number of products yet but it shows they have an interest Tue besnook the problem with amazon is their business plan is to lose money on every sale because they will make a killing on the volume they are in effect proving it is more expensive to build an internet store than a bricks and mortar chain of big box stores spread around the world Tue moonmac My RCA electrified digital antenna on a long pole gets me channels in English which is roughly half the channels that compose of my cable subscription Id rather pay for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>than cable and they genuinely make some quality shows I would happily pay double for their service month is just not cutting it clearly Tue RealistDuJour Tue Dr Gonzo HBO now streaming is much better Costs more but worth it I had Netfilx forover ayear and after I went through Mad Men Walking Dead Breaking Bad Tudors and a few more series I couldnt do it any moreOnly totaly crap was left and

<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>just went to how many different countries this past quarter They make good original content they have to buy content I mean do you realize I had

to us is the memorable We lose money on every sale but well make it up in volume Spoken by every Japanese company in the s and every internet company in the late s at least Its always the mantra of cheap funding and too much money looking for a home Malinvestment personified Tue XBSD I cant understand the constant bashing of certain companies APPL being the poster child for a whipping boy everyone has been proclaiming Apples death since fuck since they were founded Literally Every Fucking Year Someone claims apple is dying Its old Its not true Its beyond pathetic I am feeling the same way about NFLX now People are constantly hating on NFLX Is it taking losses Sure the numbers dont lie However taking a loss might be acceptable if you are building something Which NFLX is They are scaling out their CDN infrastructure They are just now opening up to stream world wide And here is a key take away they are producing their own content And quite good content if I do say so myself They are becoming the first and so far only global content creatordistributor This is important to know If they own a good library of self made content they can stream it world wide Warner bros universal etc cant bind them up with rope on where they can distribute how much it will cost per play etc Netlix knows this as does apple NFLX is preparing and laying the ground work to become one of the worlds premier source of unique original content AND they have the CDN to deliver it worldwide They are not just pissing money away with nothing to show for it I swear to god all these AAPL and NFLX dying stories are beyond ludacris The haters clearly do not understand jack fucking shit Tue pitz Pretty messed up economy when a mere FTPservercan garner a market capitalization that exceeds the entirety of the US precious metals mining sector Tue eucalyptus I still dont understand the value proposition from NFLX when all of their content is available for free via torrent If you have a connection fast enough to stream nflx you have a fast enough connection to DL all the shows and movies you want The technical knowledge to do it safely isnt that great Tue XBSD Pirating first of all is not something the average joe can do They simply want to turn on the TV scroll to the netflix app and hit play Without thinking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is on record as having the same view Apple does In order to compete with free stolen content you have to make it easier to obtain and keep the price low Which they are doing For a flat fee you can binge watch everything in HD quality No guessing what the stream quality will be and ease of use There is the value ad Tue TheDanimal As people get poorer more and more are going to rediscover bittorrent Hell even xdcc IRC transfer bots are still around and fast as fuck too <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a frivolous epense Tue redscud NFLX should monitor the IP address and only
