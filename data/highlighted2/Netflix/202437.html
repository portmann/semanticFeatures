history has the US entered a recession when rates were this low And it spells serious trouble for the financial system going forward Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Earlier today as AAPL stock was plummeting and had lost a whopping billion in market cap dropping as low as share CNBCs Jim Cramer pulled a rabit out of a hat or in this case a previously undisclosed email out of his inbox An email from AAPL CEO Tim Cook which said the following as subsequently conveyed by Cramer to CNBC viewers As you know we dont give midquarter updates and we rarely comment on moves in Apple stock But I know your question is on the minds of many investors I get updates on our performance in China every day including this morning and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last weeks Obviously I cant predict the future but our performance so far this quarter is reassuring Additionally I continue to believe that China represents an unprecedented opportunity over the long term as LTE penetration is very low and most importantly the growth of the middle class over the next several years will be huge While we are delighted by Tim Cooks subjective take of AAPLs Chinese prospects we have a different question where is the public filing that accompanies this letter which constitutes nothing short of a private business update with an outside and unregulated by Apple market cheerleader Because as the AAPL reaction to Tims letter which was clearly in Cramers private possession for at least millisecond before it was made public and thus we dont know who else may have had access to it before its public dissemination just how is this not a Regulation Fair Disclosure violation Needless to say the fate of AAPL which is the most important stock in the world held by a record hedge funds determines the intraday and not only fate of the entire market zerohedge zerohedge August And for those who may have missed it this is what AAPLs stock has done today ever since this clearly market moving letter helped AAPL regain an unprecedented billion in market cap since the lows We are eagerly looking to find an K public filing of Tim Cooks letter among AAPLs EDGAR filings even if it will have taken place hours after the market moving event or alternatively perhaps the SEC or any other authorities who were not too stunned to react today can explain just why this is not a Reg FD violation Then again with AAPL leading the SP rapidly into the green we are confident this too will be promptly forgotten and swept under the carpet of whatever it takes to keep the market green Mon JustObserving Corruption is the norm in US markets Tim will be hailed as a hero of capitalism like corrupt criminal billionaires Dimon and Blankfein Mon whotookmyalias I havent heard the latest definition of fair discolsure recently Im pretty sure it doesnt mean what we think it should Regulation FD addresses the selective disclosure of information by publicly traded companies and other issuers Regulation FD provides that when an issuer discloses material nonpublic information to certain individuals or entitiesgenerally securities market professionals such as stock analysts or holders of the issuers securities who may well trade on the basis of the informationthe issuer must make public disclosure of that information In this way Regulation FD aims to promote the full and fair disclosure Mon max Mon TongueStun Its realy quite preposterous to believe that Jim Cramer media mouthpiece for the Federal Reserve Bankster Cartel would be involved in anything under the table Shame on you Tyler you hater you Mon THE th Quadrant Mon clooney_art Tim Cook lost a lot of credibility by just emailing Jim Cramer of CNBC Dont care if it broke any laws at all since these days laws keep getting broken left and right by people with Mon Fukushima Sam Bwahaha take that you AAPL fuckers I will dance on the grave of your company just as I dance on the grave of that socialist prick Jobs Mon aint no fortuna Its my strong opinion that GS takes the opposite side of Crammers shillery by design Would love to see what their prop desk did for trades in the minutes between Crammers receipt of Cooks email and the actual dissemination of said email by Crammer Should be a simple task for the regulators to take a look at the prints too bad they wont though Mon Random_Robert The SEC regulators wont investigate or prosecute Tim Cook under FD law for the very simple reason that they dont want to see their k balances get hammered DUH Tue tbone Mon hailhillary boys in the community are taught that nonJews arent quite human Speaking from Berlin where he is doing biomedical research on a Fulbright fellowship Katz explained that growing up in such a community you dont see commonality with people who arent Jewish There is a completely different taxonomy of people There are Jews and then there are nonJews who dont have souls See more at httpmondoweissnethaaretzorthodoxtaughtsthashLCQfeWhdp Mon gatorengineer I wrote the other day that the hedge had it all wrong and this whole move was AAPL and got flamed AAPL interday move and maybe more to come on NO VOLUME Write up there with the Pandit letter that saved it at Alot of damage should have been done though lets see what happens AAPL represents the health of Chinese economy PresentlyChinese economy is a very sick patient and will become even more sicker AAPL is a vey sizable component of DOW and SP etc Consequently it is very easy to manipulate the major financial market indexes by manipulating AAPL and few similar stocks This is exactly what is going on Tim Cook is a liberal and a card carrying member of the Brown Grommet club Mon clade Mon ZD On the other hand as a member of the gay mafia he probably wouldnt mind a little prison time and the opportunities to service Bubba or a big black brotha Mon Grinder Mon CuttingEdge Openminded as I am Ive no problems with Tim Cook being a turd burglar but using cuntfeatures Cramer to boost your stock is downright disgusting Mon TongueStun I have a problem with terd burglars They use x the healthcare resources as normal people and under Obowelcare I have to pay for them They should pay extrafor their own dangerous lifestyle choices like smokers do Mon Bush Baby Mon KnuckleDraggerX Mon Bananamerican Mon Smiddywesson Remember that for your next discussion with friends and family where they flout their opinions about their k and the markets When billion in market cap vanishes and immediately reappears how real are your account balances and your current reality Mon Skateboarder You have to understand the people dont care that fucking BILLION apparent dollars can participate in magic tricks like that Is the stock price lower or higher thats it Very much a onedimensional understanding or care attributed to stocks Mon Santini Air How is Cramer still on TV Didnt everyone who listened to him go broke yet Or did he find teh kids Mon thunderchief Apple has done some great things but today they are just another gadget maker Ill take a Samsung product any day of the week without thinking twice And if I dont like that there are plenty more to choose from Apple is just another gadget company using Chinese slave labor I hope the stock goes to what Nokias did Hell maybe Ill buy one of those again or how about Sony or HTC Mon NihilistZero Seriously Apple could close shop and stop producing products tomorrow and outside of those that directly profit from Apple sales nothing would change People would use Android phones and tablets and Windows laptops They have no dominant position in the cloud storage or businessserver markets Every Apple product is COMPLETELY replaceable with lower cost and arguably better performing products Theyre a logo A brand Yet theyre the most important stock in the world That should tell everyone all they need to know about the current state of capitalism and the markets Mon Skateboarder Have you seen all the iWatch commercials Theyre nauseatingly disgustingly gross painting the most trivial stupid things that watch can do as desirable Theyre really pushing it to the techieuppermiddleklass parents Very much a parentchildassociation marketing campaign Fucken scumbags Mon FeelinFine Agreed But they want to reinforce their brand by associating it with the human experience Just like the black and white Cheerios commercials with some old hag force feeding them to a toddler Technology slowly creeping untilit overtakes you Excuse me while I load some birdshot and start taking down some drones Pushing is quite apropos Apple sells false feelings of joy no different than the dopamine rush of a drug Mon Hal n back the one thing apple really has going for it is not so much brand loyalty but brand stuckonce you create your playlists and ties to ipads or ipods or iphones its difficult to change having said that I am trying to find a way to leave the apple stable They stopped making ipods my ipad is becoming too complex and it is slowing down after months The touch screen is not reliableany more pop up adds and Ill throw it out sooner rather than later So those problems may or may not be shared by others But I bet more than a few are upset and will gravitate to other platforms Not to mention the possibility that with a global slowdown apple may no longer be selling new phones every years to folks other than delvelopersd People may realize that outside of battery replacement the phone will actually work and do its thing for years an dthe dropping more money just to have latest and greatest is great when you have the
