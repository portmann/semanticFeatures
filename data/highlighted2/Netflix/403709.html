while While ESPN will continue to generate a constant flow of income other divisions will show strong growth With a new park opening this year Disney Shanghai its second largest business segment will show a strong growth in the upcoming years Star Wars and Super Heroes movies will continue to drive the Studio Entertainments and Consumer Products divisions to higher levels The first Star Wars was a
