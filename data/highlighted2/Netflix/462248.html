class='textDiv'>Know What A Long Squeeze Is You Might See One In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha There is a more important point from the report than poor guidance or minimal subscriber growth Churn may point to a new trend in television one that is positive outside of that context no less The afterhours action indicates that pretty much everyone knows the results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX reported last night so Im going to jump straight to what I think is important Yes the subscriber additions were a big disappointment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>attempted to underpromise so it could overdeliver but wound up missing even the lowered expectations big time Forward guidance for both subscribers and revenue also missed expectations I think the information on churn was even more important though In its letter to shareholders management said that churn increased coincident with the press coverage in early April of our plan to ungrandfather and attributed this to a misunderstanding of the action as price increase rather than the completion of a twoyear price break I can see how customers might confuse the two as they seem to have the same result When I look at managements point that churn was minimal amongst customers who were actually experiencing a price increase together with a concession in the QA from the conference call that churn is expected to continue I wind up with a different interpretation It seems to me that customers did indeed respond to the media attention given to the pending price increases but it wasnt the extra two dollars that really bothered them Rather the event was a reminder that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>service wasnt even worth what they were currently paying Ive heard this anecdotally from many people who were and in some cases still are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>customers Of course some people I know swear by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but just as many are weaning themselves away from TV in favor of other often more productive AND entertaining activities That said almost everyone concedes that they like to sit down and watch something now and then When they do retire for a bit of video some use other commitmentbased services but many are quite satisfied with some combination of free and onetime fee options such as public broadcasts RedBox their local library and joining or borrowing from friends I dont know anybody who thought of Netflixs new or prior cost as a burden The available <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content just didnt hold any particular value or interest for them This anecdotal observation is also supported by statistical information House of Cards and Orange is the New Black are supposed to be proof of Netflixs ability to produce superior original content Yet surprisingly both shows fail to rank highly amongst Netflixs own viewers when compared against reruns from other networks Thats particularly troubling when we also see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>increased spending in every category in most cases by more than revenue increased Yet the company came up with worse results than last quarter which was also a disappointment These sorts of longterm trends are what investors should be paying attention to After all if the growth story is intact then any pullback is potentially a buying opportunity right That reasoning is actually a potential fallacy because it fails to quantify and price in time Even before this report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wasnt expected to have positive cash flow until and its content liabilities are already x that projected figure of per share That multiple could rise if analyst downgrades are the next shoe to drop but those often have ephemeral effects and thus are worth ignoring What deserves more attention even though it does not impact the longterm business case is the current market dynamics An analysis of the open options positions going into last nights report shows that at prices that were both liquid and steady after the report well over half a billion dollars worth of NFLX shares are set to be forced upon buyers for a losses in the next month Some may not be able to afford the shares which would force them to sell thereby creating a cascade that is similar to a short squeeze Long squeezes are even rarer than short squeezes and there is no guarantee that one will happen this time However the last time I did analysis like this the effect was pronounced and sustained despite less compelling figures My Momentum Mechanism article used <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to show an example of how momentum can reverse in a sharp but sustained way The drop documented there lasted for over a year and was also the result of a policy change However that change was much more minor and quickly retracted I dont see any way that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can back away from its price increases at this point If the company is ever to become sustainably profitable I think it will have improve both its operations and content Customizing the latter will be especially difficult in the nonsaturated international markets that investors are counting Otherwise after a short stint viewers may simply walk away NFLX investors have that option too and exercising it may be their best option until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can fix what seem to be some pretty intractable problems I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company
