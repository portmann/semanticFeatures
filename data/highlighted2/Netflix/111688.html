telling me about Prime Day This new day is coming up next week July th to be exact If youre wondering what Prime Day is then you should first look to Amazoncom They are touting this day to be bigger than Black Friday If youve ever shopped on Black Friday then you know there are deals to be had So what is Prime Day to be exact Prime Day is a specialized sales event just for those people who are members of Amazons Prime service Since Im a member I get emails telling me of sales events Im pretty excited about Prime Day to be honest The main reason is we are looking for a particular product to replace our failing Xbox which runs out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>account Since we dont have cable we watch a lot of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Our TV is connected to our Xbox but it hasnt been working too well lately Im on the fence about getting another Fire TV Stick or going with a Roku Ive heard good things about Roku and my father just got one and likes it Im hoping I can score one of these on Prime Day Make sure to check out Amazons Prime Day page for more information Basically Prime members will get instant access to tons of deals sales and lightening deals which regular Amazon customers will not They bulk up on sales when Black Friday is around and if they plan on going bigger this could be a huge sales event It will essentially be Christmas shopping in July If you want to get in on the Black Friday type action in July then Prime Day should be on your list Remember this is happening on July th Its going to be an all day sales even with more deal offers than what Amazon shows on Black Friday As a regular Amazon shopper I know there are going to be a lot of deals Here is the official word from Amazon Prime Day is a global shopping event offering more deals than Black Friday exclusively for Prime members On Wednesday July new and existing members will be able to shop thousands of Lightning Deals Deals of the Day and will receive unlimited Free TwoDay Shipping Members will find deals starting at midnight PDT with new deals starting throughout the day as often as every ten minutes Not a Prime member Try
