Netflixs first quarter earnings did not do the company any favors and came at a terrible time Netflixs biggest rival Amazon made two big moves in the last few days helping the company close the gap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>revealed it had gained more subscribers than expected but is not forecast to keep that growth going in the second quarter Streaming media overall is growing by leaps and bounds and regardless of earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still carries the bulk of the appeal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX has not had a good few weeks First a reminder of its price increase for grandfathered customers returned to the news cycle then chief rival Amazon NASDAQ AMZN oneupped them in securing additional exposure in the film space Then on top of that Amazon rolled out monthly subscription options in an attempt to lure more customers Depending on which side of the equation you fall on here you can find good news and bad though I have a sneaking suspicion the bad is going to rule the day But regardless this is coming at a time where streaming media is firmly under the microscope and everyone is debating what happens next So how bad were the numbers Well in the spirit of full disclosure lets do a quick look at both before discussing the implications The good news is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>surpassed earnings expectations for the first quarter and added more subscribers than expected The bad news is that growth is not projected to hold in the second quarter Netflixs subscriber growth in the JanuarytoMarch period was a gain of million which was higher than its prediction of million Of that number over four million came from international customers which is credited to Netflixs launch in countries earlier in the year That in itself is a big win especially for as hard as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has pounded the drum on global expansion in recent years The problem and what sent the stock down double digits in afterhours trading is that the second quarter isnt expected to see similar gains <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has said it believes it will add two million more international subscribers with another on the domestic front For a company banking this much on overseas audiences to help boost its business you can see why it spooked investors for a smaller return to come this soon Some have suggested the decline could be linked to a lower catalog count of content in foreign markets as well as reports that Russian crowds havent been as wowed as hoped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also didnt do itself any favors by not having any new update on the prospects of its hopedfor launch in China Of course the common thread here is content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spent billion in acquiring new content in and CEO Reed Hastings has said he expects to use the money from the upcoming rate hikes for more content especially in films That then leads to the question is Netflixs original programming paying off And is streaming still gaining steam It really all depends on who you ask For example a Morgan Stanley survey released earlier this month showed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>not only leads the pack but it knocked previous winner HBO NYSE TWX from the top slot <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>jumped from to as the first choice for original content with HBO tumbling from to Showtime Hulu Amazon and Starz all were represented in the singledigit range The other interesting thing about that poll is that it found <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>users were more likely to also subscribe to a traditional linear service HBO Showtime or Starz than nonNetflix subscribers Despite what some people believe this isnt an eitheror scenario which the numbers from the survey back up Still it shows this is not a passing fad and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is making some incredible gains as a leader in the field The problem is that when youre a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>that has done so well in such a quick period of time the macro and micro implications weigh the same We are in a position now where the industry is so transfixed on streaming media that it has forced linear companies to find a way to recreate their business model In effect the field is diluting itself <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its rivals likely expected this type of news as well as the subsequent shareholder reaction Amazon especially has been stacking the deck extra hard here the last few days and is hoping to cash in The timing here on Amazons onetwo punch of announcements was part of a smart and precisely executed plan by executives at just the right time So what does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>have on deck in the second quarter that could move the needle and combat its opponents The streamer has seven new shows set for launch in the next few months including Orange Is The New Black and Bloodlines while also adding new movies such as the Ricky Gervais headlined Special Correspondents and the Paul Rudd topper The Fundamentals of Caring What investors are especially going to be on the lookout for is how Netflixs first foray into the talkshow format does when it bows Chelsea starring outspoken comedian Chelsea Handler will debut in May This represents the next step in the streamers grand plan that has also included an expansion into multicamera ie laughtrack comedies such as Fuller House and The Ranch Its a process across the board no matter which company in this space you want to look at and while Mondays earnings may be a setback for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>its important for all investors in this field to realize todays results are just one battle in a much larger war Disclosure Iwe have no positions in
