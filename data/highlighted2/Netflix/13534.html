If consumers really want channels such as CNN, AMC, TNT, ESPN, and the Food Network, they can always subscribe to Sling which is a product made by Dish, which costs as low as $20 per month .If Apple bought Vessel and had exclusive rights to some content it would gain a large amount of millennial subscribers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This deal would likely not cost that much to Apple as the Vessel service was just launched and is still unproven. (Uncertainty) </span>I would consider this deal similar to the one where it bought Beats in which Apple made an attempt to get more involved in music streaming.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In conclusion, Apple may have needed to partner with ABC and other traditional networks if it was making a deal 10 years ago. (Uncertainty) </span>Now millennials don't like the content that they provide, meaning they are dying brands.Millennials are a leading indicator to the direction the country is going just as they were early adopters of social media.They are rejecting the TV and so should Apple if it wants to get involved in creating a video content streaming subscription service.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.The author is not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).The author has no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.PRO Alerts is our flagship product for individual investors who want to be faster and smarter about their stocks.To learn more about it, click here.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
