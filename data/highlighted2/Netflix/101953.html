It�s near the tail end of the chart that the numbers get interesting.Two of the biggest names in tech � Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) � are massively underowned by institutional investors relative to what their weightings in the S&P 500.And where it gets even stranger, institutional ownership of the less favorable of Google�s two traded share classes � the non-voting Class C shares (GOOG) � is �where it should be� relative to its weighting in the S&P 500.It�s the A shares, GOOGL, which actually have voting rights, that are underowned.What�s going on here?Why are big money investors shunning Facebook and Google?Let�s look at Google first.There are two issues: The discrepancy between the share classes and the overall underweighting of Google stock by institutional investors.The latter is the easier of the two to explain.Managers don�t care about the lack of voting rights because they know their votes don�t matter.For would be activists or corporate raiders, Google is an unassailable company.It�s founders hold non-traded �super voting� class B shares that make any sort of proxy battle a virtual impossibility.GOOG�s consistent discount to GOOGL, which has actually widened recently, really makes no sense in this context, so it�s perfectly logical for an institutional manager to overweight the cheaper GOOG relative to GOOGL.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As for the issue of Google being underweighted overall� well, it might come back to that point I made about Google being unassailable. (Uncertainty) </span>Google is not known for being particularly friendly to its shareholders (see � Hey Google, Stop Being Such a Baby and Pay a Dividend �).Google is a profitable company that mints money, yet it�s developed a reputation for being the plaything of its founders rather than a profit-maximizing business.And the same goes for Facebook.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Zuckerberg is a ruthless competitor and one of the few people that seems to know how to actually make money in social media. (Uncertainty) </span>Yet Facebook has also burned through shareholder money on expensive acquisitions of dubious economic value (Oculus, Whatsapp, etc.) and expenses grew at twice the rate of revenues last quarter .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>While I don�t see an immediate catalyst to change big money minds (neither Google nor Facebook will be paying a dividend anytime soon� sigh�), you could view the underownership as a contrarian value signal. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The safest move, however, might be a pair trade. (Uncertainty) </span>Short GOOGL and go long GOOG and eke out an arbitrage profit as the discount closes.Source: Google And Facebook Getting No Love From The Big Money We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
