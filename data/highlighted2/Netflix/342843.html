Apple will abandon the Air concept and create a slightly smaller Pro Shifting from an Air to Pro philosophy is probably not the worst idea but it wont reverse the nearly decline in iPad unit sales Apples continued fidelity to Steve Jobss insistence that tablets not become mere consumption devices is undermining Apples second most important product line Lower cost iPads will be necessary to compete with Amazon and Samsung but Apple can preserve margin on these devices and boost profits by expanding digital sales on the platform Apple needs to embrace iPad as a content consumption device that could potentially revolutionize television the way iPod revolutionized music Although it has been delayed a week from its original launch rumors continue to buzz that Apple NASDAQ AAPL will debut a new iPad Monday Usually reliable sources suggest the new iPad will shift the product line away from the Air philosophy of the last two iterations and towards the Pro model which was debuted in largerscreen form last year Apples presumed move actually keeps with the prediction of Seeking Alphas own Mark Hibben However it may not be the correct move Typical of the consumers dont know what they want company Apple appears to have decided to go against the prevailing trend in the tablet market This time it may hurt them The thesis of this article is that the company that created the tablet market may be misreading where it is going next I am not accusing Apple of being idle To his credit Apple CEO Tim Cook has not tried to hide anything When iPod sales got small enough and Apple Watch sales disappointed Apple simply folded them into larger categories to hide the gory details Despite some suggestions he might do the same with iPad as sales went into freefall Cook has taken the open and honest route He is also hard at work trying to reverse the trend Despite being in the shadow of perhaps Americas greatest CEO in history Cook has not been afraid to reverse Jobsera policies when he feels they are hurting the company One such move enterprise which Jobs famously shunned but Cook has made a fullcourt press to woo The recent release of the oversized iPad Pro was the latest step and the biggest Cook already had Apple working with his former employer IBM NYSE IBM to push Apple hardware to enterprise customers and collaborate on vertically integrated software for specific businesses Now he has a piece of hardware to match Apples new ambitions with a number of features built into the iPad Pro that suggest it might be the first tablet actually built with businesses not consumers in mind Apple is also tackling the software side In addition to creating new apps with IBM for enterprise Apple is also working on Classroom to help make iOS more appealing to schools Marketing is getting a refresh too with not just Cook but the entire senior leadership of Apple dispatched to give interviews and showcases about Apple products especially iPad to enterprise customers The strategy is bearing some fruit as Apple continues to expand its enterprise partnerships But it was not enough Apples recent sales figures showed another decline in tablet sales down almost in unit sales from the peak and down from even last years depressed number Its possible iPad Pro simply was too new and not available in sufficient quantities Maybe it hasnt been given enough time to move the needle Thats certainly Apples preferred take on it Cook says drawing enterprises into the iPad ecosystem will take time Given Apples twelvefigure cash hoard Apple can certainly afford to be patient with a new strategy but what it cant afford to do is ignore evidence it may be on the wrong track especially when that evidence comes in the form of a competitor in hot pursuit to supplant it Certainly there is no immediate danger of that but Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is going to try Its Fire tablet vaulted it all the way back to third place for tablet sales over the holiday period last year a increase in a single year If Samsung OTCSSNLF falls victim to the same sales decline as Apple and Amazon posts another strong year of growth it may take over second place this holiday season Amazons tablets have long been mocked as fruitcake tablets things people buy for children or loved ones as gifts but dont want for themselves They are smaller less powerful and have lower resolutions But they are much much cheaper Amazon has long since made its philosophy and strategy clear It sees tablets as mere gateways to customers Fire is sold more or less at cost to encourage the purchase of both digital content and more importantly Prime memberships which spur sales of Amazons physical goods in the general retail sector This is anathema to Apple which not only considers itself exclusively a purveyor of premium products but also inherited from its late founder a visceral distaste for any suggestion a tablet should settle for such a small role in the human condition When Steve Jobs released the first iPad in he had only one regret as documented in his official biography He had set the bar too low More than one reviewer said they loved using their tablet to consume content but it lacked the necessary tools to really be a creator of content Jobs who usually didnt have much use for outside criticism of his ideas took the reviews hard because he thought they were right When he designed the iPad one of the last products before his death he pushed to incorporate content creation tools like a second camera and more powerful software This attitude that tablets are for content creation as well as consumption has outlived its creator at Apple to the present day Tim Cook himself made explicit reference to it when launching the iPhone s in September Apple was just starting to get some early evidence that iPads growth was levelling and he spent a considerable amount of time at the keynote pushing the theme Apple devices he said were great for consuming content but they were incredible for creating content To make sure everyone got the message that tablets were for creating things he took Apples five best content creation apps which usually cost apiece and announced that henceforth they would all be free an unusually generous giveaway by the unapologetically stingy Apple Less than a month after the event Cook called all reporters back for another product launch where he unveiled iPad Air priced at the same despite the proliferation of lowercost alternatives and with more tools than ever for artists You could almost hear Apples engineers and management shouting create dammit create Meanwhile The Everything Store was positively embracing the ideal of consumption Fifty dollars is a breakthrough price but it also means consumers know they arent getting everything they would get with a iPad Amazon has to make tradeoffs to hit that price target and their success hinges on if they can identify correctly which aspects of a tablets functions specs and capabilities customers value most and which ones they are willing to go without to achieve savings This is sort of the mirror image of Apples problem which is to keep coming up with new capabilities that persuade people to keep paying up for their topoftheline model Amazon has come to focus almost exclusively on content consumption as a tablets reason for being Its cameras are mediocre its screens just big enough to enjoy a movie but not really big enough to work on But it gives literally thousands of free apps to every Fire owner and free trials of its Prime Music and Prime Video services And it keeps cutting prices The fact that Amazon tablet sales rose while Apple sales fell suggests Amazon may be on to something At the very least Amazon seems to have a better finger than Apple does on the pulse of what consumers want to see as incremental improvements in their tablets Lower costs for hardware and content seems to trump stronger processor power bigger screens or better cameras Even Cooks ambition to put iPads in every school may fall short as schools on tight government budgets will certainly consider cost as one of the prime factors in determining whose tablets they purchase The refresh rate on tablets is further evidence of the trend Confounding predictions that they would be replaced every two years or so like smartphones people are holding onto their tablets for three four years sometimes even longer And when they finally do replace them they often pass down their current model to a family member who finds its adequate to their needs This behavior is consistent with people finding that older equipment with older processors is more than enough for the tasks they actually use the tablet for namely content consumption They simply arent motivated to constantly shell out more to get the latest content creation tools Rather than continuing to fight this trend Apple should learn to embrace it The fact that most iPads are being used as miniTVs not mini art boards is no reason to be disappointed TV is as desperately in need of a revolution today as just about any other industry Apple is more than capable of beating Amazon at its own game While Amazon Prime Video has become considerably more compelling contentwise over the last few years it is still essentially little more than a poor mans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>It has no news no sports and even the scripted fare is not as good as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Amazon does not have the cash flow or profits to make its tablets the center of an entertainment revolution But Apple does Its cash hoard is more than sufficient to bring TV kicking and screaming into the st century Sports would be an excellent place to start Fifteen years after MLB began offering outofmarket games on computers professional sports TV rights are still remarkably balkanized and quaint Inmarket transmissions are only allowed on home TVs and usually cannot be streamed to phones or tablets even if the user has an authenticated cable subscription Meanwhile the outofmarket packages continue to suffer from blackout rules and technical difficulties that drive even the most devoted fans to angrily cancel the service Imagine Apple bringing its it just works engineering expertise and a wad of cash to bear on this problem It can afford to buy the rights to any content it wishes even uberexpensive NFL fare As a new entrant unbound by any legacy systems from old th century technology it could simply abolish the inmarketoutofmarket dichotomy by buying the rights to both and running one common stream over its own servers to prevent technical problems The iPad makes a natural platform for this revolution a TV screen large enough to enjoy both movies and sports and small enough to carry around in a handbag or a backpack or curl up on the sofa with This does not have to mean a reduction in Apples financial ambitions for iPad Americans alone spend almost billion a year on TV Europe Japan and Asia take the figure far higher Accepting the iPads natural role at the forefront of a content consumption revolution could be exceedingly profitable for Apple And as the profits from selling content through the device went up Apple could afford to let the hardware profits go down finally beginning to match Amazon and other competitors sub offerings I know that many will object that Apple does not do cheap products Of course Apple does not do anything cheap but that is not to say it insists everything be expensive Apple does not object to lowcost products Its iPods eventually bottomed out at a mere for the Shuffle which has no screen and small memory and so is very cheap to build But no one would call it a cheap product What Apple objects to are lowmargin products which they feel dont properly reward the people who develop them Whatever a device costs to make Apple insists on a healthy markup But if the costs of the device are cheap enough that can still result in a more affordable offering The iPad which started at back in was cut to in January but then stayed at the same price for two more years despite the fact that its costs almost certainly kept dropping rapidly Had Apple continued cutting a year off the price as it does with its iPhones it would have been at by the time they retired it And many older iPads are still in use since again they are more than adequate for the content consumption that most people use them for It is perfectly feasible for Apple to offer a fullsized iPad without giving up margin per device Yes absolute profit would go down but if it was enough to revive iPad sales it might still take total hardware profits higher to say nothing of all the extra content sales those tablets would produce Apple is far from vanquished It is still the company which sets the bar every other tablet vendor measures themselves against and it has a strong and loyal customer base But a decline in sales can never simply be shrugged off even though it might have been tempting to when everyone elses sales were falling right along with theirs But now that a competitor seems to have actually found a winning formula for tablet sales even in a declining market it is time for Apple to confront the questions it has too long ignored Most customers simply dont need to create content they just want to consume it Tim Cook needs to be brave in the face of the Steve Jobs legacy again and admit that sometimes customers do know exactly what they want Disclosure Iwe have no
