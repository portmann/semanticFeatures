<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is due to report Q earnings next Wednesday April During FY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>consistently beat top and bottom YoY numbers while also adding more members than they did in FY Current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>naysayers are still focused on the wrong metrics when judging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>its current valuation and its future growth potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has learned from their mistakes by successfully raising membership prices in FY In July of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX announced to their million members worldwide that they were no longer going to be offering unlimited plans that include both their streaming and DVDsbymail services for one low price Instead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>said that while unlimited streaming would continue at per month customers would need to shell out another if they also wanted unlimited DVDs After hovering around per share in mid the stock ended the year at around per share losing over threefourths of its market value in the span of months The companys controversial Qwikstercom creation a proposed separate site to run the companys DVDsbymail only accelerated the stocks tumble Almost a year ago in May of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>increased prices for its most popular streaming plan from to Unlike in where the stock and the companys subscriber growth drastically fell this plan has paid off so far The stock while still sporadic historically has climbed out of the hole it created in and has since provided shareholder returns that exceed Today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has more members than ever while top and bottom line numbers continue to rise quarterly But what is stopping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>from raising prices even higher More importantly how much higher can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>really go in terms of their membership pricing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has become a global internet TV network juggernaut offering movies and TV shows commercialfree across countries with longterm goals to reach countries all at a flat monthly fee During their fourth quarter of fiscal revenues rose to billion while net income surged to million Below is a chart showing how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has grown its top and bottom lines the past two years For the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>saw revenues climb to billion while net income accelerated over to million The company was able to maintain positive subscriber growth by adding million new members in up from the million added in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>now has million members Despite the shift to streaming by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>customers overall the DVDsbymail service is still reaching million members in the US Managements current outlook for fiscal include growing to million members globally launching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in Australia and New Zealand markets and launching over hours of original programming which includes the hit series House of Cards Too many people are still fixated on the doom of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>while continually underestimating the companys longterm prospects Recent discussions of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>appear to revolve around the companys history of losing content providers due to rising content costs STARZ in and Warner Bros MGM and Universal in how these rising costs are undermining the companys revenue growth the slowing of subscriber growth weaker margins stronger competition and fears on Netflixs market valuation First of all losing content providers isnt exactly a negative for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Sure they could have paid up more or even overpaid to keep providers like STARZ or Warner Bros but at what cost Is keeping a content license worthwhile if it hurts the bottom line Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has since increased its focus on creating more of its own content As stated in their recent fourth quarter conference call the main perk behind creating more original content is the higher upfront expense characteristics as opposed to paying a more out over the life of a licensing deal regardless of whether the titles under a particular license are truly adding the same value to the companys library in its fifth year as in its first year As we can see from the chart above total subscribers in the streaming segment have steadily increased in a linear fashion As more customers make the switch from DVDsbymail to streaming I expect this trend to continue if not accelerate at some point What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bears seem to misunderstand is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriber counts is approaching a simple case of law of large numbers What this means is that the total subscriber count can steadily grow for several more years But to maintain the pace of the growth today as it was five years ago is mathematically impossible Essentially the rate of growth going from million members to million members is a lot higher than going from million members to million Next we have the idea of weaker or weakening margins as a result of higher content costs and other rising expenses From the chart below it looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is dealing with rising margins quite well As stated in the companys Annual Report SEC filing growth in paid memberships and revenues continued to outpace content and marketing spending I will discuss Netflixs stronger competition and high valuation later in this article Why The Time Is Now To Increase Prices Going back to there is a big misconception on why the proposed price increase faced so much backlash It wasnt exactly the price increase that angered so many customers as much as it was the unnecessary split of two separate services Historically customers dont want to be forced to pay double for what essentially is the same product but they definitely dont want to have to pay more for separate products across separate channels Qwikstercom This is basically what made the price increase so successful for the company as shown on the table below While average monthly domestic revenues per member increased by going from to from fiscal to fiscal contribution margins jumped to This table further puts to rest statements made on the companys increased cost of revenues affecting its profitability While costs of revenues are wellbeyond the billion mark annually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still has been able to grow its top and bottom lines What the above chart also suggests is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can and should increase prices again this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is likely to face less backlash if any given the increased options available to consumers today that were unavailable in and as shown on the table below The price of a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>membership even with last years price increase still looks like a bargain when compared to other options in the space Additionally not shown on the table is the rise in movie ticket prices not including concessions which hit an alltime yearly high of in the expensive costs to purchase a single season of a favorite TV series the growing trend of customers not wishing to own either DVDs or BluRays in favor of streaming everything they want to watch and the swelling prices of cable TV packages where customers are becoming disgruntled over the package prices the channel lineups or both Going back to Netflixs stronger competition does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>really have any direct competitors to begin with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bears seem to think so and their list looks similar to my chart above However I have called my chart simply options available When it comes to persons choice for lunch is pizza really a direct competitor to steak That is where Netflixs higher valuation begins to come into play You cant just compare library counts and declare a clear winner Library counts in this space is almost meaningless Quality and content is king A provider can easily build a library of titles if they are all titles no one wants to see However as of today it is hard to dispute that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt have the most robust library out of all the streaming services More importantly the potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to continue to build the quality and originality of its library while also building its membership base lays the foundation to its high stock valuation Lastly the time is now to increase prices because I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is sitting in a prime position where their price elasticity of demand is close to zero This means that given everything else occurring in the streaming services sector demand for a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>membership would not change significantly if at all if prices were to increase again by a reasonable amount anything from to per month Right now upper management has a slightly different view on raising prices During the fourth quarter conference call CFO David Wells stated that pricing tiers was the alternative to use for the nearterm instead of increasing monthly fees flat out a each year CEO Reed Hastings suggested the ability to increase top tier prices for Ultra HD customers in the future Supporting this scenario is the trends in customers purchasing Ultra HD TV sets Overall managements stance is to generate higher revenues under some method of increased pricing Higher revenues allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to expand This expansion allows it to develop and license more content while also improving services overall The company plans to spend at least billion in on content alone and over million on technology upgrades across all the platforms it supports On the customer side the most popular choice happens to be the second tier which is per month and gives customers access to HD quality programming and the ability to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on two separate platforms simultaneously This second tier happens to be the same tier that got the boost last May Source Google Finance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>year stock performance If anything can be said about Netflixs stock it is that there is no smooth ride One of the companys listed risk factors in their SEC filings admits that the companys stock is volatile If volatility is what you are interested in then Netflixs first quarter fiscal earnings scheduled for April is sure to not disappoint However looking at the longterm scenario for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>they are in the position other streaming services envy In contrast to what the bears believe increased content costs and socalled competition have been a blessing for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>now has the ability to create more original content than their rivals as their traditional licensing business model slowly evolves to their benefit The socalled competition has actually made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>prices more attractive as newcomers have entered the space with higher membership costs while others dont possess the same library in terms of content quality An increase of up to per month for Netflixs most popular package going from to would send shockwaves to the companys bottom line and even then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would still arguably be the best bargain in the streaming services space A less intuitive outcome could also occur if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>increases membership prices Many current subscribers are still waiting for their to increase to kick in sometime in A price increase now for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may help accelerate subscribers to get grandfathered in under current prices
