class='textDiv'>New Opportunities In Netflixs Hunt For Future Subscribers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Market in the US is almost saturated for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and most of the additional growth in subscriber numbers will be through international expansion One of the prime geographies which can provide mass market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is India With the arrival of a new G provider a cutthroat pricing war is looming which should make data intensive services like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>cheaper <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQ NFLX has amassed over million subscribers globally with close to million subscribers with the US In the fourth quarter it added million subscribers in the US against million internationally It looks like the US market is nearing saturation with over of households having Subscription Video on Demand SVOD services of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Prime Video or Hulu according to new Leichtman Research Group LRG report Although US market makes of the total subscribers for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>FBR analyst Baron Crockett has stated that the US streaming service would contribute a mere share to the stock with the remaining coming for international growth prospects A number of other markets are also nearing saturation including the UK and Canada The UK has million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers equating to SVOD penetration in the households and Canada has million subscribers equaling household penetration Nordic countries Sweden Norway Finland and Denmark also have million subscribers equaling coverage among households One of the markets which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can look to increase its subscribers is India and other neighboring countries like Pakistan Bangladesh and SouthEast Asian countries One of the biggest benefits of this region is that English is used as a second language in many of these countries Also there is a greater prevalence of Hollywood movies within the local market which can reduce the need to produce customized content Although customized content would still be needed As an example of the top ten boxoffice movies in India two were Hollywood movies Furious and Jurassic World According to a recent KPMG report the top Hollywood theatrical releases in India collected million which was more than last year The report says that the entire India box office collections were up percent to billion of which million were collected by Hollywood movies Besides these shows like Friends Big Bang Theory and Game of Thrones have cultlike following Most of the countries in these locations have started seeing a higher use of GG technologies providing better internet connectivity at lower prices This quarter will see full rollout of G services by Reliance Jio in India It is a part of Reliance Industries Limited RIL which had billion revenue in and has a market cap of billion Reliance Jio has bought panIndia G spectrum and is looking to spend a total of billion in this sector by financial year according to a report by Kotak Institutional Securities This rollout has led to intensified efforts by current incumbents to bolster their GG networks and bring down prices Currently the price tag for GB data by the three main players Airtel Idea and Vodafone India is around Indian Rupees INR or Although a final tariff plan has not been finalized by Reliance Jio most of the reports suggest a price tag of INR or for GB data might be taken by the firm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is priced at INR for a basic subscriber plan in India The Indian government is strongly favoring net neutrality which should benefit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Fig <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offers three plans in India at INR and with first month free We know that last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>users watched billion hours of content Dividing this by million subscribers gives us hours per subscriber in or hours per month Watching at basic quality takes GB data per hour Hence an average subscriber used GB data on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>per month Lower prices for G data will be possible if the firms are able to convince the users to increase their consumption of data <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is highest data guzzler among all other internet applications and services even leaving YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL behind Hence this should lead to a winwin situation for the provider and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The new G provider Reliance Jio can reduce the per GB cost of data and still keep the average revenue per user high and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also gains through a higher subscriber base Fig High data usage by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>platform in comparison to others This year an expected million smartphones will be sold in India The average price of smartphone devices is between to lower than China and other markets Fig Average selling price of smartphones in China and India SourceIDC Currently Airtel market leader within Indian telecom market is able to get average revenue per user ARPU of INR for data usage It has million users The per GB rate still stands at above INR or If the per GB rate falls to close to INR or by the entry of Reliance Jio we should see a massive surge in the number of users having G data plan Going by a recent Cisco NASDAQ CSCO report which estimated that Indian smartphone market can have million users by and if half of them use G data it will still provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with million possible customers A similar coverage percentage to Canada and the UK would provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>million additional subscribers in India A look at other popular platforms shows similar growth in the past Facebook has million monthly average users MAUs in India compared to million in the US and Canada Although it is not as data intensive There are huge stumbling blocks which the firm has to overcome in this market including customized content piracy reasonable pricing and more But it still remains one of the biggest possible markets for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which can be an engine for future growth for a long time Investors should watch the growth of telecom providers in South Asia and SouthEast Asia to estimate future growth potential of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers India is one of the main markets in this region with high usage of G smartphone devices and with cutthroat competition among telecom providers the data price should become very reasonable This will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gain an easier foothold in a market which can provide it tens of millions of additional subscribers and give good
