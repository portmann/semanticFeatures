entered a recession when rates were this low And it spells serious trouble for the financial system going forward Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Back in February Thorsten Heins thenCEO of what was once the iconic smartphone brand Blackberry publicly lied that its Hail Mary iPhone competitor the Z had record early sales He told CNET that BlackBerry nearly tripled the sales of its best performance over the first week in the UK while it had its best first day ever in Canada In fact it was more than percent better than any other launch day in our history in Canada Less than one year later and less than two years after he was hired the ruse was up Blackberrys US market share has fallen from to in four years and Thorsten was fired Fast forward to Monday morning when the SP had just hit its first limit down in history stocks were crashing countless ETFs were crashing more as ETF pricing models were corrupt and broken the QQQs were plummeting and none other than AAPL was set to open at a price of wiping out tens of billions of market cap overnight It is then that AAPL CEO Tim Cook may have pulled a page straight out of Thorsten Heins playbook when did something nobody expected him to do he panicked and emailed CNBC anchor Jim Cramer to do what the AAPL CEO himself admitted the company does not do by providing midquarter updates and assure the CNBC anchor that there is no need to sell AAPL stock I get updates on our performance in China every day including this morning and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last weeks Needless to say this stunning intervention by Tim Cook to arrest the plunge in AAPL stock succeeded and AAPL soared from to close back over a gain of nearly billion in market cap in turn dragging the entire market higher with it Yet what many have found problematic is that in emailing Jim Cramer with what was clearly material nonpublic information how long did Cramer have possession of Cooks email who did he privately share the information with first did Cramer trade on the information before going public with it etc Cook may have breached Regulation FD We wondered as much in our Monday post Did Tim Cook Violate Regulation Fair Disclosure By Emailing Jim Cramer To Save AAPL Stock This Morning Nearly a week later there is still no K even if grotesquely delayed with what should clearly have been a replica of the statement made by Cook to Cramer What we uncovered may explain why Tim Cook did not want to publicly file his all is well email to Cramer the simple reason is that Tim Cook may have simply been lying in order to halt the rout in his stock a rout which incidentaly had little to do with concerns about AAPLs Chinese sales and was driven by the latest HFTfacilitated marketwide flash crash as we described previously Of course accusations that Tim Cook is lying should be taken very seriously which is why instead of relying on Thorsten Heins pardon Tim Cooks selfassessment we went with the latest AAPL channel check out of GFK Germanys largest market research institute For those who are unaware GfK is almost universally accepted as the best source for endmarket demand collecting and aggregating point of sale data from servers at all major retailers collecting real time consumer data as well as conducting manual channel checks at smaller retailers In short if something is selling with an upward trajectory GfK will know about it with about an confidence interval And vice versa Apples global exNA outlook worsened slightly with the additional JULAUG weekly data Units are now forecast to grow qq prior Softer early AUG trends in China were only partially offset by resilience in Dev Asia In China iPhone demand softened in the final week of JUL and remained at such levels in AUG weekly data Figure Apple as a result is expected to see more pronounced share loss in China than prior expectations though units are still expected to grow yy In Japan iPhone improved meaningfully in AUG despite no material ASP movements Sonys Xperia Z was most impacted following its shortlived demand uptick in JUL Figure Apple lost share mm in final JUL data with iPhone Plus unit demand declining mm This was worse than the mm decline seen for the sc in JUL and was also weaker than GfKs expectations Apples US smartphone share fell as a result to a level below that seen LY Figure The downtick was more pronounced for iPhone and drove the Plus ratio from in JUN to in JUL iPhone Plus continues to significantly outperform the sc launch to date with units only modestly below the growth seen through JUN m qq yy prior m qq yy International sellout m qq prior m qq yy unchanged Inventory build of m units unchanged While the above data has a roughly week lag but considering the explosion of market volatility into the past two week period it is certain that sales if anything deteriorated as the Shanghai Composite went red for the year after soaring two months ago So what can we make of the above data Here are GfKs highlights The Q outlook for Apple has softend notably as a result of weaker trends not only in the US but in China the place where Cook assured Cramer Apple has experienced strong growth in its business US unit demand declined in July far more than the drop a year prior and weaker than GfKs own expectations This could point to substantial weakness over the next months for Apple considering last year ahead of the iPhone launch the sales decline was about half of the current decline even without a major new phone rollout imminent This may mean that the upgrade cycle was much stronger andor shorter until now and is starting to fade dramatically The data started deteriorating before the recent rout in Chinese stocks and EM currencies which make products such as the iPhone more expensive Keep in mind most of the future growth for Apple is expected to come from Emerging Markets and China now that the US only accounts for a third of total sales If one uses channel check data to objectively determine end demand the answer is a resounding yes To be sure Cook may be telling the truth in a very narrow sense if Apple is simply be resorting to the oldest trick in the book at this point channel stuffing The problem with channel stuffing is that it only allows you to mask the problem for quarters at which unless there has been a dramatic improvement in the enddemand picture it reemerges that much more acutely just ask AOL which was channel stuffing for months on end only to be ultimately exposed leading to a epic plunge in the stock price So is AAPL the next AOL and is Tim Cook the next Thorsten Heins It all depends on China if the worlds most populous nation can get its stock market its economy and its currency under control then this too shall pass The problem is that if as many increasingly suggest China has lost control of all three At that point anyone who thought they got a great deal when buying AAPL at will have far better opportunities to dollarcost average far far lower Oh and to anyone still holding their breath for AAPL to file a public statement which may well contain an outright lie you may exhale now Sat falak pema That aint American Thats downright Bolshy as they used to say Sat Cognitive

trained lawyer who has a history of frontrunning information he garnered as a result of his position with CNBC cant play the ignorance card here Cramer a former hedge fund manager who CERTAINLY knew the implications of Cooks statement instantly should have been the one to raise his hand and tell Cook no I wont broadcast this info for the same reason that I wouldnt broadcast this info if the CEO of a pinksheet bucket shop made this same call to me go file your SEC disclosure and THEN come onto my show dude Cramer surely knew that this information would spike the stock Will be interesting to see how many of his buds were buying calls right before the broadcast Sat Winston Churchill Sat New_Meat Sun jnx One look and handle of the Samsung S and its quite clear that Apple has serious issues
