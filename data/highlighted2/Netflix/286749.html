Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>recently expanded into more countries This global expansion will likely benefit from new contentaware video compression technology from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Theres a great chance that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX will repeat its amazing stock market run of YTD performance this year Aside from the alleged suspension of Apples NASDAQ AAPL planned subscriptiononly streaming TV service the expansion to new countries will greatly help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>protect its growth momentum <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>currently has more than million paying customers However there is a chance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could hit million subscribers soon because of the potential subscribers coming from new countries This massive expansion was likely partly made possible by Netflixs new pertitle video compression technology The company announced last month that it is implementing a pertitle or contentaware method of video encoding This is to create betterlooking video files for subscribers with limited internet speeds As we all know a majority of the worlds countries still lag behind America and Europe when it comes to internet connection speeds The longterm success of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in Latin America India Africa Indonesia and the Philippines depends on whether it can stream efficiently to people with less than Mbps average internet speed Millions of people in emerging markets can definitely afford the month subscription fee of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>However the sad state of monopolydriven telecom services in emerging countries means the majority of people in these places have expensive DSLG LTE connections As a result most people in emerging countries are probably only paying for or Mbps monthly plans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>did right in retooling its streaming platform to adapt to the substandard internet connections of its new markets I live in the Philippines and my towns average DSL internet speed is Mbps Without better video encoding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have a lower total addressable market in countries where the majority of residents have slow internet connections The universal improvement in video compressionstreaming will help Filipino subscribers get a satisfactory <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>experience even on their Mbps DSL connection The happier the customer is the more chances he will stay loyal to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The more people in emerging markets who become loyal monthlypaying customers the better chance there is for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to fortify its position as the worlds most successful streaming video company Consequently customer satisfaction also requires companies to innovate or they risk losing customers The new contentaware video compression technology is a good sign that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still innovating Like other firms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>previously used an automated onesizefitsall bitrate ladder method to stream videos suitable to the detected internet speed of a user Netflixs old method used the old chart below to create different compressed versions of its content However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>found the old bitrate ladder method to be inefficient Different TV showmovie files were shotproduced by content owners using different resolutions Netflixs new automated contentaware video compression technology will be able to differentiate simple D cartoonsTV shows from Khighresolution Hollywoodmade movies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can then encode and stream better quality simple TV showsAnimation movies intended for people with slower net connections Thanks to the contentaware optimization from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a subscriber with a DSL connection of Mbps will now be able to watch a better HDquality p cartoon movie instead of just an SD version p Furthermore subscribers with mbps or faster connections also get better simple content HD videos compressed using higher bitrates I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to continue improving its video compression and streaming technology The current version of the pertitle video compressionencoding only saves around bandwidth Since last year even though its service was largely limited to North America and Europe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>already accounted for of global internet down traffic This could go only go higher now that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is streaming to more countries The bandwidthhogging business of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>requires the company to optimize its streaming platform Wireless and fixedline telecom operators especially those in emerging countries will appreciate a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>service that doesnt put too much pressure on their DSLG network infrastructures I expect foreign telecom operators to also imitate TMobiles NASDAQ TMUS Binge On program of providing free unlimited mobile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>streaming to its customers Anything that encourages more people to use their phonestablets to stream videos is always good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The Binge On free program limits video streaming to p resolution this is a perfect template for emerging countries with slow and expensive cellular data plans NFLX is a Buy The momo valuation of this stock is due to its continuing doubledigit growth in number of subscribers The new markets will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>recruit millions more subscribers this year Sure there are now local players that ply their streaming pay TV trades in Asia like HOOQ and iFlix However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>touts a much bigger content library than other smaller payTV firms Content is king and it will remain a major factor toward winning the loyalty of subscribers Furthermore Netflixs decision to spend billion to develop and publish original content this year is a sign of maturity Thirdparty content licensing has always been a heavy handicap for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>With a billion budget HBO only spend billion for original content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could hire the best actors directors and writers to come up with more hit TV shows and movies Exclusive content is a very attractive incentive for customers to keep renewing their monthly subscriptions By aggressively focusing more on original content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also has better chances of improving its future operating margins I expect the Chinese government to also eventually issue a license for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to operate in China before ends China due to its huge population of million smartphoneinternet users is the perfect market for any premium streaming video service provider </div></body></html>
