#A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Comcast is a major step forward for these two companies The FCC has pushed for increasing openness for settop boxes In early July as investors saw <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX shares begin to tumble on news of a downgrade by Needham the share price quickly reversed when the company announced that it had entered into a deal with sometimes rival Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA to allow users of the X system to receive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content through their settop boxes On a yeartodate basis Comcast is up over nearly while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is down over While there have been a range of opinions on the value of the deal from Netflixs perspective there has been surprisingly little comment on what the deal means for Comcast Ultimately the deal is likely a longterm positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but represents an additional erosion of Comcasts security as a top cable company plus the latest reverberation of the FCCs Unlock the Box campaign Last week these two media giants announced that they had reached an accord through which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content would soon be available directly to Comcast customers who use the X system Comcasts newest technology Currently roughly of subscribers use the X box but the cable giant says it expects that number to be up to by the end of the year Neither company is giving a lot of details according to a recent Wall Street Journal article We have much work to do before the service will be available to consumers later this year Well provide more details at that time By the numbers Comcast X users number around million with that number expected to grow to million by yearend If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can attract a significant amount of these subscribers to its service this could significantly bolster its US grow statistics which have slowed Even with these numbers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>valuation its PE ratio is currently above is hard to justify Investors should expect the most significant growth to come from deepening penetration into Asia At current price levels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should be considered between a buy and neutral There is some shortterm upside heading into earnings but longerterm there needs to be more clarity to justify holding the stock in ones core portfolio While Comcast which still lacks the shiniest reputation with customers will certainly declare the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>deal as a victory and extol their expanding capabilities against the backdrop of increasing cordcutting the deal is another reason to be short the stock In midFebruary the FCC approved a proposal that put a significant part of Comcasts business in its crosshairs The company has tried to counter the FCC position by taking its own steps perhaps making a Federal regulation unnecessary but the issue continues to threaten the companys core business In April Comcast attempted to flout the need for regulation when it announced that it was putting its technology in certain smart TVs as well as through Roku devices The commission responded to the move by saying that it appears to offer only a proprietary Comcastcontrolled user interface and seems to allow only Comcast content on different devices rather than allowing those devices to integrate or search across Comcast content as well as other content consumers subscribe to While the deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may be some further response to the situation it seems unlikely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be sufficiently integrated to satisfy the objective of Unlock the Box The numbers for Comcast suggest that the end of settop box rentals could make a significant impact With an estimated billion a year being spent by consumers to lease these boxes the end of this revenue would be significant If one estimated that Comcast has million subscribers and uses the commissions estimate of an average of per year per customer this represents a loss of billion per annum if box leasing disappears That is not a small hole to fill The reason however that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>deal should give investors further pause is that it demonstrates that the erosion is happening from both sides Comcast access is becoming boxfree and other apps are being added to the Comcast platform Given the expense of Comcast service in either world there is little justification for the cost A great deal of the content available on Comcast is available elsewhere and when Comcast is juxtaposed as it will be against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>consumers are likely to see just how disproportionately expensive it is With the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>deal Comcast subscribers should determine that for the relative value the cheap <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscription often less than the X rental fee is better accessed without Comcast at all As the industry moves increasingly in this direction despite strong yeartodate performance and a dividend yield of Comcast is a short The deal represents the first penetration for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a serious market disruptor into the ecosystem of a major provider Investors should expect to see more of these deals and at an increasing rate While it is hard to imagine a company as large and diverse as Comcast will not find diversification techniques to offset some of the potential losses there is meaningful downside in the stock over the longterm
