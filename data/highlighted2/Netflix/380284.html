class='textDiv'>Disney Look Here For Growth The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha Late last year Disney launched a directtoconsumer subscriptionbased streaming service and app DisneyLife DisneyLife is special because of its niche market and rich globally recognized content Besides being different DisneyLife is a costefficient and optimal margin expansion strategy for Disney to maximize revenues from its content and its IP portfolio After ESPNs subscriber numbers started to decline there have been a series of bearish sentiments aiming at Disneys NYSE DIS lack of diversification These bearish sentiments were answered in part by Disneys effort to launch a directtoconsumer subscriptionbased streaming service and app in the United Kingdom DisneyLife DisneyLife can be accessed through a dedicated app on tablets smartphones and TV streaming boxes like the new Apple NASDAQ AAPL TV The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX like service lets families of up to six stream Disney movies TV shows music audiobooks and ebooks online DisneyLife gives subscribers access to classic Disneyanimated movies and the entire collection of Pixaranimated films According to Corey Robertson from The Disney Blog Disney has plans to expand DisneyLife to other markets such as France Spain Italy and Germany starting this fiscal year But based on a recent comment by the CEO at the Deutsche Bank Media Internet and Telecom Conference on March DisneyLife has not yet fully taken off We believe DisneyLife will be a margin growth story that will enable Disney to diversify its revenue stream from selling content to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and from its gains in its stake in Hulu to selling content directly to consumers Many companies have started selling content directly to consumers to compete with online rivals who are disrupting traditional television business models and transforming the way that people watch TV A few companies who have original content already package their content and sell it directly to consumers Aside from wellknown media companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Hulu and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN niche players have entered the market with original content These niche players include the World Wrestling Entertainments NYSE WWE WWE Network HBOs NYSE TWX standalone Internet streaming service and Major League Baseballs MLBTV etc We believe the decline in ESPN viewership and the need to diversify revenues was one of the major catalysts for Disneys decision to launch DisneyLife Let me first of all I think putting it in perspective a little bit what were seeing in the marketplace today is not that different than what we anticipated ESPN is always priced robustly our pricing would moderate meaning wed be able to take increases but not at the rate that we were getting them before And with that in mind its actually one of the reasons why we thought about diversifying the company moreSo what we thought we would do is strengthen our competitive position in the marketplace and we did that by licensing great sports for longterm periods of time investing in our content original and live sports and investing in digital which is essentially means not only giving ESPN subscribers an opportunity to watch ESPN on mobile platforms but giving us more touch points with the consumer Bob Iger at the Deutsche Bank Media Internet Telecom Conference on March First Disney was anticipating the decline in ESPN viewership as stated in the quote above As a result Disney wanted to diversify the company more by giving Disney more touch points with the consumer Hence the reason why alternative sources of revenue such as DisneyLife were only launched approximately six months after the introduction of skinny bundles since initial basic Skinny bundles did not include ESPN The decline in ESPN numbers is not because Americans or the rest of the world suddenly developed a hatred for sports Part of this decline is due to basic skinny bundles such as the FiOS Custom TV which did not include sports programming But after Disney sued Verizon NYSE VZ Verizon decided to offer two lowcost basic TV packages one with sports and the other one without DisneyLife is a niche market and its Total Addressable Market TAM includes any parent or any guardian with kids around the age of years old Weve gotten a strong sense for our pricing were out at I think We have learned a lot about marketing which we havent even kicked in in a big way yet were doing that end of this month And weve learned a fair amount about programming What I mean by that is what people want when they subscribe to the service and its largely movies and TV shows The games and the books are nice but theyre subscribing to this for movies and television And that Disney matters Parents with kids under even those that subscribe to Sky and a multichannel bundle are still interested in buying this as an addon or bolton service for their children So what weve accomplished and weve really only just begun I think launched in December or maybe Thanksgiving time is actually significant for us as a company because the opportunity to launch this in other markets we believe is pretty great We just havent made any decisions about which markets and when Bob Iger Chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company at the Deutsche Bank Media Internet Telecom Conference March Page DisneyLife is unique because of Disneys rich worldly recognized branded intellectual properties Disney has an outstanding list of movies meant for kids such as The Lion King Beauty and the Beast Finding Nemo Toy Story Monsters Inc Inside Out etc This is why Disney was able to start pricing DisneyLife at Because of its unique content and niche market we believe there is a market for a premium service like DisneyLife In a market where every major player is investing heavily in original quality content Disney is wellpositioned to excel because it has the capital to develop or acquire great content In addition to capital DisneyLife is backed by a portfolio of highquality branded intellectual property developed and acquired by the Walt Disney company over the years Besides the demand for Disney animated movies is alive and strong When you look at the worldwide list of the highest grossing movies of all time Disney animated movies such as Frozen Toy Story The Lion King Finding Nemo etc rank as the th th th rd highest grossing movies of all time on the domestic international and worldwide box offices This proves that the demand for Disneys movies is as strong as ever Consequently it is our contention that DisneyLife will excel as an addon service for children This will be a costefficient revenue stream for Disney because Disney will be able to realize more revenues by selling content directly to consumers Aside from being a catalyst to Disneys stock price appreciation this is critical for Disney investors as any margin expansion initiatives allow Disney to sustain and grow its dividends overtime Disney has something particularly significant going on for it that other digital movie providers such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon are spending billions of dollars to imitate their own content From Winnie the Pooh to Mickey Mouse Disney has created some of the most iconic characters in history It is more likely that parents who grew up watching Disney or Pixar movies are likely to let their kids watch the same Good parents would like their kids to watch nonviolet and nonsexual contents and DisneyLife offers one solution to that DisneyLife is a lucrative alternative source of revenues for two main reasons First it is a costefficient solution It is cost effective because it eliminates middlemen and maximize margins by taking its content directly to consumers Second it enables the entertainment giant to optimize on the value of its IP and realize more revenues from its rich brands by charging a premium on some of the worlds best animated films ever created Subsequently this is important for Disney investors because Disneys efforts to diversify revenues will mitigate the ESPN problems and thus bolster investor confidence in the stock Lastly any margin expansion initiatives enable Disney to sustain and grow dividends Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
