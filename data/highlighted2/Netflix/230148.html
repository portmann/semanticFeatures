sheet items <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has days of inventory outstanding a massive number Days inventory outstanding has grown by in the past years leaving questions as to whether enough cost has been ascribed to revenues When accounting for offbalance sheet items days payables outstanding sit at also an extremely large number and have grown by since Q Cash from operations has turned extraordinarily negative while net income has stayed positive This has been recently driven by incrementally larger new content costs versus old amortizing content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>trades at a blistering x EVEBITDA multiple Given the above red flags and lower EBITDA growth I have a price target implying downside from current levels It has never sat well with me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX has offbalance sheet liabilities representing a whopping of its total onbalance sheet assets nor that its total streaming content obligations on and offbalance sheet are a massive billion pool of obligations that represents of assets onbalance sheet This massive pool of streaming content creates uncertainty in that there is potentially room to manipulate income statement accounts in order to boost margins For example inventory accounts are increased by purchases of inventory and decreased by the use of that inventory when the product is sold this is called cost of goods sold or COGS A company facing increasing costs with a massive amount of inventory could get away with expensing less cost through COGS than they should for every dollar of revenue earned This increases margins but in an unsustainable way as it leaves behind a bloated inventory account One way investors can detect if accounting shenanigans such as this occur is by analyzing working capital versus income statement accounts to see how they perform over time Metrics such as days inventory outstanding days payables outstanding and the cash conversion cycle are particularly important here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>categorizes its inventory as current content library net and has an account in addition to its payables account called current content liabilities that is also effectively a payables account In its Q for the period ended it discloses BN in its current content library and BN in current content liabilities Under note Commitments and Contingencies it discloses a total of BN in aggregate shortterm streaming commitments or BN in additional offbalance sheet liabilities To correctly analyze the working capital accounts we must capitalize the offbalance sheet liabilities creating a liability accounts payable and an asset inventory account Adding the BN to the current content library we get BN in total current content AKA inventory Inventory turnover is T COGS average inventory Per <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>filings T COGS is BN avg adj inventory BN The is an average Days inventory outstanding is inventory turnover so days of inventory outstanding an incredibly high number by any standard Red flag number one Another important test is to see how days of inventory outstanding performs over time An increasing number may indicate management is not costing enough inventory Management teams facing increasing costs may do this to reduce COGS thereby increasing margins beyond what is actually feasible The result is an unsustainable and bloated inventory as cost that should have been accounted for in the income statement gets left behind in inventory SOURCE <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Q and K Filings Since Q Netflixs days of inventory outstanding has risen from to a worrisome and a RED FLAG Days Payables Outstanding Red Flags Days payables outstanding is another metric that should shine light on how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is managing its balance sheet Accounts payable turnover is purchasesT COGSaverage accounts payable We must first capitalize the current offbalance sheet liabilities of BN and add them to Netflixs current content liabilities account of BN which is just a payables account in disguise We must also add the other traditional payable account of BN they have as well So Q accounts payable of BN We also need Q AP to get an average BN Using the adjusted inventory calculated earlier and COGS from Netflixs financial statements we get accounts payable turnover and days payables outstanding another exceedingly high number and our RED FLAG Another metric to examine is how days payables outstanding performs over time as an increasing number may indicate management looking to preserve fee cash flow by not paying their bills on time SOURCE <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Q and K Filings Since Q days payables outstanding has increased from to or by In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>they may be forced to extend the time they pay their bills given the pressure theyre experiencing from an operating cash flow perspective The amount of cash they are spending on content has turned free cash flow dramatically negative and extending the time by which they pay for their content helps to mitigate this free cash flow deficit Another good metric to follow is the cash conversion cycle or how quickly a company can turn inventory back into cash It is calculated by adding days inventory outstanding days sales outstanding days payables outstanding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>customers pay by credit card so days sales outstanding is likely minimal They have an other current assets account with BN in it BN of which was deferred tax assets the balance may be receivables but the company states in its Q for the period ended that our receivables from members generally settle quickly so I will conservatively assume days sales outstanding Currently the cash conversion cycle stands at days SOURCE <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Q and K Filings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is losing balance sheet efficiency as the cash conversion cycle increases to a high of in the latest quarter According to Netflixs Q and K Filings the cause of this large gap down in cash from operations is the large differential between the additions to streaming content and the amortization of streaming content In the period ended NFLX added BN in content and amortized only BN This indicates to me that old streaming content contracts are coming off and new content is likely getting more expensive They are likely also increasing the total amount of content available which goes well with the idea that theyre expanding their reach globally but they are doing so at a rate that VASTLY outpaces the cash coming into the business hence the negative cash from operations and likely the reason they announced a price increase for all members <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>currently trades at a blistering x EVEBITDA multiple This is one of the highest multiples of any stock I have seen in recent years A x multiple can be thought of as an expectation that EBITDA will grow at for the foreseeable future in order to get to an EVEBITDA to Growth ratio of Below is a historical chart of EBITDA growth with the highlighted white line the implied EBIDTA growth expectation from the multiple Just by eyeballing this chart the median EBITDA growth rate is roughly the green line Netflixs multiple is approximately x too expensive Given the massive pool of streaming asset obligations worth of the balance sheet the concerning levels and growth of days inventory and days payables outstanding the large disconnect between cash from operations and net income and the nosebleed EVEBITDA multiple I believe Netflixs stock is grossly overvalued I have a price target of based on a x EVEBITDA multiple a x EVEBITDA to Growth ratio implying downside from current prices This happens to coincide with Netflixs December valuation a time when investors were
