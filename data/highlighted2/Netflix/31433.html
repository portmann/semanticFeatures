Netflixs latest earnings report shocked analysts as a result of its substantial increase in subscribers The companys gamble on multiple new original programming has been a success and an underlying reason behind the subscriber surge So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has not been really impacted by streaming live services like Sling and Vue but Apples upcoming entry could be a game changer For those of you who have read my past columns tied to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX it shouldnt come as a surprise that Im bullish on the stock Of course when the company releases stats like it did yesterday you can see the reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is currently in a good place and its important to reflect on why A big part of that is people are finally seeing the billion it spent in developmental projects begin to deliver House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black held down the fort for a long time but now reinforcements have arrived to the point that there is a logjam of new original content and more on the way The NBCturned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>comedy Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt kicked off the new arrivals with the Kyle Chandlerled ensemble Bloodline coming soon after and the Marvel comicsbased Daredevil joining the fray last weekend And thats just the start as the summer will bring the Lily TomlinJane Fonda comedy Grace Frankie Wachowski sibling drama Sense and the TV adaptation of cult film Wet Hot American Summer to the mix along with the third season of Orange set for a June return Thats a lot of new exclusive programming and so far the word on Schmidt Bloodline and Daredevil is very positive Yes we dont have ratings info to back it up nor will we soon but good buzz is good buzz and if you look at the reviews and headlines tied to Netflixs newest trio youll find many more positive comments than negative especially tied to Daredevil The future remains bright in this category for investors as all of those new series have been renewed along with mainstays House of Cards and Orange for which paired with other interesting projects like the continuation of its Marvel deal the Planet Earth documentary sequel Our Planet and Adam Sandlers Ridiculous present a solid slate Its actually fascinating because now its even more crystal clear how much ratings really impact a series fate Gone are the days where executives would take a chance and keep series like Seinfeld on air just because they believed in it Now they are beholden to the and numbers which is a little better but still if a show starts slow it may not recover as word of mouth is impactful Now to be fair the lack of ratings information does give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a huge advantage over the traditional broadcasters but lets be honest executives have to know when they greenlight shows like the critically vilified Manhattan Love Story the odds are not going to be in their favor regardless Netflixs model is dependent on adding quality shows not shows just to fill a schedule up which is also why it hasnt been greatly impacted thus far by livestreaming products like Dishs NASDAQ DISH Sling or Sonys NYSE SNE Vue Thats another valuable point to hit on as many arent thinking clearly when comparing these products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Hulu and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Prime shouldnt be seen as rivals to Sling or Vue they are more of complements If youre paying for the basic Sling or Vue package you arent paying as much as you were with cable and because of that spending another on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or a similar service for additional content is still affordable Sling and Vue are also based on a right now live model while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and the like are based on a VODon my schedule model it shouldnt be an eitheror proposition Now despite this current success I will admit that it remains to be seen how a potential entry by Apple NASDAQ AAPL into the streaming TV field will change the game Anything Apple touches has the potential to erupt in a big way and while the model is reportedly similar to SlingVue never underestimate what the Apple name means to consumers However the other big story to come from the news was that at the companys shareholders meeting on June executives plan to call for a stock split to make the stock more affordable to new investors Moneycom does a great job of breaking down exactly what the split means but stresses that it will have no real value on the stock its more cosmetic than anything else While hes right that cosmetic value is still something to note as perception is everything and Netflixs entire business model is based around changing the perception of the traditional media model Perception is also something other analysts warn about as some fear this is a facade and as it is unreasonable to assume <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can keep this momentum going I respect their opinions and understand their reasoning but from my perspective all this company has been doing lately is proving it can add and keep subscribers at a strong rate because of the value it brings to the table You cant overlook that Netflixs business is contentdriven and right now it happens to be particularly strong The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>earnings report caught everyone by surprise because the sheer number of additional subscribers was really stunning but again if you look at the success of its programming it does make sense and even despite a lack of ratings info to justify it that theory is supported by top Hollywood insiders Of course its possible that could change down the line but for now the company made a billion gamble and it worked Source Netflixs Strong Subscriber Count Speaks
