at the time Investors have been wondering why a longterm AAPL bull turned into a bear and quite frankly it was mostly driven by shifts in my own fundamental assumptions Furthermore the weakness in the market environment in conjunction with forwardlooking indicators forced me to change my stance on AAPL towards the end of the year Clearly I was very optimistic and at the time I felt like I had connected the dots correctly However my observations were clearly incorrect which resulted in some missed calls However as more material information surfaced I changed my stance In the end I was timely enough to alert investors to further downside in Apple One of my readers asked me to chronicle why I had changed my stance on Apple NASDAQ AAPL over the year and with the overwhelming response among readers demanding me to reply back to that comment with an article here I am I dont have the original question on hand and its extremely long to quote But essentially the reader asked Why did you change your stance on AAPL over the course of Very good question and its worth writing an entire article on Alright so where do I even begin Going into FY basically Q of I made a couple flawed assumptions on Apple I thought demand for iPad would recover Tim Cook was banging the table saying that the segment would produce much better results given enough time Yeah it was the worst year on record for the iPad and that decline wasnt mitigated with the timely release of the iPad Pro the product had many delays and was never released in the timeframe I was operating on I also thought the Apple Watch would hit the sales channel with volume production in QFY Nope that never happened GT Advanced Technologies went bankrupt delaying initial supply I then thought the market would value the company at a higher multiple nope that never happened the equity market was weak and whatever strength Apple could exhibit got sapped away in the latter half of the year I was expecting healthier gross margins due to product mix shift to higher memory and screen tiers nope gross margins improved marginally because the initial ramp of various new devices along with higher component cost inputs mitigated the upward momentum on margins Furthermore growth was heavily lopsided to Chinas rapid consumption growth which was fueled by speculation over the Chinese economy Again reading into the Chinese macro figures shows a pattern of economic moderation with GDP growth primarily being driven by GDP per capita as the primary basis for growth Moving from low middle class to affluent is a statistical shift that takes time The spread between household income and GDP growth widened which is why speculation over the rise of a consumerclass China became the primary justification to overweighting of cyclical Chinese names Unfortunately the spread widening doesnt create an overnight population of hungry consumers with comparable wallets to the EU and United States Its a great leading indicator but unfortunately it couldnt support the rapid expansion of the Shanghai Composite Index Investors started to discount Apples exposure to China as a result of market pricing which weighs on the minds of analysts to this day I also thought Apple Pay would be immediately accretive to operating profits to the tune of a couple billion dollars whoops not a lot of people used the thing and competing services started to surface in the span of a couple quarters I was expecting something better than the big announcement at WWDC The new service that was launched this year Apple Music hardly a needle mover because its more of a replacement to Apples cash cow business iTunes The company just repositioned itself in music which is more about managing risk and staying relevant Its not going to meaningfully impact revenue due to the competing nature of streaming as opposed to perpetual music licenses When I closed out I made this big claim that Apple would go to I think readers remember this article because it was so widely read in comparison to all the other instances where I do the moonwalk backwards and start lowering my PT throughout The sad irony was that the company had a pretty stellar year and reported revenue that was just shy of the billion I had forecast for FY All they needed were Apple Watch sales to reach that incremental billion gap in my forecast I also thought gross margins would be pretty good due to the low cost of Apple Watch components and the spread of pricing tiers to push ASPs higher Unfortunately at the time I did not realize that the software development cost for Watch OS would be so large and various production ramp issues would mitigate profitability so significantly Therein lies the reason why I was off by a factor of or something Remember when you operate off of a multiple the difference in EPS is enough to throw forecast assumptions off by a lot I also felt like the company had such a blowout quarter in Q that sentiment would surf the stock so much higher Instead the stock found its resistance area in the mids as everyone sort of caught onto the realization that things werent going to get much better than this In fact Carl Icahn more or less signaled the top of the euphoria with his big splash of an article in the middle of the year where he paints a picture perfect world for Apple investors Of course hes held onto his position despite the challenging environment for stocks in general The various concerns that started to materialize throughout the year started to eat away at investor confidence with the exception of Icahn of course But then again Carl Icahn is a pretty gutsy guy and has super high risk tolerance If he can hold onto <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Im sure he can withhold any temptation of selling a somewhat volatile stock like Apple I say somewhat volatile but in reality its very volatile It just isnt the rollercoaster ride <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was So if youre mentioning Carl Icahn as a pillar for investor sentiment hes not the guy Hes a bit more contrarian and hes way more patient when compared to the vast majority of fund managers I have ever interacted with Hes also an activist so his edge gives him more confidence to hold onto a stock So where do I start to turn back my stance on Apple Well my euphoric optimism started to peak out at I couldnt come up with any other reasons for why the stock could possibly do any better so I started to question myself over the next couple months I revised my EPS estimate lower in response to Q results which later proved to be too high I anticipated market sentiment to improve so I raised my price target to But as we had moved throughout the year the entire market didnt produce any returns The faster moving horse ie Apple was going up as fast as it possibly could The remaining companies were struggling because their low single digit growth rates were mitigated by currency headwinds with no hedges to offset the impact Commodity prices rapidly deflated so investors thought this was a precursor to a deflationary environment which made it difficult for the Fed to raise rates in response to CPI pressure I also had to take into consideration the slowdown in MA activity following a rate hike which puts downward pressure on valuations In the end I concluded the market multiple would struggle in an environment like this As such the respective return of Apple when compared to the market was limited which eventually led to multiple compression The year wore on and my fears about a flat market environment that couldnt break past key resistance levels continued to wear on me I knew then at this point I would have to revise my stance lower despite the strong performance of Apple There was just no way Apple could outpace the market so substantially without the entire market going along for the ride The force of gravity came down on Apple investor sentiment as it did with every other stock The best run company on Earth was no exception to this so I started making my way towards the exit before it got too crowded I lowered my PT from to in this specific article and revised my stance to be more broadly inline At this point I got the right figures as I revised to billion in sales and EPS the company later goes onto report billion for FY and basic EPS So I get things a lot closer leading up to the final quarter The price target I arrive at was roughly where I stood in Q When looking back if I had plugged in the right figures I would have arrived at the right price target I also thought that there was no way the stock was going to revisit because it already happened Quite frankly the market is forward looking so I have to move over to estimates to get an accurate idea of how the stock will behave in the last quarter of I started to weigh valuation risk questioned whether smartphone demand could be sustained and whether Apple can mitigate the negative aspects of its business model on the S part of the cycle I also realized that they couldnt do this without better product features The product didnt improve its base storage configurations or along the entire product stack Prices for NAND flash fell precipitously so thats when I called out Tim Cook for being too reliant on the strength of the brand as he fell short of a reasonable quality threshold given the premium pricing of the iPhone I also realized that issues pertaining to demand were beginning to percolate given the search engine trends that a Jefferies analyst highlighted in the beginning of October I didnt take those risks too seriously because I weighted the comments from Tim Cook higher as he mentioned iPhone units will grow in QFY on the QFY quarterly conference call Unfortunately more bad news started to surface from channel checks from analysts like Credit Suisse UBS and even Morgan Stanley Ill update the commentary on analysts over the course of the week The weakness in demand that was indicated by search trends in the beginning of October started to show up in channel checks towards the middle of November at this point I couldnt ignore the potential weakness in FY results and potential downside to the valuation of the stock At this point Im pretty bearish on the stock and my revision to my most recent financial model wasnt really wellreceived by the AAPL investment community I also had to factor in more multiple compression because of environmental factors and historical volatility I revised my price target from to and my timing couldnt have been more perfect given todays market price I realize that many of you are blanketing me with comparisons to other contributors or have made blanket accusations on some of the stuff I had said in the past year They were all honest mistakes and I feel that Ive corrected my stance quickly enough before things got a little too carried away Of course theres always room for further improvement and Im hoping that given enough time a compelling opportunity for buying Apple on the cheap does in fact emerge At that point Id be very compelled to switch my stance but until a compelling valuation does surface I continue to reiterate my sell recommendation and price target We only use your contact details to reply
