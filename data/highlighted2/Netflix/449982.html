#A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha We built and attached a DCF model to provide each reader an instrument to run their own sensitivities moving on more than variables in the input panel The decision to create original contents as well as the NetflixEverywhere plan marked the crucial steps to become a major company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is one of the most iconic corporations of the Internet related economy Its success is substantially based on four pillars Generally the market is quite efficient in pricing the potential revenue expansion of a company and its ability to generate cash However sometimes mispricing situations could emerge and threaten the wealth of a highlyexposed investor Now if we look at Netflixs stock price performance it is rational to assess with skepticism the increase since the increase since and the more incredible explosion since the beginning of In addition what has grabbed our attention as value investors is the following <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>PE table The aim of this article is neither to explain the terrific Netflixs share price evolution we have been experiencing since its listing nor a priori judgment on its multiples It is a more neutral observation of the market to eventually give insights of what could be Netflixs path in our view As the company starts to generate cash and visibility about future results rises it made sense for us to create a DCF model and better understand which drivers could have been responsible for the current price as of July st We chose a numberdriven analysis since we evaluate most of the articles we read about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as lacking real financial content and often targeting consensus instead of objectivity We modeled the cash flows for years and then we used a stage terminal value estimation to sum up the value of a company in a growing at a decreasing rate perpetuity We separately considered the three business segments because they have different growth patterns Graph and most of all different margins Then adopting a macro view we tried to appraise the potential audience considering the reference market Let us begin with the domestic segment In recent years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has delivered impressive numbers in terms of membership net addition reaching about million of subscribers at the end of this years Q Since the company has been able to add in average million users each year with a CAGR The management has a longterm objective to reach to million homes In our analysis the US population represents the broader market As the graph below shows the aggregate actual number of cable and broadband TV users is over million at the end of meaning of the US population Furthermore these numbers exhibit a clear trend cable companies are slowly losing customers while SVOD companies are able to add new subscribers each quarter We believe the company could realistically achieve about million subscribers at the end of with an CAGR We forecast a growth in then decreasing each year until We expect a similar path because of the following considerations So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has produced unique content which are greatly appreciated by the public Along with its platform the competitive advantage of the company is the ability to retain customers by streaming the most appreciated TV series and movies We wont want to further discuss this point because the company has been proved successful Estimating million customers in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have approximately of the expected US population The objective to reach million homes seems a little bit too optimistic since it will mean out of people in the US will have and pay a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>membership Competitors are aware of the potential the market has and will compete as hard as they can to gain market share The competition has already started and it is coming from Amazon NASDAQ AMZN HBO and Hulu Furthermore in line with the decision to raise prices in May we decided to constantly increase the Average Revenue Per Unit ARPU by each year meaning a average increase on the monthly plan Despite the astonishing numbers shown by the domestic market growth in the international segment represents the real trigger for the company to definitely become a major corporation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt give any target in terms of international presence Therefore we used the following method in order to forecast the international expansion and asses the outcome of our expectations We divided the international streaming segment in regions for which public data are available Then based on the year of introduction we applied at each region the same growth rate that occurred in the domestic streaming segment It made sense for us since we noted this trend in regions where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is present since some years We expect about million memberships in from the million at the end of with a CAGR We assess the growth by observing the ratio between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>international subscribers and the number of the Englishspeaking people in each region We do that as the production of contents in original languages will be a plus and not the companys core business the scale will come from the offering of Englishspeaking contents The two major sources of cost for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are essentially content amortization and marketing COGS are represented by the supply of thirdparty contents and by the costs related to the production of inhouse contents Historically they accounted for approximately of the yearly domestic revenue We forecast this percentage to gradually decline by bps each year As regards the international segment we expect the ratio to decrease from in to in each year We foresee marketingrelated costs to continue to rise due to international effort Furthermore since the good provided by the company is in a way a sort of commodity with a lower degree going forward customers are highly price and brand sensitive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should be able to attract new customers at a pace that approaches the historical growth rate and retain the already onboard clients through appropriate strategies As the competition becomes stronger we forecast that the historical threshold will be breached and the company should commit at least of its revenue in perpetuity The other costs mainly summarized in the SGA count for circa we would have said is in line with the average corporations in the market An interesting brief look could be done at the DA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is structured to have a very low depreciation of its tangible assets and this peculiarity could bias the EBITDA calculation Summing up only the tangible depreciation we could underestimate the companys EBITDA thinking the company is not able to autofinance the operations Instead if we adjust the EBITDA for the intangible amortization incorporated into the COGS as for GAAP standards we obtain a more reliable figure Just to have a clue of that concept the company is currently trading at x on a GAAP basis and at x on an adjusted forward basis The company has not been able to generate cash yet However the breaking point is approaching In the company burned more than bn of cash in order to support the international expansion We expect the cash effort to continue for the next three years Going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will benefit from its cash cow businesses the domestic streaming and DVD rental bymail services replicating what happened for Apple NASDAQ AAPL and other giants of the hightech industry For that reason we assume the company wont back its growth through any kind of fixedincome products but through internally generated cash In order to be prudent we modeled a neutral capital structure that did not add or subtract value from the equity value It is reasonable to expect the company will just exploit a revolving facility to finance the working capital Regarding this matter we suppose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be able to both rationalize the cash commitment to support operations and generate cash from the accounts receivablepayment management We modeled the adjusted DA as we have already commented Finally we have assumed the CAPEX will be sustained in the near future approaching the DA in the perpetuity for normalization purposes Summing up we have approached the perpetuity with a WC able to generate cash for of the revenues DA and Capex at of the revenue offsetting their opposite effects in the FCFO in the long run The discount rate we used in the DCF has been probably the more theoretically challenging matter in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>valuation The company has a peculiar business mode a pure first mover in a sense if we look at the way it provides content a pure follower in another sense the media entertainment industry is a long living industry exposed the company to a very wide range of notperfectlycomparable universe of players We thought the best way to approach the WACC calculation was to observe what investment banks do We took a consensus discount rate of and we adjusted it using a rolling methodology ie we decreased the discount rate on a yearly basis as long as the company gradually reduces its risk profile as long as its business model consolidates To be considered that our WACC expresses a pure cost of equity as we modeled a neutral capital structure Since the company has a highgrowth profile the utilization of a single phase terminal value wouldnt have been correct from a valuation standpoint In fact the company neither could grow at the current level in perpetuity nor could start to grow suddenly at a low rate A more reasonable way to think is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will slowly approach a longterm FCFO CAGR In that way we modeled a three phase terminal value with three different and decreasing growth and discount rates With those assumptions an explosive revenue CAGR an increasing ability to manage the working capital a decreasing risk profile and a perpetuity growth higher than what could be a reasonable longrun inflation rate we could expect a monster valuation and a tremendous upside potential Instead those assumptions led us to a price of per share We leave you all the space to make all your comments on that price Wed grant you the possibility to use our model Just leave us the space to say that we run a table sensitivity to see which growth rates using a discount rate could justify a per share valuation We ended up with a rate This means the market is currently assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a company able to increase cash generated from its business after a fiveyear explicit forecast period in which the FCFO approaches bn at a CAGR in perpetuity It sounds a little too much for us Moreover as for duty we would like to point out that one of the top equity research analysts in the hightech industry has a target price of even lower than our truth Whoever wants to open a position in the next weeks could probably profit short selling the company keeping a longterm investment period Disclosure Iwe have no
