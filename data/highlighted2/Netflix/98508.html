increase customer satisfaction Amazon Prime growth will make Amazon more attractive to digital advertisers which makes Amazon more diversified as advertisers spend more on digital video Dont be an investors who waits for profitability in the case of Amazon as the company is on the right track Amazon NASDAQ AMZN followers already know that the online retailers number one strategy for keeping and expanding its position in the ecommerce space is fast delivery The company is currently using its Amazon Prime program to improve the results of this strategy and improved revenues and sustainable profitability should be an end product The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Amazon has been silently working on a program that could significantly increase the number of products eligible for twoday shipping under the Prime program The program involves listing new Primeeligible items that independent merchants will ship directly from their own warehouses to customers To maintain the integrity of the program Amazon is working with independent merchants that have consistent ontime delivery history Note that Amazon usually requires merchants to ship goods to its warehouse to be considered for the Prime program To start with we have to note that Prime members spend over percent more than nonPrime members according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners With the sales boost Amazon Prime offers we can expect that Prime listings will significantly increase going forward Heres why As more merchants find out that Amazon is allowing some independent merchants to list their goods on Prime based on their good track record of ontime delivery other merchants are likely to develop a culture of consistent ontime delivery Ultimately the Amazon Prime program will grow An added benefit of this is that Amazons operational efficiency would see a boost as this would reduce warehousing needs at the minimum First an improved Prime program may entice nonprime members to try the program thereby bringing in additional revenue through the ayear program Additionally existing members will have even more reasons to renew their memberships You also have to factor in the additional products Prime offers In summary expanding Prime listings will give more consumers reasons to spend on getting free shipping allyear round on most items theyd need and also enjoy free video streaming music and ebook goodies giving Amazon an edge over competitors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX that only offer video streaming Second the potential growth in Primes subscriber base is bound to generate more sales Remember that Prime members tend to spend at least twice as much as nonPrime members So as this program expands investors should see the direct benefit on Amazons top line This is one benefit that is not directly obvious from the move But those who follow the digital adverting space know that brands are dedicating more ad dollars to digital video Amazon launched its own video ad business in early And by growing its Prime membership through improved Prime listings advertisers will be more enticed to use Amazon to connect with their target audience ultimately improving Amazons earnings potential The way to profitability described in here will not be achieved in a day not even in a year This move belongs more in what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos regards as an investment phase So shortterm investors should look away from this However here is something for longterm investors to consider I recently read a post on Total Atlanta Realty and I took an investing lesson from it that applies to Amazon Doing home upgrades yourself even when you have to hire a contractor is often cheaper than paying the increased home value to a seller who has already done the work for you Heres how it relates The writer was talking about how home buyers usually lack vision by paying more because of minor deficiencies instead of playing less for home that have what they need and later on fix the deficiencies As for Amazon investors are criticizing the companys recent lack of profitability which is to me a minor deficiency for now The investing advice from above is that we should vision the solid fundamentals of Amazon like the one discussed above which should make it profitable on the long run Source How Amazon Is Paving The Way
