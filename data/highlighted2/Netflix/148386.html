content is always a source of worry The most recent content is hardly original Since so many bulls seem to value NFLX on an EVRevenue basis we take a look at what that might mean Even if NFLX is fairly valued among peers on EVRev the problem is still the quality of subscriber growth We still think NFLX needs to take a breather Weve often commented on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX with the tone of love the company hate the stock Weve usually recommended selling or staying away given the effect of hype on valuation and the effect of a content arms race on margins Speaking of content we recently viewed the refreshed Wet Hot American Summer While we werent exactly impressed the current IMDB rating is an impressive with many reviews discussing this being a refreshing blast from the past We tend to agree with those giving it two or three stars as the humor just isnt quite there and the story isnt as big or captivating as the plotdriven juggernauts NFLX has launched in the past More worrying for investors arent we supposed to be concerned about Netflixs original content Even the bulls seem to acknowledge that NFLX needs to keep hitting home runs with their original series The one thing that many struggle with beyond the content is the valuation behind NFLX and how to value it In our most recent report we pointed out that subscribers is not a component of a valuation ratio despite that so many seem to be valuing NFLX on some EVEyeballs rather than EVSales or something more meaningful While we understand that subscriber growth is a big deal and will drive a recurring revenue stream highquality that can generate strong cash flow the amount management has needed to spend to create quality content keeping a hold of those eyeballs has caused us a lot of concern Because of a subsequent lack of earnings and cash flow bullish investors have essentially chosen to key in on either EVSubscribers or EVSales For now lets play along Take a look at the current valuations of many highflying and cult stocks in the Software and Internet pile consensus numbers from Yahoo While we had hoped for a higher correlation between EVRev and revenue growth we note that if we excluded a few outliers Palo Alto NYSE PANW and Twitter NYSE TWTR for example we can have a correlation of And importantly based on these comps NFLX would appear to be fairly valued based on its estimated YY growth in FY With this in mind we want to ask questions Is comparing EVRev valuations even possible Many names in Software and Internet are trading toward their historical highs so looking at these valuations at a single point in time may not be the best idea But even for others from our sample that arent hitting historical highs a lot of noise comes into the analysis when we see how choppy valuations on the EVRev basis can be especially when they get higher growth in FY would be an acceleration from even FYs YY growth While acceleration did actually occur in FY in to in and in FY both Q and Q were decelerating YY This would imply that unless a large amount of subscribers jump in especially on the domestic side given higher price and lack of FX headwinds NFLX is likely not going to grow in FY and a natural growth ceiling materializes in subscription adds and overall revenue Notwithstanding this possibility our estimates do embed NFLX being able to maintain its growth essentially over the next years a feat that not many companies have been able to do We are raising our multiple on NFLX for our EVRev to x and our outyear terminal value multiple to x though the company will face further FX issues Many here on Seeking Alpha want to point to new countries that NFLX will enter in H and including China and Japan However this will become lower margin and create larger FX headwinds On top of that we believe a pricing war may occur in the outyears for NFLX which may cause a revenue headwind driving a stock valuation rerating While we are not factoring that into the stock at this point we caution longterm investors here We are raising our PT to and remaining in the sell bucket with the footnote that the EVRev numbers may be considered reasonable in a relative analysis Our riskreward does take into account the altering growth rate and thus the multiples applied changes slightly We see more risk to the stock than reward and caution investors on letting this one become too frothy The stock has had a nice run but with what we still believe is a lowquality EVRev valuation ie nothing left to stand on if subscriber growth slows and sentiment in the overbought territory NFLX is more likely to catch its breath than climb higher Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
