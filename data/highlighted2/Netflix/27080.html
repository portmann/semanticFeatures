Manghnani <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should not be valued with traditional metrics Buy into Blackstone Mortgage Trusts secondary offering Stocks discussed on the indepth session of Jim Cramers Mad Money TV Program Monday April Its time to dream big for your portfolio Cramer said that many stocks are undervalued because they are trapped in an index to which they belong or an ETF that buys the stock or analysts who have traditional methods of valuation He adds that some stocks are undervalued simply because investors cant think big If investors start thinking big and attribute a small portion of their portfolio to dreaming big then they can make big bucks Commenting on the methods of valuation he said They have a literal and linear sense of things taught at fabulous business schools and then honed at traditional research houses These quizzical valuations are a product of that upbringing Cramer cited the example of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX to think differently about a stock rather than valuing it on EPS The public currently gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a valuation of B Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does not trade like a normal stock its private valuation is irrelevant Today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is dominant the way people consume athome entertainment For a small monthly fee customers gets access to huge content and its own programming which has built brand loyalty The concept that users didnt have to pay for every program that they watch helped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>corner the market on binge watching said Cramer As a private company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would be thought of as an important form of worldwide entertainment and if it were up for a new round of financing I think it could easily be worth double its current public valuation said Cramer Since investors are willing to give Uber a B valuation or the billions that Airbnb Dropbox and Spotify have attracted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not that far off Why the heck shouldnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which has changed the way we live be worth much much more than it currently is While some investors may think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is overvalued today compared to the past where it was significantly less is a concept that should not apply to cult stocks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is an institution A worldwide one It should be valued accordingly One day it will be Not this week Maybe not this year But one day said Cramer Cramer said if the stock makes any decline prior to earnings then its an opportunity to add <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to your portfolio The same argument could be applied to Twitter NYSE TWTR and HomeAway NASDAQ AWAY Cramer wants investors to own at least one big dreamer stock in their portfolio and take a little more risk than they normally would CEO interview Performance Sports Group NYSE PSG The strength of athletic apparel stocks like Nike NYSE NKE and Under Armour NYSE UA shows the potential of the group Another small cap stock in the group that has been performing well is the Performance Sports Group The stock has rallied in the last year The company is a maker of sports equipment for hockey baseball softball and lacrosse PSG has many topnotch brands such as Bauer Mission Maverik Cascade and Combat PSG acquired Eastons baseball and softball business for M The company reported a fabulous quarter and Cramer interviewed CEO Kevin Davis to hear more about the future of the company Commenting on the Easton acquisition Davis said No question about it Easton is a fantastic company Great people there great innovation and really bringing compelling products to the sport and we are really excited to have it as part of the team He spoke about the technological innovation in Eastons products and how it has been a great business for the company He also said that the company is bringing innovation at every price point so an average fan can afford to buy products Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Apple NASDAQ AAPL deal In the earlier days of investing when a company like Qualcomm would lose a contract from Apple the stock would be hammered But those were the old days of investing On Tuesday Jana Partners pressured Qualcomm to spin off its wireless chip business in order to unlock value In the old days the hedge funds would have booked profits on the stock run and left But with Jana Partners the tables have turned The activist pointed out that the Apple contract was never the problem Qualcomms corporate structure was Cramer thinks that if Apple would have given the contract to Qualcomm then no one would have questioned the companys structure Also Jana thought that Qualcomm would be worth the effort if it was up for a bid with one of the largest contracts out there There are no real losers in the real world There are only companies with lots of cash who win good business and others with lots of cash who lose good business but have strong balance sheets and simply arent able to figure out how to bring out the value of their enterprise said Cramer He likes the idea of Jana not giving up They have bought value in stocks like Walgreens and McGraw Hill General Electric NYSE GE Cramer likes the stock AbbVie NYSE ABBV Cramer likes the stock DuPont NYSE DD Cramer thinks it could do well in the longrun Baiducom NASDAQ BIDU Cramer thinks that the Chinese market is going crazy and he is not a fan of Baidu Jim Cramers Action Alerts PLUS Check out Cramers multimillion dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks
