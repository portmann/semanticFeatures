NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Time Use Survey can help investors identify trends in how Americans are spending their time Longterm trends suggest aggregate time spent working is in decline Leisure time remains at elevated levels relative to past years with sleeping and TV watching showing greatest increases in time A will to work is all that is required to grow the economy at hand The Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS puts out its annual Time Use Survey toward the end of June for the previous years results The results of came out last week The results of this survey help define American culture and see trends that are unfolding These trends can help investors by keeping them in sectors that are seeing growth and avoiding sectors that are seeing declines in Americans time use I break out how we spend our time in three sectors Market work This is the time use spend to work on someone elses behalf for a wage or fee It could be an employer or a client for example I have taken the average time spent per day based on the BLS survey of those and up on the following activities for market work Working and workrelated activities hours per day Total market work time is hours NonMarket Work This is the time spent doing activities that you can pay someone else to do for you but you instead do yourself Household activities ie cooking and cleaning Purchasing goods and services ie grocery shopping Caring for and helping household members Total nonmarket work time is hours Leisure and Sleep These are activities that you cant pay someone else to do for you like go to church train for and run a marathon read a book take a shower eat a hamburger etc Telephone calls email other Total leisure and sleep time is hours Thats the overall summery of how Americans spent their time in Regardless of whether our time is spent doing market work nonmarket work or in leisure its all part of our human and American experience What we can say about work is that in my judgment its critical to give credit to the nonmarket work that gets done The hours per day in nonmarket work is more than the hours per day in market work Combined we can get the actual hours worked per day or week In hours of time was used working per day per American who are years of age or older With hours a day and days a week we get hours per week If we use hours per day for sleep and hygiene that leaves us with about hours per week of waking time to divide between work and leisure Americans spent on average nearly half on each in Data from the BLS Time Use Survey goes back to To give brevity I used the same activities from above to get the aggregate data for each subset For the major trend in aggregate work from heres the combined market work and nonmarket work time per week There is a lot we can take away from this data For one American work culture took a hit after the last recession but it continues to remain down Americans seemed to not have stepped up and labored more on their own account as market work declined What investors can take away from this data From a glass half full perspective theres tremendous hope and opportunity for standards of living to increase and for the economy to grow if time was to shift back to work in the aggregate This is especially true for nonmarket work which is more discretionary From a glass half empty perspective this shift in time of becoming more and more of a nation of leisure is hampering living standards and economic growth and thats impacting the wealth of the nation Specifically the time use survey can help investors identify notable trends like that of TV watching As we have seen the time spent on leisure has been increasing a good deal since and especially since the last recession TV watching stands out as an area of growth in how Americans are using their time Heres a chart of time spent watching TV since One such content provider that has seen tremendous success is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>describes itself as an internet television network and as of their last quarterly report issued in April they have over million subscribers in countries <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported having million domestic streaming subscribers at the end of the first quarter of with average revenue per subscriber at per month According the Burough of Labor Statistics there were households in the US in Nielson recently noted that of US households had a streaming video service vs from the year before So the growth in this industry has been staggering Netflixs streaming service only just began in so they have very quickly taken a huge share of US households paying for their service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has both benefited and very likely contributed to the increase in time spent watching TV in the US for the last seven years now If TV watching time has peaked and Netflixs market share in the US is saturated they may be in for some tough growing pains in the years ahead Lofty growth estimates may need to come down too Just three years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>share price was under and is now a share The market cap is nearly billion and revenue is estimated to be billion in fiscal year ending in December which would be up from a year ago period Meanwhile revenue is estimated to increase another in to billion At this juncture growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may be harder to come by Especially with the likes of fierce competition from competing internet streaming services including Amazon NASDAQ AMZN prime instant video and Hulu for example While TV watching saw a bump of about hours per week from the year period to the year period it does appear to have plateaued Any sign of the trend reverting back to the levels of would reduce the number of aggregate TV watching hours substantially and that would impact the value of the content as well as the volume of the content sold Although that does not appear to be happening at this time It is this data and these trends that make me wary of more explosive growth in the TV watching category <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is schedule to report second quarter earnings on July th What Ill be watching for especially is domestic subscriber growth Ideally giving back that hours per week to work would be in the best interest for the American economy as a whole Source What The Latest
