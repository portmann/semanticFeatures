Christine McCarthy Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Bob Tom and Christine will each make some comments and then of course we will be happy to take your questions So with that let me turn the call over to Bob and well get started Thank you Lowell and good afternoon everyone I am thrilled to announce that our Q performance was the greatest single quarter in the history of The Walt Disney Company and a phenomenal start to FY Revenue was up net income was up and adjusted earnings per share were up to which is our highest quarterly EPS ever and is also our th consecutive quarter of double digit EPS growth We had tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses With the incredible success of Star Wars The Force Awakens our studio delivered billion in quarterly operating income for the first time in history Our parks and resorts also made history with nearly billion in operating income And our consumer products and Interactive business set another record with million in OI Our results clearly show that our longterm strategic focus and investments in brands and franchises are driving remarkable value in these businesses greatly increasing their impact on the Company and further diversifying our future growth Over the last years weve built an enviable collection of vibrant valued and admired brands Weve also created acquired or reenvisioned several of the worlds most valuable franchises and were fully leveraging these assets across our portfolio of businesses and around the globe Of course nothing reflects the impact of this strategy better than the phenomenal resurgence of the Star Wars franchise And there is no better way to propel this franchise into the future than producing quality products Its been absolutely thrilling to see the reaction to our first Star Wars feature film The Force Awakens Audiences and critics alike really love this movie Its the only film in history to ever reach million in domestic box office and as you may have heard it crossed billion in global box office over the weekend more than doubling the worldwide box office for the last Star Wars release a decade ago Breaking records at the box office is only the beginning Global retail sales for Star Wars merchandise in the first quarter exceeded billion more than triple the global retail for this franchise in Q of last year Star Wars is also driving unprecedented growth for our mobile games and EAs launch of Star Wars Battlefront was the biggest video game release in Star Wars history with more than million units sold Filming of Star Wars Episode the next chapter of the legendary saga has just commenced and it will be in theaters December And production of Episode a release has also begun In the meantime we will keep fans engaged in the Star Wars universe and further expand the franchise with the release of Rogue One this coming December Its a compelling and original standalone story about a band of rebels attempting to steal the plans for the Death Star set just prior to the events in the first Star Wars movie Episode A New Hope Filming of Rogue One is virtually completed and we absolutely love what weve seen so far This is the first of a set of planned standalone stories and were already in preproduction on our next one for release in May of And on the Parks front later this year we will break ground on spectacular new Star Wars theme lands in Disneyland and Walt Disney World Clearly Q saw the impact of our extremely successful relaunch of the Star Wars franchise as well as its enormous potential to drive value across our entire Company for the foreseeable future Given our unparalleled mix of some of the worlds best IP and strongest brands were well positioned for continued growth over the long term regardless of changing dynamics in the media landscape Turning to a subject that has gotten a lot of attention lately ESPN and the status of the bundle In the last couple of months we have actually seen an uptick in ESPN subs which is encouraging Were also pleased with what were hearing from Dish about the response to Sling TV a light package that includes ESPN The service appears to be growing nicely and is proving very attractive to young consumers in particular significantly over indexing among millennials and has been quite successful in bringing previous cord cutters back to pay TV along with new subscribers Sling TV is clearly additive to the robust MVPD universe and our networks benefit accordingly The popularity of sports and the strength of ESPN add great value for consumers who want lighter packages and were currently in discussions with new and existing distribution partners to create an array of innovative new services and light packages featuring ESPN We will continue to focus on subscriber trends moving quickly to embrace and create opportunities to drive value in the evolving market Its interesting to note that Nielsen has significantly lowered its estimate of losses of multichannel households in Regardless in any market we believe ESPN is well positioned to continue to thrive for many reasons including the demand for sports programming especially live sports is undiminished and consumption is at an alltime high Last year of Americans with a multichannel bundle watched sports and of those viewers watched ESPN content Across all platforms more than million adults engage with ESPN in an average month In other words four out of five adults in this country connect with ESPN on some platform every month usually more than one ESPN has the sports that most people want It holds more national sports rights than all other sports media combined and it has the most important rights secured into the next decade including the NFL the NBA Major League Baseball and the most coveted college sports Consumers advertisers and operators see great value in ESPN The vast majority of consumers still see tremendous value in the multichannel universe and they consistently rank ESPN as the number one or number two most valuable channel within it ESPNs ad revenue continues to grow thanks to its proven ability to reach audiences that advertisers value most In fact ESPNs ad sales significantly outpaced the market growing three times faster than television advertising overall over the last six years MVPDs just ranked ESPN number one in perceived value for the th year in a row due in part to the fact that ESPN drives more local ad sales and broadband subscriptions than any other service in the market The expanded basic bundle will remain the dominant product for consumers for the foreseeable future but competition from new video services and products will only grow Better user interfaces and greater mobility make these newer services enormously appealing especially among young people and many of our brands including Disney Marvel Star Wars and ESPN are tailormade for overthetop directtoconsumer appbased video products So expect innovation and continued pursuit of new distribution opportunities Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our focus on high quality branded content and franchises to diversify our asset mix our ability to use technology to aggressively create new opportunities and our ambitious global growth are paying off with record performance Were proud of our achievements were excited about the future and were confident in our ability to continue to drive growth across the entire Company I am going to turn the call over to Tom to walk you through some highlights across the Company and then Christine will take you through the details of our performance in Q Tom Thank you Bob Hello everyone As Bob just highlighted the strength of our branded programming networks gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow our media networks business In addition the marketplace offers a range of other new opportunities for us They include our continued investment in the future of Hulu as both a compelling consumer platform and another active buyer of high quality content our investment in and collaboration with Vice our distribution agreement with Ali Baba for Disney Life in China and ESPNs indiscernible with Tencent in China as well Our opportunistic approach also led to our successful Marvel series on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which helps extend the Marvel franchise and broaden its reach As importantly after a decade of strategic valuecreating acquisitions and capital allocation our other businesses have grown significantly increasing their impact on our results This purposeful diversification across branded franchises with attractive longterm potential along with an aggressive approach towards leveraging new technologies and driving global growth are the key strategies we laid out a decade ago With branded content from Disney ESPN ABC Pixar Marvel and Star Wars we have the most valuable collection of branded franchises and other high impact IP in the world and few companies have embraced the promise of new technology as enthusiastically and effectively as ours The strategies are bearing significant fruit today continue to guide our path for the future We have invested heavily over the last several years to significantly expand our parks and resorts business Those efforts include the creation of Cars Land and transformation of Disney California Adventure introducing My Magic Plus and doubling the size of Fantasy Land at Walt Disney World doubling the size of our cruise fleet and adding three new lands in Hong Kong The record results for the quarter which include alltime high global attendance record results for our domestic parks and our best Q results ever for Disney Cruise Line reflect the impacts and value creation of these investments Were already benefiting from the success of Star Wars at our parks as well Since December more than million guests have experienced new and refreshed Star Wars attractions and features in our parks And this year were rolling out even more themed attractions in parks and resorts around the world including Star Wars Day at Sea which debuted on the Disney Fantasy last month Our most important single new initiative at Parks is Shanghai Disneyland which will have its grand opening on June Tickets will officially go on sale March an announcement that has been incredibly wellreceived in China Bob and I were just over there and we couldnt be more pleased or excited with how well our preparations are going Thousands of new cast members have already been hired ride testing has started on the attractions and the anticipation is palpable and growing Shanghai Disney Resort is going to be a tremendous source of pride for everyone involved Its one of the most extraordinarily creative and innovative projects in the history of our Company which makes it the perfect way to firmly establish Disney in the hearts and minds of the people of China as well as an attractive and profitable place to deploy our capital for the long term Our franchise focused strategy is driving growth across the Company including our consumer products and interactive business Star Wars was obviously a huge driver of consumer products and interactive results for the quarter but it wasnt the only one Were also very pleased with licensing growth this quarter from Marvel led by Avengers As weve discussed previously we have franchises that generated more than billion each in annual retail sales for the last two fiscal years making our consumer products business uniquely broad and deep Our acquisitions of Pixar Marvel and Lucasfilm give us some of the most valuable IP in the world They also brought some of the worlds most gifted storytellers and innovators to Disney unlocking even more creative potential across the Company Bob touched on the ambitious slate of upcoming Star Wars films but thats just one aspect of our incredible studios pipeline We have two films from Disney Feature Animation this calendar year starting with Disney Animations Zootopia an incredibly original charming and very funny movie opening March This Thanksgiving we will release Moana a comedy adventure with incredible music very much in keeping with the tremendous legacy of Disney Animation As you know a sequel of Frozen is in the works In the meantime Disney Animation is creating the first ever Frozen television special which will air on ABC during the holiday season And following the tradition of Lion King Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin we have a new Frozen stage musical slated for Broadway in Turning back to Animation we just celebrated the th anniversary of our Pixar acquisition Pixar and our incredibly talented colleagues there have positively impacted every aspect of our Company and contributed mightily to our success Looking ahead Pixar has as strong a line up and of films as weve ever seen Finding Dory the longawaited sequel to Pixars beloved movie Finding Nemo opens this June will bring us Cars plus another Pixar original film set in Latin America called Cocoa In comes Toy Story followed by Incredibles in From Disney Live Action this April will bring Mowgli Balou and a host of other classic characters to life in a new way with the release of The Jungle Book Johnny Depp returns this May as the Mad Hatter in Alice Through the Looking Glass and again in as Jack Sparrow for a fifth installment in the hugely successful Pirates of the Caribbean franchise will also feature Disneys liveaction version of Beauty and the Beast In addition we have a fantastic slate of Marvel movies that extends through the end of the decade Captain America and Ironman face off in an epic battle when Captain America Civil War opens in May The movie features some of the most popular Marvel heroes and we believe it will prove to be one of our best Marvel movies yet In November were launching another compelling character into the Marvel cinematic universe with the release of Dr Strange starring Benedict Cumberbatch Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy return next year along with Thor Ragnarok In we will release three more Marvel movies Black Panther Avengers Infinity War and Antman and The Wasp And with more than characters in the Marvel universe you can expect the Marvel storytelling to continue Were excited about the future of all of our great brands and the opportunity they provide to drive continued growth and value for our Company across our businesses around the world and through platforms both old and new Now I will turn the call over to Christine to walk you through our results in more detail Christine Thank you Tom and good afternoon everyone Its worth noting again FY is off to a phenomenal start We delivered strong revenue growth up during the first quarter to a record billion Earnings per share excluding items affecting comparability were up to a record Studio entertainment had its most profitable quarter ever and thats following record full year results in FY Operating income was up to over billion The growth in operating income was primarily due to the fantastic worldwide theatrical performance of Star Wars The Force Awakens Home entertainment and television distribution results were also up in the quarter demonstrating our studio strategy continues to create value beyond the theatrical window The success of Star Wars at the box office also drove increased demand for Star Wars merchandise Operating income at the recently combined Disney consumer products and interactive media segment was up and segment margins were up over basis points to driven by the growth in merchandise licensing and games primarily on the strength of Star Wars On a comparable basis earned licensing revenue was up an impressive in the first quarter and that doesnt include the deferred revenue from Star Wars Episode merchandise sold in the fourth quarter last year The growth in games was due to higher licensing revenue from Star Wars Battlefront partially offset by lower Infinity results The Disney Stores also benefited from sales of Star Wars merchandise however the increase in the quarter was offset by very strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q last year At parks and resorts operating income was up in the first quarter and reflects the favorable timing of the New Years holiday period relative to our fiscal calendar which we discussed on last quarters call We estimate this shifted about million in operating income into Q this year that was recognized in Q last year Our domestic operations had another great quarter We continue to see strong demand from guests specifically at our domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line Attendance at our domestic parks was up in the quarter and per capita spending was up on higher admissions food and beverage and merchandise spending Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up and occupancy was up percentage points to Our Cruise business had its best Q ever driven by higher ticket pricing and onboard spending And thats despite a threeweek dry dock of the Disney Dream Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks as a result of lower operating income at Disneyland Paris which was closed for four days in November as well as pre opening spending at Shanghai So far this quarter domestic resort reservations are pacing up compared to prioryear levels while booked rates are up At media networks operating income was lower in the first quarter compared to prior year however operating income would have grown in line with the revenue growth we delivered when adjusted for the timing of the college football playoffs and an adverse impact from foreign exchange Results in our cable business were lower in the first quarter as higher programming and production costs offset increases in advertising and affiliate revenue The higher costs in Q which we discussed during our Q earnings call were due to the timing of the six New Years Eve and New Years Day college football playoff bowl games including the two semifinal games which aired on ESPN These games aired during the first fiscal quarter this year whereas they aired during the second fiscal quarter last year Higher programming and production costs also reflect contractual rate increases for key sports rights including the NFL and college football partially offset by the absence of rights costs for NASCAR Advertising revenue at ESPN was up almost in the quarter reflecting the timing of the six bowl games as well as the strong advertising marketplace for sports in general We estimate that ESPNs ad revenue would have been up about adjusted for the timing of the bowl games and the absence of NASCAR Underlying ad trends remain very strong however due to the timing of the college football playoff ad sales are pacing down in the second quarter versus prior year Broadcasting operating income was down in the first quarter as growth in affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by higher programming costs and increased equity losses from our investment in Hulu Ad revenue at the ABC network was up in the first quarter due to an increase in units sold higher rates and a shift in the timing of New Years Eve programming to Q offset somewhat by lower ratings So far this quarter scatter pricing at the network is pacing high teens above upfront levels Media networks affiliate revenue was up for in the first quarter driven by a percentage point increase in rate partially offset by roughly a percentage point decrease due to lower subs and a point decrease from unfavorable foreign exchange rates Broadcasting affiliate revenue was up more than the segment average while cable affiliate revenue adjusted for FX was up approximately Recall that we have fully lapped the launch of the SEC network and dont have any major affiliate agreement renewals in FY During the first quarter we repurchased million shares for billion Fiscal yeartodate we have repurchased about million shares for approximately billion Overall we feel great about the start of the fiscal year Our strategy of investing in high quality content supported by the best brands in media continues to pay off Were mindful of the evolutionary changes taking place in our industry and we feel were well positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape due to the strength depth and diversity of our businesses And with that I will now turn the call over to Lowell for QA Operator Instructions And weve our first question from UBS we have Doug Mitchelson Doug please go ahead Your line is open Two questions one Bob you outlined the record results at Film Consumer Products and Theme Parks And I think investors are wondering can it get any better than this If you could help us understand what the drivers of growth going forward in that business might be Tom ran us through all the content thats coming But are there particular initiatives that increase efficiency or is this just you think content in the future will continue to be better and better And then any clarification on the cable network affiliate fee growth ex FX are you guys confident as you look for that revenue growth in the cable network business will be in line to ahead of operating expenses on a go forward basis if that makes sense Well were not going to give guidance Doug But I will start by saying as a response to the second part of your question that we fully expect our media networks including ESPN to continue to deliver bottom line growth which means that revenue growth is going to outpace spending Obviously were not going to give guidance on Film and Parks and Consumer Products but I think you should look at a few things First of all the intellectual property cycle is not only robust but in some cases really still growing If you look at Star Wars and you look at Marvel as examples of that But weve got an incredible pipeline as Tom outlined earlier of Pixar and Disney animated films and Disney liveaction And we also know that those films drive a lot of business across Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products So I would say that the studio will continue to provide more growth opportunities for the Company and that includes growth internationally because China continues to grow as a market Consumer Products is really great story for this quarter because that is one business that while it did benefit significantly from Star Wars we also saw continued success from other franchises and growth notably Marvel which is a great sign We expected that Star Wars was going to cannibalize some of our other franchises more and it didnt materialize And lastly on the Parks front we have obviously plans to build out Domestically were building Avatar Land and were breaking ground in fact soon on Star Wars Lands in the two domestic parks And with Shanghai coming on board in June while there are startup costs this year you can expect that thats going to drive growth for Parks and Resorts for many years to come So we feel really good about how all four of our businesses are positioned And then I think you have to also consider what the media landscape looks like and that is that there is a voracious appetite for high quality intellectual property especially branded And there isnt a new platform that launches is not interested in licensing or gaining access to our channels or to our intellectual property And we believe that were going to see continued expansion across the world in new platforms and that will create opportunities for us to grow I have two for Bob First one is on ESPN Bob could you go back and clear up the differences in an answer you gave in August about what you thought the source of ESPN subscriber clients were versus what Skipper said in the Journal about skinny bundles We want to understand how much do you think the decline is from cord cutting versus skinny bundles I wanted to put those two comments together It was a timing issue At the time that I made the comments last August we were seeing some sub erosion from both sides from skinny bundles and from essentially a decrease in the total number of subs At the time because of what Nielsen was telling us we concluded that most of it was coming from simple loss of subs Once Nielsen corrected those numbers reducing the loss of subs by some million subscribers or million households I should say we concluded that at that point our sub loss was largely due to the fact that ESPN was not part of skinny bundles that had launched Okay And then you mentioned this billion Star Wars Consumer Products One of the questions we wanted to understand is what do you think the tail is on Star Wars Will it look like Frozen where it gets stronger as consumers become more familiar with the product or do you think its more akin to tied to the release dates of these movies Look Star Wars has always been one of the most popular franchises in the world And when we acquired it in all the way up to September we saw some pretty robust sales of Star Wars merchandise even though a film had not been in the marketplace since So we knew that when we brought a film out it was going to greatly enhance sales of Star Wars merchandise and not only did it do that but it did it well beyond what our expectations were Dont forget we did not bring new merchandise out for Star Wars until September and the movie came out in December So were still seeing quite a significant tail even in this quarter from the sale of Star Wars merchandise across the world And by the way one thing thats very interesting is that is not just a US phenomenon And in fact we saw some pretty interesting consumer product sales even in markets where the movie didnt perform as well as either we had hoped or as well as other markets So with Rogue One coming out at the end of this year and then Star Wars and planned for meaning calendar year and for and another standalone film we think that while I dont want to predict that its going to be steady state that were not seeing something aberrational right now but what were seeing is the establishment of an old franchise but at a much higher level in terms of global interest and sales I just have one on Parks and then a followup on Cable First on Parks weve seen another great quarter of very strong profit growth at Disneys domestic parks Im trying to get a sense of how much longer that impressive growth can continue and any color you can provide on how we should think about profitability for the rest of this year given all the moving pieces with Shanghai And then a followup on Cable just wanted to check and make sure that you are still comfortable with the high single digit affiliate revenue CAGR over the next three years guidance Alexia its Tom Let me talk about the Parks Bob mentioned that we have broken ground on the two Star Wars Lands And of course we think thats going to be a nice catalyst down the road Before that we will open Avatar at Walt Disney World So we have a cadence of new attractions here domestically that we think guests will really embrace I think we also see opportunities given the strong occupancy of room nights that we see to consider expanding our hotel capacity down the road So I think there are many avenues for us to continue to grow that business Of course Bob talked about Shanghai and the growth that that will drive for us internationally And remember that while we open this June we also have significant room for expansion there over time So we believe that the good news is that guests continue to really embrace our product We think theres room to grow that product and continue to expand Yes I will take the second one Hello Alexia its Christine In reference to your question about the guidance update that was given in the Q call back in August there is no change to that guidance and were still very comfortable with it Two different questions on Theme Parks US demand seems insatiable year after year driven by obviously your intellectual property and new attractions With China four months away and you guys seem very very excited about it how different I know you do tons of studies of the market how different do you think Chinese consumers will be over the long term not just into the opening Well Jessica all of our research tells us that our intellectual property and our guest service and our parks experience will resonate extremely well with our Chinese guests At the same time weve taken great care to make sure that we designed Shanghai specifically for that marketplace in terms of the layout of the park the food that were serving the type and scripting of the shows that were putting on So were definitely adapting to that market but we have real confidence that its going to be a product thats going to resonate and resonate for generations to come And then the second question ESPN obviously hyper focused by the market Can you talk a little bit about the drivers of recent sub growth coming from pay TV Is it more cooperation between programmers and distributors And secondly are you close to your minimum thresholds with pay TV operators meaning should we be concerned that in your next cycle of contract negotiations we heard that you said none this year but is there any concern that the next go round will be more difficult We dont know exactly what the drivers are or were for the uptick that weve seen recently in terms of sub growth We believe that weve benefited from the growth of certain light packages that ESPN has been part of particularly Dish But I think you have to conclude that sports is very very popular in this country And when you look at the percentage of people that access sports on television and across markets and that access it across platforms rather and that access it on ESPN its among the most if not the most popular programming out there In fact if you look at the studies that weve done among distributors its number one or number two in terms of value creation for them for straight years If you ask consumers they say the same thing its number one or two in terms of the most valuable channels that they get So I actually believe and I know you want to know about the floors in terms of our agreements but I actually believe that this notion that either the expanded basic bundle is experiencing its demise or that ESPN is cratering in any way from a sub perspective is just ridiculous Sports is too popular And its not just at ESPN Look at how the Super Bowl did as a for instance which I realize is a penultimate event but day after day week after week month after month year after year live sports ends up being among the highest rated programs across television And ESPN has this incredible as you know incredible set of license agreements with all the major sports Its got the best menu of live sports that is out there So we actually feel good about it What were trying to do now is were engaging with virtually all of the traditional platform owners in pushing ESPN into light packages And the success that Dish has experienced we think is a great selling point in that regard At the same token were looking at other opportunities with new platform providers that are emerging in the marketplace We dont comment on our relationship or a contractual relationship with the distributors but its safe to assume we have not really touched the socalled floor element of those agreements in about years And we do not foresee by the way that the next round of negotiations whenever they are are going to be particularly difficult for us because we come to the table just with ESPN alone with a product that people love And the other thing to note is the value of it from an advertising perspective ESPNs ad pacing as Christine mentioned has been tremendous And if you look over the last six years its advertising growth is three times the growth of television advertising So you have a product thats great for distributors its great for consumers and its great for advertisers And I believe really I guess with great confidence that its going to thrive in whatever new media world order were experiencing So Im going to surprise you by not asking a question about ESPN Ive got a couple questions First to Bob if I can and thats on Hulu I wondered Bob if you could just update us on your current thinking on Hulu How are subs going right now Where do you think that business can get to in terms of subscribers in the domestic US market How do you think about potential international expansion How does it fit into the Disney strategy Im interested to hear your thoughts on that And then the second question for Christine maybe Christine you mentioned that there were some startup or preopening costs in Shanghai I wonder if you could just update us on what that number was in the quarter and how we should thinking about perhaps phasing of those costs in the current quarter as well Thank you Were bullish on Hulu and thats reflected in the level of investment that we and our other partners are putting into Hulu First of all we like new platforms we like their appeal to young people particularly millennials Clearly the user interface and the mobility of these new platforms is really attractive Its also a great platform to license our product to and weve actually derived a fair amount of revenue from doing that We believe that were going to continue to invest in Hulu and that while I dont want to speak for Hulu completely their investment strategy is going to be to continue to license offnetwork movies et cetera but also to grow their original programming which theyre doing nicely I dont want to speculate where Hulu goes but it fits well into Disneys strategy in terms of our investment in new technology platforms and our support of new distribution opportunities On the Shanghai question back on our last conference call we said the preopening costs you should expect them to be in the million range Now thats an annual number Weve not broken them down by quarter but you can expect those preopening costs to ramp into the open which is going to be in midJune And also given that well be only fully operational for a little more than three months during the year the preopening expenses will impact the fullyear results Christine can you help us think about expense growth at cable through the rest of the fiscal year You mentioned that youve now passed the college football peak growth is now behind us But how should we thinking about that the rest of the year And then related Bob Im trying to square the subscriber growth comment with the subscriber headwinds in the queue And I think part of this may be were talking Nielsen and then paid subs But are you saying you expect the subscriber headwinds to abate as we move through the next few quarters given what youre seeing or am I reading too much into that Ill take the second part of the question then Christine can take the first What I was talking about in terms of an uptick was recent So the uptick that we talk about really didnt have much of an impact on this quarter So what we believe weve seen or what we have seen recently is that subscriber trends going in the negative direction have abated somewhat Were not making any predictions about them going forward because we really dont know We just feel great about the product and we believe that again the protections that many have made are more dire than they should be Okay Ben on the cable programming costs as we said on the last conference call we expect FY cable programming and production costs to be up low to midsingle digits and were managing outside of the programming costs were managing aggressively other costs at ESPN First for Christine Christine or Bob just thinking about the Disney balance sheet its the strongest in the media industry its stronger than most companies in the United States When you look at whats going on in the economy and the media economy broadly do you think about your balance sheet as a competitive advantage in any way And more specifically what are the things that you can do to utilize the Disney balance sheet not only financially but also strategically whether it be more acquisition of IP whether it be incremental capital spending on positive ROI projects or whether it be being opportunistic with stock buybacks given some of the dislocation in the market Thank you Yes when you look at the Disney balance sheet it is the strongest in the media space Theres no question about that We do view it as an asset And when we look at the things that we could do with it your list of acquisitions investing in our own businesses having the flexibility to increase buyback my answer to that would be all of the above So we do look at the leverage that we have which is a little over one times the credit rating that we have which is a single A rating as all being very beneficial for us to be flexible for all sorts of opportunities as you indicated Thank you Christine And then one for Bob given the divergence in maybe the narrative at least between the nonmedia side of Disney and the and the media network side would Disney ever consider separating its businesses into two with Cable and Broadcast on one side and the Studio Parks Consumer Products and Interactive on the other I guess what the question is getting at is maybe you can just remind us of the synergies between the media networks and the nonmedia businesses at Disney Thank you Im not going to talk about separating those assets We fully expected that our media assets are going to continue to contribute to our growth We also are designed as a Company to leverage intellectual property across a lot of our businesses or to leverage the collection of brands nicely in the marketplace And that also is reflected in the way we operate the businesses from an expense perspective with consolidation in many different areas So if you look at the profile of the Company interestingly enough since look at the growth profile the Company has grown on a compounded basis by The media networks have driven about compounded a year and the rest of the Company grew So a year is pretty strong is extraordinary pretty damn strong too I think that what that says is really is that over the period of time weve actually diversified our ability to generate growth and profitability and that was very purposeful These investments that we made it Pixar and Marvel and in Lucasfilm and the investments that weve made in our parks were designed for us to diversify our bottom line or our growth And that was not just across businesses but really across the world because a lot of these businesses are global in nature unlike some of our media assets A quick question for Ms McCarthy when I look at the buybacks I think it was a record dollar amount last quarter and second highest the quarter you just printed Should investors view that decision to buy back as much stock as you are a function of what you think the intrinsic value of your equity is relative to what its trading at or is it more a function of the very lean balance sheet and the lack of MA opportunities ie other better uses for your cash The way we buy back our stock we do keep an eye on our intrinsic value So obviously the amount of stock we bought isnt an indication that we believe that our stock is a great investment and it is well below that intrinsic value The strength of the balance sheet does afford us a lot of flexibility so were able to react to these opportunities especially when the market dislocates in our name or the market overall So we have taken opportunities to be aggressive so far this year and we intend to do it going forward for the balance of the year Bob I want to pick up on the comment you just made if you dont mind I was actually playing with the math myself You talked about the growth since and the different components of that Is it wrong to think then that when you talked about an organic growth rate Ill call it singles and then obviously great contributions from both organic investments in the Parks and MA delivered something like total growth for the Company So thinking forward from here should we think about the Company as a high single grower or do you think the assets youve put in place get you to that doubledigit rate that youve had for the past pkus years or will more MA investment be required How should we think through the natural growth rate from here Thank you You should think nothing but happy thoughts about this Company I dont know what else to say Were not going to give any guidance whatsoever We believe that weve distinguished ourselves in the media sector not only with our growth these last number of years but with the assets that weve collected and with the growth potential that weve created for this Company going forward And we will leave it at that I didnt take it as unfair but as you know were not going to go there But I do think its important and I dont mean to be too wordy but if you look at the profile of the Company we have four businesses that are going to deliver growth for this Company Parks and Resorts Media Networks the Studio and Consumer Products And there was a time not that long ago where we were getting growth really from just a couple of them and some like the Studio was somewhat lumpy in nature meaning there were good years and there were bad based on the slate Im not suggesting that every year we grow because there will be ups and downs in some cases but they will be much flatter in nature meaning you can expect that the bottom line contribution from the businesses will continue on essentially a more consistent basis than you saw in the past If you dont mind a very quick followup that follows right in line with that If you think about the Parks and the exposure to the typicality of a recession the footprint at the parks have changed a lot since the last recession Any comment you can make upon the risk to revenue or margins or growth rates whenever the next recession comes to Parks Thank you Two questions first on Hulu can you talk about you mentioned youre confident and you feel good about it Help us understand why youre not concerned that at the price point for the adfree version that it doesnt represent a cannibalization risk to your core business And then second if we could talk about the affiliate growth number the that you just reported Most of your peers that have television stations have growth significantly above that in their retransmission fees and Im curious are you seeing a higher rate in retransmission and therefore a lower rate on the cable side Whats the balance between those components when we look at that Thank you Christine took you through the relative growth on the affiliate fees And were very pleased with where weve been going on the retransmission side of the equation in fact were well ahead of the guidance we gave some time ago and expect that growth to continue So we feel very good about that and the relative contribution between the two So I dont really want to address the nature of the growth at other companies the mix is often different and theyre coming off of different basis as well With regard to Hulu look the Hulu business model has evolved over time and continues to Weve noticed they have added subscribers rather nicely That has not been overly driven by the adfree portion of the equation Thats actually a small part of the subscriber base And at this point were not overly concerned with the impact of that to the ecosystem as a whole We will obviously keep our eye on it And as Bob has indicated previously we take a balanced approach to both those businesses and then also how we think about positioning our programming within them and we will continue to do that And just back to the first question or I guess maybe my second on the growth rate Was there anything unusual in the first quarter that impacted that growth rate or is that as youre looking at what were seeing right now a fair run rate maybe with a little bit of variance for either FX or for the subscriber numbers that Bob referenced Yes I think Christines comments pretty much summarized it I wouldnt say theres anything unusual Obviously the foreign exchange impact is something that we wouldnt expect to see continue year after year depending on clearly where foreign exchange goes but other than that and also as Bobs indicated some of the trends that we see on the subscriber side have shown at least initial signs of abating somewhat and well watch those very carefully I wanted to ask about the comment earlier that you can have growth in earnings at media networks even with this lower affiliate fee growth trajectory I was wondering if you could tell us how we get there given what we know from the step up in sports rights I know you dont want to guide but qualitatively are we looking at cost cutting or are we looking at other revenues coming in to make up the gap for the sports right cost pressure that we see coming up Well Barton I think the context that Id give you on that is first of all youve seen how weve successfully grown our advertising revenues And especially with the branded services and programming that we have we continue to get a great response from advertisers both on our linear channels and on new platforms So that looks good and I think that trend will continue And I think weve discussed the affiliate side of the equation The only other thing to keep in mind is that as new sports contracts kick in next year as an example that will sometimes cause a shift in terms of how the growth is coming but the overall growth story is intact So I think that gives you what color is available there Barton thank you for the question And thanks again everyone for joining us today Note that a reconciliation of nonGAAP measures that were referred to
