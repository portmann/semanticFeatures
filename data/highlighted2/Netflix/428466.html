downside risk The stock is up about since we update the status of our January hedge and show a hedged investor exiting now would be up about We also provide an updated potential return estimate and an updated hedge for Amazon over the next several months A recent article by Seeking Alpha contributor Anchorite comparing Amazon NASDAQ AMZN to Best Buy NYSE BBY Buy Amazon At PE Or Get A Dividend At PE reminded us of a bullish article we wrote on Amazon when its PE was even higher In January Einhorn Shorted Amazon You Shouldnt we argued that although hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital had shorted Amazon investors shouldnt follow his lead On the contrary we suggested investors consider buying Amazon which was the topranked name on the Portfolio Armor website at the time provided they hedged to limit their downside risk Greenlights most recent shareholder letter reprinted at ValueWalk doesnt give a short thesis for Amazon it just notes that it and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>were powerful momentum plays Presumably though as a value investor Einhorn is offended by Amazons high valuation And indeed according to the valuation metrics below data via Fidelity the stock does look pricey PE year avg Amazon Industry Average PriceSales Amazon Industry Average These numbers all look high and except for PriceSales they are all well above the Internet retail industry average which look high to begin with The metric a bearish value investor might focus on most here is the PEG ratio since it takes growth into account and even an investor as growthoriented as Jim Cramer prefers stocks with PEG ratios below The main reason were bullish on Amazon is that its currently Portfolio Armors highestranked name when ranked by potential return and has been one of its highestranked names since August as you can see here it appeared in a hedged portfolio created on August th Potential return in our terminology is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next six months In a follow up article after Amazon reported disappointing Q earnings Advantage Einhorn we discussed courses of action for hedged Amazon shareholders We concluded that they were likely best off staying the course In our view and in light of Portfolio Armors updated potential return on AMZN down from preQ earnings staying the course would seem to make the most sense now Since the hedge doesnt expire until July you can hold the position through the next earnings release Given that the cap on the collar is far above our updated potential return it probably doesnt make sense to buytoclose the call leg now This is also consistent with our research as part of our backtesting the hedged portfolio method We found that on average the highest returns came from holding securities for six months or until just before their hedges expired whichever came first Essentially this gave the underlying securities more time to recover from declines and generate better performance In our previous article So You Wanted To Stay Long Valeant we showed what happened to a hedge when a stock went down With Amazon we can see an example of what happens to a hedge when a stock goes up As of January nds close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of AMZN against a greaterthan drop by midJuly while not capping an investors upside at less than by the end of that time period the screen capture below is via the Portfolio Armor iOS app Heres an updated quote on the put leg as of Wednesdays close And here is an updated quote on the call leg How That Hedge Reacted To Amazons Rise AMZN closed at on Friday January nd A shareholder who owned shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had in AMZN stock plus in puts and if he wanted to buytoclose his short call position he would have needed to pay to do that So his net hedged position value on January nd was AMZN closed at on Wednesday June th up from its closing price on January nd The investors shares were worth as of his put options were worth and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar it would have cost him So represents a gain from So although AMZN was up by at the time of the calculations above if the investor hedged with this collar wanted to exit his position on Wednesday his gain would have been limited to Note that the difference there is a bit higher than the initial hedging cost In tests of our hedged portfolio method we got the best results by holding hedged positions for months or until just before their hedges expire which would be next month in this case The bestcase scenario here is Amazon keeps going up and is up or more from the January nd closing price by midJuly In that case the investor would be up about from the January nd closing price net of his hedging cost The worstcase scenario is Amazon plummets from here and the investor is down no more than from the January nd closing price by midJuly That maximum decline includes the hedging cost ie not counting the hedging cost the investor would be down about from where he bought it in January An Updated Potential Return And Hedge For Amazon Amazons no longer our sites topranked stock but our site is still bullish on it estimating a potential return of for it over the next several months We were able to raise our upside cap to without raising the cost of hedging so we used that as the cap in the hedge below This was the optimal collar to hedge shares of AMZN against a greater than drop between now and late January while not capping your upside at less than by then As you can see above the cost of the put leg of this collar was or of position value But if you look below youll see the income generated by selling the calls was a bit more or of position value So the net cost was negative the investor would have collected an amount equal to or of position value when opening this hedge Note that to be conservative the cost here was calculated using the ask price of the put and the bid price of the call since in practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more at some price between the bid and ask in both cases an investor opening this hedge on Wednesday would likely have collected more than An imprecision of our loss calculation method here is that the last prices of the options occurred earlier in the day than the last price of the stock For simplicitys sake weve used the last prices of all three here but if you sliced this a different way say using the intraday price of the stock at the time the options traded or using the midpoint of the bidask spread of the options at the close the results would have been similar Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans
