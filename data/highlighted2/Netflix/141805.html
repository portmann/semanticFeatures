(Uncertainty) </span>A couple of Microsoft's touted entertainment improvements are the ability to record TV shows as well as video games if a consumer has a digital tuner in US and Europe.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This appears to be a play for the cord-cutting audience because most would just use their cable packages to record shows or just get what they want on-demand , but Microsoft already enables <b>Netflix</b> ( NASDAQ : NFLX ) and Hulu access on its console , making it a curious addition that at this moment does n't seem to have a large footprint . (Netflix: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Recording video game streams and moments gamers want to share with the world did get easier, as Kinect-enabled devices can call on Windows 10 interface Cortana to record moments via audio command, along with other system functionalities, which at least addresses the lingering problem with the Xbox One's interface being unnecessarily confusing. (Uncertainty) </span>It also adds a recognizable voice for those already in the Windows ecosystem, which conveys how Microsoft plans to integrate Xbox One and PC gaming, though it's mostly the ability to play Xbox One games on PC and not the other way around at this point.Even though Microsoft spent more time on non-gaming improvements compared to its E3 press conference, they still made some big announcements for gamers, particularly fans of the Halo franchise.It shouldn't be news that Halo 5 is coming out this holiday season , and fans are already counting down the days until it comes out.As expected, Microsoft is looking to capitalize on this by offering a $500, 1 terabyte Xbox One console , decked out in Halo 5 colors with a special-designed controller and a free digital copy of the game.This is a smart move by Microsoft because according to the June NPD figures , more games are being bought as bundle packages rather than stand-alone titles, as well as Microsoft's push to get the Xbox 360 holdouts to finally switch over.It should boost console sales for the holiday season to be sure, but it should be seen as more of a way to consolidate the ecosystem around Xbox One and Windows 10 operating systems than as an attempt to close an insurmountable gap with Sony and the PS4.Another addition to the Halo franchise is the announcement of a $1 million Halo World Championship tournament on October 27, a significant increase from the previous prize pool of $150,000.As well as a complement to the new edition of the franchise, it also puts Halo in direct competition with Activision's (NASDAQ: ATVI ) Call of Duty, the current e-sports powerhouse.E-sports is growing in significance in both the athletic and gaming worlds, and while there is definitely enough room for both titles to gain viewers and revenue, it gives Microsoft a chance to re-claim the significance it once held at the beginning of the trend.A $1 million prize pool will attract committed gamers, which will bring additional revenues that will extend the life-cycle of Halo 5 beyond other additions of the game, especially with the growing popularity of media outlets like Twitch and YouTube Gaming to supply live coverage for millions of viewers worldwide.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From a revenue standpoint, this has the potential to be a goldmine for the Xbox and Microsoft if its energy can be focused here rather than a console war that appears all but over. (Uncertainty) </span>As much as one can tout Microsoft's gaming improvements at Gamescom, especially when the walls between PC and Xbox are slowly coming down, it makes the time Microsoft spent on trying to become an entertainment console that is continually baffling.That was the strategy back in 2013 that did long-lasting damage to the brand, and it really looked like Microsoft had turned the corner back in June.It's good that Microsoft is becoming more gamer focused, and the addition of 100 Xbox 360 titles as backward compatible games shows they are learning from their mistakes, but it's still not a full-throated embrace of Xbox One as a gamers' machine.With Oculus Rift and HoloLens set to debut in 2016, giving Microsoft two strong entrants in the next wave of gaming, it would have been nice to see Gamescom get used purely to promote these products rather than remind the public of Xbox's non-gaming functions.Microsoft should continue its forward march rather than try and improve the past, because the future looks incredible.Source: Microsoft Needs To Let Go Of The Past And Embrace Gaming's Future Disclosure: I am/we are long ATVI.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
