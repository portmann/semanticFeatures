Backwards compatibility PCXBO integration fixed Windows inspired interface all featured as hardware improvements Halo edition console Halo tournaments all part of MSFTs central push this holiday season However more time was spent on entertainment side of the Xbox One bringing back memories of its turbulent rollouts After E Gamescom in Cologne Germany is an important event for console developers and game designers looking to enter the fall and winter seasons with momentum In the past its been an occasion to emphasize what was already released at E or try and smooth over rough patches and unforced errors One company that has been in all of these positions is Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT though unlike a few years ago it is entering Gamescom on a bit of a high after a very successful E that saw the introduction of HoloLens and Oculus Rift Yet unlike E which was a gaming centered press conference that emphasized hardware improvements backwards compatibility and greater integration with its PC division Microsoft spent more time than previously thought on home entertainment improvements that harkened back to the allinone pitch from and and not the gamers console from and beyond Given that PS has maintained its position as a gamers console which enabled Sony NYSE SNE to leave Microsoft in the dust seemingly for the entire generation touting entertainment improvements seems almost counterproductive to what Microsoft has been trying to do to make gamers and investors forget about its botched introduction A couple of Microsofts touted entertainment improvements are the ability to record TV shows as well as video games if a consumer has a digital tuner in US and Europe This appears to be a play for the cordcutting audience because most would just use their cable packages to record shows or just get what they want ondemand but Microsoft already enables <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and Hulu access on its console making it a curious addition that at this moment doesnt seem to have a large footprint Recording video game streams and moments gamers want to share with the world did get easier as Kinectenabled devices can call on Windows interface Cortana to record moments via audio command along with other system functionalities which at least addresses the lingering problem with the Xbox Ones interface being unnecessarily confusing It also adds a recognizable voice for those already in the Windows ecosystem which conveys how Microsoft plans to integrate Xbox One and PC gaming though its mostly the ability to play Xbox One games on PC and not the other way around at this point Even though Microsoft spent more time on nongaming improvements compared to its E press conference they still made some big announcements for gamers particularly fans of the Halo franchise It shouldnt be news that Halo is coming out this holiday season and fans are already counting down the days until it comes out As expected Microsoft is looking to capitalize on this by offering a terabyte Xbox One console decked out in Halo colors with a specialdesigned controller and a free digital copy of the game This is a smart move by Microsoft because according to the June NPD figures more games are being bought as bundle packages rather than standalone titles as well as Microsofts push to get the Xbox holdouts to finally switch over It should boost console sales for the holiday season to be sure but it should be seen as more of a way to consolidate the ecosystem around Xbox One and Windows operating systems than as an attempt to close an insurmountable gap with Sony and the PS Another addition to the Halo franchise is the announcement of a million Halo World Championship tournament on October a significant increase from the previous prize pool of As well as a complement to the new edition of the franchise it also puts Halo in direct competition with Activisions NASDAQ ATVI Call of Duty the current esports powerhouse Esports is growing in significance in both the athletic and gaming worlds and while there is definitely enough room for both titles to gain viewers and revenue it gives Microsoft a chance to reclaim the significance it once held at the beginning of the trend A million prize pool will attract committed gamers which will bring additional revenues that will extend the lifecycle of Halo beyond other additions of the game especially with the growing popularity of media outlets like Twitch and YouTube Gaming to supply live coverage for millions of viewers worldwide From a revenue standpoint this has the potential to be a goldmine for the Xbox and Microsoft if its energy can be focused here rather than a console war that appears all but over As much as one can tout Microsofts gaming improvements at Gamescom especially when the walls between PC and Xbox are slowly coming down it makes the time Microsoft spent on trying to become an entertainment console that is continually baffling That was the strategy back in that did longlasting damage to the brand and it really looked like Microsoft had turned the corner back in June Its good that Microsoft is becoming more gamer focused and the addition of Xbox titles as backward compatible games shows they are learning from their mistakes but its still not a fullthroated embrace of Xbox One as a gamers machine With Oculus Rift and HoloLens set to debut in giving Microsoft two strong entrants in the next wave of gaming it would have been nice to see Gamescom get used purely to promote these products rather than remind the public of Xboxs nongaming functions Microsoft should continue its forward march rather than try and improve the past because the future looks incredible Source
