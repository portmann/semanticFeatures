other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will look to build on its by continuing to expand out its original programming and continuing to have yearround launches The networks foray into films will continue to be heavily watched in including how its debut Beasts of No Nation fares during award season As we welcome a lot has changed in the world of streaming media While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX remains the leader in the market the playing field has changed considerably in the last months Now new rivals are making their mark as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>prepares to expand its original content yet again For those of you keeping tabs on this fascinating sector here are three things you need to know about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its outlook in Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its streaming rivals dont release ratings a large part of determining what is and isnt a success is dependent on how critics and award voters respond to the programming To say award voters are embracing streaming media would be an understatement Take the Golden Globes for example as when they announced their nominees last month of the series up for top honors Best ComedyDrama five are from streamers Breaking it down further of the group of six up for Best Comedy four are from online providers and one of those actually won In total of the nominations from the Globes came from series not airing on a traditional broadcast network If youre an investor in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Amazon NASDAQ AMZN or even Hulu right now youre probably feeling pretty good and wed understand why This was a fullblown invasion of streaming content into the mainstream awards season and it is going to have longlasting repercussions on how we watch TV <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>even topped HBO as the most nominated network at the Globes which marks an important change of guard Yet heres the twist Usually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the one earning all the award recognition but now Amazon Prime and even Hulu are invading the territory In fact despite all of Netflixs nominations this year it didnt convert a single one to a win In contrast Amazon won twice Now the true impact of those results wont truly be felt until the Emmy nominations this summer but investors shouldnt underestimate the threat For now the overall focus still remains on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>because it is the originator and again it did top HBO in total nominations which is important because that broke a year streak With the service committed to doubling down on its original programming in and rivals Amazon and Hulu continuing to gain new ground this threat from the cordcutting generation of series isnt going away One thing of note was that among those eight nominations for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>House of Cards earned just one While it was slighted in most of the main categories unlike in past years the important differentiator is that the network still loomed large without it Thats good news for the streamer as Cards likely only has another few seasons left in it before star Kevin Spacey decides to make a fulltime return to movies or the theater Cards did its job it set the table for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and the network was able to take advantage of the momentum and build off its success The studio unleashed a number of new hit series in and it wont stop in In addition to new episodes of Cards Orange Narcos Bloodlines Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Marvelbased Daredevil and Jessica Jones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is set to unveil a stunning roster of new series Speaking of Marvel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is expected to debut Luke Cage and Iron Fist in paving the way for The Defenders presumably in which will combine the leads from all four series into one program a la The Avengers Of course the network isnt fully relying on superheroes and its other programming options look just as healthy For example it will look to awardwinning filmmakers Judd Apatow and Baz Luhrmann for such buzzy projects as Love and The Get Down Love is described as a downtoEarth comedic look at dating with Gillian Jacobs Community and Paul Rust Super Fun Night in the lead roles Meanwhile Get Down is a musical drama that revolves around a group of teens in the age of disco Fan favorites Jimmy Smitts NYPD Blue and Giancarlo Esposito Breaking Bad headline You also cant forget about the nostalgia factor as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will bring back the cast of Full House for spinoff Fuller House as well as reunite That s Shows Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson in The Ranch Both comedies are expected to get an immediately strong reception Much has also been made about the networks entrance into the world of movies The networks theatrical debut Beasts of No Nation got off to a rough start when it bombed at the box office Yet as I mentioned previously that should have no effect on its success overall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had to release the movie in theaters to be eligible for the Oscars and the streamer never expected to make money during that run Of course that didnt stop analysts from taking cheap shots at the studios business model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is having the last laugh though as so far at least of the most prestigious award groups have included Beasts as either a nominee or a winner in multiple categories It is also heavily expected to maintain some sort of presence at the Oscars Meanwhile will expand that experiment as Brad Pitt will be the studios next big headline with the film War Machine Pitts Plan B productions made the film which is based on the book The Operators The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of Americas War in Afghanistan Written by Michael Hastings the film centers on Gen Stanley A McChrystal the former commander of the US and international troops in Afghanistan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reportedly spent million to acquire the film as it saw promise in the premise It will also release Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Sword of Destiny PeeWees Big Holiday Mascots and the Ricky Gervais vehicle Special Correspondents The bottom line is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is for now well positioned to maintain its current run in after a number of big wins in Combined with its expansion into additional markets the network is looking more and more prepared for what will be an onslaught of competition going forward But make no mistake that competition is coming and is getting stronger </div></body></html>
