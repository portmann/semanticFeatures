class='textDiv'>Amazon Just Fired A Major Shot At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>have similar goals for the streaming movie space but different approaches On Thursday at CinemaCon Amazon revealed it would no longer look to secure a short theatrical window for its films and instead go with the full day approach The move brings theaters into the fold as partners and doesnt alienate them in the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does with its unyielding day and date demands The end result will be Amazons films will get additional exposure and as a result additional revenue and awards considerations In the world of streaming media the two biggest players are Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Each has their pros and cons and each has fiercely loyal customers however one key difference maker might give Amazon an important edge its relationship with theaters As Ive written previously the battle for consumer dollars has expanded beyond the traditional big screen with streaming media taking a major role in the proceedings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>started it last year with its Beasts of No Nations and will be a prominent player again this year alongside Amazon Yet while the end goal of winning accolades and audiences is the same the approach couldnt be more different <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>enters the market with a dayanddate directive In other words it is adamant any film released in theaters get a simultaneous airing on its platform Theaters hate that because it doesnt do them any good They have no reason to waste a valuable screen on a film audiences will in all likelihood opt to watch online The end result is only a handful of independentlyowned theaters running the movie For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>thats fine because it just needs one New York and LA run to get awards consideration The problem is that approach didnt get it as far as it hoped last year Now look at Amazon which is coming into this differently It recognizes the best way to counter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is to get the theaters on its side If Amazon can make the theater owners understand it values the theatergoing experience and is not coming after their income then its films will get a lot more exposure For investors thats the key Added exposure means an added advantage in the awards race Everyone assumed because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was backing Beasts and it had a proven track record with content it was going to be a major award player Yet while the movie was in the hunt and did earn a few awards it was shut out in the races that really mattered In the end a large part of the reason for that was voters didnt see it as a real movie and many decided not to vote for it as a result That theory was recently backed up by the films director Emmy winner Cary Fukunaga in an interview with Alec Baldwins Heres The Thing podcast In a fascinating discussion Fukunaga is very frank about why the film didnt get support and the fact he still hasnt had a real followup conversation with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>about what happened Now to be fair to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Fukunaga cant be too ticked off because hes now working with the streamer again on Maniac a new series starring Jonah Hill and Emma Stone Regardless it is still an excellent scenario that explains the problem facing the streaming revolution The company tried to take a similar simultaneous release track with its first film ChiRaq The difference was Amazon gave theaters a small window of exclusivity The theaters in turn still passed and outside of controversy around its subject matter nobody was talking about it in the media The film fell flat Amazon though has learned from its mistakes and has since dropped the smaller window stipulation and will go to the traditional day window Marketing and distribution chief Bob Berney a respected industry veteran hammered home that message on Thursday at CinemaCon alongside Amazon studio chief Roy Price The annual convention in Las Vegas is a weeklong showcase to exhibitors that previews the years hottest projects For the first time ever Amazon had a presence and got some much needed facetime with theater owners The message was clear we are your ally All the films we are acquiring and making will be released theatrically with aggressive marketing campaigns intent on bringing customers to your theaters Make no mistake this is an important declaration Amazon just came out and said to theater owners that it understands the sandbox they are playing in Its no longer us or them its a partnership Shareholders need to understand why this is a turning point Amazons agreement to work with the theaters means its films will actually be seen in theaters It will also make life easier for the studios Amazon partners with for those releases Remember unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Amazons recent acquisitions include both theatrical and streaming rights Amazon will of course handle streaming but will work with a partner of its choosing for theatrical In fact the companys other big CinemaCon news was that it had signed a deal with Lions Gate NYSE LGF to handle the theatrical run for its Woody Allen film Caf Society which will be the directors first wide release since Given Allens films are usually platformed out and utilize a limited run model thats a big deal Amazon will also team with Roadshow Attractions for the distribution of its buzzy Manchester By The Sea which is an early Oscar hopeful And lets be honest thats the end game here Amazon wants to be the home to Academy Award winning content because it knows that will add subscribers and thats vital to its investors Adding customers is the lifeblood of Amazons Prime service and this change in strategy will serve that end goal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still going to be a force to be reckoned with but Amazon just gained a powerful advantage that will make this awards race a lot closer and more interesting to watch Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote
