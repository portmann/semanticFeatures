the market today after announcing positive news The company has launched in several countries and continues to explore a key market Today well talk about the launch and exploration what were seeing in the market today as a result and what we can expect to see from NFLX moving forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Is Launching Services Globally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>announced a very big move today Today the company is bringing its internet television services to more than countries around the world simultaneously As soon as the announcement was made the services went live In a statement CEO Reed Hastings had the following to say Today you are witnessing the birth of a new global Internet TV network With this launch consumers around the world from Singapore to St Petersburg from San Francisco to Sao Paulo will be able to enjoy TV shows and movies simultaneously no more waiting With the help of the internet we are putting power in consumers hands to watch whenever wherever and on whatever device To ensure that everyone in these countries will be able to enjoy the service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has also added a large number of languages Today Arabic Korean and Chinese were added to the languages already supported by the service Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still not available in China this may not be the case forever In fact NFLX announced that it is in the process of exploring options for providing services in the country There are also three other countries that it is not able to provide services in due to US government restrictions on American companies Those countries include Syria Crimea and North Korea What The News Means For NFLX Moving Forward This news is absolutely huge for NFLX Think about it In the past <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was only available in a very limited area While their target market was rather large it was nothing compared to having a global market As a result of the news today billions of consumers now have the ability to sign up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and if it climbs anywhere near as fast elsewhere as it has in the United States this is going to be huge for investors As investors we have learned that when positive news comes out with regard to a publicly traded company we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock Thats exactly what were seeing as a result of the announcement that NFLX has gone worldwide Currently NFLX is trading at after a gain of and the stock seems to be continuing upward What We Can Expect To See From NFLX Moving Forward Moving forward I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion with regard to what we can expect to see from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Ultimately the company has proven over time that it has the ability to take control over a market and sell its services Now the service is not only available in such a limited market Instead it is available worldwide This will generate massive amounts of sales leading to solid earnings reports and gains for the stock moving forward Where do you think NFLX is headed moving forward Let us know your opinion in the comments below Buy NFLX Stock from Modest Money Recommended Brokers Get in free
