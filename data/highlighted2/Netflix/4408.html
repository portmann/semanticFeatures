strength of Marvel and Frozen Hasbro ready to ride Disneys coattails with rights to Frozen in and Marvel and Star Wars through Shares of Disney NYSE DIS hit record highs on Thursday as investors responded to several announcements made by the media company Most of the items presented werent huge secrets or even new but rather confirmations and release dates This was enough to get investors excited and for great reason as the future continues to play into Disneys hands with blockbusters contributing to several operating segments After listening to the presentation from Thursday and reading through supporting materials I wanted to share some quick opinions and also show how Hasbro NASDAQ HAS will benefit along the way Perhaps the biggest news from Thursday was the fact that Disney is officially working on a sequel to the billion grossing singalong phenomenon Frozen This doesnt come as a huge surprise to me as I have predicted several times that a sequel was going to happen Of course this announcement comes at the perfect time as this weekends release of Cinderella will feature the exclusive Frozen Fever short film to moviegoers prior to the featured movie As I predicted before I think this could lead to Cinderella seeing strong revenue as until the animated short is released elsewhere or leaked online this will be the only way fans of Frozen can see the movie Now that the sequel has been officially announced and fans are getting a look at Frozen Fever the next question on everyones mind will be concerning the release date Ive been pretty open in my belief that the movie will be released November based on blocked off dates and an already pretty full lineup I stand behind this guess although part of me thinks it would make sense to release it earlier I think the official announcement will come at this years D Expo to be held in August Shares could see a nice pop on this announcement as well Since Disneys acquisition of the Marvel comic book brand Disney has worked aggressively at releasing movies each year and expanding the licensing power of these wellknown characters Toy sales for Marvel related merchandise were up last year This IGN article says Disney is trying to appeal to audiences by licenses of the individual members of The Avengers and not just as one collective essentially breaking the superhero team back up That article also sites expanding Avengers characters into newly licensed areas like food Chobani granola bars and action sports SpiderMan Womens fashion was also one area mentioned for expansion of the expansion of the Avengers brand SpiderMan will likely see a stronger push now that Disney can also use him in upcoming movies One area that might not be getting enough attention is the Guardians of the Galaxy brand This movie was a huge success and is now bringing a sequel movie and an animated television show which will premiere on the companys own Disney XD later in With the strength of the brand and the expansion into television Disney has already extended current Guardians licenses and has also signed new ones Along with Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy providing a boost Disney is already planning ahead for its shows set to debut on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX this year Disney has created individual merchandising programs for the upcoming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shows Jessica Jones Luke Cage and Daredevil Along with the Frozen confirmation the next biggest news was concerning the Star Wars franchise which is one of the newest pieces to the Disney puzzle The company announced that the spinoff movie will be titled Rogue One This movie has a release date of December and will be in the years between Star Wars VII and Star Wars VIII Disney is already getting aggressive with the brand by releasing a Star Wars related movie every year beginning in This strategy has worked with Marvel and by Disney utilizing the large base of characters in the Star Wars universe it should have similar success with origin stories and spinoffs As I have said several times the upcoming Star Wars movies are going to be blockbusters in my opinion and similar to Frozen carry into every segment for the company That means theme park attractions cruise ships video games movies television and video games The addition of the Star Wars movie in adds to an exciting lineup of movies set to release over the next several years Also it makes for a rather interesting fiscal as two Star Wars movies will be released in the same fiscal year something investors should definitely be excited about While most movie analysts focus on the box office basis on a calendar year I think its important to lay out the fiscal year splits for Disney here I called Captain America Civil War a new Avengers style movie with the inclusion of Iron Man and rumored SpiderMans first appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe I believe this could lead to Avengers style box office So then pair that box office with a new Star Wars movie and several other sure blockbusters and you have an incredibly strong fiscal Now take a look at fiscal and you have two Star Wars movies two Marvel movies Toy Story and the continued expansion of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise My earlier predictions called for the following Toy Story million domestic billion international Star Wars VIII million domestic billion international Add those three up and you have worldwide box office of billion for the contributing fiscal year from just three movies Then factor in the rest of the movies and you can see how that year could be extremely special for Disney and its shareholders The presentation on Thursday confirmed the strength of Disneys brands as consumer products In the last year Disney had separate brands that saw global retail sales of billion or more The strength and focus on consumer products should be a big deal to investors The most recent first quarter shows exactly how important consumer products are to the bottom line for Disney especially given shares now triple digit price and creeping up price to earnings multiple Here is a look at first quarter earnings As you can see from the chart consumer products was the fourth highest revenue contributor for the first quarter But a quick look at the third and fourth columns paints a strong picture for this segment that should have investors excited The consumer segment was the third highest contributor to profits and posted the highest operating margin While other toy stocks like Mattel and Leapfrog have fallen shares of Hasbro have fared better gaining in to date A big reason for Hasbros success is the strength of Disneys consumer brands The company has the rights to several product lines under the Marvel and Star Wars banners To make matters more exciting Hasbro also acquired the rights to make dolls based on the Frozen and Disney Princess brands a move which saw Hasbro take the rights from rival Mattel At the time of this announcement I said I thought the deal between Hasbro and Disney confirmed a sequel to Frozen was happening Hasbro now has the rights to Frozen beginning in and the rights to Star Wars and Marvel through the year which would as of now cover the new Star Wars trilogy While Hasbro is a big winner by having these rights in place Disney has already won in terms of guaranteed royalties The deals for Star Wars and Marvel will bring in million and million respectively in guaranteed money for Disney further boosting the consumer products line Shares of Hasbro are up in and continue to trade close to week highs Shares also sport a dividend yield which should not be underestimated as a reason to go long now for the long term benefits Analysts see revenue growing in fiscal to billion This figure could come in conservative depending on the initial lineup of Frozen products and the official release date The strength of Marvel Star Wars and Frozen should power shares of Hasbro higher in and I think shares could end the year closing in on So with Disney shares up an already impressive and sitting at record highs whats the play here I have recommended buying shares of Disney for years and often cite wait for pullbacks and buy shares This isnt exactly a company that has seen large pullbacks that create good entry points I think the days of not being in the triple digits could be over unless the company decides to split its shares which I anticipated earlier at the triple digit mark I threw out a earnings multiple on Disney before to justify a share price I think in the end valuation is hard to gauge on Disney as the media company will continue to shift into an event driven catalyst play Yahoo Finance currently lists revenue targets of billion and billion respectively for the current and next fiscal year Those figures factor in growth of around each year While this is a great number for a billion plus company I still think it could be conservative given the strength Disney has been showing across the board in all business segments While this article really focuses on studio and consumer products other segments like television theme parks China open in and interactive first profit last fiscal year could also serve as ways to report higher than expected revenue With that being said Disney is a name investors need to be in going forward I dont think there is going to be a valuation correction anytime soon and think releases of movies like Frozen Star Wars VII and Avengers Age of Ultron will continue to provide rapid boosts to the share price Each quarterly report should also provide a nice boost unless the company stumbles on guidance which I dont see as a strong likelihood Remember there is still several events that can drive shares higher in the short and long term For starters the box office results of blockbusters like Avengers Age of Ultron and Star Wars VII act as catalysts A later announcement of the actual release date of Frozen also serves as a catalyst as it will determine which fiscal year the movie falls in and how it could shape up future
