justified What are the real metrics underlying overall revenue numbers Mr Market was clearly disappointed after Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Q earnings were reported After trading close to its week high before the earnings call the stock is now down by more than and is now trading below Lets take a closer look at the their earnings to identify if the sell off was really warranted or if its a great buying opportunity in disguise A quick glance at their quarterly earnings metrics is sort of disheartening to any Microsoft investor as revenue declined for the quarter and for the first nine months of this fiscal Reportable Segment Analysis A Mixed Bag Their productivity and business processes segment Office products and Microsoft Dynamics posted a increase intelligent cloud All cloudrelated products enterprise services and consulting was up by and more personal computing Windows Xbox devices and search advertising increased by So all wasnt lost this past quarter The major hit to overall revenues came from corporate and other the segment which accounts for revenue deferrals related to Windows that segment booked a loss of billion for the quarter and billion for the first nine months of the current fiscal With PC on the decline and Microsofts device business not taking off as expected it was a given that more personal computing the lead earner for Microsoft would take the worst hit The growth they showed this quarter is overshadowed by the they lost year to date compared with the same period last year and this declining trend may well continue in this segment On the other hand the productivity and business processes segment is holding steady on the back of growing Office subscriptions despite declining legacy Office product sales something that has directly been impacted by declining PC sales since As for the intelligent cloud segment it has taken the lead growth position but did not grow as fast as some might have expected them to This applies specifically to cloudbased revenues to which the infrastructure component Azure is or should have been a significant contributor Overall the intelligent cloud unit grew during Q during Q and during Q That was at the low end of their guidance and Microsoft also iterated that it expects foreign exchange to negatively impact the segment by points in Q The slowing growth in what was expected to be the lead growth segment coupled with a not so enthusiastic guidance for the last quarter has taken the toll on the stock Despite the struggles its been having this fiscal I think the recent selloff is not at all justified In the shortterm yes the company has disappointed on several fronts But in the grander scheme of things is a transformative and transitory period for several companies in the tech space Oracle NYSE ORCL Cisco NASDAQ CSCO IBM NYSE IBM Facebook NASDAQ FB <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and many other companies are attempting to change their basic DNA not an easy task and certainly not one that is going to be given any leeway by investors In Microsofts case the company is clearly trying to get intelligent cloud to swap places with more personal computing as the key growth driver of sustainable revenue growth But its going to take time and thats exactly whats weighing down the stock at this point Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeds billion Q Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeds billion Q Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeds billionQ At the end of third quarter Microsoft said that commercial clouds annualized revenue has reached billion to put it another way billion a quarter The company aims to double this number by and thats exactly why the current slow down and the notsopositive guidance has played a huge damper on the sentiments To get to billion in commercial cloud revenues Microsoft has to grow in the to range every quarter sequentially from here until which I believe they can still do despite the obvious slowdown from Q to Q when compared to Q to Q They have only just entered the hybrid cloud space with Azure Stack and that promises to be a strong revenue earner in the enterprise segment where Microsoft already has a significant presence In terms of stabilizing the other segments I think theyre gradually getting there Heres a look at the past three quarters where you can see the results of their efforts So even though this past quarter has been a sort of mixed bag with respect to growth in various areas we need to look at the longterm implications of what Nadella and the company are doing in key strategic areas The basic shift from being a productbased company into becoming a servicesoriented one is a hard nut to crack even for a small company And for a huge vessel like Microsoft the challenges are compounded to a much greater degree The important things to keep your eyes on are Windows adoption million users as of last count commercial adoption of Office million with revenue growing by in constant currency the embracing of the open source community via Xamarin and UWP and their recent entry into the hybrid model for enterprise cloud solutions Microsoft is now trading at times its forward earnings and as each of the business segments claws back again with intelligent cloud taking the pole position I think the upside is very much there for Microsoft so loading up now while its trading at the level would be a good investment decision If you would like to follow me for more analysis in the tech space and
