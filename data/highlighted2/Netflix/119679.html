Alpha Jul AM ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NFLX by Dan Rayburn When writing about public companies on my blog I have said many times that I have never bought sold or traded a single share of stock in any public company ever While my blog is not a site for financial advice or guidance I still wanted to disclose that yesterday I purchased stock in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX For me its a longterm play as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>really seems to be firing on all cylinders right now and I like their road map for international expansion Their subscriber growth outside of the US is starting to see some nice gains they continue to add new content to their inventory and they are doing a good job of licensing content for the geographic regions they are expanding into With M in revenue from international subscribers for Q Netflixs well on their way to becoming a company with M subs within a few years Most on Wall Street estimate it will take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>until to reach M subscribers but I think they will do it sooner than that With just over M customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>only needs to add M new subs a quarter over the next quarters to reach M subs by the end of Some argue that will be hard once Apple NASDAQ AAPL comes out with a streaming subscription service of their own but until Apple actually has something in the market if it ever happens and we can judge whether or not it can compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>there is no threat And while Amazon NASDAQ AMZN competes with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to date they have not shown they can keep <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>from expanding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>likes to talk a lot about how they see HBO as their biggest competitor but HBOs catalog of content is very small and the one thing consumers have shown us is that they want a lot of choice Netflixs content catalog offers real depth and breadth of choice whereas HBOs is very limited What Id really like to know is what methodology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is using to judge the impact of their original content strategy on their business They keep saying it helps their business but we have no details on the direct impact Does original content produce new subscribers or is it simply a way to reduce churn I think the latter but until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gives out some viewing statistics which I dont see them doing any time soon we have no real way to measure it But they would not be spending M to create one season of House Of Cards if they didnt see positive results on their business so one has to simply trust that they know how to properly measure the impact of original content creation good and bad on their business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has gotten so big now with a market cap of almost B that it almost guarantees that they will remain independent Many have speculated that Netflixs longterm strategy was to be acquired but considering how big they are now who would acquire them There is almost no one who could afford them and the few that could think Apple Amazon Microsoft Facebook and Alibaba have already missed the boat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is almost too big now for it to make sense for even any of them to acquire the company And with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>only getting stronger bigger and growing their business well outside the US every day that goes by Netflixs value continues to rise It really is amazing what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has accomplished in just seven years and how fast they have growth Source Why
