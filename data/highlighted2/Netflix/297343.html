any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Earlier this month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>announced it was launching its service in more countries Since the announcement the stock price has failed to show any positive signs I try to explain the challenges and opportunities it may face in different countries of the world by using the example of Pakistan To everyones surprise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX announced earlier this month that it had started selling its streaming service in new countries a move that was expected to take place by the end of this year One of the most important regions it expanded into was the market located in the subcontinent even though it still has to tap into China I cant help but wonder that maybe this sudden global expansion is more like Reed Hastings the CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>rolling dice altogether instead of putting in the due diligence of proper analysis of each territory Sure there will be a lot of places where Hastings and his company will roll a but what about other markets where the company is rather uncertain To understand one aspect from one of these uncertain countries I am going to examine the market prospects of Pakistan for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The number of internet users in Pakistan stands at about of the population In other words thats million internet users and a figure that has grown at an average pace of over the past eight years In just alone the number of internet users in Pakistan grew by more than The country was a latecomer to the world of ecommerce but still holds significant opportunities especially when we consider the massive rise in online shopping within the country As of annual online spending stood at million By this number is expected to balloon to million In the government of Pakistan auctioned G and LTE licenses to the telecom companies operating in the country bringing the popularity of highspeed internet to new heights The response has been promising Pakistan Telecommunication Authority PTA revealed that the number of G users in the country stood at million as of November while LTE and G subscribers amounted to just over users A major challenge for companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in Pakistan will be countering the massive black market Movies are easily available through bootleg DVDs while the more tech savvy crowd tends to torrent their material So when it will come to choosing between a paid monthly subscription versus a free getting the same content for free which one do you think most people will go for Lurking behind all of this mess is the countrys sensitive censorship laws More than three years ago YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL was completely banned after the controversial movie Innocence of Muslims was uploaded sparking deadly riots across Pakistan and many other Muslim countries It wasnt until January after YouTube launched a localized version of the site for Pakistan allowing the government to request the restriction of any content it deems objectionable In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to be patient and tread lightly so that it doesnt offend viewers in the country All it could take is one overambitiously racy scene and countrywide operations could come to a standstill Alas things are changing in the country Internet laws and regulations are regularly being focused on especially as ecommerce becomes a more accessible feature to the common man The public sector leadership will eventually have to clamp down on illegal distribution of movies and criminalize piracy altogether a feat which will have economic consequences the country might have to stomach But the arrival of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and the overall surge in ecommerce activity indicates Pakistanis will be more welcoming of any regulatory action <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>being a predominantly English service will have to adjust quickly for the support features as well as the content it offers The company said that it has added support for Korean and Arabic along with simplified and traditional Chinese to the new languages it now offers So far the company has shown some level of dedication toward capturing audiences in different parts of the world A few weeks before launching worldwide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>announced that they were adding a Pakistani movie called Zinda Bhaag to their content list This paves the way for more Pakistani movies to try and get them uploaded onto Netflixs content database Similarly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is speeding up efforts to reach a more diverse crowd by debuting new series in alone The influx of subscribers will proportionately increase the essential financing capabilities of the company to spend on their content It should be noted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has also banned the use of VPNs which allowed users in different countries to stream the content available in other countries This may be a small nuisance for some users but other users might see this as a dealbreaker Many subscribers often use proxy servers to surpass the restrictions imposed in their geographic territories These restrictions often limit the content available to them on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>forcing them to use proxy servers Using the example of the Pakistani market as a basis for understanding Netflixs global expansion isnt meant to be a conclusive analysis of the companys new strategy It is meant to help investors and maybe even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>understand the deep level of complexity involved with each region of the world What the company did was basically adopt a Well cross that bridge when we come to it strategy Its not impossible but its definitely easier said than done The expansion has helped the companys subscriber base grow faster than they had expected as the company added million users in their fourth quarter taking the worldwide tally up to nearly million Despite the bold move of launching its service across the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is cautious and realizes it wont start making a profit on this expansion till at least a year down the line that too if everything works out Over the past year the company stock has surged by more than peaking out at a week high of per share However the last six months have seen the stock price fluctuate to a great degree as uncertainty loomed over its subscriber base due to the saturated US market The latest quarterly report shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported a net profit of cents a share down from cents a share the year before If the expansion fails to impress investors once the company does cross the oneyear buffer it has given itself then the stock price will see itself on a slippery slope Until then it is a waiting game </div></body></html>
