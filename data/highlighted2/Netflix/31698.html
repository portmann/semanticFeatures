could help differentiate the Apple TV brand There is incredible risk to investing in storytelling but Apple might increase shareholder value over time by exposure to entertainment Apple NASDAQ AAPL is a technology company that makes computers phones tablets and watches Its good at making those things and it has made billions from them However should Apple just be a technology company It is time for Apple to consider making movies and television shows It is time for Apple to compete with Disney NYSE DIS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and all the other contentproduction entities that capture the collective imagination of the culture Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL got into content and advertising revenue via YouTube Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN started Amazon Studios Apple will need at some point to start designing storyboards and chasing copyrights in addition to drawing schematics and filing patent applications Apple has a lot of cash and it generates a lot of cash A serious amount It has a market cap well over billion Obviously the company doesnt want to risk all that it will continue leveraging its intellectual resources and data to generate new technological tools for others to use in the pursuit of creativity and running business models That still doesnt mean that Apple cant afford to spend some of its corporate time acquiring screenplays The Apple TV product helps to prove the point It is being positioned as an alternative to cable and its recent announcement that the companys ecosystem offers subscription access to HBO is notable HBO is a distributor of content produced by others but it also produces its own content In fact what is the value of the HBO brand today Is it based on reruns of an old s movie starring Molly Ringwald or is it tied more closely to Game of Thrones and Girls Shows like the latter have upgraded HBO in the minds of many consumers of entertainment and the proper curation of such content helps to differentiate a service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is in a similar situation Output deals are important and can help serve as a backbone but House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black help push consumers from the maybeIshouldsubscribe to the Ishouldsubscribe mindset <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also is getting into movie development Apple should use some of its cash to produce original programming Apple could use quality shows and movies to make its Apple TV platform more valuable The phrase content is king is probably overused since platform does matter if you dont think it does ask any YouTube star what their eventual goals are if they dont reply to have a broadcast TV show or to star in a film distributed by a major you can bet theyre lying but content is extremely important and basically helps to define and power a platform in the first place There is a connection between Apples DNA and storytelling Look no further than Pixar Steve Jobs helped build that company and brand into a powerhouse animation studio Disney eventually had to own it Which brings me to Disney CEO Bob Iger He spent billions expanding Disneys character set Heres a hypothetical if Iger were Apples CEO and not just a board member how would he be thinking I bet he would want to take Apple into the content arena just as he did the opposite over at Disney With initiatives like a wireless device for the wrist that reduces the friction of transactions in a theme park Iger has proved to be enamored of technological advancement He also was a big fan and friend of Jobs Assuming Iger continues to remain on the Apple board for the next several years I have to wonder if he may eventually help push Apple in the direction of making movies and TV shows especially once he steps down from the top spot at Disney Even suggestions for acquisitions wouldnt be out of the question Apple may look to buy smaller production companies or maybe even make a big purchase like acquiring something like a Lions Gate Entertainment NYSE LGF or maybe even a cable channel like AMC Networks NASDAQ AMCX There is enough money in Apples coffers of course to start a new Pixarlike animation house A combination of acquisitions and internal studio creations would not be a bad idea Shareholders may not like such a proposal for Apple for two very important reasons First its hard to quantify the risk of content production a faster processor speed has more inarguable value than a movie about zombies fighting vampires Second transparency in the field of movie economics is nonexistent Fair points but they probably shouldnt discourage shareholders from encouraging Apple to tell stories Instead they should want Apple to do so and then pressure the company as well as other players in the media space to be more forthcoming in distribution of information regarding economic profits and deal structures related to filmed entertainment Apple will become a major media company like Disney one day Maybe both companies will merge in the future as some have suggested Anything can happen but the Apple board and CEO Tim Cook should examine the possibilities offered by storytelling to increase shareholder value Source Apple Should Invest In Original Filmed Content Disclosure The author is long DIS MoreThe author wrote this article themselves
