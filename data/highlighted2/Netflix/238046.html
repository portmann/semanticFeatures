Seeking Alpha Ben Strubel Strubel Investment Management clicks Nov PM ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NFLX Includes CBS CMCSA CMCSK DIS FOX FOXA TWX VIA VIAB by Ben Strubel Time Warners potential investment in Hulu means stronger competition for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Content costs are still rising and the deeper Hulus pockets get the more costs are likely to continue to go up Comcasts push toward data caps could make streaming as expensive as traditional cable Two recent news items one from Hulu and one from Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK should give pause to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX shareholders and give traditional media company investors some reasons for optimism Comcast just announced it was expanding its usage of caps on broadband usage and news leaked that Time Warner NYSE TWX may invest in Hulu Last Friday several news reports leaked that Time Warner was interested in buying a stake in Hulu that would value the company around B or B In a recent article we argued that Hulu is worth closer to B but the B number is certainly a huge jump over the last transaction in which valued the company at only B The transaction would give Hulu even more content firepower as the company would be owned by four of the top six media conglomerates Disney NYSE DIS TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA NBCUniversalComcast and Time Warner Of the major media companies only Viacom NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB and CBS NYSE CBS wouldnt hold an equity stake in Hulu Most importantly however is the deal should finally signal to investors that the major media companies are serious about their commitment to Hulu and using it as a tool to compete with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Too often in the past media companies have been hesitant to embrace change and new methods of content delivery but this time it looks like they finally have their act together to unite behind a successful consumerfriendly platform The chart below is what should scare <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>investors Highlighted in yellow are the total content library balances as a percent of revenues and the YoY revenue growth compared to YoY content cost growth All figures are taken from the companys Ks We can see that content costs have been growing faster than revenues have been growing for the past three years However you will notice that the difference is slowing and as the business becomes larger content costs are increasing a slower rate So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on the surface may seem like nothing to worry about A business becoming more profitable as it scales up Except now we may have an even more wellfunded Hulu competing for content with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and driving up prices Remember that Hulu just recently outbid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for both Seinfeld and Empire With Hulu now possibly having Time Warners financial backing its likely we will see content costs increase as bidding becomes fiercer and Hulus pockets become deeper and more entwined with the traditional media companies Perhaps even more worrying to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>than Hulu is the ongoing efforts of the telecommunication companies to restrict data usage Recently Comcast announced it was dramatically expanding its GB per month data cap on broadband internet The new data caps will now apply to many of Comcasts customers in the companys southern markets Users will now be required to pay per extra GB used per month or pay an additionally surcharge of per month to get truly unlimited data If or when data caps like this expand to more markets it may dramatically change the demand for streaming services Right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Amazon Prime Hulu and other streaming services have an enormous cost advantage over traditional television Cable companies must build out the physical network infrastructure and connect each customers home to their cable network as well as pay content licensing fees to the major media companies to carry their channels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on the other hand is able to piggyback on existing networks to deliver substantially similar content For example in its last fiscal year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had M streaming customers and spent M on capital expenditures Comcast on the other hand had M customers but spent B on capital expenditures The difference is even more stark when you take into account that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a fast growing company so its capital investment levels are likely being spent with an eye toward providing additional capacity for future growth We think that this arrangement will not continue indefinitely and the recent moves by Comcast are a precursor to a future where cord cutting streaming users are forced to shoulder the costs of the required network infrastructure spending It could be data surcharges like Comcast looks to want to begin to implement It could be lobbying to weaken net neutrality rules and then force streaming providers to pay surcharges to have their traffic delivered with those streaming services likely being forced to pass on those charges to customers Whatever the future looks like we dont see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and others can continue to essentially freeload on the billions of dollars of infrastructure spending done by incumbent telcos This raises the question of what the costs of streaming versus cable might look like in the future We put together a table below that shows the cost comparisons for a midtier Comcast cable package versus a cord cutter streaming bundle We are assuming for the cable package that you get some type of movie channel package for free and are a good enough negotiator or complainer to get the cable company to keep providing that to you for free We also assumed a month charge for a DVR capable cable box For the cord cutter we assumed youd want Hulu for current TV shows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for its large back catalog and movies and the ESPN streaming service for live sports We believe the table below is as about an apples to apples comparison as you can get As you can see the costs are quite comparable if there is a data surcharge If things continue as they are and the streaming players are able to essentially use the telcos infrastructure for free the cord cutter bundle is only as about half as expensive Right now its really no surprise that streaming is eating into traditional cables market share You can get pretty much the same exact content for just about half the price The reason You basically arent being billed for the billions of dollars the telcos are spending on infrastructure If youre a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shareholder or even a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>user it is worth thinking long and hard about how much longer this cost arrangement will hold Additionally the major media companies seem to finally have united behind Hulu as their tool to force competition into the streaming market and raise prices on content costs Netflixs days as a lowcost streaming provider may soon be numbered and the companys expenses and charges for its service may soon start to rise We only use your contact details to reply
