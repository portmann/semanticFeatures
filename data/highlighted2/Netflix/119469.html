loss for Q international profits M additions helped out by strong Australian response based on survey data On July <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX knocked the cover off the ball with its first post stock split earnings report The share price jumped by over as revenues topped billion with over million in profit While the domestic market contributed to most of the profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is thinking more about its international operations and expansion and while there were no new markets opened this quarter the second half of this year will feature further Asian and European expansion most notably Japan in Q Bearing in mind that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wants its international sector to be profitable by it should be investors main concern to see how it is progressing on this costintensive goal International revenue up costs under control According to the shareholders letter that came with the earnings release <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>emphasized that while no new markets opened up there was continued improvement in existing markets notably Europe and its newest markets in Australia and New Zealand International revenues came in at million up yearoveryear and million members were added across international markets More customers also began paying subscription fees with over of these customers paying for the service up from in Q This is important for Netflixs continued expansion across the world because it shows that existing markets fully accept paying for the product and provides a solid revenue stream to fund nation and region specific projects such as original content that can cater to these markets especially with programs like House of Cards often preceding Netflixs entry into these markets As for Netflixs profitability targets the target has become more realistic thanks to lighter losses in the international sector <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>only suffered a million loss on international revenues last quarter better than the million loss that was projected when the quarter began This was supposed to be the toughest quarter for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>from a profit perspective given the capital investments in expanding the market in Australia and preparing for a mainland Asia incursion later this fall So coming out million better than expected is welcome news thanks to million more in revenue and about more users than previously anticipated Looking ahead Q expects to see a million loss on million in revenue which shows confidence in Netflixs incursion into the Japanese market which would also result in million more paying members While the numbers already seem promising on their own Netflixs projections seem like an understatement Although based on survey data and not on official numbers Australia alone contributed million subscribers last quarter and it was only three months into the service Both countries have large mobile internet markets where most of Netflixs Australia customers get the service and only around onethird of households in each country have pay TV However Japan is a much denser more traditionally techhungry market with some of the highest internet speeds in the world Given Netflixs continued investment in mobile compatibility and new user interface design put up in June it will enter the Japanese market more ready than its other markets with a ripple effect across the domestic and international markets that also have high mobile internet usage rates As a result the million addition target seems too easy to achieve for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as it enters an incredibly rich market and the million loss might be smaller to the same degree Q losses were better This can only be good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and could result in hitting profitability ahead of schedule <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has staked a lot on its international market and after a few struggles in its first wave of European expansion it appears as though the company is not only meeting expectations its exceeding them Better revenues and user additions in the Australian market bodes well for the Japanese expansion and while Q is already expected to have better numbers than Q it might once again be an understatement which makes the now split <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares a very good deal for those looking to get in before Japan goes online and this past quarter becomes just one of many for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its shareholders
