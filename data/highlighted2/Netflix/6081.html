TheFind will accelerate this initiative Facebook can use its data to help firms figure out which product to produce Facebook can tell consumers which products their friends like In the future this may be used with the smartwatch to encourage purchases The future of ecommerce will look very different than it does today The two concepts that will be at the forefront of this change are location and socialbased recommendations Nokia NYSE NOK has a realtime feature where if you face the camera forward it shows you where nearest stores are in real life imposed in a map on the screen I can certainly see a time where a more advanced version of this feature is added to a smartwatch In this scenario haptic feedback can alert a user to when heshe is near a store that heshe likes and there is a sale on a particular item that heshe covets This type of realtime analysis can only be made possible with the information Facebook NASDAQ FB has Facebook is the greatest database of information in the world as users are constantly inputting information on its network The idea that Facebook will only make money through ads in newsfeeds is narrowminded Facebook can and will control the way we make purchases in the future because it has the most information on your habits and taste Right now Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN controls the way you shop online as users often see an item that they want on Facebook and leave the site to purchase it elsewhere Since users spend so much time on Facebook and Instagram it would be more convenient to simply make the purchases on the social networks They can make better recommendations toward future purchases than a website such as Amazon can Plus it has the information on what your friends are purchasing Although the reviews on Amazon are great it isnt the best method for purchasing goods I often wonder if some of the reviews are biased or if the reviewer understands my circumstance This can easily be solved with Facebook in control as I will be able to personally know who is rating the product Since Facebook has the vastest network of people it has a competitive advantage over any other website If Facebook can get users to start buying products more frequently on its website it makes the ads it sells much more powerful The problem that Facebook faces is getting this idea started Facebook discontinued its service that allowed users to buy birthday gifts for friends This product was inherently flawed In my personal situation I would never buy birthday gifts for at least of my friends For the friends I would buy gifts for I would simply give them the gift in person It seemed odd to try out a method for purchasing an item on someone else first It would be awkward if the technology didnt work Luckily for Facebook it can afford minor mishaps like this because its large user base gives it the opportunity to keep trying out new methods to break into the ecommerce space The only downside would be that it came out with such a bad product that it caused users to quit the service Judging by the fact that the invasion of privacy that the company is often lambasted for has not caused a mass exodus of users I highly doubt that a minor misstep in ecommerce will cause many users to delete their Facebook accounts Facebook is doubling down on its efforts to become more relevant in ecommerce by instituting a buy button allowing product ads and purchasing TheFind The buy button allows users to buy a product without leaving Facebook Right now Facebook is still testing this product by partnering with Stripe to make the transaction seamless In the future when this is fully rolled out a small transaction fee may be charged The specific product ads are a glimmer into the future of advertisements Product ads allow for a personalized ad for each user Facebook determines which product a merchant offers is most likely to be bought by each consumer based on their activity and preferences Not surprisingly this has led to a increase in clickthrough rates for Shutterfly ads and doubling conversion rates for Target NYSE TGT It is important to recognize that this is just the beginning for Facebook as this will accelerate the trend of moving ad dollars away from traditional media and onto social media Facebook acquired TheFind to refine its ecommerce initiative TheFind is a website that allows users to find the cheapest items online and the quickest ways to get them delivered The traffic data and the past success of TheFind is not important What is important is how Facebook will integrate it with its existing services Facebook is going to use TheFinds human capital and technological prowess to allow Facebook to stop advertising to consumers items they have already bought through the service TheFind may also help Facebook with its search function as TheFinds search bar is its best feature A great comparison to what Facebook is doing is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has the suggested feature which allows it to recommend Movies and TV shows it thinks the user will like based on hisher watch history Facebook has even more data on its users than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does making this capability much better <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>goes a step further with its data analytics It is able to determine which genre and which actors would be the best fit for its original programming based on the viewing habits of users This same information is available to Facebook but on a grander scale The idea that Facebook can communicate with brands what their next product should be gives an added layer of importance to Facebook To <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>this data allows it to avoid the added cost of filming a pilot for a show For Facebook this means another product that it can charge firms for Facebook can be involved in the creation of a product the advertising and the selling of a product This integration of products will be a boon for Facebooks bottom line in the future Facebook is expanding its tentacles by going after Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL with search and Amazon with product sales When initially trying to find a value for Facebook around the time of the IPO I thought about how much power the company had in that it captures users attention for such a long period of time every day The cost of content is minimal because users log on to see whats happening in their social group In gaining the time of the consumer it was only a matter of time for Facebook to figure out how it would use the data that users give it on a daily basis This data give it a leg up in the area of ecommerce Facebooks essence is ease of use This convenience will be brought to ecommerce as users will find the process even more seamless than Amazons oneclick buy system Amazon still has to get consumers over to its site to make a purchase Since they are already on Facebook it makes intuitive sense to have websites cut it out of the loop and have oneclick buying directly on social media In conclusion Facebook has made several important steps toward becoming an ecommerce powerhouse Although we do not know exactly how TheFind will be implemented as the transaction just occurred last week there is no doubt Facebooks immense set of data and ability to be convenient to users give it a competitive advantage in the industry There may be a point in the future where you are at the store shopping and your watch vibrates When you look at your watch you see that an item you didnt realize was in the store is on sale After swiping right you see that four other Facebook friends have purchased the item and enjoyed it This social element is something only Facebook can offer Source Will TheFind Help Facebook Make Inroads In The ECommerce Space Disclosure The author has no positions
