positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article I like it even more when I consider the level of demand for its bonds in early Debt and price strategies give it plenty of flexibility Its very easy to say that Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX balance sheet is weak Thats what the headline numbers suggest Sales must rise at a steep plus rate yearly to be able to offset surging operating costs for two years at least Otherwise its cash flow profile will get much worse right Well if you focused on its latest balance sheet and cash flow statements you could have as well forgotten what happened in February when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>strolled in the debt market to borrow bn to fund its ambitious expansion plan this might be the most important value driver of all On January st just a few hours after the quarter closed we crossed million members <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>said when it reported fourthquarter results last week The latest number of memberships implies a compound annual growth rate or CAGR of since the end of which is responsible for a bn rise in annual revenue to bn in Its topline grew at a CAGR of during the period and will have to grow at a similar rate this year and next If its growth rate diminishes it might still be able to borrow at convenient rates regardless of whether interest rates rise or fall Banks need clients like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may need to borrow from banks in future to diversify its funding base and push down its cost of debt when it has become a more mature business There are two apparent problems however As it invests heavily to chase growth its profitability will unlikely surge over the next few quarters And at a share its stock is currently valued at over times its projected earnings With regard to its PE let me say that we can safely ignore it at this stage of business maturity and given the residual growth that is embedded in it If anything a high PE indicates a relatively low cost of equity which gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>plenty of flexibility with regard to funding options Expectations should be easy to manage if access to external capital is granted Recent market volatility and a slew of risk metrics point to a very slim chance of a meltdown in the credit markets into It doesnt take a financial guru to understand that if this billionmarketcap streaming video outfit doesnt grow paid memberships its shareholders could be troubled unless that is its valuation becomes so attractive to draw the interest of wouldbe suitors Speculations aside one key element to consider when it comes to determining the appeal of NFLX in this volatile market is the level of demand that its bond issuance received in early First the size of the bond offering that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>launched last year was increased by from bn to bn Click to enlargeSource <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>edited by the author <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will likely have to tap debt markets once again by mid so the response it received from bond investors less than months ago is surely a good sign Second its debt maturity is another element I like the residual maturity of its debt obligations ranges between six and nine years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is exploiting a lowrate environment that is set to last until in my view and will likely continue to do so depending on its funding needs If you are tempted to buy its stock but you also want some yield its bonds could be a valid alternative if you are prepared to embrace equitylike risk Holders may require <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control events at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>added when the bond deal was announced In this context I would not underestimate that just a minor rise in adjusted operating cash flow AOCF would still determine a manageable level of net leverage in but that excludes current content liabilities at over bn Its international push might be successful but for the time being it absorbs a significant amount of capital Revenues rose in but look at the growth rate of each operating cost item excluding the cost of goods sold Inevitably its operating income and net profits fell in Once the latter is adjusted for a few noncash items operating cash flow is negative to the tune of m in and that cash burn rate comes before any deductions for cash flow from investing Click to enlargeSource <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>edited by the author Core cash flows did not cover funding requirements of about bn last year To cover that bn shortfall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could have tried to charge us an additional to monthly starting in January This kind of increase in prices would have generated bn of revenues which is only about bn short of its target Click

calculations are right and based on the assumption of a constant trailing cost base <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could have selffinanced its operations but would have run the risk of alienating its clients at a critical early stage of its international expansion That is why it decided to raise debt in early <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>decided to raise prices of its main plan to per month only in October Its previous price increase was in May My gueestimate is that the next price hike will come in early or a bit later depending on its funding strategy Not only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is passing onto the consumer a higher cost base charging us for great series and films its clients are also paying for part of its rising debts The way it looks the higher the amount of the debt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>loads onto its balance sheet the higher the subscription rates will likely become over time Management decided to err on the side of caution in early two prices increases in less than a year would have not gone down well with the consumer Moreover had it pushed up prices at the beginning of any price rise would have greatly outperformed the US inflation rate which hit a low of on a trailing basis last year but things could be different into with inflation growth projected at up to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a bet on growth and rising inflation rates but even in a deflationary environment demand for its product will likely be relatively inelastic and could offset heavier debt payments When it reported its quarterly results last week its stock surged over in afterhours trading and that performance is consistent with its track record on a few occasions over the past few quarters Management is delivering on its promises but execution must be flawless so it cant afford any mistake let alone certain press coverage How to

importance and is a kind of risk that you ought to consider before snapping up NFLX which could be a good addition to a diversified portfolio particularly if the VIX index stays below and oil prices sit above a barrel over the next months A steady CAGR for NFLX revenue into A weighted average cost of capital of between and Based on these assumptions the net present value of NFLX indicates that its equity might be undervalued by about to at its current valuation of a share Yet only a couple of minor tweaks to CAGR and margins allow us to point to a fair value in the region of
