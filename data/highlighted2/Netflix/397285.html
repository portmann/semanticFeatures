under the surface the recent market rise comes from short covering and a rotation into beatendown energy and commodityrelated stocks Through April the DJIA is up the SP is up barely and NASDAQ is down As Apple NASDAQ AAPL proved last week and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX demonstrated in the previous week the leadership of the stock market is changing fast The stock market may look calm on the surface but were constantly seeing various sectors and stock market components churning wildly under the surface Last week was an incredible week for earnings surprises The flagship stock that was talked about the most last week was Apple which posted negative firstquarter sales and earnings growth its first drop in revenues in years Compounding Apples woes the analyst community is forecasting negative sales and earnings growth for the next two quarters and for all of Apparently there is a push back in emerging markets about the cost of Apples premium iPhones which are very expensive relative to other smartphones Even though Apple introduced a cheaper iPhone SE to boost its emerging market sales competition for smartphones is real and operating margins are under compression Despite the fact that Apple boosted its stock buyback program and raised its quarterly dividend investors were rattled by the first sales decline in iPhones after an incredible nineyear run Clearly Wall Street wants to see positive sales growth which Apple will likely deliver by the fourth quarter when its longanticipated iPhone is expected to be released Please note Louis Navellier does not currently hold a position in AAPL or NFLX Navellier Associates Inc does not currently hold a position in NFLX for any client portfolios Navellier Associates Inc does currently hold a position in AAPL for some client portfolios Some Gems and a Lot of Junk Lead The Recovery Last week in Smallcap Losers Surge April the folks at Bespoke Investment Group updated their decile matrix of the factors that have been driving performance since the stock market lows on February th Amazingly some of the best performers were in the extreme deciles top or bottom with traditionally negative characteristics The bottom in capitalization soared the worst in performance through February th surged the highest in priceearnings PE ratios shot up and the highest in short interest surged In other words your best bet in the market surge from February to April was a smallcap stock with high short interest a high PE ratio and a horrible start to Clearly the recent market rise comes from short covering and a rotation into beatendown energy and commodityrelated stocks Based on my years of monitoring the stock market I can tell you that junk like that usually doesnt stay on top for very long There were some bright spots in the Bespoke report however It also shows that the top decile of stocks with the highest dividend yields surged since the stock market low on February th For comparison purposes the overall SP gained in that same time span Another sector with sound fundamentals also rose Specifically the bottom of stocks with the lowest PE ratios surged These two segments show us that some stocks with good underlying fundamental factors have virtually doubled the markets average gains over the last weeks So far among the companies in the SP that have announced their firstquarter results positive earnings surprises are running at a pace higher than the pace at the same time in the fourth quarter Aggressive stock buyback activity may explain some of the underlying strength in the stock market in recent weeks As long as the Federal Reserve keeps shortterm interest rates ultralow we can expect more companies to borrow money or issue bonds at low interest rates in order to buy back more shares The Financial Times reported last Monday Stock buybacks a boon to US Q earnings that the proportion of stocks in the SP Index that have reduced their outstanding shares ie bought back more shares by at least in the past year have risen to for companies that have reported firstquarter earnings up from in the fourth quarter of and in the first quarter of Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary Naturally with fewer outstanding shares corporate buybacks help to boost earnings per share EPS Todays low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the upcoming months after the central bank comments last week Specifically on Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC statement was incredibly dovish since it cited a mixed economic environment due to lingering concerns over low inflation and slower growth Interestingly the Fed noted that household spending has slowed even though real income has risen and consumer sentiment remains relatively high The FOMC statement sounded clueless when it said The Fed continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments Translated from Fedspeak the FOMC is frozen confused and full of trepidation so they will probably do nothing which may explain why the Fed left key interest rates unchanged Speaking of apprehension I should add that the Bank of Japan on Thursday also left its key interest rates unchanged at and maintained its quantitative easing at an trillion yen billion per year pace Overall it increasingly appears that central bankers are confused rudderless and powerless Disclaimer Please click here for important disclosures located in
