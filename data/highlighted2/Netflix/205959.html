#A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is looking to move beyond original TV series and into original films but theater chains are loathe to give up screen space to the streaming giant Paramount has started a new strategy that closes the window even more on when a film hits videoondemand after its theatrical run concludes Both companies have drawn the ire of the theater owners as it could negatively impact their financial bottom line and as such are boycotting select release This is a busy weekend for the box office Yet even though three new films are debuting the big story is whats coming to the small screen and the ripple effect thats going to cause within the media industry The film is Beasts of No Nations and the reason why its such a big deal is because it is one of Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX first entries into the world of movies Starring Idris Elba Luther The Wire the movie is a fictional story about the real life child warriors in West Africa Directed by Cary Fukunaga the Emmywinning talent that helmed True Detectives first season the film is causing controversy beyond its plot Instead of the conversation being on the films chilling look at a sad truth the talk is all about its distribution partner <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>When negotiating for the films rights <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had to convince Fukunaga and producers that they were the right fit That wasnt easy given <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a streaming service for your TV and mobile devices Beasts is also seen as a potential Oscar contender so the film had to at the very least get a qualifying run on the big screen Getting theatres to run a movie can be tricky enough as it is but imagine the request coming from a predominately small screen source The end result is that Landmark Theaters owned screens in different US markets will show the film much to the dismay of other chains The fear being that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is encroaching on their territory and the theaters dont want to help in their own demise Its become less about the movies themselves and more about staying alive in tougher economic times We all know theaters are having a rougher go of it as of late as more people are opting to stay in on the weekends To counter that exhibitors are trying to add more amenities to lure audiences From plush seats to IMAX screens every option is in play The problem ironically though is that this only INCREASES the price which is the reason why the decline first began Beasts isnt the first film to challenge the norm and it wont be the last Paramount NASDAQ VIA NASDAQ VIAB is also feeling the impact courtesy of a new initiative that is angering theaters Recently the studio struck a deal with chains AMC Theatres and Cineplex Entertainment to allow consumers to watch select releases at home just days after they exit from theaters the typical window is days In response Carmike Cinemas Marcus Theatres and Harkins Theatres have told Paramount they will not screen any film of theirs that has the reduced window in the agreement Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension will be the first major film to be released under this new deal which includes a financial carveout of videoondemand VOD profits for the theaters participating While AMC and Cineplex make up a large percentage of theaters Carmike and company are still a huge chunk of the market Now instead of the theaters that showed the previous Paranormal film only theaters will screen this one While I get rational Ghost Dimension is the first film in the foundfootage franchise to be shot in D which of course carries an upcharge The nonparticipating theaters are essentially hurting themselves here as most people who will want to see this film will likely opt for the D option which athome viewers cant experience Its a very different scenario than Beasts as while that film is probably better experienced on the big screen the impact isnt as severe The battle lines for this fight have long been drawn and they were actually redrawn a little last year when Sonys NYSE SNE The Interview changed the game rules As you may remember following a threat on any theater showing the film Sony pulled the release but then opted to change course By that point though theaters had reallocated their space so Sony went with a mix of indie theaters and VOD options The move was met with scorn by theater chains who felt slighted and the situation ratcheted up tensions across the board Granted half the problem was the film earned around million off this patchwork experiment which showed films can make money under that model Coincidentally that is about the same amount of money it cost to make the film Some may argue thats not a lot of money but given the type of film The Interview was it is impressive This was a parody and one that was always going to appeal to a limited audience Had this been a film that reached a larger set of demos we would have likely seen a larger gross Yet this was a solid return Back to Beasts though as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>isnt stopping there and already has four films with Adam Sandler in the works plus a new movie centered on Paul Reubens PeeWee Herman franchise The studio is also on the hunt for more and its a safe bet theyll find more willing partners <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a disruptor By definition its meant to upset the norm and thats a good thing The people who oppose it are likely the ones who will be financially impacted as a result I do understand why they are upset and I dont blame them but with so many other options in play to be entertained this battle is not going to end anytime soon We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
