class='textDiv'>Earnings Quality At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Is Subpar <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha The future trajectory of Netflixs stock is about as uncertain as it gets Were growing very concerned about the quality of the companys earnings Even after factoring in tremendous earningspershare expansion into our valuation model the companys shares still arent cheap Traders and speculators love <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX because of its stock price volatility Longs and shorts will argue accordingly Moviewatchers and gamers enjoy the firms wide selection of content and the convenience of delivery But longterm investors looking for an entry point today are very concerned about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as an investment and they have good reason The companys relationship between net income and cash flow is frightening and its credit is rated junk by the agencies Theres a lot to like about Netflixs potential but its share price is way to rich for our taste If theres one thing we feel confident about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>its that its shares are far from cheap Lets have a look There are a variety of stocks on the market that have performed well but that doesnt necessarily mean they are good businesses or those that own them have been savvy investors No reasonable investor would ever pay more than they can receive from a company in terms of free cash flows as in the case of taking the company private This is just a fact of reason If investors dont accept this fact then they arent really investors at all Because the future has yet to be written we use a fair value range in our analysis that reflects a range of probable future free cash flows and resulting fair value estimates in reasonable expected cases instead of a specific point fair value estimate After all only a fool that may be chasing nearterm dynamics for example will pay more for a company than what he or she thinks it is worth yes many investors play the greater fool game and call it investing With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>we chalk up a lot of the companys business performance evolving from mailing archaic DVDs in traditional snail mail and longterm share gains to luck though we point to executive perseverance as a key asset of the company On the basis of a wide fair value range wild swings in its stock price are all but guaranteed because the value ballast that anchors Netflixs shares is itself a large fair value range in light of both upside potential and downside risks Since the range of Netflixs futurefreecashflow derived intrinsic value itself spans or more large movements in the stock price are therefore commoninvestors can feasibly justify a large pricing area for the company Even big moves in the stock price are all within the range of probable fair value outcomes But many speculators that own the company within the fair value range and capture gains from movements within the fair value range think that something material is happening Its not The share price is just bouncing around within the fair value range as it is expected to do On the other hand investors as opposed to traders and speculators look for asset mispricings or situations when the share price of a company falls outside the cashflowderived fair value range which is supported by the fact that any reasonable investor wont pay more than the free cash flows he or she receives from the investment Any unreasonable investor can pay anything for any asset From our perspective buying and selling a company within its fair value range is merely trading and speculating hoping to capture the next bit of sentiment influencing actions by the next greater fool Even investors that held the companys shares a number of years ago accept the view that Netflixs business operations while profitable will be highly volatile Were forecasting significant earnings per share expansion into the teens by the end of this decade but our valuation doesnt come close to its share price For those that love multiples the company is trading at an astronomical earnings multiple Further not everything is perfect at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Rising content costs as well as expenses associated with the firm developing its own content will likely apply new pressures to future free cash flow SP recently downgraded its debt further into junk to B Were also growing concerned about the earnings quality of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The company posted over million in net income during but cash flow from operations was less than million This is a major red flag This is where we derive what multiple a companys earnings should be trading at After forecasting and discounting future free cash flows and adding the firms net cash position on the balance sheet we arrive at its equity value Dividing equity value by shares outstanding gets to equity value per share Dividing this by next years earnings per share gets to the fundamentally correct multiple that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should be trading at Investors cant simply waive their hands and throw a random multiple on a companys earnings stream even if it is based on a peer comparison or relative to history All one has to accept is that a company with billion in cash on the books is worth more than a company with million in cash on the books all else equal These companies should be trading at different multiples A companys future outlook at the present is different than its future outlook or years ago so using multiples of the past is lessthanideal as well The PE is a shortcut and used incorrectly What are investors to do Though the discounted cashflow model also has a few pitfalls they are less severe in nature than the PE application For one the DCF values the exact company at the exact time were valuing it It is the only valuation approach that does this We also know that all of what is known is in the past and all of what has value is in the future the future is not yet written This is why a fair value range is most appropriate in estimating intrinsic worth We want to capture a range of probable fair value outcomes All of this said on the basis of this process we value Netflixs shares in the range of each We think this fair value range adequately captures the companys downside risks and upside potential Uncertainty is not always a negative proposition in valuation uncertainty to the upside must also be considered Still the estimated fair value of per share is well below its mids price tag Our future forecasts do not differ much from consensus over the next few years The enterprise free cash flow model which drives the fair value reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of during the next five years a pace that is lower than the firms year historical compound annual growth rate of Our model reflects a year projected average operating margin of which is above Netflixs trailing year average Beyond year we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of for the next years and in perpetuity For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>we use a weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows If there is one takeaway from this article it should be the importance of applying a fair value range in equity analysis Not even CEO Reed Hastings himself knows exactly what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is worth The future free cash flows drive the intrinsic value equation and the future has yet to be written We put our words into practice Though we estimate Netflixs fair value at about per share every company has a range of probable fair values thats created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers like future revenue or earnings for example If the future were known with certainty we wouldnt see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values No reasonable investor would ever pay more for an investment than he or she could receive in future free cash flows Stocks reflect pieces of a business future free cash flows not pieces of paper Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock In the graph above we show this probable range of fair values for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>We think the firm is attractive below per share the green line but quite expensive above per share the red line The prices that fall along the yellow line which includes our fair value estimate represent a reasonable valuation for the firm in our opinion As an investor its helpful to think in this framework a range of probable fair value outcomes Any research that says that a firm is worth precisely this or precisely that is precisely wrong The future cash flows are what determines intrinsic worth and the future by definition has yet to be written A rangeofoutcomes approach is most valid in thinking about intrinsic worth From our perspective theres just no reasonable argument supporting longterm investors interest in Netflixs shares Earnings quality is deteriorating and even factoring in fantastic earnings expansion shares arent necessarily cheap Content costs are on the rise and the credit agencies rate the firm as junk What more can we say The future trajectory of Netflixs stock is about as uncertain as it gets Source Earnings Quality At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Is Subpar Disclosure The
