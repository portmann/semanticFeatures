</span>announced that it will increase the price of its standard service for new subscribers by Historically this has not impacted subscriber growth directly The company has promised to grow net subscribers by million annually in the coming years which will become a reality if it can cut down on subscriber loss I propose an idea that would cut down on subscriber loss and give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>users a reason to stay subscribed for at least one extra month I recently read an article that admonished investors from by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX due to its nosebleed valuation and a few other metrics I was quick to comment that this is by no means a way to evaluate every company under the sun as some stocks simply do not trade on valuation Netflixs price action in Thursdays trading session serves as the perfect example On news that it would charge new customers more per month for its standard streaming service NFLX spiked from to in the blink of an eye This momentum carried into the close with NFLX eventually ending the day at This was a move in a matter of hours all on claims that the company was going to charge about more per month Roughly a year ago investors balked at Netflixs US subscriber decline blaming it on a price increase However the company stated that US subscriber declines were bound to happen as a result of their growth This is an example of correlation vs causation On the companys most recent conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CEO Reed Hastings was asked about his bold projection of million US subscribers Reed said that he expects million to million net adds every year for a number of years adding that if his projections are correct the company will fulfill their goal of million US subscribers Being a company that primarily trades on subscriber growth it makes sense that investors saw Thursdays news as positive By upping the price for new subscribers only it gives old subscribers a reason to stay An increase of per month for million subscribers adds an additional million to Netflixs annual revenue With the added income <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can put more money toward producing original content which will please old subscribers and attract even more new ones Also people love a bargain and the feeling of getting something for cheaper than your neighbor is one that is appeals to many which gives old subscribers incentive to stay with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>A natural extension of this price increase is an initiative to reward old subscribers One way that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can deliver on its promise of million net new subscribers per year is by cutting down on its subscriber loss One idea that I have as to how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can cut down on subscriber loss is by allowing subscribers of more than one year to unlock exclusive content The euphoria that would surround this content would be enough of a reason for many to stay with the content itself being the kicker In addition this would tack on an extra month to each subscribers plan adding even more revenue per subscriber <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not stock that trades on valuation The companys ability to grow its net subscriber count has proven time and time again to be the reason for its incredible marketbeating performance The price increase for new customers allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to invest more into its original content and gives old customers a reason to lock in their price and stay History shows that price increases does not greatly impact Netflixs ability to grow subscribers and when coupled with initiatives to cut down on subscriber loss such as the one outlined above the company should be able to beat net subscriber growth expectations going forward With a heightened number of subscribers will come a higher stock price We only use your contact
