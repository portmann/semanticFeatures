goes up must come down Those were the words Sir Isaac Newton used to describe the forces of gravity but more often than not those words also can be used to describe highflying momentum stocks When a momentum stock gets hot valuation doesnt matter at all Price becomes completely divorced from value If youre an aggressive trader thats OK Your holding period is likely only weeks or maybe even days But herein lies the key You have to know when to sell Because if you hang on too long all of those outsized gains can disappear in a hurry and you can be left nursing some nasty losses Consider the case of Chinese stocks Between March and June the Deutsche Xtrackers Harvest CSI China AShares ETF NYSEARCA ASHR jumped by nearly By late August it has given all of those gains back and then some Today were going to look at five stocks that have at least until recently been racking up significant gains If you own any of them I recommend you sell them or at the very least tighten your stop losses Ill start with streaming content pioneer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I love <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Ive been a customer for years and I have nothing but respect for CEO and founder Reed Hastings Hastings is a true visionary who was willing to effectively destroy his original business renting DVDs by mail to create something bigger better and far more revolutionary streaming movies and TV shows over the Internet Hasting and his team have fundamentally changed the way we consume content and theyve created fantastic original content of their own I now spend far more hours watching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>than I do watching traditional TV And theyve managed to do all of this while charging their customers a negligible per month But no matter how much I love the company I just cant love NFLX stock at todays prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>trades for times sales and times next years expected earnings Not surprising given that the stock has more than doubled this year Its hard to justify paying a premium like that for a stock with a billion market cap This is no longer a startup company and subscriber growth particularly in the US will start to trail off soon And while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still lightyears ahead of its competition traditional cable TV in terms of convenience and elegance its competitors are not sitting still Hasting recently admitted that TV everywhere apps were a budding competitive threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Chipotle Mexican Grill has been one of the great growth stories of the past two decades Riding the wave of consumer tastes away from greasy burger joints and towards healthier fast casual dining Chipotle has quickly evolved from an unknown burrito shop to an indispensable part of the American diet I love Chipotle I eat there multiple times per week And if I had a location closer to my house I would probably eat there daily I barely remember what my diet was like preChipotle But as much as I love the burritos I cant say I love CMG stock And it has absolutely nothing to do with the E coli crisis currently catching the headlines Given enough time every restaurant will eventually have to deal with a food poisoning scare and from the looks of things Chipotles management is being exceptionally proactive in getting ahead of the crisis No what concerns me is price CMGs performance is just for the year to date thanks in large part to a major correction around earnings and the E coli scare But investors in for a couple of years still are sitting on substantial gains as well as an expensive stock thats trading for times earnings and times forward estimates While that might not look exceptionally expensive compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>its quite pricey for a restaurant And CMG simply isnt growing fast enough at this stage of the game to justify it Last quarter revenues grew at a clip Along the same lines we have former highflier Buffalo Wild Wings I say former because this former momentum darling has clearly lost its momentum As recently as September it was trading at over per share Today it barely fetches But heres the thing I expect more downside to come This was a classic fad stock that rode the wave of popularity of chicken wings Hey I get it Who doesnt like eating a plate of chicken wings with a beer while watching a football game The problem is that this is now a saturated market There is a beerandwing joint at every intersection and there is nothing special or unique about Buffalo Wild Wings offerings that would distinguish it from competitors such as Wingstop NASDAQ WING Meanwhile BWLD is a very expensive stock Even after the decline Buffalo Wild Wings still fetches a PE ratio of Ditch this former highflier before its wings get clipped Instinctively I hate betting against a guy like Elon Musk Hes one of the smartest capitalists walking the earth today and I have a lot of respect for what hes accomplished with Tesla Motors Just a few years ago electric cars were geeky They didnt have cachet and they certainly couldnt compete with a Corvette in terms of performance But no matter how impressed I may be with Teslas cars I cant quite get on board with the stock price Tesla currently trades at a forward PE ratio of and at times annual sales To put that in perspective BMW OTCPKBAMXY trades for times sales Thats ludicrous Yes Tesla is growing at a faster clip and Tesla is more than just a car company Its also a maker of highend batteries with a variety of uses But anyone in their right mind can credibly say that times sales is a reasonable valuation when highend rivals trade at a fraction of that If you like cool cars buy a Tesla If you want a cool stock that you can talk about over the water cooler at work then I suppose TSLA is good for that too But if you want a stock that is likely to generate solid returns over the next few years you should probably look elsewhere Starting at todays prices its not going to happen with Tesla Next up is Netflixs streaming competitor and allaround retail champion Amazoncom Last quarter Amazon did something that took a lot of investors myself included completely by surprise It actually turned a profit While Amazons revenue growth over the past years has been incredible its never really turned a profit Founder Jeff Bezos has been more than happy to sacrifice profit margins in the interest of expanding his empire and hes done a fantastic job Amazon has evolved from being the Walmart of the web to being a leader in digital video and music distribution and cloud computing Along with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Amazon is putting the screws to legacy rivals like IBM NYSE IBM with its Amazon Web Services The thinking has always been that the profits would start flowing once Amazon reached a critical size and wasnt forced to plow as much cash back into its businesses And that day might finally have come Theres just one problem Investors have already wildly bid up the stock price in anticipation Amazon trades at a forward PE of And while this metric might be a little skewed by Amazons thin profit margins Amazon also trades for times sales To put that in perspective WalMart NYSE WMT trades for times sales I know I know Amazon is more than just a retailer like WalMart Its a revolutionary tech leader I get that But investors are still paying an exorbitant price for Amazon shares Dont get sucked in here This article first appeared on Sizemore Insights as Take the Money and Run Stocks to Ditch Disclaimer This
