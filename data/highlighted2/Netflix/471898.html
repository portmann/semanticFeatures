Alpha As I predicted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>hit its cost and profit targets but missed on subscribers This set off a stock plunge which created a buying opportunity Just before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX released its second quarter earnings I wrote that I thought there might be a buying opportunity created by the resulting market movements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has always seen sharp movements when it falls short on subscribers and I thought there was a good chance that one might happen this month There was indeed and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock did drop by immediately following the news But is this a buying opportunity or a real market correction that will not be reversed I wanted to look one more time at the actual numbers now that we have them and see what they say about Netflixs prospects <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock cratered because as I expected subscriber count came in well below expectations Three months ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was projecting a net addition in the US of Meanwhile experts had pegged the increased churn from the ungrandfathering of longtime subscribers at in aggregate not all of which should have been in the current quarter since the hikes are being staggered over the remainder of the year At instead that means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>saw more cancellations in one quarter from the price hikes than was predicted for the whole year Projecting that number out over the rest of the year would put cancellations from the hike at well north of million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>itself seems to have admitted this if only implicitly It cut its expectations for the current quarter from to As I said though I think investors should look at the numbers a little deeper Assuming that the missing subscribers would all have been paying at the rate for the standard plan which seems logical since grandfathered subscribers have no reason to cancel before their benefit actually expires then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should have been missing million per month Since the hikes didnt take effect until May th and some were staggered in even later than that lets call the expected shortfall somewhere around million But now look at actual revenue While subscribers came in short revenue came in only million short of expectations That is somewhere between onehalf and onethird of the shortfall that should have been expected Whats more that shortfall isnt even attributable to the streaming segment of the company Netflixs total streaming revenue came in million higher than it projected at its last earnings call A million shortfall in the US segment was balanced out by a million beat in the international segment despite the fact that the international segment actually fell further short of subscriber projections that the US segment did Of course the international business can be affected by forex movements which can distort the US dollar picture But even if we focus solely on the US segment a subscriber miss came to only million in missing revenue That is less than missing per missing subscriber Less than one months fees even at the old rate and these results are for the whole quarter As I explained last week I think there is a simple explanation for this Some of those cancellations actually represent consolidation of accounts into the higher Premium plan which offers twice as many simultaneous streams as the Standard plan When two accounts consolidated their Standard plans into one Premium plan monthly revenue that was projected to increase from to fell to instead But that is still better for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>than a straight up cancellation which would reduce monthly revenue by each Ultimately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>like any other company profits from having more revenues than costs Subscribers are certainly a useful metric to track and I dont mean to belittle those who track them But a selloff on a stock that hits of its revenue target and actually beats its cost and profit margin targets seems to me wholly unjustified <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has already recouped about half of its losses and anyone who bought the dip as I recommended is already up not bad for one week But I suspect there is still some upside left It wouldnt surprise me to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>return to its former position over the next few weeks at I still see the stock as a shortterm buy despite its longerterm challenges I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business
