digital millennium copyright act drm Schrdingers law Once upon a time in the longlong ago bygone years of the th century teenagers communicated their feelings through a medium known as the mix tape Those of us who can remember tape cassettes can remember hitting record on a boom box at exactly the right moment when a favorite song started on the radio or as the s waned into the shadow of YK recording tracks off a bunch of CDs into one themed tape to play in the car or slip into the hand of a notsosecret crush But the teenagers of today only barely born when we of yesteryear were partying like it was indeed dont have bulky stereos taking up space and neither does anyone else Were all using smartphones and streaming media of every type There are services like PlayOn that allow consumers to make their own recordings of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>movies and other streaming content These services dont technically break the law because they arent doing anything that circumvents the digital rights management on the video and audio being recorded But you are definitelyviolating your agreement with the streaming service by making these recordings Likewise while many of us once had shelves and boxes containing stacks of VHS tapes full of shows and movies recorded from live TV we now have DVRs and ondemand cloud archives less clutter but without the charm of handwritten labels So now instead of handing over a mixtape to impress a friend we share a Spotify playlist And instead of recording a favorite movie or a Christmas special onto a blank VHS tape when it airs and replaying it whenever the mood strikes we just open a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>app and stream whatever suits our mood Increasingly though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Spotify and their kin do share one key feature with broadcast TV and radio of old impermanence Sure you can stream something to your hearts content right now instead of having to wait for pm Eastern Central to watch it but what was there this month may not be available next month as contracts shift around as content providers decide what they want to license or hold for themselves And so even in an entirely new era of media distribution the same question applies can I record this and save it for later so that regardless of me being online or something being available to stream I can play it back whenever I want Recording anything from the big streaming services is as you could probably guess strictly against the rules The bestknown video and music streaming businesses dont want you recording their stuff they want you paying a subscription fee to them every month for continued access to their stuff That makes sense continued monthly payments are their entire business model If you save the content and unsubscribe they go broke So its unsurprising that pretty universally the terms of use or terms of service for the streaming content companies say saving their stuff is a big nono A sample of TOS agreements shows how universally banned copying is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Section E specifies You agree not to archive download other than through caching necessary for personal use reproduce distribute modify display perform publish license create derivative works from offer for

the Content unless expressly permitted by Hulu in writing Spotify Section says The following is not permitted for any reason whatsoever copying redistributing reproducing ripping recording transferring performing or displaying to the public broadcasting or making available to the public any part of the Spotify Service or the Content Saving a copy would be well copying which is explicitly banned Pandora Section includes prohibitions on recording as well as passwordsharing and several other actions you shall not modify download intercept or create any derivative works of the Services including any translations or localizations thereof copy store edit change exploit download prepare any derivative work of or alter in any way any of the content made available through the Services There are dozens of streaming media businesses but they generally all have some clause in them that says the same thing these ones do recording our content in any way is a big nono and will get you booted off our service Period Breaking or circumventing any kind of copyprotection mechanism on media is illegal Thats what the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA is all about Aside from a few very specific enumerated set of exemptions you may not create copies of anything if doing so would require an endrun around locks it has built in In the Supreme Court famously decided Sony Corp of America v Universal City Studios or as most of us know it the Betamax case The key finding from that SCOTUS ruling is that recording and timeshifted viewing of copyrighted broadcasts for your own personal noncommercial use is not copyright infringement but instead qualifies as fair use The Court also ruled that the maker of a VCR could not be held liable for any infringing behavior an end user committed which is what allowed VCR manufacturers to proliferate even though video pirates used them to create bootleg recordings The Betamax format went bust of course but the courts ruling lived on in the millions of VHS VCRs that were legally sold with the promise of making it easy for consumers to record a show that was airing at an inconvenient time and play it back whenever they darn well pleased The VCRs run faded out as DVD came in but the promise of timeshifting stayed DVRs hit the scene when TiVo launched in by years later DVRed timeshifted programming had become the dominant way Americans watch TV Ratings giant Nielsen has long since had to take the and three days and seven days after broadcast respectively ratings into account for its customers because tens of millions of us are consuming programming at the times of our choosing instead of when a network decides for it to air So we find ourselves in an awkward new position legally you can save anything you want for the purposes of timeshifted consumption if its broadcast linearly But ondemand programming is already timeshifted to you so can you still record it For example a company called PlayOn explicitly lets consumers do exactly this record streaming media from their own accounts to their own PCs for later consumption on nearly any device Its a handy tool if for example youre going to be spending a lot of time without good internet access and want to bring a TV series with you or if youve got a favorite movie on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>thats falling off the service at the end of the month and you want to record it now to archive it for watching later PlayOn has been offering this feature to its subscribers since and has thus far not faced any legal challenges from video providers during that time CEO Jeff Lawrence told Consumerist When we asked if the company had been sued he laughed and asked innocently For what PlayOn Lawrence explained explicitly does not circumvent any DRM nor does it access the encrypted stream in any way to download material Instead it functions essentially as a browserbased screencapture program The consumer has to queue up and play something in order for PlayOn to record it which PlayOn then does in realtime invisibly in a background process Because PlayOn is technically functioning as screen capture software and is not circumventing DRM it stays on the legal side of the line That applies even if users then illegally share and distribute those copies they made just like the manufacturers of VCRs were not responsible for bootleg tapes being sold on street corners Currently then we are left in a box much like the famous quantum cat As the situation currently exists it is both expressly forbidden and yet also permissible to record streaming media for your own personal use as long as you dont break DRM to do it For now it seems like this unsettled grey area is where we are going to remain Copyright law does get periodically rewritten by Congress but otherwise mostly changes through case law like the court challenges that faced Betamax or Aereo Chicago Residents Now Stuck With A New Cloud Tax On <span
