style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is having an incredibly strong time in the market today and for good reason The company announced today that a migration process that has been in play since has finally met completion Today well talk about the migration process that has been completed how the market reacted to the news and what we can expect to see from NFLX moving forward So lets get right to it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>first started a big migration in August of In this month the company experienced a major database corruption As a result of this corruption the company wasnt able to ship DVDs to its members for days This hurt the company making NFLX realize that it was a good idea to move away from virtually scaled single points of failure In simple terms the company needed to move away from the relational databases in their data centers and toward more reliable and scalable systems At that point the decision was made to move to the cloud Now eight years later the company has completed this migration By the majority of infrastructure had been moved to the cloud but there was still a bit more work to do Now the company has announced that after years of efforts NFLX is now run entirely from the cloud and has shut down its data centers On a blog post NFLX had the following statement to offer Find out how you can trade stocks like the pros without major time commitments Moving to the cloud has brought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a number of benefits We have eight times as many streaming members than we did in and they are much more engaged with overall viewing growing by three orders of magnitude in eight years As investors weve learned that any time we see positive news with regard to a publicly traded company we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock that represents the company In the case of NFLX the news reported today was overwhelmingly positive Ultimately moving to the cloud gives the service a higher level of security and reliability As a result of the positive news were seeing incredibly strong movement in the value of the stock today Currently NFLX is trading at after gaining per share or so far today What We Can Expect To See From NFLX Moving Forward Moving forward I have an overwhelmingly positive opinion of what we can expect to see from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>As of late the stock has fallen on hard times as a result of slowing user growth in the United States However this is not a very concerning factor for me The reality is that NFLX recently announced that it had expanded to become a worldwide company after moving into more than countries around the world They also announced that they are working on moving their services to the worlds second largest economy China With this move NFLX has really broadened its horizons with regard to user growth and I believe that global user growth is going to be the driving force behind growth in the stock moving forward Now that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has completed the migration to the cloud the service is now more secure and more reliable than ever before Considering the current state of sentiment among consumers with regard to online security this is also likely to help pick up user data All in all Im incredibly impressed with NFLX and looking for gains Where do you think NFLX is headed moving forward Let us know you think in the comments below Buy NFLX Stock from Modest Money Recommended Brokers Get in free
