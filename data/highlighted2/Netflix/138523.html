class='textDiv'>Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Overvalued <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha The prevailing rhetoric for not buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is driven by fears over its valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not overvalued if anything its reasonably valued when based on current fundamentals I think that if the valuation were to stay constant the stock would in fact trade at a higher price assuming the PEG were to remain constant This implies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a poor candidate for a short because investors would not only lose their shirts but also their jeans and shoes Heres what he stated in his most recent article First todays market is trading at multiples much higher than it has in at least years Were fundamentals to remain constant but multiples contract to historical averages the market would undergo a substantial downdraft All investors should be cautious as a result Second given that multiple expansions havent impacted all sectors equally my plan going forward is to focus my valuation shorts in the sectors whose multiples are highest today biotech software services and consumer services Everyone wants to predict the next market crash the problem I havent seen anyone do this consistently Sure we could argue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a short if the market tanks but so is everything else I dont think the broader market has topped out Its going to be a while before valuations become over extended The cyclically adjusted PE multiple for the broader SP is at the midpoint of the cycle In the past market valuation expansionary cycle we saw valuation tick higher for nearly years straight The market hit bottom about years ago So any early speculation on a massive market correction that involves a massive regression in valuation could be premature Remember markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>trades at a more generous valuation because theres a pathway to sustained revenue growth over a multiyear period Theres no other realistic alternative to capturing the Internet TV space aside from Amazon NASDAQ AMZN However Amazon is not a pure play on Internet TV and to Amazon public cloud is a much bigger priority than Instant Video viewing hours Therefore investors who want exposure into web TV dont have a long list of candidate to choose from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>secured huge wins in the early innings of the Internet TV space The company signed a deal with Disney NYSE DIS and launched various inhouse productions This keeps the process of content bidding a bit more honest as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can always revert to more inhouse content to avoid price gouging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>expanded internationally so it will also have a global base of subscribers to market content to which creates trouble for regionally locked content studios The ability to source higher quality content becomes easier when you operate on a growth rate for revenues MVPDs multichannel video programming distributors arent growing at the same rate as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>so eventually the competing economics of content deals for online streaming becomes better whereas deals with MVPDs become less desirable When assuming a top line growth rate Netflixs revenue will reach billion by The growth will have to accelerate by points but I think thats feasible given the adoption rate of K TVs and the robust growth in international subscribers yearoveryear growth in Q The movement of domestic subscribers to higher pricing tiers will eventually materialize by I also think international subscriber growth will be driven by China as a wave of deregulation will make it easier for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to launch its streaming service in the mainland My longrun net income forecast is billion on a profit margin assumption The company may produce higher margins but given the rapid investment into content and inhouse productions Ive tempered my expectations on margins If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>were to trade at perhaps times earnings the stock would be worth billion Even at times earnings the stock would be worth billion The valuation will contract from times earnings but anticipating a more rapid reduction in valuation would be ridiculous For those reasons I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Sure the company isnt cheap but I wouldnt say the stock is overvalued either The stock will simply justify the valuation by sustaining a high pace of growth Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I
