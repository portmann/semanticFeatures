to begin focusing on earnings over revenue Kindle sales are slowing and pushes into India and China have paid limited dividends thus far Amazons stock remains wildly overvalued fundamentally which allows little room for error if these issues begin hitting the top line I dont think theres any doubt that most people would consider Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN a great company What started as an online bookstore has morphed into a global retail behemoth Amazon has become a cornerstone of any individuals online shopping experience and has expanded its technological reach by testing things like drone delivery gaming and original TV content Plus Amazon has usually been at the forefront of many of these consumer trends But a great company doesnt necessarily make a great stock The chief complaint for many existing and potential Amazon shareholders is that by almost every metric the stock is wildly overvalued The justification for this valuation has always been that the company could be profitable at almost any time but is choosing instead to plow its income back into the business to grow domestically and globally And its worked Amazon now has almost a quarter billion customers and is not only the biggest online retailer out there but is now competing with the likes of Apple NASDAQ AAPL Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX in the technology and entertainment spaces Theres almost no arena that Amazon isnt having at least some influence Amazon went public in and has been in growth mode ever since Many companies are given a grace period by accepting investors of a few years of posting losses as firms plow money back into the business in the name of growth Amazon is in the middle of year of its continuous growth cycle with no real signs of slowing down While Amazon has a dominant position in ecommerce its ventures outside of that core business have been hit and miss Kindle sales are slowing down and the Kindle Fire has been a dud In fact Amazon is plowing more money into the business now than ever before The company is already sinking hundreds of millions of dollars into original programming content and has committed to spending another B to expand its presence in India Amazon is also trying to take on Alibaba NYSE BABA in China but so far has had limited success For the first time Amazon may have trouble generating the return on investment that it has become accustomed to Amazon has always traded on revenue instead of earnings Amazon is forecast to continue growing revenues in and another in so if that trend continues it should be good news for shareholders but things might not come as easy as they once did Cloud services revenue should be a big contributor to that revenue growth but costs are starting to come down and that could end up hitting the top line Combine that with some of the issues mentioned above and future growth is no longer a slam dunk Its unclear how some of these initiatives will pay off and to what degree Reuters estimates say that Amazon is expected to make per share in but I just cant see that happening Jeff Bezos seems committed to continuing his growth agenda but almost two decades into this growth cycle it might be time to start delivering some bottom line results By virtually any measure Amazon is wildly overvalued Only Alibaba really compares from a forecast revenue growth standpoint but Alibaba also delivers impressive margins Amazons valuation leaves very little room for error if the company starts demonstrating slowing growth And given some of the uncertainty surrounding Amazons future growth prospects it might not be a bad idea for the company to start delivering some bottom line results Investors have long given Amazon a pass on delivering earnings as long as revenues continue to grow but if that starts to change the stock price could start heading south For a stock that has traded on revenue numbers the prospect of owning shares of an overvalued company whose revenue growth is starting to slow should be concerning Jeff Bezos continues trying to expand his business into just about every area that affects the retail consumer but even his brilliance has its limits Despite a mixed bag of recent results Amazon is continuing to spend billions of dollars into growing the business and it could end up being a significant misstep if the company cant deliver an adequate return on that investment It may be time to start ratcheting back on the growth phase and finally settle into a new role as a maturing
