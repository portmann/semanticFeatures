Rate Hike Can Badly Hurt HighFlying Growth Stocks In Tech Biotech Seeking Alpha Growth companies are currently valued very richly not only because they are growth stocks but also because shortterm interest rates are almost zero Waiting for growth companies to reach their potential is inexpensive when it doesnt incur interest payments but that can change at any time There is a real chance that investors will panic about growth stocks when or before shortterm rates will be raised Very few investors would believe that a rate hike can hurt stocks like Amazon AMZN Facebook FB Tesla TSLA <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NFLX and LinkedIn LNKD or even Alphabet GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL what used to be Google These are some extraordinary companies And there are many other companies especially in the biotech sector which can have extraordinary growth in the coming years Very few people doubt that these names are great and will offer exceptional growth in the coming years Im no exception I believe that the mentioned companies and many other smaller ones will offer great revenue and income growth over the coming years But if you look at their valuations Facebook seems to be a bargain with a respectable trailing PE of Amazon Tesla <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and LinkedIn dont really make any meaningful profits and their valuations are based on their potential alone And there are many such companies smaller and less known ones which are solely valued according to their potential especially in the biotech sector Stocks can be quite vulnerable to shortterm interest rates because there are very easy ways for pretty much everyone to own stock on leverage nowadays without paying much in interest Other assets are a lot more complicated to own just based on shortterm interest rates as they are quite illiquid and intermediaries especially banks since the financial crisis are not willing to lend at low rates Therefore its not common to see such optimistic valuations anywhere nowadays other than in the socalled growth stocks I am saying socalled not because I do not believe they are growth stocks especially the ones I named but because the whole idea behind growth is subjective and based on popular perception I dont remember many people calling Amazon a growth stock years ago But it was a growth stock even back then however not popular at all Just take a look at two charts below the first one of Amazon and the second one from the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index NBI Both Amazon and the biotechnology sector were considered to have growth potential years ago but their shares were very unpopular What has happened in the meantime that has made such stocks so popular Money has become very cheap and the time value of shortterm money has become almost zero especially if you have access to large sums and you can practically leverage up at almost no cost This phenomenon was true since but it truly started to affect the growth sector in Why Between and there had been too many nasty surprises especially with the real estate market and then with the European crisis Probably investors and particularly hedge funds started to think that zero interest rates were a safe bet as long as you went for growth stocks They apparently offered no nasty surprises And they havent offered nasty surprises ever since the crash in year actually With hindsight it seems very easy to understand that if you can borrow at practically no cost there is no problem to wait So why not bet for companies which offer certain growth for at least to years in the future This way with some good hedging in place for shortterm fluctuations a hedge fund could do quite well in the longer term Now the market has become complacent evaluating growth companies as if shortterm interest rates are a sure thing forever If this changes it will catch many by surprise Even the belief that the Fed is certain to raise rates might panic those who are in the socalled growth stocks But this is to be seen What is for sure is that very expensive and fashionable growth stocks are not exactly the safe bet they are believed to be The companies behind the stocks will likely continue to do well but there is good chance that their current outoftouch valuations will be a thing of the past at least for a while Amazon and Facebook for example are truly great companies They have exceptional management and they have pretty much built monopolies But they are currently making very little profits to justify their huge valuations Does anybody know how much they will make in or years I personally think that Facebook is likely to make billion perhaps in years for fiscal year But its valued at almost billion now When will it make billion in a year to justify its current capitalization In It is quite possible though not certain at all But that is years from now It is OK to wait if you dont pay any interest on your money but if there will be interest to pay things will change And as any experienced investor knows when things change course in the stock market it usually happens suddenly and dramatically The situation is even more serious in the case for Amazon Amazon is a great company but one of the reasons it has such extraordinary growth right now is because it doesnt care about profits Investors dont really want to own shares in a company where the management doesnt care about profits So they will ask for profits in case the stock will go down and it wont be so popular any more Will Amazon stock be so popular by continuing to offer great service to its customers but almost nothing to its shareholders Of course this is considered to be a temporary thing but it is anybodys guess how much money Amazon will be able to make when it will consider that it has grown enough to start making some real money Its also anybodys guess whether those online merchants whom Amazon will not have killed off by then will not take away its apparently loyal customers Will Amazon userscustomersmembers will still stick around in case other online shops will offer better deals Its simply anybodys guess But in todays zero shortterm interest rates many investors seem not to mind waiting And this zero shortterm rate environment can change soon And all this waiting has resulted in some too optimistic evaluations for companies which have been able to offer growth for some years now as if the future is a certainty which it never is We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do
