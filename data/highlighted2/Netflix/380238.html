Wajdas article warranted a response it seems to be my job on SA to be a voice of some moderation The key thing Greg missed in his valuation was content costs NFLX cant get to billion users without investing many billions in content I present a very simple model that gives a rough value for NFLX of per share on a free cash flow basis In a recent article Greg Wajda argued that now is the time for all millennials to jump aboard the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Ship and set sail for millionaires island The crux of the argument was that billion users paying a month was trillion in revenue and at about net margins thats billion in net income At a x multiple thatd value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>at billion or so leaving it to rival Apple NASDAQ AAPL in size While using net income to value companies seems attractive it doesnt give you the full picture In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>growth doesnt come free <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has to either purchase or develop content on its own and unfortunately that doesnt show up on the income statement It shows up on the cash flow statement As can be seen here in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spent billion or about of revenues acquiring content versus amortization of billion The simple point here is that for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to get to billion users across the globe its going to have to amass the largest content library on earth I think the company can do it but developing or licensing content that appeals to viewers in each country in multiple languages and across age groups is a very expensive undertaking that has to be funded in some manner Lets assume that the amortization line item represents the costs to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>of maintaining its library of content I dont think its a perfect representation even if youve amortized the value of a show like House of Cards over or years down to there are still going to be viewers watching that content Regardless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is going to have to keep generating new content in order to replace old and unpopular content and amortization is a reasonable proxy for that Right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>records about billion of amortization across its million streaming subscribers or per year about per month If we assume this continues forward at billion users that results in billion in amortization of content Now to grow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is going to have to add content Right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spends per subscriber per month in new content of which per subscriber is simply replacing amortized assets This then equates to per month per user of net content additions Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is in the position to gain significant scale from its library Shows can be easily translated and there is significant cross border appeal for numerous titles so we cant just use that per year of net content additions per subscriber Just for fun I ran a quick DCF using Greg Wajdas assumptions assuming straight line growth in users slight EBIT margin creep from to its current tax rate of per user of content amortization and of the current per user in content acquisitiondevelopment costs The valuation outputs can be seen below So that implies a tripling of the share price from todays Sounds great right Well there are a few things I dont buy First the growth rates in subscribers at the front end of the model are far too high Users almost double in year one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>grew subscribers at last year so lets change the assumptions to create a Scurve shaped growth trajectory more in line with how companies actually grow Interestingly enough this actually increases the value per share slightly to Now in the original model we assumed that pricing would go from per month to However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has not historically demonstrated significant pricing power Growth in pricing from has only been and is down YY So lets be generous and say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can grow prices per year That gives us an ending pricing of per user per month and knocks the value down to But the problem with that assumption is that it doesnt really take into account that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>earns about per user LESS from international markets where most of its user base will be So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may have pricing power but thats offset by lower base prices overseas If we adjust the pricing growth down to an ending value of that value drops to Now lets revisit the content acquisition assumptions I dont believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will immediately gain scale from its content The company is going to have to invest upfront in order to grow the business Lets assume that content costs are instead the full per user If we assume this throughout the life of the model Netflixs value is drum roll please per share assuming the pricing discussed above and the user growth discussed above Also note that in the terminal year of the model its assumed that content costs equal amortization which is simply for technical reasons for calculating terminal value Now I dont think that content costs will be per user for all of Netflixs life So lets adjust that and say that on a per user basis that cost declines by some amount per user going forward The sensitivity analysis can be seen below Notice the variability that a straight line decline in acquisition costs has on Netflixs value Indeed I would say content costs will be the single largest driver of Netflixs value if it can develop a topquality globally popular library for a reasonable cost the scale that the company can operate at will mean impressive value generation for shareholders But have content costs declined Not really was a big investment year but average new content costs per user have averaged over the past years with a low of and a high of per user Fundamentally content is expensive and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt have the ability that HBO has for example to monetize its content so the returns to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>from content arent spectacular at present If we assume that content costs run at the average rate over the past years at per user and decline at user per year you arrive at a value for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>of per share I think somewhere around here is reasonable Why do I think that valuation is reasonable Its already clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the dominant service for cord cutters and the larger a library <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can build the more true that becomes As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gains users it will also gain scale in its operations and more pricing power in content negotiations I think its fair to say that both of these should reduce content costs per user over time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be very successful I dont contest that What I do contest is investors using income statement items to value the company precisely because they fail to take into account the massive cash costs of developing the immense content library that is required to make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a global nearmonopolist in online streaming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may well grow to billion users but the company has limited pricing power overseas and on a free cash flow basis the costs of content weigh significantly on the companys valuation As such investors should not necessarily wade in at present Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this
