class='textDiv'>Why It Makes No Sense For Apple To Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha The rumors surrounding Apple NASDAQ AAPL buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX just dont go away They have been circulating again this past week In fact they have been circulating for years Back in March this article found on thestreetcom suggested the merits of the merger Back when the article was written the main thesis was that a premium from the than current billion would get the deal done Two years later the market cap of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is billion So what makes the deal more appealing now With a price tag of twice as much In this article I am going to go on record as saying that there is no benefit at all to Apple buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is facing their own struggles with competition such as Hulu The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>business is platform agnostic If the deal was not appealing to Apple at billion it will hardly be appealing with a billion market cap and that is before a premium is offered to make the deal attractive to NFLX shareholders Now dont get me wrong I think that Apple should and will make a mega merger Earlier this month I wrote an article suggesting the benefits of Apple buying a few companies that have seen tough times and have seen their stocks get beaten down When I wrote the article I thought that I would receive tons of negative comments but interestingly I was wrong I think that people are finally realizing the logic of Apple growing via acquisition and at the same time using some of their cash hoard But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not the right choice Or fit There is no comparison Per the SEC Annual Reports filed by both companies Apples balance sheet saw more than billion increase in cash and cash equivalents added in their last fiscal year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on the other hand witnessed a negative million free cash flow exodus in their latest fiscal year Net Income as a Percentage of Revenues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>operates on relatively thin margins In their latest fiscal year their net income was just over of revenues and diminishing Apple on the other hand had net income of over of revenues For the past five years the average net income as a percentage of revenues for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was Compare that to Apples five year average It is clear that there is no financial motivation for Apple to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>So we than need to move on to the business advantages of a possible acquisition There is no doubt about it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is becoming a victim of their own success Hulu has mounted an all out attack and is now going head to head with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and gaining traction In this article Cade Metzdis does a nice job penning some reasons why Hulu is finally mounting a viable challenge to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>It is noteworthy that Hulu is owned by Comcasts NBC Universal st Century Foxs Fox Broadcasting and Walt Disneys ABC The content and financial muscle that backs Hulu should give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>supporters serious reason to question their long term growth prospects Do not misunderstand me I am not suggesting the downfall of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I am however suggesting that in the coming years the ability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to dominate will be tested like it has never been tested before That is not the backdrop for Apple or any other company to spend billion or more to acquire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the current billion market cap of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>plus a buyout premium to entice <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shareholders to approve a deal International regulatory restrictions and irregularities are also a challenge to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as is the fact that in some countries such as Spain NFLX is late to the party and other services are already well entrenched Both of these obstacles are described in this article co penned by Mark Scott and Elian Peltier In addition many of the developed countries of the world that are prime markets already have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>services With domestic net addition growth stuck in the low single digits the focus will continue to be on international growth While the international division is seeing healthy growth for now it is still hemorrhaging cash The international streaming segment witnessed a million contribution loss to earnings One must also remember that the old but faithful DVD business is fading away on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>As highlighted on page of their annual report Domestic DVD revenues were down for vs That matches a similar drop for the vs period Profits likewise continue to experience the same pressures vs profits were down after dropping in the vs period These issues have not been ignored by the analysts The last few months have seen a slight deterioration in the Recommendation Trends by the analysts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock is currently selling at a staggering forward Price Earnings ratio of Not only has any future growth been priced into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares so too has a buyout premium Fellow SA author Frank Isaksen wrote an article this past week detailing his justification for stating that the current price of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>already has a buyout premium built into it It is definitely worth reading Apple is lucky They do not NEED to buy anyone at the moment Their main business is still a cash cow They have a terrific RD department and a top class management team To buy a company for the sake of buying to increase revenues makes no sense and to me that is all that would be gained by acquiring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is too big to buy Alsoat the current market cap they do not generate enough income to justify being bought out Apples billion cash and cash equivalents hoard will not and should not be spent on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>But the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bulls
