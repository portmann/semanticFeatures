you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Apples shares broke below in premarket trading as analyst downgrades and further component producer outlook reductions weighed heavily on the no brainer It appears increasingly likely that Tim Cooks rescue email to Cramer on August was perhaps not the entire truth and the market is trading back to levels it first crossed in August ie unchanged in months Of course amid this carnage this morning AAPL attempted to save the day and issued a quick statement proclaiming January st as the biggest App Store spending day in history for now the stock is not excited about that Following our reports of FoxConns hiring freeze in November which was ignored by all the talking heads and confirming Nikkeis recent report of a production cut in iPhones this mornings headlines are not helping However things just do not add up the way that Tim Cook said they were Here is what Tim Cook told Jim Cramer via email at the peak of the panic in August I get updates on our performance in China every day including this morning and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last weeks As we asked at the peak of the panic in August So did Tim Cook lie If one uses channel check data to objectively determine end demand the answer is a resounding yes To be sure Cook may be telling the truth in a very narrow sense if Apple is simply be resorting to the oldest trick in the book at this point channel stuffing The problem with channel stuffing is that it only allows you to mask the problem for quarters at which unless there has been a dramatic improvement in the enddemand picture it reemerges that much more acutely just ask AOL which was channel stuffing for months on end only to be ultimately exposed leading to a epic plunge in the stock price So is AAPL the next AOL and is Tim Cook the next Thorsten Heins It all depends on China if the worlds most populous nation can get its stock market its economy and its currency under control then this too shall pass The problem is that if as many increasingly suggest China has lost control of all three At that point anyone who thought they got a great deal when buying AAPL at will have far better opportunities to dollarcost average far far lower It appears given the constant flow of evidence that AAPLs Tim Cook may have some explaining to do as his channelstuffing lioes come back to haunt him Wed Looney Wed Buckaroo Banzai Ive seen this movie before and I know how it ends This time the only difference is Steve left the company in much better shape instead of leaving a flagship product line with market share of a product market he left one with a leading market share in a highly fragmented market and a dominant profit share So Apples postJobs decline this time around will be more gradual but directionally exactly the same I really dont understand why Jobs left the fudgepacker in charge though The fudgepacker lifestyle is a big distraction demanding a lot of time and energy from an executive who already has his hands more than full Jobs was smart enough to understand this But fudgepackers are generally quite good at playing office politics and my guess is Cook took advantage of Jobs declining health to insinuate himself into his current position Wed Takeaction Wed Bro of the Sorr were getting to the point where even companies have their own version of the PPT chipotle does big buyback after getting crushed apple spews rainbow unicorn bullshit to trick the retarded sheep back into their dazed graze who knows how much longer the plates can be kept spinning in the air Wed Bruce Gender Wed jnx SeriouslyApple makes good products butas incomes are shifted toward more necessary stuff Applesproduct cost will seem quite high to many carriersare moving away fromthe discount phone thing Wed MountainsRoam Timmy has a penchant for a babys arm holding an Apple Wed cordial savage Wed silverer Wed cordial savage Sohow are the Watch and iPad Pro doing How about that enterprise partnership with IBM I was pissed I didnt sell at the top but glad I got out Just ride the waves Wed bamawatson Wed silverer Im sure glad I hung onto my still in the box LuanLi computer case and Cougar SX power supply Now I can build that Linux box Ive been thinking about when Apple gets desperate and starts piling on more mistakes Thanks to Steve Jobs for a wonderful years of great visionary products but I dont think there is anyone to step in now to save Apple Steve himself was probably shaking his head thinking about it not long before his departure RIP Steve Wed edifice You are forced to buy new cablesdocksdongles when a new product is released Obsessed with smallthin products The smallerthinner it is the less functionality it has Soon you will pay and Apple will ship you a box containing a sheet of paper that will read Wed XXL Maybe they can make an iCar to burn some cash If they sell the equivalent of year VW production with the amount that Tesla loses for every car the billion is all gone in a single year This is not taken inflation into account Just kidding Dont sell your stock Apple could be the next Blackberry Wed Boris Badenov Wed Bubenthauser Tyler your hate for the only decent behemoth company in the world today is pointless You obviously dont understand cycles on WallSt and the business of Apple Inc But hey youre not alone Pathetic Wed Golden Phoenix Yeah I guess people who dont hold a declining stock are too stupid to understand People who hold securities which are rising are such idiots Wed Bubenthauser No its the contrary Buy low sell high Up to the traders execution All the rest is FUCKING NARRATIVES just like the majority of the BS spewed by Tylers of late But hey that what journalists do They SELL words and narratives Usually witha fucking BIAS Wed Shibumi Its a tough business and Samsung is a tough competitorbut that doesnt mean Apple sucks They Jobs created the whole industry and will always have a slice They opted for a closed architecture compared to Samsungs open model It boils down to platform stability vs open sourcewildly different business models Unfortunately for Apple Millennials hate the close platform model It seems inevitable that Samsung will prevailbut the next insanely great thing will come from Americacount on thatand some asian behemoth will end up with the market when it moves towards being a commodity Wed Golden Phoenix If you want to do some basic technical analysis on Aapl shares draw a long term trendline from the April low up across the previous bottoms Youll see Aapls price recently penetrated that trendline to the downside briefly turned up to test it from below touched it then failed and has since declined from there This is a textbook example of what you do not want to see a stock you hold do For those annoyed by Aapl fanboys its a sight to behold Fanboys will disregard this post because they like having their trendline bottoms penetrated Its a year generational thing the irony Gotta go back to when it was share and Bill Gates offered up some to keep the company afloat That could happen again ya know Shit goes back forth Wed Bastille Day Forbes Under Young energy entrepreneurs to watch including a few Texans Posted on January By Joshua Cain Forbes Magazines
