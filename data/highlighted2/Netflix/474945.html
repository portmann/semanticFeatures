competitive pressures are creating challenges for Disney Their business segments still have significant growth potential thanks to macro factors and business acquisitions Disney NYSE DIS is a diverse corporation comprised of media networks parks and resorts studio entertainment interactive media and consumer products Disney owns franchises such as ESPN ABC and Marvel to name a few It would be difficult to find any person who has not interacted with a Disney product or service at some point in their life From Monday Night Football to The Avengers Disney offers some of the most sought after content across the globe Recently Disney has come under scrutiny for some of its business segment performance Entertainment consumption trends competition and new disruptive technologies are presenting challenges that Disney will need to address In this article we will review each of the business segment challenges and opportunities In the end my thesis is that the stock and not the company is the only thing broken This segment can greatly emphasize stock direction as it makes up of Disney revenues Today consumers are cutting the cord from traditional cable and focusing on alternative media platforms to save money and increase convenience As a result Disney Q revenues remained flat compared to the same period in the previous year and were in decline versus their Q fiscal quarter However they significantly improved operating income versus the same period previous year in addition to the preceding quarter ABC scripted and nonscripted shows such as Modern Family Scandal and Shark Tank appear to be down doubledigits in ratings In addition nearly of scripted shows were actually canceled inclusive of Nashville leaving a question mark on new content Competitive pressures increased from NBC owned by Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NBC shows like Blindspot Chicago Fire and The Voice had better year over year comparable rating fluctuations and can be found exclusively on American Airlines NASDAQ AAL According to Nielsen data ESPN also saw decreases in subscribers Since subscribers have fallen around As a result Q ad revenue was down From a pure sports perspective NBC has another ace up its sleeve as it covers the Rio Olympic Games in August This coverage has potential to threaten ESPN ad revenue in Q If that is the case the stock could see pressure Finally I think Disney fell short in their decision not to invest in daily fantasy sports They initially committed to investing in Draft Kings but later decided it could threaten their brands Comcast and Time Warner NASDAQ TWX on the other hand both invested in FanDuel or Draft Kings According to Eilers Research in a recent Forbes article daily fantasy is estimated to grow from billion in up to an astounding billion by That growth rate alone could have been proactive in squashing any rhetoric about ESPN performance and subscriber volatility Personally I dont feel this would have negatively impacted the brands image and it could have increased the frequency and volume of web traffic Overall the disruption in this segment is real but Disney can still excel within the evolving landscape For one thing Disneys media is offered across many of the disruptive mediums such as SlingTV by Dish Network NASDAQ DISH SlingTV offers costconscious consumers more flexibility to stream live television as low as per month without traditional cable contracts Secondly Disney is leveraging social platforms such as YouTube Consumers tend to have less patience to watch an entire show and can view a single segment on YouTube from shows like The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon ABC originals can also be found on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Disruptors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are investing in this content in return eg ESPN Films for As a result Media Networks still provided a increase in operating income No matter the trends Disney is finding ways to expand profitability within this challenging atmosphere Disney parks are iconic and provide great family entertainment but there are definite challenges in this space NBCs Universal Studios recently launched two key attractions These include The Wizarding World Of Harry Potter and The Walking Dead I am twentynine years old and have no shame telling my readers that I would frequent Hogsmeade for some butterbeer A recent article from the LA Times reports that although Disney still hosts nearly two and a half times the foot traffic of Universal Studios the growth rate continues to favor Universal Studios From to Universal Studios was estimated to have grown attendance by while Disneyland grew just a mere The good news is that according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis disposable income in the United States has increased over billion from January through May of this year creating organic growth in leisure and entertainment spending In addition the International Association of Amusement Parks released a report that bodes well for Disney estimating theme park revenue growth rates could reach globally per year on average Disney cruise lines also received record earnings which have led to the demand of two additional ships available in and Not only will this segment benefit from an increase in disposable income but also lower oil costs Weve seen the airline stocks benefit from this and should favor Disney cruises just the same Finally Disney knows how to entertain and its been their business model for years The force is strong in this business segment Disney saw a massive increase in operating income and in revenue for Q This was primarily driven by the success of Star Wars The Force Awakens and Zootopia Combined these two films have grossed over billion in their fiscal yeartodate performance and Disney has already planned two additional Star Wars films for and release dates Star Wars represented the highest grossing film of all time domestically and third in worldwide sales Compare that to when TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOX distributed Star Wars Revenge Of The Sith in which only reached th place in worldwide gross sales Risks are difficult to gauge in advance of a movie rollout Delays in scheduling fluctuation in production costs and timing of major competitive studio launches can impact the overall performance But if Disney can continue to bring franchises like Star Wars to the top of world records their future will continue to look promising in this business segment This is the smallest of the four business segments and its revenue was the only one to contract during Q Revenue shrank by in Q versus as Disney reported a stronger US dollar as the culprit However many Disney Stores are located in malls across the country and I suspect a decline in mall traffic to be a contributing factor The other part of this segment is Disney Interactive represented by games and apps that coincide with crossover content eg movie launches For instance one of their newer games includes Star Wars Commander which was the number one downloaded app in China This reinforces their ability to grow international markets with content and monetize the franchise products However Disney Infinity was a large video game project that put players in an interactive character world Earlier this year Disney reported it would shut down the operation and incur a writeoff of million At the end of Disney revenue topped billion a increase over Theyre currently pacing ahead of sales as of Q with billion in yeartodate sales The company grew earnings per share EPS by in Q and is the th consecutive quarter they produced doubledigit growth in EPS Even with this impressive growth Disney missed the consensus EPS of per share in Q Compare this to Comcast who grew sales by and are also pacing slightly ahead in yeartodate sales versus prior year Though the two companies are growing very similarly the stocks price to earnings ratio PE differs Comcast trades at a PE of while Disney trades at a PE of Now consider Fox who saw annual revenue decline around from to Their yeartodate sales are on pace to remain flat to and operating income is especially weak versus prior year With that said Fox still trades for a PE of By comparison I would make the argument that Disney is currently undervalued based on their performance and the evaluations of peers With some investors anticipating a major market correction Id like to propose some potential ways to approach Disney without a lot of exposure Depending on your approved trading level for options a diagonal call strategy can help create returns by supplementing longterm in the money calls with income generation As an example writing an October call at a premium while simultaneously purchasing a January call at a premium creates a net debit of on Disney In this case I can gain exposure to Disney shares for around rather than purchasing shares outright for roughly If youre less worried about market volatility or have a lower level options approval a covered call strategy may also work In a covered call option your exposure will be greater since you own the shares outright In this scenario you will benefit from a Disney yield in addition to the income generation from written calls Investors may also consider writing a put option if they view particular support levels For instance Disney stock has been trading sideways between and per share for the past six months If an investors thesis is that represents a key support writing a put below can be an effective strategy If you do this you must be willing to own more Disney shares in the event the option finishes in the money as you are then obligated to purchase shares for every contract you write If the option expires out of the money investors effectively build a safety net to protect their core investment Rinse and repeat these strategies to help outperform the stock itself during periods of slower appreciation Disney is a fiscally fit company ran by a great management team Their business has continued to produce growth in revenues and operating income while growing earnings per share over eleven consecutive quarters The industry is getting more competitive with Comcast overlapping almost every one of their segments Consumption trends challenge Disney to adapt but I believe they will find a way to navigate this new landscape with their brand equity With data suggesting a rise in leisure and entertainment spending the company is also positioned well for organic growth barring any major economic issues Keeping that in mind the company appears undervalued compared to its peers and may serve as a value investment With major indexes reaching new highs in investors should be cautious of their exposure To reduce their risk an options strategy can provide a safer choice without avoiding the market altogether May the force be
