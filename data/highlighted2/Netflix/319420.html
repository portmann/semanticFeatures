class='textDiv'>What Investors Really Need To Know About HBO Nows Numbers Time Warner Inc NYSETWX Seeking Alpha HBO recently revealed its subscriber count for its HBO Now service was Many analysts had expected the number to at least top the million subscriber mark with some predicting even higher interest HBO Nows lower number is the result of a myriad of factors but nothing that should be a longterm detriment The assumption in the market is that every streamer needs to reach Netflixs level of success to be profitable but thats not a fair comparison HBO Time Warner NYSE TWX made news last week when it was revealed its HBO Now service had logged subscribers so far Expectations had been much higher and as a result analysts and the media have teed off on the cable giant Yet for all the disappointment is HBO Now really a flop Yes the expectations were much higher and many thought the service should reach the one million mark quickly and without problem In fact other projections actually went as high as two million including one from HBO CEO Richard Plepler who last year predicted the count could be as high as four or five million subscribers So you can imagine how the media and industry analysts reacted when Plepler was the one to report the number Plepler and his company had to have to have seen the irony here which is why they were ready with a response HBO is just getting started and there are a number of factors in play that can account for the lower subscriber count Yet before I get into those whats fascinating and overlooked is that HBO Now isnt the first streaming network to see this backlash over slow growth Take Vince McMahons WWE Network for example The company got hammered for breaking its traditional PPV model for a SVOD system Over time though WWE NYSE WWE has been able to get on a steady track to the point the service now outranks that of every traditional cable TV network Furthermore the networks revenue is now twice the number of its PPV revenue Yes you can point to total subscriber count and say it should be higher or that it slipped a bit quartertoquarter but thats missing the point The bottom line is that it took time for the WWE Network to get to where it is now and HBO Now needs the same opportunity People have this expectation that just because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is dominating its field and has done so in quick and surprising fashion then every streamer should do the same It doesnt work like that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Its the exception to the rule Its also in a vastly different position than HBO HBO Now at its base level is a way to view HBO programming without an HBO subscription Its a way of extending the cable channels audience Remember the primary way people view HBO programming is on their television sets or through the HBO Go app which is free to cable subscribers HBO created this alternative model as a way to boost revenue and appeal to the cord cutters At a cost of multiplied by subscribers the total comes out to million which is million more than what HBO would have made in the last months without HBO Now Theres also that its just been months We arent even at the year mark yet HBOs busy season is arguably AprilAugust which is when the majority of its top original programming runs This is the window for the reigning Emmy winner for Best Drama Game of Thrones and the reigning Emmy winner for Best Comedy Veep When those shows kick back up so will the subscriber count Its also important to note that not only is HBO Now not available through Xbox or PlayStation platforms like HBO Go is but for the first three months of its existence it was a Apple TV exclusive which not coincidentally started right around the time Thrones returned in Investors cant overlook either of those facts especially since of HBO Gos viewing comes from those gaming consoles HBO also is constantly curating new content and in it is adding Jon Stewart and Bill Simmons to its already deep ranks Stewarts content is being specifically designed for its streaming audiences as is a new daily news program from VICE Media a company HBO helped launch HBO has long been a dominant force and now that one of its big initiatives is going slower than anticipated its easy to take shots at the network HBO Now and even WWE Network have a long way still to go but the steps taken thus far are important ones that shouldnt be overlooked Keep any eye out here as new numbers come in because it will be a gradual increasemaybe not to the levels of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but that was never in the cards Disclosure Iwe have no positions
