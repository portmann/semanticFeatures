Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a short position in NFLX over the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is expected to become the largest video streaming company in the world in the next five years as announced at CES However a few problems like the low profit margins terribly low cash flows and poor starts in a few countries make us think that the future is not so bright Even the excellent assumptions in our DCF model do not make the company considered as fairly priced The comparative analysis shows that the market values <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>like a com company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is the worlds largest video streaming company and the most popular one Owing to it being the market leader in an almost monopolistic industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has shown excellent growth rates both in the US and in other countries As of January the company operates in more than countries has a M customer base and more than B in annual revenue Every year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>makes enormous investments in its streaming content library These investments typically reach a level of of total revenues The company has Napoleonic plans for the future an opening in China spending of more than B on programming and reaching a customer base of millionplus members by Additionally as quoted in this article The service will in debut its first talk show a movie starring Brad Pitt reboots of bygone hits Full House and Degrassi and the first offerings in French and Italian It is impressive However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs the money to keep funding its fast pace According to our research we definitely see a lot of drawbacks in this company We are going to explore them now Reason Growth Is Good But What About The Margins As you can see from Diagram despite the excellent revenue growth rates the companys net income is growing moderately The main reasons for that are the low operating and net profit margins even if we leave out other PpayTV platforms the closest competitors Financial pyramids have always had triple digits turnover growth rates but it does not mean that they were profitable We do not imply that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is sort of an illegal scheme Nevertheless we want to emphasize the importance of optimal pricing and costreduction strategies that must be implemented by the management in the future in order to make a business model sustainable To better grasp the idea just pretend that you are a hotcakes dealer who sets the price at an operating breakeven level ie revenue COGS We are absolutely sure that you will become the fastestgrowing dealer in your region but it will not make you rich as you will practically work for free Reason Cash Flows Metrics Are Terrible Look at Diagram During the last five years the company has been borrowing cash from its stakeholders because cash provided by operating activities was not sufficient to finance its future expansion The fiveyear accumulated undiscounted free cash flow is B A discounted metric would be more reasonable depending on the discount rate Assuming a discount rate the accumulated amount is in excess of B Hence B is the amount of money classified as investments made in the past When will they be paid off Will they ever be paid off In fact nobody knows the answer What we definitely know now is the stock is trading like the expected cash flows will grow faster than the revenue and everybody will be happy even those who bought it at a valuation of x PE However this is not true because free cash flows are going to increase very slowly Why Look at Diagram which shows the actual and the forecasted amounts of capital expenditures and investments in content Even though the projected capextorevenue ratio is expected to fall it is not likely to fall below the mark because Thousands of movies and TVseries are produced annually The increasing number of content subscribers will force the company to make investments in file servers The companys competitive advantage over torrent sites requires it to provide high quality for a small price Investments in IT streaming technologies to provide fast connection speed and IT code optimizing are required in the long run At CES it was announced that the company had opened access to its services in countries like Russia India South Korea etc Nevertheless the opened status does not mean that the company has successfully penetrated the market because in most of these countries the expansion was awful according to the users experience Just a few things to mention The website has not been translated into local languages It means that about of potential clientele has been weeded out No translation of movies and no subtitles Prices have not been adjusted to make the service more affordable in countries with devalued currencies especially Russia and the CIS These points were derived from the articles of analysts living in some of these countries Russia and South Korea Read more about Russia here and here Read more about South Korea here Learn about the situation in Pakistan here According to this information the announcement of the enormous expansion of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in other countries sounds like an attempt to boost the stock price without a footing These issues make us think that Netflixs future is rather miurky and highly depends on both the endogenous factors like the size of the capital expenditures and the success of the costreduction strategy and the exogenous factors like geopolitics torrent activity around the world forex headwinds and user preferences The companys future is uncertain Now we are going to value the company taking into account the above factors We will use our standard tools the DCF model and the comparative analysis Our discounted cash flow model can be downloaded in the Excel file format which you can access with this link In Diagram you can see how different metrics are expected to change during the forecast period During the modeling process we had to make several assumptions which can be examined by readers in the Assumptions tab of our Excel file A few words about them A net profit CAGR of which takes into account both the increasing operating margin on the one hand and the increasing tax rate on the other Capital expenditures to become less aggressive than they are at the moment The current capextorevenue ratio is projected to decrease by The net capex is projected to become by The cash flow effect of the negative operating working capital will become less significant in the future The terminal EVEBITDA multiple is set to be at x which implies a perpetuity growth rate in free cash flows As a result free cash flows will substantially increase and become positive by However we think that these assumptions are overly optimistic because capital expenditures may not be as low as we project in the future Nevertheless we do not support the view of the Streets analysts regarding M in net income in as the current net income is two times lower than the previous years the Q filing can be viewed here and we do not see the catalysts that may spark high growth in the bottom line Our model shows that after subtracting the market value of debt minority interest and adding back cash and investments the market value of equity is circa B in the base scenario Consequently the fair value per share is Its more than lower than the current share price around per share The sensitivity tables are presented in Diagram We find the suitable price range for the stock to be between per share or lower because of the very positive perpetuity growth estimates This price range represents a downside risk for the stock Our comparative analysis results are presented in Diagram All ratios show that the stock is extremely overvalued We think that the PE ratio of x the PBV ratio of x and the PS ratio of x are extremely irrational However the current EVEBITDA multiple is x which is not off the charts The current valuation seems to be justified by the expected success of the costreduction strategy that the company is going to implement we hope the management will in fact implement it Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>seems to be a global superstar we are very concerned about its future because of a few internal and external factors We do not think that the company will reach a net income of M by the end of We also see that the accumulated investments balance of Bplus has not yet been paid off According to our DCF and comparative analyses the stock is overvalued Hence we recommend shorting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and set a target price range of per share This price range is translated into a downside potential for the stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc bears currency risks interest rate risks macroeconomic and geopolitical risks Since these risks are mostly unpredictable we recommend investors hedge their positions using different financial instruments Our valuation of the company is based on current and mediumterm business trends and does not include the probability of a force majeure On the other hand by using our Excel model you can change the key parameters in line with your personal assumptions and expectations </div></body></html>
