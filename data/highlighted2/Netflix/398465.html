appear skittish Mad Moneys Jim Cramer said those in the market shouldnt overlook three key items when making their assessments oil China and the US dollar First on the list is oil Despite the drop Tuesday oil is heading higher Cramer suggested Oil tumbled on news that OPEC members are increasing production That said Cramer pointed out that demand is picking up and overall production is dropping which may lead to higher prices in the future China released data Tuesday suggesting a slight decline in growth Cramer said its important to look at other positive data coming from the key economy And then theres the dollar Cramer disputed suggestions that the dollar is heading toward new highs Rather he said the dollar is in a lull and when we have a lull we like to take the temperature of the market and look for some bargains As the dollar gets weaker companies can raise guidance Cramer added Cramer started with retail Costco NASDAQ COST won an upgrade Tuesday Cramer said CVS NYSE CVS is a company he likes very much As for other companies Cramer pointed out Clorox NYSE CLX reported a betterthanexpected quarter beating on both the top and bottom line Pfizer NYSE PFE impressed with its

And finally Cramer highlighted comments from Apple NASDAQ AAPL CEO Tim Cook on how the companys lucrative services stream may not be valued correctly by the market And dont forget Apples big stock buyback and billion profit from the last quarter The major trends oil China and the dollar remain very much in place Cramer said And when they arent you are still getting a whole different set of stocks that we at least expect to rally Thats bullish not bearish Cramer featured more of his interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook during his Tuesday show the first part of the interview can be found on Mondays show Cramer asked the CEO what the Tim Cook Apple stands for Cook didnt want to refer to the company as his but stated that Apple is striving to make the best products on earth that enrich peoples lives We want to change the world through our products Cook said The CEO also said Apple attempts to conduct business in a way thats right and just The company takes special care to address issues surrounding its impact on the environment whether its assessing how much energy Apple products use or relying on renewable energy to power the business Apple also cares about privacy and how it treats its employees Cook said Cramer asked Cook about statements made by presidential candidates whether its Republican Donald Trump on suggestions Apple should make its products in the US or complaints by Democrat Bernie Sanders that corporations are destroying the moral fabric of the country Cook said government in general has gotten dysfunctional in the US and in other countries as well and that puts more responsibility on consumers and companies to help promote change and to improve things Cramer asked about the government push to obtain data from an iPhone used in the San Bernardino terrorist attacks Cook said Apple is happy to work with law enforcement and if officials have a valid warrant The request to break the iPhone tied to the terrorist attacks presented something different We stood up he said Helping to break into one iPhone could create a permanent way to bypass iPhone password protection Cook added Cook also suggested the privacy concerns raised by the government action didnt belong in court rather as part of a bigger discussion among all impacted parties Its a complicated issue he said The Mad Money host offered examples Costco generates a steady stream of revenues with its membership fees <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>generates revenue through its monthly service that Cramer said he would gladly pay double for

struggled despite recently delivering decent first quarter results and guidance I can make a case its a real bargain Cramer said Cramer had outgoing CEO TJ Rodgers on his show to share his companys

bringing new blood into operations Rodgers also said hes bullish on the company and its future While Cypress has seen a gradual decline in revenue Rodgers said most of that revenue decline was the result of a decline in revenues from businesses the company is divesting Blackhawk NASDAQ HAWK the gift card giant has encountered headwinds related to the delay in EMV implementation the credit card chip technology by many of its retail partners mainly grocery store outlets The issue pertains to fraud occurring within the space as retailers put restrictions on gift cards to address that issue
