</span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Netflixs TCA day reveals were very status quoist but thats okay given the strong position the streaming service holds in the industry Other networks are beginning to stop complaining about the networks competitive advantage and to start trying to mimic it in their own unique way Thats how long it took <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX topper Ted Sarandos to get asked a question about Adam Sandler at Tuesdays start of the summer edition of the Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles The questions didnt get any easier from there but Sarandos knew that This isnt his first time at the TV industry staple and with a stock price of over it wont be his last either <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a beast theres no other way to put it Its a legit beast and it is coming hard at the traditional networks Let me put it like this almost a decade ago when the major league baseball team the Tampa Bay Rays were still the Tampa Bay Devil Rays a popular sports website posted fake mock slogans for all MLB teams At that point the Rays were not the powerhouse they eventually came to be for a time but they were close and their slogan was Last chance to laugh at us During that time the streaming giant at its start had just two original series now it has and all total hours of original programming It also had panels at TCA this year the most of any network Of course by far the most interesting panel is the one that featured Sarandos alone on stage being grilled by members of the media The whole thing in general is a fascinating exercise that still shows the value of critics analysts and the media overall These executives voluntarily sit down for minutes twice a year to get basically attacked by reporters Some executives are cocky and have every reason to be and some would be dead in the water if it werent for extensive media training by expensive PR teams Yet they all do it one after the other Whats interesting though is seeing the ebb and flow NBC for example was at its lowest low a few years ago but as of late its king of the hill for now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>though has always remained among the more steady networks and thats because it holds a competitive advantage above all others it doesnt release ratings As proved again on Tuesday during the panel for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt even the shows creators have no clue as to how many people watch their series That means Tina Fey one of the industrys top and most respected showrunners is as in the dark as you and I Say what you want if thats fair or not and I know someone is bound to comment on it below but the point is moot This is not going to change and rival networks have even begun to take a page out of that playbook and realize they dont need to report on their online offerings either Check out NBCs wording of who was watching its Aquarius Remember this is a series that did so badly in the traditional ratings it was bumped to Saturday night TVs graveyard And it still got RENEWED Even Sarandos poked fun at that scenario So what did <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>say during its panel that would be of interest to investors Would it take the stage and make a bombshell announcement No it didnt but again it didnt have to as status quo is good for the network and quite frankly it had nothing to prove that wasnt already clearly on display For a organization that for years wouldnt fully welcome bloggers into its membership ranks to now have days devoted to streaming media is a very powerful statement Among the announcements made on Tuesday were air dates for the new season of Bojack Horseman the rebirth of the resurrected Longmire and what seems like a laundry list of standup specials from Alist level comedians In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is working on locking in another season of Arrested Development and getting the Olsen Twins to participate in Full House spinoff Fuller House which actually sounds like it could be possible now Paired with the success of series like House of Cards Orange Is The New Black Bloodline and Grace Frankie not to mention Daredevil <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to look like the powerhouse it has proven to be Now Im not saying this to get a fight going in the comments or get a bump in my page views Im saying this because its the truth and thats evident by the fact that all of this has happened in a threeyear span and in the TV industry thats a record pace Its also what has inspired <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to jump into original films which takes me back to Adam Sandler As I mentioned it took six minutes for someone to ask Sarandos about his networks fourpicture deal with the comedian As I mentioned last week before Pixels even the theaters a lackluster performance should have minimal impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and thats what exactly what Sarandos said to reporters looking for red meat We did our deal with Adam Sandler because he is an enormous international movie star We are as encouraged as ever Sarandos wouldnt be baited into saying something salacious he is too smart for that He later went on to doubledown and say I dont feel I have to defend Adam Sandler and hes right <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>makes original series based on what the network perceives to be the best for its audience and theres no reason for that strategy to change with original films Its also worth pointing out that what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is doing here is no different from what its rivals do it is just perhaps doing it better All of the networks have the ability to mine their data for what their audiences like and mold their plans from that point it is just that in this case nobody knows what is in that data which is whats become the news Now yes you can say theres no hard numbers proof that House of Cards and its brethren are ratings successes but its hard to deny that they are successful in general The boost that comes from critical buzz word of mouth and awards season glory is hard to deny The truth is that the old school method is fading and this is the future and in case you forgot that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is happy to remind you over and over and over again Source <span style='background-color:
