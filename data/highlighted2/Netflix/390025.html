class='textDiv'>Google To Face Stiff Competition On Video Revenues From The Other FANGs Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOG Seeking Alpha Googles YouTube could see ad revenue erosion from Facebooks fastmoving initiatives on video YouTube Red is pitting itself against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon Prime Video but can it sustain the planned addition rate for new original programming Googles video revenues are now tied closely with market share action How much will they lose to Facebook versus how much can be gained from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon If you want to summarize what Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL as a business is you just need to explain four things Google Advertising Search YouTube and Android If advertising is the dam that collects water for Google then their catchments are Search YouTube and Android Outside of these catchment areas Googles attempts at creating new ones so far has been a huge letdown like their Motorola dream or Google Plus But so far Search YouTube and Android have served the company well and in fact have positioned the company to take advantage of the global shift toward mobile video consumption But where there is money involved its obviously going to bring competition and YouTube is starting to face significant threats to its longterm future Dont get me wrong I dont think YouTube is going to go away any time soon However the way the market is shaping up there are two distinct threats to YouTube one in the form of Facebook NASDAQ FB and the other in the guise of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Prime Video In my recent article Facebooks Future is Video I talk about why Facebook is pushing hard on the video front and the tremendous growth that the industry has seen in recent years In the current scenario Facebook is still a rookie in the ever growing mobile video world when you consider the size scale reach and timeline of YouTube The real lure of mobile video for Facebook is the advertising revenue Sitting as they are on a user base numbering billions they have every reason to get into this business With WhatsApp still unmonetized and Instagram already piggybacking on FBs ad platform this is something they sorely need to cement their future The loser in this game is going to be YouTube although it will take time before Facebook Live and other initiatives can catch up to the pioneer of usergenerated video content However once Facebook fully integrates advertising into its entire suite of video offerings their strong network of advertisers will be in full battle gear against Googles YouTube ad business a fight to be watched for sure YouTube is the precursor of currentday video streaming services but one thing Google failed to do was to see the early potential of YouTube as a significant source of income Today that has changed and Google earns more than billion through search and YouTube advertising The company doesnt break out revenues for YouTube but one source estimates YouTube gross revenues at around billion for expected to grow more than to billion in The source that estimates neglects to factor in is the entry of Facebook into this business so Google not only stands to lose future revenues but current video advertising gains as well Google is depending heavily on the growth of YouTube for forward revenue growth and Facebooks efforts may well put a damper on their plans sooner rather than later The moment Google launched YouTube Red it was clear that the competition now was not limited to Facebook or even sites like Vimeo for that matter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon Prime Video now came into the picture with their premium video streaming services Thats the competition that Red is up against in this space YouTube doesnt have the kind of content that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can offer They may be able to stave off Amazon for now but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a very real opponent for Reds popularity Google is working under the assumption that just because YouTube has a huge following Red will too Thats not going to be the case until they can start matching content with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Of course Googles money muscle can make that happen but it will be several quarters before Red can boast a strong and growing following for premium content YouTube Red plans to have about to original programs this year and theyve already got about six now according to CEO Sundar Pichais comments during the companys last quarterly earnings call That growth rate for original programming nearly matches what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will introduce this year but lets not forget this not only does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>have a huge lead in terms of subscribers but also dozens of original programming feeding those millions and an enviable international presence in countries Its going to take awhile for Google to get to where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is and my only hope is that they do it in a sustainable way Once again Google is late to a key segment The same thing happened in the cloud industry Google was already a provider of cloudbased services for several years but only with the success of AWS Microsoft and IBM did they actually wake up to the revenue reality of cloud Infrastructure as a Service in a big way I covered this recently in an article called Alphabets Google Weak on Cloud Numbers Amazon Prime Video is another threat to watch out for in the segment that YouTube Red operates in APVs success is tied in with Amazon Prime memberships and that number is growing fast most recent estimates put it at around the million mark and counting Though Prime members arent there mainly for the video streaming service Google will still have to factor that in when they count the competition YouTube certainly has the firstmover advantage over the usergenerated video streaming market but the competition is getting thicker by the year Not only has Facebook entered this market but IBM also announced a service for media companies to distribute their HD video content seamlessly using IBMs technology backbone This will create even more traffic from multiple sources For now YouTube has the luxury of being the dominant player in streaming video monetization through advertising I dont see this status quo being maintained for more than the next two years In that time Google must grow YouTube Reds revenues quickly while making sure that they maintain the growth on video advertising revenues Theyre already seeing success with initiatives like Google Preferred so all they need to do is keep pushing from multiple directions and each of these must align either to video ad revenues or their subscriber base on YouTube Red Video and cloud are two areas that Google has been very slow at and they cannot afford to sit on their online advertising laurels any more Just like they brought in Diane Greene to head their cloud division they need someone with strong media experience to run YouTube Red I dont see this as a major problem considering how critical this component is to their overall business The kind of manpower money and muscle theyre putting behind their cloud business is exactly what Id like to see here in their video business Please follow me as I track the performance of FANG Facebook Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Google in the video space in the months ahead It will be fun to watch Disclosure Iwe have no
