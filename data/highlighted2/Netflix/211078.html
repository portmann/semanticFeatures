the dark corners of the web an event took place Tuesday This event means that for the time being <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>actually lost one of its largest worldwide competitors Im not going to recommend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX here I find it wildly overvalued However this wont keep me from commenting on a development which is actually a positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and which started happening yesterday You see theres this thing called Popcorn Time Popcorn Time is an app thats available for PCs and Android smartphones and which is kind of a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on steroids It has every kind of TV show imaginable along with a massive selection of streaming movies including many recent blockbusters Popcorn Time relies on bittorrent sharing to provide an experience much like Netflixs but without having to host massive amounts of data or needing a content delivery network Unlike most bittorrent clients Popcorn Time is as userfriendly as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>you just search for a movie you want to see and press play After a bit of buffering Popcorn Time streams your movie just like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>And Popcorn Time is also free which kind of makes it very competitive with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Finally Popcorn Time is illegal in most places since its basically piracy as the content authors receive no compensation for its usage Potentially Netflixs Largest Competitor Why do I say Popcorn Time is potentially Netflixs largest competitor Well in the last twelve months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>captured million new subscribers including nonpaying subscribers per quarter As for Popcorn Time as of March it was getting downloaded at a clip of times per day that takes it to a run rate of million new users per quarter So basically in terms of growth Popcorn Time was recently as large or larger than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the leader in paid streaming its easy to see that Popcorn Time is very likely to be its main competitor when it comes to streaming Its impossible to tell how many of Popcorn Times subscribers would have otherwise opted to subscribe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but the answer is clearly many At the same time its thus no surprise that in its Q shareholder letter when talking about competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>named piracy as being one of its biggest competitors Heres the exact phrase Piracy continues to be one of our biggest competitors This graph of Popcorn Times sharp rise relative to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and HBO in the Netherlands for example is sobering Its also to be noticed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>singled out Popcorn Time This is not surprising given the growth in numbers I chronicled above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also pointed towards the following chart depicting Popcorn Times interest rising in the Netherlands Source Google Trends sorry about it being in Portuguese but its selfevident So there you have it in a way Popcorn Time is perhaps Netflixs largest meanest competitor But there is an exception While the chart above depicting interest in the Netherlands can be replicated for other countries this wont be wellknown in the US For instance here are the charts for Portugal where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>just launched and for the United States Notice the massive difference Theres an obvious reason for this Most countries have not yet implemented effective piracy policies but the US already did The US implements the famous six strikes policy where after warnings from the ISP it disconnects the user from the internet Given this reality its natural that Popcorn Time and other bittorrent piracy tools have not taken hold in the US and as such investors are unfamiliar with this trend This is so even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>singled it out as being one of its largest competitors Still Netflixs International Streaming segment accounted for nearly twothirds of the growth in paid memberships on the twelve months to September So its easy to see why having Popcorn Time fail can be a significant event for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>While people might be focused on HBO and Amazoncom Video those are competitors mostly established in the US whereas this issue both And reflects Netflixs main competitor outside the US for obvious reasons the piracy controls within the US Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>trades as much on immediate EPS and revenue growth numbers as it does on subscriber numbers And here as we saw nearly twothirds of those increased subscriber numbers are coming from markets outside the US where Popcorn Time is well established It should be said that by March Popcorn Time was seeing daily downloads this puts the quarterly downloads at million which greatly exceeds Netflixs international growth rate in subscriptions million total subscriptions per quarter during the last twelve months hence me saying that Popcorn Time was Netflixs greatest competitor So why am I saying that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>just got good news Well as it turns out there was quite a bit of disagreement within the Popcorn Time team regarding the direction they wanted to take it in Some of this disagreement no doubt was prompted by rumors of an impending large lawsuit against Popcorn Time and those behind it This disagreement led to the defections of a large number members of developers yesterday And as of yesterday Popcorn Time stopped working this happened because the developer holding the keys to the domain was one of those who left What this means is that overnight <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>lost perhaps its largest competitor ever Now this might still be temporary Maybe the remaining team will pick up the pieces and reenable this software Certainly other substitutes will emerge But as of right now the fact is that its down and hasnt recovered this can be monitored here Still the fact that Popcorn Time lost control of its own domain might make any substitutes have much less market reach than Popcorn Time had attained and thus be much less competitive than Popcorn Time was Either way this is positive news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>though again I must emphasize that it being a positive factor is not enough for me to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a but Im neutral on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>There are a lot of news reports about Popcorn Time for the web being down This is unrelated this refers to a version which popped up just a few days ago which promised to make Popcorn Time available through the web browser This version is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things it was still too small and was pulled by its own creator due to lawsuit threats Popcorn Time a piracy site and app was the single largest competitor to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Due to internal strife Popcorn Time went down yesterday This is likely to be a positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>particularly helping increase subscriptions in foreign markets Its less of a factor in the US since the US has tight piracy policing rules in effect at the ISP level Obviously Popcorn Time might yet resurrect and others will certainly try to take its place But getting to the popularity Popcorn Time already enjoyed is something of a long process and in the meantime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is
