Subscriber growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>came in below expectations when the company announced third quarter earnings Operating profit also disappointed missing the companys target by percent The quarterly report hurts managements credibility and will likely cause investors to lose confidence in the longterm potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to generate meaningful profits With NFLX trading at a very high multiple the disappointing quarter could cause shares to trade steadily lower until management is able to reassure investors that growth is on track Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQ NFLX traded more than lower in extended trading Wednesday evening following the companys third quarter earnings announcement For the quarter the company generated billion in revenue below Wall Street analysts expectations for billion More importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported total memberships of million users This number represents growth of million new subscribers during the quarter and is short of the million total subscribers investors were expecting Looking at the companys earnings the picture gets even more disappointing For the quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>generated million in operating earnings which fell far short of the companys guidance of million Management blamed this decline on involuntary churn which means that the company was unable to collect payments from existing customers The quarterly letter implies that this is an issue with new chipbased credit and debit cards This seems like an odd scapegoat for a miss in operating earnings After all a worldclass retail company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shouldnt be caught off guard by a change affecting their regular subscription payments Finally the companys earnings per share came in at which is a penny better than the second quarter of this year and half of the per share earned in the third quarter of Wall Street analysts were expecting the company to earn for the quarter Investors currently own shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>based on longterm expectations of significant subscriber growth It makes no sense to pay per share Wednesdays closing price for a company that earns just cents per share of profit per quarter unless one expects a tremendous amount of growth over the next several years Earlier this week we laid out a best case scenario for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>explaining how even if everything goes perfectly for the company over the next three years the potential increase in the share price would not likely compensate investors for the risk they are taking Our recommendation was to sell NFLX shares before this evenings earnings announcement Now thanks to the companys disappointing subscriber growth and complete miss in terms of operating profits it will be even harder for investors to make a bullish case for this company especially with the stock price still well above per share At this point the companys management team has begun to lose credibility which will likely negatively impact consumer confidence Since the entire market cap of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is based on expectations and not on the companys current earnings its important for the management team to manage investors expectations and to execute on published targets With credibility now severely challenged investors will likely require more concrete proof of potential earnings growth moving forward And in the meantime it would not be surprising to see the share price drop into the low s near where NFLX was trading as recently as the end of first quarter International Growth and Price Increases We have two final thoughts on the third quarter earnings report First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had worse than expected subscriber growth in the US offset by stronger than expected international growth There are two ways of viewing this data A shift toward international growth is good because it represents a larger pool of prospective subscribers Or A shift toward international growth is bad because US customers are more profitable for the company We tend to gravitate toward the bearish side of this argument because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is already struggling to meet its operating earnings target If it focuses on adding more customers that are less profitable to the companys bottom line investors will have to place even more faith in the companys ability to execute overseas And this at a time when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is already losing credibility The second issue were worried about is whether the price increase in the US will be effective or not Last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>increased its domestic pricing for streaming media to a month This new pricing only applies to new customers but the a month could help to exacerbate weak subscriber growth in the US We find it odd that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would move forward with its new pricing plan during this quarter while knowing that the companys US subscriber growth metrics would not meet investor expectations It seems like a wiser strategy would have been to hold off on a price increase until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was able to determine what caused the weakness and make the appropriate changes The fourth quarter will be a very interesting period for NFLX investors If the stock is able to rebound from this disappointing earnings announcement it will represent an impressive show of strength from the faithful NFLX shareholders But we believe the more likely scenario is that NFLX will trade steadily lower during the next three months or at least until management is able to prove that exceptional subscriber growth is once again the
