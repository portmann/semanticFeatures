class='textDiv'>CBS Positioned To Profit From The Future Of Television CBS Corporation NYSECBS Seeking Alpha A strong lineup gives CBS an advantage in negotiations with cable providers CBS All Access and Showtime streaming position CBS to take advantage of paradigm shift This past week I purchased shares of CBS Corporation NYSE CBS The company is well positioned to profit from a strong lineup and a paradigm shift in how TVvideo content is consumed While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX has been the pioneer CBS is beginning to offer compelling streaming content Unlike many of its peers CBS is welcoming the future of television with CBS All Access and Showtime streaming I believe that CBS is in the sweet spot for profiting from the transition to ondemand while being able to strongarm cable companies into paying more for content CBS All Access For per month CBS All Access provides subscribers with access to TV shows ondemand This is cheaper than per month for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and per month for Hulu The shows include the NCIS franchise the CSI franchise Survivor Minutes Criminal Minds Elementary Family Ties Hawaii Five MacGyver Melroses Place the Star Trek franchise Taxi and many more The app is user friendly and much easier to navigate than Hulu Given million subscibers at Hulu and M subs for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I project that CBS All Access will reach M subs by the end of Showtime This July Showtime will be available for streaming outside of a cable contract on Roku Apple TV and PlayStation Vue for per month Showtime provides a competitive alternative and complement to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and HBO NOW from Time Warner NYSE TWX Showtime will likely lure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>customers that want to increase their available content for streaming and others that are just bored with Netflixs content HBO Now has better content than both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Showtime but costs per month via iTunes and Slingcom Given million paid subscribers at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I project that Showtimes streaming service could reach million subscribers by the end of The Cable Networks Division which includes Showtime is the most profitable part of CBS In the first quarter of Cable Networks accounted of net income but only of revenue The Cable Networks Division recorded a profit margin of vs for the rest of the businesses A successful launch of Showtime streaming could drive net income and earnings per share growth Five million subs per year at a profit margin could translate to an additional million of net income Content And Negotiations High quality content leads to negotiating power The fall lineup includes new shows Code Black Supergirl and Limitless Returning from last year are NCIS NCIS New Orleans Blue Bloods Criminal Minds CSI Cyber Elementary The Good Wife Hawaii Five Madam Secretary NCIS Los Angeles Survivor The Amazing Race Minutes and Hours NFL Thursday Night Football also will return to CBS this fall along with their typical Sunday NFL games On February th CBS will broadcast Super Bowl L This will likely be the most watched and most celebrated event of all time Add in March Madness and CBS has the upper hand when negotiating with cable providers On June th CBS contract with ATT Uverse which has million subscribers comes due After a short blackout last December CBS struck a deal with DISH Network NASDAQ DISH disabling the adskipping DVR feature for CBSowned broadcasting stations Valuation Over the past months CBS earned per share for a trailing PE of Looking forward CBS is expected to earn over the next four quarters for a forward PE of Over the past year CBS aggressively repurchased shares outstanding reducing share count by The reduction in shares outstanding will continue to have a positive impact on earnings per share CBS is definitely a better value than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CBS market cap is lower than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>even though CBS revenue is higher and net income is higher CBS has more channels of distribution and has an opportunity to grow in Netflixs backyard which is streaming Conclusion CBS is a well managed company with a great content lineup As the method viewers use to consume video content continues to evolve CBS will profit with the introductions of
