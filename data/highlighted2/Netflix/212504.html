launching DisneyLife a digital subscription streaming service in the UK next month The weakness in cable TV business has not happened overnight as the percentage of households with cable subscription has been falling over the past five years But Disneys NYSE DIS August selloff was a surprise or perhaps a shock as the share price fell from its historical high of to a low of during the month ESPN has also lost approximately of its subscriber base since its peak level In the meanwhile the live streaming companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Hulu are witnessing impressive subscriber growth the cable TV industry will remain under pressure in the future Although the decline rate in cable TV subscriber base is steady which is expected to remain modest the growth in the live streaming market will continue to challenge Disney and other players as more and more subscribers are switching to streaming services Retaining the subscriber base would be tougher as YouTube is also entering the subscribed streaming business with the launch of YouTube Red To attract a large subscriber base the adfree music and video streaming service will also offer offline and background play functionalities According to Bob Iger Disney is not ready to take the desperate step towards an internet offering The company expects its media network will remain strong as evident from the fact that of US cable households watched ESPN in the first quarter Thus Disney is not expecting a dramatic decline in cable subscribers over the next five years In the meanwhile ESPN revenue would continue to move in the upward trajectory The primary channels of ESPN charge per subscriber a month and if the company keeps increasing the price at a six years historical average of still its revenue will grow by annually over the next five years Losing subscribers even at a modest rate could slow down the topline growth but it will impact the earnings growth of media network segment in due to a high cost In this regard Disney is cutting jobs at ESPN network around of the workforce It seems Disney does not intend to trim the bundle and pricing as a first option and taking a typical initiative by reducing the workforce to immediately reduce the cost However it is not a solid step to maintain the earnings growth Disney must come up with a robust strategy to retain the subscribers as losing more than million subscribers over the past four years is not a good indication In this scenario the management has a good amount of time to swing its existing strategy including pricing and introducing skinny bundles sales channels and even basic technology Disney has done very smart things and in my opinion it is doing the same by not taking aggressive measures for now The media network segment is still capable of delivering a steady and profitable growth but tapping the subscription streaming business to build an option for future is a smart move Disney is holding an option to start selling ESPN directly to the viewer if the subscriber base falls below expectations in the future In this regard Disney is launching DisneyLife a digital subscription streaming service in the UK next month Offering most of the popular movies and television shows directly to consumers for or about a month will open a new revenue window for Disney After the initial launch in the UK next month Disney will roll out the streaming service in the other European markets like France Spain Italy and Germany in where video on demand in Germany alone is expected to grow at a CAGR of by The ondemand video subscription in the UK will reach roughly billion by the end of and video streaming and subscriptions industry will account for of the video market Now it seems that Disney is preparing itself for the streaming business Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger said DisneyLife is a great example of our strategy to utilize technology to connect with consumers in more direct and compelling ways For now Disney will offer older content to subscribers including Pixar movies along with bundles of books and music Star Wars and Marvel films would not be available in this subscription Holding these cards is a good thinking to play smart Thus if this business model succeeds Disney would offer all the lucrative content in a separate subscription services dedicated to these franchises Moreover Disney is slowly testing the market without risking its existing business In this regard the standalone subscription service will not be available in the US but it might happen in the future The global subscriber base of streaming business will reach million by With the acquisition of stake in Hulu Disney indirectly entered the streaming business back in April Hulu which is a joint venture of Disney st Century Fox NASDAQ FOX and Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA is the second largest streaming company with a market share of in the US market Hulu is rapidly growing in the streaming space and the company will find it easier to make content deals as compared to its rivals due to its holding companies Hulu has around million users on its Hulu Plus Services and the company witnessed a increase in its user base in the past year Thus having stake in the second largest online video streaming company gives Disney an indirect access to rapidly growing industry The other three segments are delivering doubledigit growth which means despite a slowdown in media network the overall profitability of Disney will continue to grow by a higher single digit in the longterm Disney earns roughly half of its operating income from media network while the remaining half comes from the studio entertainment parks and resorts and consumer products Besides ESPN Hulu and DisneyLife Disney is equipped with Marvel Pixar and Lucasfilm to maintain its growth momentum for a longer run Star Wars The Force Awakens which has already broken records of advance ticket sales is all set to boost the revenue of studio entertainment In addition to that Disney has also unveiled the roadmap of next five Star Wars movies and Marvel movies In the meanwhile the opening of the Shanghai theme park next year will accelerate a sustainable earnings growth in the coming years For the third quarter Disney reported diluted earnings per share of up as compared to in the same period last year Disney will announce its fourth quarter and annual results on November Consensus expects that Disney will report earnings per share of for the fourth quarter which will be an increase of roughly over the same quarter last year The company generated billion in free cash flow during the first nine months of up Disney has been raising dividends aggressively from per share in to per share in and another dividend hike is on cards Thus the cash reward to shareholder should remain healthy in the future With strong fundamentals and intact outlook Disney is still a longterm investment for healthy dividend growth and capital gains We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact data you
