class='textDiv'>Disney A Bad Stock But A Good Company The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha Disney is encountering solvable problems as it adapts to the changing media landscape Disneys strong competitive advantages ensure longterm prosperity Disney appears to be slightly undervalued at current levels Disney NYSE DIS just reported its greatest quarter ever That is quite a milestone for a company that has been around since Q revenue was up yoy and EPS increased yoy Both numbers exceeded Wall Streets estimates The studio entertainment and parks and resorts segments both generated over billion in quarterly operating income for the first time During the Q conference call CEO Bog Iger said our results clearly show that our longterm strategic focus and investments in brands and franchises are driving remarkable value in these businesses greatly increasing their impact on the Company and further diversifying our future growth I think it is safe to say that this wonderful company is firing on all cylinders A blow out quarter and a beautifully articulated conference call explaining the numerous growth opportunities that lie ahead DIS did not give guidance is usually a formula for a higher stock price right Wrong The stock was down over the next day and is currently off its alltime high Why Because DIS has become a frustrating story stock that lives and dies by one metric ESPN subscribers The performance of Disneys stock has been disgusting ever since the company reported Q earnings at the beginning of August The quarter was strong earnings expectations were exceeded yet the stock sold off sharply because the number of ESPN subscribers declined This only augmented worries that a secular decline in the cable business was on the horizon because the younger generation is starting to consume media in different ways This is troubling for DIS because its media networks business generates of total revenue However the market is currently underestimating Disneys ability to adapt to the changing environment and completely ignoring the companys superior diversification Sure the younger generation is starting to consume content utilizing different mediums such as smartphone apps and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX However it is the quality of the content that matters not how it is consumed It may not be on a television set but people will always watch live sports and kids will always watch compelling movies and shows produced by Disney Management pointed out in the conference call that of Americans with a multichannel bundle watched sports and watched ESPN content in some form This is not going to change anytime soon Keep in mind that it is ESPN who has the rights to Monday Night Football the College Football Playoff Sunday Night Baseball and college basketballs Big Monday ABC has the rights to the NBA Playoffs and the NBA Finals The Disney Channel continues to create shows and movies that attract kids to the television like a magnet I consider myself a normal American man who enjoys sports I will continue to pay for cable if that is the only way I can watch Stephen Curry lead the Warriors to back to back titles this summer I can still quote movies from my childhood such as Motocrossed Brink and Double Teamed which were constantly on the Disney Channel Disneys management is aware of the changes taking place in the media industry and they are taking action to position themselves ahead of competitors Iger says the company will continue to focus on subscriber trends moving quickly to embrace and create opportunities to drive value in the evolving market The company has started to offer less expensive cable packages featuring ESPN it is continuing to invest in Hulu as a media distribution platform and it has distribution agreements with Alibaba NYSE BABA and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Also it is possible that subscriber declines have at least temporarily subsided Management stated they have actually seen an uptick in ESPN subscriptions However the numbers do show a decline in operating income for the media segment attributed to an increase in programming and production costs offsetting an increase in ad revenue It is important to note that operating income for the segment would have increased around if the timing of the College Football Playoff was different Even if operating income from Disneys cable business continues to slowly decline I have confidence that management will take the appropriate steps to weather the storm Disney has been able to successfully adapt to multiple disruptions that have taken place in the media industry over the past century As stated earlier it has been around since and will probably still be around in In addition to the highest quality content and phenomenal management Disney has another competitive advantage that will provide a cushion as the media landscape changes It has a diversified business model with multiple segments that continue to perform remarkably DIS has been able to acquire a vast umbrella of brands and franchises that drive longterm performance across all segments of the business In the Q conference call COO Tom Staggs refers to Disneys longterm strategy as purposeful diversification The ultimate catalyst for the Disney machine is the iconic movies and characters that are consistently created by the studio entertainment business Disney is able to leverage themes and characters to amplify revenues in the parks and resorts and consumer productsinteractive segments of the business For example Disney has experienced a massive uptick in sales of consumer products related to Star Wars It is planning to open new Star Wars theme lands at Disneyworld and Disneyland and is adding more themed attractions to parks across the world Lastly Star Wars video games are flying off the shelves The proof is in the numbers The studio entertainment segment reported quarterly operating income higher than Q of parks and resorts operating income grew and consumer productsinteractive media reported growth of The impressive growth in all three segments can be directly attributed to Star Wars release As long as Disneys entertainment segment which contains brands such as Lucasfilm Marvel and Pixar keeps producing compelling movies the other segments will reap the benefits I was blown away at the pipeline of future movies listed in the conference call I counted over movies planned for the next years including Star Wars movies the remaining sequels and standalone films Frozen Civil War Iron Man vs Captain America and a new Pirates of the Caribbean As I have stated in previous articles my investing strategy is to take advantage of market selloffs and overreactions to transitory issues to buy companies with strong fundamentals and future growth prospects It just so happens that both aforementioned forces are dragging Disneys shares down at the same time Disneys phenomenal content and proactive management team are the main reasons why I believe the current issues are transitory and easily solvable Thanks to its diversified business model the company as a whole continues to perform like a welloiled machine Any losses experienced by the media segment will be more than offset by the other segments of the business while Disney adapts to the changing environment as it has done many times over the past century Disney has a forward PE of around This is roughly in line with the PE of the SP and the entertainment industry I would argue that a phenomenal growth company such as Disney should trade at a premium to the market and its industry Disney has grown earnings at compounded annually for the past years and is projected to experience similar growth for the next years This gives Disney a PEG of a little over which is more than fair Disneys current PE is at the midpoint of its historical range for the past years In conclusion Disney appears to be slightly undervalued to fairly valued when you compare its PE to the market its industry its historical averages and its growth rate Disneys balance sheet is still not overleveraged by any means The companys debttototal assets ratio is only leaving it enough borrowing capacity to pursue many strategic options However more debt does not need to be added unless a major acquisition is pursued because Disney generates an impressive amount of cash flow Over billion of free cash flow was generated by the business in This represents the cash left over after working capital requirements and capital expenditures This excess cash can and is being used to repurchase shares increase the dividend and pursue other growth opportunities Management is doing a fine job of effectively investing the capital that is provided to them ROE was and ROA was respectively for Managements ability to achieve high returns on the capital invested is what ultimately drives earnings growth and thus value for the longterm shareholder My reverse discounted cash flow model pictured on the left shows that a share price my purchase price implies sales growth forever and a slight decline in margins over the next years Two percent sales growth is usually the assumption made for companies that have reached a terminal state and have very limited growth opportunities As stated earlier I believe Disney is far from reaching this business stage because of its pipeline of movies capacity for more worldwide parks and resorts and opportunities for further brand acquisitions Although a temporary margin decline is possible as Disney adapts to a new age of streaming and ondemand content I believe margins will return to historical levels as Disney finds new ways to monetize its content and operations in the other segments continue to improve More realistic yet still conservative in my opinion assumptions are made in my base case scenario pictured on the far right This scenario assumes sales growth of for the next years in line with the average sales growth for the past years for the next years and thereafter It also assumes operating margins remain constant at This scenario yields a fair value of a share In conclusion Disney appears to be slightly undervalued when you consider the growth catalysts rock solid balance sheet impressive cash flow generation managements ability to invest capital at high returns and the companys sustainable competitive advantage At the worse you are buying Disney at a fair price I am always willing to buy a wonderful company at a fair price because wonderful companies seldom sell at fair prices It is not prudent to blindly buy your entire position at once without taking a look at the charts I utilize technical analysis to ensure that my cost basis is as low as possible and future return is as high as possible I also never buy all of my desired position at once so that I am able to use excess cash to lower my cost basis if the stock drops significantly below my initial purchase price I also like technical analysis because it presents facts that cannot be disputed This is contrary to fundamental analysis which is oftentimes extremely subjective Disneys twoyear chart pictured above tells me that a longterm uptrend was broken in August when Disney plummeted below its day moving average red circle A broken trend is a powerful force and oftentimes signals the start of a new trend A new bearish trend has been established because Disney has made a slightly lower high and slightly lower low black circles Disney faces strong resistance around top blue line and strong support at around bottom blue line Although Disney has rebounded sharply off its week low of made in February I would be skeptical of this rally for a couple of reasons The SP is currently overbought and encountering resistance at the day moving average More chatter about global growth concerns Fed tightening or oil going to could easily cause a market selloff which would definitely drag Disney lower Also the trend for Disney is neutral at best and a retest of or a new low seems more likely than a breakout to new highs Although Disney is a wonderful company that is undervalued at current levels the technical picture and macroeconomic backdrop does not look great That is why I would suggest waiting for a market wide selloff before establishing a substantial position I think it is okay to buy a small amount at these levels because there is a chance that Disney has bottomed and the market is going to break out to new highs However it would be smart to keep some powder dry just in case the stock moves lower If Disney is able to stay above key support levels at during the next inevitable market wide pullback I would recommend accumulating a large amount of shares I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any
