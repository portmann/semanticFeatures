billion but believe that shares today are worth If one thing was made clear in trading following <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX earnings its that shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>trade almost exclusively on subscriber growth When the company announced that domestic subs grew only in the quarter vs estimates for million and guidance for million net additions the stock fell nearly in afterhours trading Once the company revealed in the conference call that slower sub growth was due partially to a consumer transition to chip payment cards shares rebounded to almost flat But investors still remained concerned about subs growth in the US and shares traded down roughly on Thursday October Shares have traded erratically on subs growth for some time now with sub beats pushing shares higher and sub misses crashing shares At some point though the market has to realize that subscriber growth does not pay back shareholders cash flow does Beyond the hype cycle of a quickly growing subscriber base is the unfortunate truth that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a company valued at billion with million in trailing twelve month nonGAAP free cash flow Its true that current heavy spending on streaming content additions will eventually lead to greatly positive free cash flow but even under aggressive assumptions for huge piles of free cash flow in the future we cant wrap our heads around the current valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>credited involuntary churn in the third quarter to the increasing prevalence of chip payment cards The transition included the changing of account numbers for some consumers which led to an inability to process payments for some customers according to management Management believes this involuntary churn is temporary and that the TAM remains to million households in the United States According to data from Visa and other payment card issuers this seems a legitimate reason why subs growth slowed Visa says million chip cards have been issued to customers or about of their total customer base More widely more than million chip cards have been issued in the US or a little more than of the billion total payment cards in the US Meanwhile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had million subs at the end of Q Assuming an equal distribution of chipcards among those million subs then roughly of those subs have been issued chip cards or roughly million From this standpoint about million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers were atrisk of the account number changing issue management cited US subs missed estimates by less than so if the miss was entirely attributable to chipcards about of Netflixs chipcard subs were affected by account number changing issues This seems very reasonable and management does cite that multiple issues outside of the chipcard issue may have been at play so in actuality far less than of Netflixs chipcard subs were affected by account number changing issues To us this makes complete sense While some might see trouble in slowed US subs growth we believe the math checks out for the chipcard issue to be the main culprit of slower growth This issue is not terminal and so we do believe management when they say the TAM remains in the to million range While US subs growth was slower than expected international subs growth exceeded most expectations International paid subs growth is still slowing on a YY basis consistent with previous quarterly trends But this is to be expected given prior YY growth rates were north of Despite CEO Reed Hastings attempt to remain neutral on countryspecific developments he did shed some color on Brazil and Japan Brazil continues to be a rocketship for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a valueoriented product like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is proving to be a popular option in countries with tough economies Cheaper international pricing does give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>leverage in some pricepressured international markets and this valueoriented pricing will experience viable synergies from current emerging market weakness This cheaper international pricing coupled with FX headwinds is weighing on margins as net profit margins have compressed dramatically due to a negative teens contribution margin from the international streaming segment Management though sees no reason why the international business cant be at least as profitable as the domestic business especially when FX headwinds slow down By our calculation actually monthly ARPU quarterly revenue divided by end paid member count divided by actually increased sequentially from Q to Q so this is promising for margins Indeed international streaming contribution margin was more than basis points less negative in Q than in Q The Brazil market also benefited particularly from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>original series Narcos which features Brazilian superstars as the lead and director of the series Narcos also was popular in France and Norway according to management Narcos provides investors a glimpse into the benefits Netflixs move to exclusive content will give the business and we discuss that more indepth in the next section While management is attempting to taper expectations for the Japan market CEO Reed Hastings did imply that Japan is doing well Price Increases And Original Content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is moving to exclusive content and is spending a ton of money in doing so more on that further down So naturally management expects to be able to charge customers more in the future as Netflixs exclusive content library grows While it seemed that management intends to keep its standard definition offering in the US at CEO Reed Hastings was quick to point out that the standard def offering has remained constant in years past the company does expect to space out its price tiering In other words management does expect to hike prices in the future for HD and ultra HD offerings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has not distinctly proven price elasticity for its streaming service but we do believe gradual price hikes will be accepted by the customer Management appears to be trying to sell the you get what you pay for model as the more customers pay per month the more and better content the viewer base will get Specifically the more and better original content the viewer base will get and given the massive success of both domestic and international original content like House of Cards and Narcos we do believe both domestic and international consumers will be willing to pay more as this original content library expands It makes sense to us and believe it will make sense to the consumer that a service that offers exclusive content is more expensive than a service that offers nonexclusive content At this point though this is our speculation and Q results will give us more founded insight into Netflixs price elasticity Intense competition does complicate the consumer decision As opposed to a dilemma between pay more or lose streaming service entirely the consumer is now faced with a third option to use another streaming service like Amazon Prime or Hulu We believe that the more diverse Netflixs original content library is the more protected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is from churn due to price hikes From this standpoint we affirm that the move to exclusive content is a necessary move albeit an expensive one Most economic moats are expensive to flesh out and we see no difference from the norm for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Its nothing new that the streaming content space is highly competitive as companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon attempt to capitalize on the growing shift from linear to internet TV While we believe that Amazon has key preexisting advantages in certain international markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still viewed pretty unanimously as the streaming content king According to Piper Jaffrays Fall Taking Stock With Teens Survey teens are spending far more time on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>than any other streaming service The numbers are not even close Unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>though Amazon Instant Video is part of a bigger Amazon Prime ecosystem This advantages Amazon Instant Video in that its appeal isnt directly attached to its content Amazon Instant Videos attractiveness increases as the overall appeal of the Amazon Prime ecosystem grows We see Amazon Primes growing ecosystem as a major deterrent to Netflixs price elasticity At the margin consumers might be willing to pay for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon Prime services However as both become more expensive consumers will likely be forced to choose between one or the other If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>sees churn increase as a result of price hikes we believe lost subs there will mean gained subs for Amazon Prime Overall we believe that the global streaming content space much like many other industries will be an oligopoly and not a monopoly We believe Amazon Prime and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>among a few others will continually compete for market share in the foreseeable future Given all the factors previously discussed we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a long runway for continued strong topline and bottomline growth We believe that the company will brush off nonterminal chipcard headwinds in the US and grow US streaming subs at a rate in assuming paid US streaming subs come in at roughly million before growth slows to a CAGR into This projection puts total US paid streaming subs in the range of managements TAM by the end of Q domestic ARPU quarterly revenue divided by end paid member count divided by months in period was up YY and given our expectation for continued price hikes in the future we model for ARPU to grow roughly per year into We see domestic streaming revenues exceeding billion by Given slowing YY international sub growth trends we believe international subs can grow right around in down from roughly in Q and this assumes Q paid subs come in at million and at a CAGR thereafter into This projection means that we expect international paid member count to almost equal domestic paid member count by Similar to domestic streaming ARPU we believe international streaming ARPU will grow at a CAGR into We see international streaming revenues exceeding billion by Contrary to popular belief we believe the DVD segment has some longevity and value as long as some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offerings remain DVDonly We model for DVD member count to level off around million over the next five years and believe pricing will inflate only per year We believe domestic DVD revenues will sum to just over million by More favorable pricing tiers should help improve margins and we believe that the international business can become as if not more profitable than the domestic business Overall we believe net profit margin should continually improve into In sum we see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>achieving net sales of billion by while netting a profit in excess of billion Our fiveyear revenue and earnings model can be seen below Important to note that not shown is Q which we assume will grow at a comparable rate to Q from a subs standpoint The companys biggest problem is its negative cash flow which is driven by huge spending on streaming content additions In the company spent billion on streaming content additions That number grew to billion in and is already billion through the first nine months of These are necessary additions and with the streaming landscape only becoming increasingly competitive we do not see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>easing on this spending As detailed above Netflixs key advantage moving forward is quality original content so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to continue intense investments in originals While investments will likely not continue to accelerate going forward we do not see this going down Helping cash flows as a result of heavier spending on originals is amortization of the streaming content library which grew from billion in to billion through the first ninemonths of This will continue to grow and should help cash flows Through the first nine months of net income to operating cash flow reconciliation is million That puts net income to operating cash flow reconciliation on track to be nearly million this year from million last year Overall we believe that the company can reach net income to operating cash flow reconciliation of zero by as the intensity of investments in originals cools while amortization of the streaming content library grows We model for net income to operating cash flow reconciliation roughly as follows Looking at capital spending we believe DVD acquisitions should continue to cost roughly million per year while we expect additions to PPE to continue to be above million and accelerate next year but slow as international growth slows Under these rough assumptions we see the company generating positive free cash flow by and upping annual free cash flow to more than million by This agrees with our intuitive feeling that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has huge free cash flow potential In our DCF model we use an aggressive perpetuity free cash flow growth rate and a discount rate The CAPM discount rate is much higher than but we use because we really like the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>business and do not require a high rate of return on a super growth stock like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which will almost assuredly grow revenues and earnings at a healthy clip Taking the net present value of our explicit free cash flows and summing this with the net present value of our terminal free cash flow we believe the net present value of all future free cash flows is roughly billion Adding in MRQ net cash of million we believe that Netflixs fair value today is billion Using an MRQ average diluted share count of million this equates to a fair share price of roughly In our model we have done our best to reconcile the bullish revenue and subscriber growth story with the bearish negative cash flows to paint a full picture of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its value This full picture tells us that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is worth billion today or roughly per share Despite the premium valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>actually isnt terribly overvalued We believe shares are trading north of fair value but a premium on fair value isnt dramatically overvalued for a super growth stock like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>At per share we believe investors are overpaying for a stock that doesnt pay its shareholders While we believe share price will be higher than in five years we believe buying here would yield a very small rate of return for investors Without a dividend a small rate of return on a richly valued stock is unattractive to us We will stay away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for now but this is not to say share price wont appreciate from here As we began
