learned to communicate effectively after the disastrous price increase Raising the price will allow it to accomplish what it states to its customers more content With earnings around the corner I am still a buyer and will add to my position on any dip postearnings Most remember the debacle of Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX stock price in it soared to over prior to the split and sunk into the s after announcing changes to its baseline pricing structure Netflixs July announcement of the price increase on its blog was so poorly communicated that most consumers digested it only through the medias interpretation Thus many were angry The NFLX Facebook page ran rampant with negative comments and subscribers ran away over the price increase that was less than the cost of a beer and burger Making a mistake is only truly a mistake if you learn from it As I was in a Big University Graduate Communications program at the time and studying media effectsmarketing my classmates and I noted the issues with this message The bottom line lacks clarity it cannot be digested in a single reading and provides a more exhaustive explanation than needed It had an arrogant air to its theme almost like that of say a cable company which is the absolute antithesis to NFLXs basis The attitude could be summed up as the price is going up and you will like it and if you dont then cancel we dare you And if you wanted to take NFLXs dare to cancel the message gave the customer an easy way out a couple clicks and you were done Most importantly though was the lesson of customer loyalty They gave no incentive to current customers no grandfathering of those already members for a year or two and thus further infuriated longterm subscribers However fast forward over four years and we come to NFLX having regained its stock price and then some This increase in the companys stock price has come about even with another price increase for its service in May of But why did that increase not have a media headline of NFLX raises prices Well the answer is in the email below which shows that NFLX learned from its mistake The messaging is direct and uncomplicated Consumers can understand the reason for the price increase and they have seen the results of increased content over the past several years especially the addition of original content that NFLX continues to expand And NFLX grandfathered in current subscribers at their old price for two years Average subscribers likely read the email shrugged with an ok I get it and went on with their lives and the stock price reflected this lack of enraged defections So what were the lessons learned by NFLX outside the realization that is better than per month and the need to clearly spell out the increase while citing valid reason that consumers can easily digest Two additional and essential lessons pop out The need to incentivize current customers to stay through a price increase by keeping their current plan price for years Loyalty works both ways and is give and take There is no mention of canceling your membership in either of the newest announcements By not mentioning the option consumers are more likely to react in a hohum manner than consider ending their subscription With these lessons learned NFLX again announced it will increase the price of its most popular subscription fee by month to last week There is no reason to fear a drop or even a major dip as this newest increase nearly mirrors the success NFLX also prepped this increase in July with a statement from Reed Hastings that subscribers should brace for higherpriced plans in the future The simple statement below gave the candid reason for the price bump To continue adding more TV shows and movies including many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>original titles we are modestly raising the price for some new members in the US Canada and Latin America As a thank you to existing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>members who arent already benefiting from a previous price guarantee we will maintain their current price for a year Overall NFLX has now created its round wheel for price increases that unlock value for its investors by maintaining customer loyalty and increasing its content library And as my military comrades like to tell me You dont need to reinvent the wheel if it works it works NFLX has fortified this base messaging skill and now only needs to improve the rubber on the wheel for max performance and longevity Thus this newest price raise is nothing to worry about in fact it should be welcomed as Seeking Alpha contributor Michael Battat mentions in his article Defections in mass are highly unlikely and the extra revenue should help ensure original content and the addition of new shows possibly from the selection of cancelled TV shows I mentioned in my previous NFLX article I am continuing to buy on a weekly basis and will fortify my position further if investors react
