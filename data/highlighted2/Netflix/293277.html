class='textDiv'>What Investors Learned From Netflixs Response To NBCs Ratings News <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreBusiness relationship disclosure All opinions expressed are the authors and no compensation outside of Seeking Alpha is being received While the author has a business relationship with a subsidiary of Comcast it is not related to any divisions discussed and the author is not a fulltime employee NBC this week revealed ratings data pertaining to Netflixs original programming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has since responded to the release with its own comments calling the data remarkably inaccurate Netflixs business model is radically different than that of the broadcast networks which makes the idea of ratings less important than it would for traditional outlets As you may recall NBC NASDAQ CMCSA released a version of Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX ratings during its day at the winter edition of the Television Critics Association press tour We knew <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would have some sort of response when the streaming network had its turn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos got right to the point by telling the room full of reporters the numbers were remarkably inaccurate data Sarandos followed that up by saying the below Heres a couple mysteries at play for me Why would NBC use their lunch slot to talk about our ratings Maybe because its more fun than talking about NBC ratings The methodology doesnt reflect any sense of reality we keep track of Lets look at that because those few lines are really telling First Sarandos and likely everybody paying attention to this feud knows exactly why NBC did what it did on Wednesday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a threat to the traditional way of watching TV and that scares the industry The broadcast and cable networks see streaming as a threat to its livelihood and are hell bent on protecting what theyve spent decades building I also get Sarandos was trying to make a joke when saying maybe because its more fun than talking about NBC ratings but thats not the punchline it was three years ago NBC leads the demographic two years running and is in prime position to pull of the hat trick in the spring That demo may not matter to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but it does to the rest of the TV industry Yet that third part is what makes all the difference and really signifies we are comparing apples and oranges For the first time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has really come out and said the demographic isnt something they keep track of in the first place Sarandos then brilliantly pointed out why his network has so many hits because they dont make their shows compete against each other Theres a very natural inclination to say relative to this show this other shows a failure That puts a lot of pressure on the talent that we dont want if we turn it into a weekly arms race by doing box scores for every Nielsenissued ratings report were going to have the same result as its had on traditional television which I think has been remarkably negative in terms of the quality of shows Sarandos makes perfect sense here but that often gets lost in the shuffle The reason why the networks come after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its decision to hide its ratings is very simple In fact The Hollywood Reporter summed it up best earlier this week Now you may be annoyed that Sarandos and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>dont reveal ratings numbers certainly many critics and people who cover the industry are put off by that stance As an aside it doesnt bother me at all and I have no idea why premium cable channels would provide ratings numbers either That said what does bother me about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is it tries to have it both ways not releasing numbers and then touting the success of its shows without tangible evidence What NBC tried to do was find that tangible evidence which is even more of note now because it turns out it may not have never really existed on a concrete level However if anything NBCs stunt and again it was a stunt did succeed it was prying just a little more information out of the streamers vaults Sarandos is a very smart businessman and hes been vital to helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>become a global entity Yet the more both he and it succeeds the larger that bullseye becomes What the media has learned from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is if if they push the network hard enough they WILL squeeze out some new information This isnt the first example it happened as recently as last October when Netflixs Beasts of No Nation bombed in theaters The next day the media called its debut into the film world a complete disaster Remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>only arranged a theatrical run to qualify for Oscar contention it wasnt done to make money Yet Sarandos felt compelled to respond and he did so by revealing specific stats about Beasts which proved its value When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>goes on the record about something the media doesnt forget about it anytime soon This was a solid response to NBCs actions because it could in some ways begin to change the conversation But the more likely scenario is it will continue to get lost in the noise
