class='textDiv'>Amazon Video Looks Strong Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Seeking Alpha AMZN grew downstream Internet traffic share by in H while NFLXs share decreased by NFLXs decrease can be attributed to a reencoding of the video library to deliver superior quality on less bandwidth use We argue that an analysis of trailing year data best lends itself to the conclusion that both platforms are growing concurrently Sandvine recently released their North American Internet usage numbers for the first half of They look quite favorable for Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Video which grew Internet downstream traffic share from in H to in H Those numbers look especially favorable against Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX numbers which illustrated a decline in Internet downstream traffic share from in H to in H The quick read is that while NFLX still dominates the streaming market Amazon Video is quickly gaining traction at the expense of NFLX expansion We argue that a deeper read contradicts this point and that both platforms are actually growing concurrently behind a secular shift away from linear TV Looking at Sandvine numbers back to we can see that there is a positive trendline for AMZN NFLX and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL owned YouTube Since H NFLX has grow share while YT has grown share AMZN which has no data for H since it was not a top service has presumably grown share roughly now stands at In a trailing year window then YT and NFLX growth have outpaced AMZN growth That story changes in the trailing year and trailing year windows Over the past years both NFLX and AMZN have grown market share by It is when looking at the past years that we see AMZN growth beginning to outpace NFLX growth AMZN share grew over the past years while NFLX growth has inched up a mere We argue though that this is more indicative of AMZN ramping growth rather than NFLX having stalled growth According to Sandvine NFLXs lost market share in the most recent report should not be read as peak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and is actually attributable to the company reencoding their entire video library to deliver superior quality on less bandwidth use According to Sandvine Frequent readers of this report should however not interpret this decline as a signal of peak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Earlier in the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>began implementing PerTitle Encode Optimization which saw <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reencode their entire library with a focus on being more efficient in order to deliver what they claim is a same or better experience while using less bandwidth Sandvine believes Netflixs bandwidth share decline is tied to the new encoding techniques and that this implementation is a tremendous win for subscribers and operators since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>video will now use fewer network resources resulting in an overall better experience It should be noted that at the time of collection it was unclear if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had reencoded their entire library so an update in the second half of this year may better reveal the impact Encode Optimization may have had on networks in the region History shows that Sandvine is usually accurate about their rationales for NFLX share declines and projections for future increases In H NFLX saw downstream traffic share slip from in the prior year to Sandvine explained though that the data was collected before NFLX made SuperHD content available to all subscribers Sandvine further forecasted that NFLX share would return to or even surpass previous highs From that H report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to be the unchallenged leader for traffic accounting for of downstream traffic during peak period While we observed that their share of traffic decreased slightly since our H study it should not be interpreted as a decline in the dominance of the service at the expense of their competitors In fact the bulk of data collection for this report occurred before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>made SuperHD content available to all subscribers regardless of the service provider Based on initial findings from customers we expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>share to return to or even surpass its previous heights As it turns out availability of higher bitrate Super HD content to all subscribers caused share to jump to in H The downstream traffic share represented a increase from NFLXs previous high share of in H Given the accuracy of this rationale and forecast we are confident in Sandvines current rationale for NFLXs decline as it relates to a reencoding of the video library Interestingly enough Sandvine indicates that Amazon Video is up to a similar reencoding making it all the more impressive that the platform saw its downstream traffic share increase from H We argue that an analysis of the trailing year Sandvine data best supports the conclusion that AMZN and NFLX are growing concurrently while both benefiting from a secular increase in adoption of OTT streaming services According to Sandvine Realtime Entertainment has gone from accounting for only of peak period aggregate Internet traffic in to now accounting for almost of aggregate traffic and over of downstream traffic NFLX AMZN and YT combined to account for of downstream traffic in Today they account for of downstream traffic In short not only are people spending a greater portion of their online time watching and listening to content but the market for online streaming has remain consolidated on a few quality platforms AMZN and NFLX are benefiting from cordcutting On the first point it is nothing new to point out that Americans are cutting the cord Some data shows that in Americans are cordcutters with this trend being accentuated for young adults are cord cutters This article provides strong data to support the thesis that the cord cutting trend is just beginning while this survey and this study illustrate Millennials prefer watching Internet TV over watching Linear TV A continued transition away from Linear TV and towards Internet TV will grow both Interenet and OTT streaming service usage On the second point both AMZN and NFLX have poured a significant amount of money into building out their streaming platforms and developing a moat to protect from competition This includes spending heavy of acquiring content and spending even heavier on developing original content These efforts are clearly paying off as both platforms have grown their share of downstream Internet traffic consistently since We think the market especially internationally where we see NFLX as having a million sub opportunity by is big enough to allow both NFLX and AMZN to grow their streaming platforms concurrently Even in a rather saturated US market both are still growing downstream traffic share We are bullish on both platforms longterm growth I wrote this article myself
