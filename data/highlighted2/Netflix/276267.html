class='textDiv'>Bill Maurers Predictions For Seeking Alpha Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>investors should expect some select disappointment The next major area for consolidation will be in consumer goods One struggling tech company will finally make a much needed move As the year comes to a close investors are starting to look at what has to hold Each year I try to provide a couple of predictions as to what we will see in the market Last year I did fairly well with my group being dead on with thoughts about tech giants and a major change to the Dow Today Im here to provide my predictions for Apples NASDAQ AAPL dividend raise will disappoint investors There have been those calling for the technology giant to significantly increase its dividend in recent years and yet the company has not obliged If we look at total dividend payments for the past three fiscal years in the most recent K filing Apple only increased the figure by billion dollars between fiscal and fiscal The most recent fiscal year saw billion in total dividend payments There are a couple of reasons why I dont think well see a dramatic dividend increase in First most of the companys cash is generated outside the US This has resulted in Apple taking on a large amount of debt to accomplish its capital return plan and the company is mostly focused on share repurchases at this point Apples outstanding share count only came down by in fiscal after a decline in the prior year This was mostly due to the stocks rise limiting the amount of shares that could be repurchased for a similar dollar amount As a result I see another high single digit or low double digit percentage raise in Apples dividend during which I believe will be a disappointment for many who think a massive rise is coming Ill have a more formal dividend prediction as we get closer to a potential raise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX wont add million domestic paid subscribers is expected to be the last major year for Netflixs dramatic international expansion plans with the company expected to focus on increasing profitability in and beyond While it wouldnt surprise me if the international subscriber base grows at a decent clip and perhaps tops expectations I dont think investors should be looking for too much growth in the US As a point of reference Netflixs most recent guidance calls for an increase of million paid US subscribers in after million in So why do I see a bit of a slowdown next year Well there are a couple of main reasons Increasing prices will result in slightly higher churn Greater competition will limit growth and increase costs Summer Olympics will provide a midyear speed bump Company gets closer to market saturation rate I understand that a couple of these items have been part of the bear case against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for a number of years I do think well start to see some of these issues gain a little traction in enough to provide a meaningful slowdown in the US segment I also believe that increasing content costs especially if Apple decides to launch some sort of service will limit Netflixs content library <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has seen substantial growth in its US subscriber base in recent years but it is time for a mostly natural slowdown There are a number of smaller names in this space that have vastly underperformed the market in the past year I recently detailed how Deckers Outdoor NYSE DECK could again be in for a rough time thanks to a warmer winter and its shares are down about over the past year Wolverine World Wide NYSE WWW has lost of its value over the past year while Crocs NASDAQ CROX and Steven Madden NASDAQ SHOO have also underperformed the market While these companies may offer great products there are certain issues with each that make them questionable stock picks All of them currently have market caps of less than billion so a takeover by a larger firm or a goprivate transaction would not require a ton of capital Perhaps well even see a merger of two of the names in the space and there are more companies out there than just the ones Ive listed As some of the larger apparel names look to diversify their businesses and accelerate growth it would not surprise me to see one or more of these smaller names taken out Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO will need to find a new CEO In this years prediction regarding company executives I believe the struggling search company will look for management change The core business continues to deteriorate while plans for the Alibaba NYSE BABA stake have changed multiple times With revenues on the decline and earnings plunging Marissa Mayer has not proven she can get the business headed in the right direction She also lost a key ally on the board recently which could prove to be costly if her position is up for debate While a new leader may not be chosen during especially if she is axed late in the year I do think it is time for the company to move on A turnaround is finally here forThe Container Store NYSE TCS Ive been very bearish on this retailer for a while and over the past two years the stock has fallen from the mid s to the high single digits Some of the items that have hurt the name primarily a stronger dollar and premium valuation have improved significantly over the past year With the company opening new stores and expanding certain initiatives to current locations revenue growth is expected to accelerate in the February fiscal year While the companys initial forecast for the upcoming year may not be that strong expectations for this name have come way down and so has the stock While I dont see the stock returning to the s or s anytime soon even a return to double digits would represent close to upside from current levels Today I provided my predictions for While I do think Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could disappoint in certain respects that doesnt necessarily mean I would go out and short these two currently I do think Yahoo needs to get some new leadership in place and I think the footwear space looks ripe for MA Finally I think The Container Store will get back on its feet What are your predictions for and what do you think about mine Please feel free to comment
