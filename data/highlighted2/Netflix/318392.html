estimates that Netflixs subscriber base will more than double in the next five years This growth will be fueled by aggressive international expansion of its streaming service increasing broadband penetration and a growing library of content that caters to different audiences across the world The road to may prove to be the companys golden years ARK estimates that Netflixs NFLX subscriber base will more than double in the next five years growing to million by up from million in This growth will be fueled by aggressive international expansion of its streaming service increasing broadband penetration and a growing library of content that caters to different audiences across the world In this article we walk through the key assumptions and potential pitfalls in our model while sharing our data set in the spirit of open research and collaboration In January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>expanded its streaming service to cover countries worldwide With the exception of China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>essentially covers the whole globe Its addressable market is best measured by the number broadband connections In there were million fixedline broadband subscribers globally ARK estimates broadband subscribers could reach roughly million by see chart below The primary drivers will be growth in China and other developing countries In the series of charts below we show broadband subscribers in the top countries The Rest of World category denotes all other countries not included in the top Given million broadband connections worldwide what level of penetration could <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>achieve The answer depends on two factors the level of interest and the ability to pay for the service To assess interest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>we looked at worldwide Google Trends data for four popular pieces of content House of Cards Orange Is the New Black Daredevil and Finding Nemo We used the first three to measure interest in Netflixs current flagship content We used Finding Nemo as a rough proxy for future Disney and Pixar films that fall under an exclusive licensing deal with Disney NYSE DIS such as the sequel Finding Dory in the US We also assumed that over time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would gain access to Disneys content in international markets In the chart above the Google Trends data for the four shows are summed and normalized to the country showing the highest interest Australia Despite the modest sample size this interest data revealed some interesting insights Australia topped the list correlating with recent government survey data indicating rapid adoption of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>since its Australia launch Interest was much higher in France than in Germany reflecting Germanys cultural aversion to pay TV Finally the results did not measure the interest based on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>availability The Philippines and Poland stood out with strong interest despite not being currently served The interest data answers the question of who might want <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>To answer the second question who has the means to pay for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>we took GDP per capita for each country and normalized it to the United States which has the highest per capita GDP The results shown below are not surprising developed countries led the group while developing countries trailed To estimate Netflixs longterm broadband subscriber penetration potential we took the geometric mean of the interest data and GDP per capita data and normalized it to managements guidance for longterm US penetration The chart below shows the combined results with and longterm penetration estimates Note that these results are basely purely on fixedline broadband penetration affordable data plans for video over LTE would greatly expand NFLXs addressable market This penetration model though far from perfect makes a few predictions that correspond well to empirical data With no manual adjustments or access to survey data this model anticipates the United States will be the country with the highest penetration which is true today and likely will remain so It predicts Australia Canada and the UK will be the leading large countries outside the US which fits well with the survey results Finally it predicts modest penetration for Japan and China which aligns with the management guidance in earnings calls That said if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>successfully partners with a local Chinese operator its penetration could increase substantially To estimate the companys subscriber count in we multiplied the penetration estimates from above with the estimated broadband subscribers in The results are shown below The most striking data point here is the dominance of the United States both today and in Even with a full international rollout next year the US is estimated to be the largest single contributor to subscriber growth adding million subscribers over the next five years China at is a surprise Management has stated that it plans to operate a small service in the country While our estimate anticipates only penetration Chinas large broadband user base means it could still end up with a huge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriber base with potentially million subscribers France Germany Italy and Japan should be strong drivers of subscriber growth given their relatively recent launch and strong interest and ability to pay For the Rest of World comprising of more than smaller countries weve deliberately taken a conservative stance We estimated the NFLXs interest and GDP by discounting the global average by to account for the uncertainty in the quality availability and relevance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content for such a diverse set of countries This assumption may be too conservative as there are a number of developed countries in the group such as Belgium Sweden Austria and Norway that could provide substantial growth As this model draws its conclusions from some fairly abstract data a few words of caution are warranted Assessing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>interest based on Google Trends data of popular content is at best an approximation The data set is small presented only in relative terms and the use of English search queries likely underrepresents other geographies GDP per capita as a measure of a countrys ability to pay ignores cultural and competitive dynamics Certain countries may be wealthy but not willing pay for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for other reasons GDP per capita measures average wealth and underestimates the purchasing power of broadband users This means developing countries likely have a greater number of potential subscribers than their low per capita GDP numbers suggest The estimated adoption rate for is based on observed trends in Netflixs initial international rollout Those countries generally had weak domestic offerings andor favorable market conditions NFLXs adoption in upcoming countries could be slower A large and growing broadband base in conjunction with the global interest in streaming content suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a substantial opportunity ahead In the US after more than years of operating history and intense competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to gain subscribers With the full international rollout minus China complete ahead of schedule in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has opened up a number of new markets especially in Asia In total our model expects US penetration of broadband subscribers and international penetration leading to an estimated million total subscribers by This subscriber growth will not happen automatically of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still has to demonstrate relevance in Asia and less developed markets Navigating Chinas stringent regulatory environment will be challenging Content wise it must continue to improve its offering especially in the face of fierce and wellfunded competitors such as HBO NYSE TWX Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and various local operators All that said the road to may prove to be Netflixs golden years Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote
