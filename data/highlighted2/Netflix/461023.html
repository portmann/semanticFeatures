Netflixs pending price hikes have the potential to alter subscriber patterns In addition to straightup cancellations the hikes may also spur consolidations of accounts into higherstream Premium subscriptions Such consolidation may appear like an adverse subscriber reaction But in fact the per stream cost would be going down which would leave room to recoup the revenue losses through further hikes If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers do surprise to the downside but revenue declines are proportionately less investors should buy any resulting dip As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX prepares to announce its second quarter earnings after close today general expectations are for a typical second quarter lower growth than in other quarters but still generally positive trends This may not be correct this time around There is some potential for a downside surprise on subscriber numbers in the US But if such a surprise happens it will likely be deceptive an apparent weakening of Netflixs customer appeal that is actually not happening Such a showing might produce an opportunity for investors to buy in on a dip in the stock Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had only one streaming plan when it first launched its Internet video offering it has since upgraded that to three separate tiers of streaming plans Basic Standard and Premium Basic offers one stream at a time Standard Definition only for Standard is for two streams in SD or HD Premium is for four streams in SDHDUHD What is today the a month plan is actually not the old a month plan That plan the Standard plan now costs However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>allowed longtime customers to continue to access the Standard plan for what was once the Standard price but is now the Basic price for new customers But this savings was a grandfathering scheme not a generally applicable discount You couldnt use it to buy Basic for or Premium for It only applied to the plan customers had at the time prices went up And when prices went up there werent three separate plans available The Basic plan wasnt even available yet it was created the same day the price hike was announced at the old price and the Premium plan was already and wasnt increased so people on those plans got no discounts Customers also lost the grandfathering if they changed plans This means that everyone who is facing a price hike in the coming months is on a Standard plan When the price hike was announced <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had around million domestic subscribers Today it has million so at least million subscribers are already paying the higher rates Some estimates also have as many as another million subscribers having already left their grandfathered plans but even that estimate has more than half of Netflixs US customer base facing a price increase Broadly speaking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>customers are commonly seen as having two options put up with the increase or cancel Most analysts are expecting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will see some churn but that it will be more than outweighed by the revenue gains The ballpark for cancellations is around spread over the remainder of this year Figure about hikeinduced cancellations in the current quarter since they didnt even start until midMay The company is guiding to net additions in US subscribers notwithstanding the cancellations Analysts are divided on that figure however But even the skeptical analysts are I think skeptical for the wrong reasons Basically they think more people will cancel than expected taking door number two instead of door number one But that ignores the fact that customers actually have a third option Instead of keeping their Standard plan or cancelling it they can upgrade to the Premium plan That has obvious implications for revenue but actually it has implications for subscriber count as well Those who upgrade to the Premium plan from the Standard get two benefits First they can watch UltraHigh Definition where it is available Second they move from two streams to four At a month that comes to per stream Meanwhile the Standard plan which had cost per stream at the grandfathered rate now costs per stream In other words for just more a month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers on the old Standard plan can get two more streams and UHD content to boot This can be either a positive or a negative for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Positive side first Some subscribers may choose to upgrade to the fourstream plan solely to get access to the UHD content While anyone still on a grandfathered plan obviously wasnt willing to pay a month to upgrade hiking the price by also means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has cut the upgrade cost in half so maybe some more will take the plunge now That would be an unqualified positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as its revenue per subscriber per month would go up by instead of But there is also a potential downside With the price hike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is also increasing the incentives for account sharing Since the Premium plan has twice as many streams available as the Standard plan it is conceivable that two Standard accounts could be consolidated into one Premium account actually reducing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>revenue from for those two accounts to Unlike straight up cancellations this wouldnt necessarily show up in a consumer survey These subscribers would still be keeping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>just changing how they structure their relationship with it Account sharing is already possible of course and financially speaking already desirable since two Standard plans are already more expensive than one Premium plan But just as the price change may cause some customers to take a fresh look at upgrading to a UHD plan it may also cause other customers to take a fresh look at the idea of partnering with a neighbor roommate cousin coworker sibling or any one of those million domestic subscribers Because Netflixs new pricing structure has the potential to alter how customers approach getting access to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content subscriber counts may be affected more than a straight up cancellation analysis would suggest If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>sees two Standard accounts consolidated into one Premium account its revenue from those two accounts will only drop But its subscriber count would drop So even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>surprises to the downside with its subscriber account this evening the significance of that wont be apparent without checking the revenue number more closely If revenue per account jumps more than expected that will be a strong indicator that some of those cancellations are actually consolidations Those consolidations would in turn offer potential further revenue increases in the future As I said the cost per stream on the Premium plan is actually lower than even the cost per stream on the old grandfathered Standard plan even though the quality of the streams is higher If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does see a lot of consolidation over the remainder of as it phases out grandfathering it may well be able to raise the Premium plan price to or even in the future putting the per stream cost at or above the old per stream cost and putting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>itself on a pricing par with HBO While market sentiment about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has often closely tracked subscriber count following earnings releases that may no longer be the most accurate indicator of Netflixs customer engagement and earning potential If there is a downside surprise on subscribers this evening and that surprise prompts a selloff I recommend buying the dip Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position
