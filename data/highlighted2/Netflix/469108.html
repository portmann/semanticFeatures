Questions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>And Their Investors Should Ask <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Netflixs simple ungrandfathering plan may have had the biggest impact on their Q results causing a huge drop in value While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>maintains strong growth the industry is becoming more competitive with an ambiguous future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX got hit hard after reporting Q results and is still down doubledigits The slowdown in membership growth was the leading cause for the selloff However now that the storm has passed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and their investors need to take a look at the industry and what Netflixs future in it looks like Here are four questions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and their investors should ask <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>revolutionized Pay TV dominating the space and wiping out the old school Blockbuster model But people tend to see opportunity in others success which is what happened with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>We all know that Amazon NASDAQ AMZN has created their own streaming service but that is far from the only threat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>faces Devices created by Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGL NASDAQ GOOG Roku etc have opened up viewers to many different streaming apps which arent just cheap but free and isnt that the way of the millennial generation I think the biggest threat that faces all Pay TV services arent each other but the same threat music faced free The hardware technology already exists for consumers to steal copyright content and stream almost any movie show or even live event for free Its difficult to predict how much of an effect illegal streaming will have on the future of the industry due to a variety of factors But in a worst case scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and other Pay TV services could face an ugly fate Now there is the possibility that I am completely wrong and more and more people wont start stealing content or it will become highly restricted If that is the case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still going to face increased competition from some heavy hitters Hulu Amazon HBO Showtime etc are all direct competitors now This is not something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has had to face until recently It is not just about buying old content anymore but about creating new content This is not necessarily a bad thing as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has gained original movie and TV show content however it does signal the evolution of Pay TV service which shows it is becoming very competitive with strong established players No matter how you look at it the Pay TV space is becoming increasingly competitive and the once disrupter is becoming disrupted How Successful Will Their Pricing Strategy Be As an industry becomes more competitive pricing strategy usually becomes more competitive Pay TV should be no exception to this rule <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may only be raising their costs a buck or two but it wasnt received so well by their customers Their rollout plan to ungrandfather their customers so they can raise their prices might seem like it will simply grow their top line in the short term but could cost them valuable customers over the long term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is facing stronger competition now than they ever had before and raising prices has motivated their existing customers to exit and a possible move to their competitors One of Netflixs competitors Amazon is known for suppressing prices to maintain strong growth and squeeze out their competition Competition is heating up and analysts are expecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to maintain a strong growth rate While small price increases may seem harmless to the customer and profitable to the company it is a daring time to begin making changes to their pricing strategy that will cost all their customers more money for the same services <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to make sure they have the right pricing strategy that balances and suits their business development and profitability goals At per share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>beat Wall Streets earnings estimates by Their revenue of billion missed estimates of billion which is a miss of about Looking at those numbers head on most investors wouldnt complain and certainly would not panic like they did So then why did they It was because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>forecasted global membership increase at million and only came in at million That was the blow that really shook investors and caused a selloff And to make matters slightly worse <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>actually hit their gross additions target but lost members when the media reported their plans to ungrandfather their tenured members As we know losing existing customers is always the bigger and costlier threat So was the selloff an overreaction Depends on how you look at it On the one hand the dollars were good but the underwhelming number of members was highly disappointing The fact that some of their customers dropped off makes their future bleaker as it can suggest a significant slowdown along their top line On the other hand Netflixs plan to ungrandfather customers may ultimately be worth it if the increased revenue from it exceeds the sales lost Its simply too early to tell how bad Q was for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but Wall Street doesnt respond well to uncertainty which makes it bad for their stock Below you can see the slowdown in membership growth for Q Is It Time To Focus On The Bottom Line <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has consistently shown profitability however their margins are thin Their operating margin for the trailing twelve months is an underwhelming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>typically hasnt had to worry about their earnings too much as Wall Streets main focus has been on top line growth Nevertheless they are not turning positive free cash flow and while they have room to add more debt onto their balance sheet they probably wont want to Stockholders equity is only billion which is small given the companys billion market cap Their liquidity is fair but not very strong which could signal a sign of more debt to come unless they start producing more cash flow While I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a few questions to ask themselves investors should also take note and ask themselves whether their stock is under or overvalued Trading at times earnings and times sales seems pricey given the competition and slowdown in customer growth However a year growth rate is enough to keep growth investors motivated I believe the decline weve seen in Netflixs price this year is probably warranted The stock was previously trading at more than times sales at the end of which is a heavy premium to pay given the increasingly competitive landscape of the industry Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
