style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is down after hours following a lackluster Q report Shares are being hammered by slowing subscriber growth as video streaming competition supposedly continues to mount Competition in the space is fierce but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has competitive advantages This article is my nd installment in a segment called Buy on the Drop where I choose a stock that recently experienced a large decrease in price and give a recommendation on whether investors should Buy on the Drop or not This is a recurring segment so if you enjoy the article Follow me to see more You can read about my previous installment discussing Biogen NASDAQ BIIB here Most of you reading this article likely already know the details of Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX Q report and the subsequent price drop but I will provide a quick summary of events to get everyone up to speed Shares in NFLX are down after hours as I write this on the heels of an underwhelming report that seemed to validate fears of slowing growth at the company The drop continues the trend of NFLX flying all over the radar as this year price chart shows It appears that every time shares take a nosedive they always pop right back up again Will recent history repeat itself or is this time different for NFLX Lets take a look at that report On the surface Netflixs second quarter appeared fine if not solid with EPS of beating consensus analyst estimates and revenue of billion in line with estimates But a further look will reveal the source of investor disappointment subscriber additions or lack thereof <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>said in its Q report that it had expected to add million subscribers in Q which made actual additions of million fairly underwhelming For its part <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>partially blamed higher than expected churn which the company said was caused by its announcement during the quarter that longtime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>members would be ungrandfathered from previous price increases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>said users likely misinterpreted that announcement as a price hike and cancelled subscriptions I do believe that this was a factor in Netflixs subscriber miss but is it the whole story How much of a factor is competition from other video streaming services on Netflixs performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt think competition had much impact and in the Q report stated Our view is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and other streaming services are all growing primarily against linear TV hours and that competition did not contribute materially to our miss in Q Provided in the report is a chart from Sandvine SVC a network equipment company which seems to corroborate this claim Netflixs share of internet traffic has remained mostly steady seemingly indicating that competition isnt exactly a pressing issue for the company It may not be completely measurable yet but the story told by this graphic is not entirely accurate Competition is affecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>not in revenue or market share but rather in the cash flow department The company again recorded negative free cash flow primarily due to the capital requirements of Netflixs original series and films which require cash upfront as opposed to licensing deals The substantial capital and resources <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has poured into original content has allowed it to maintain modest subscriber growth and to continue to generate robust revenue growth After all lost in all the mania over subscriber numbers US revenue and international revenue were up and yearoveryear respectively However Netflixs cash burn rate is not improving and the company is dedicating a big portion of its resources towards creating original content If you read the bullet points you might remember I recommended buying on the drop What gives with all this negativity Well have no fear that ends right now From here on out its all positive and theres plenty to discuss Firstly for those focused on subscriber growth fears I would point towards Netflixs forecasted Q additions which indicate a rebound from the lackluster Q figures The company expects to add k US subscribers and million international subscribers in the third quarter much better than one might expect after subscriber growth fears were supposedly validated Add in the fact that Q is a seasonallyweak quarter for subscriber additions and the fears seem overblown But if youre still worried about Qs big subscriber miss and whether it indicates a peaking of new additions here is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>refuting claims that competition was the cause for the miss First increased competition would show up mostly in soft gross additions rather than churn Second we experienced a similar uptick in churn in early April in Canada where there has been no recent increase in SVOD competition but where ungrandfathering is also underway In regards to the first point recall from earlier in the article that the primary catalyst for the subscriber miss was churn caused by ungrandfathering and not from softer than expected gross additions which were in line with company forecasts This implies that the subscriber miss was caused by the unforeseen churn which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>said was coincident with press coverage of its ungrandfathering Seems like a legitimate reason to me If this is the case then the stagnant subscriber growth in Q would seem to be explained by ungrandfathering a shortterm headwind as opposed to competition which would be a much more worrisome issue In addition I think the ungrandfathering effect was taken into account by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for Q which led to the relatively underwhelming expected gross subscriber additions for the quarter of million well below analyst consensus of million The discrepancy here is likely due to a combination of the previously unaccounted for increased churn caused by the ungrandfathering effect and unrealistically high expectations from analysts Was the stocks valuation propped up by those unrealistically high expectations Did the stock deserve to fall by not meeting those expectations Well get into that a little later To sum up the discussion of subscriber additions it is my opinion that the ungrandfathering of tenured <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers caused unexpected churn which precipitated the substantial subscriber miss Q was an anomaly that should not be taken as a legitimate indicator of Netflixs future Q will also be affected by ungrandfathering but the shortterm pain of lower subscriber additions will be well worth the longterm revenue gains <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is reaping from the ungrandfathering process The second issue I would like to address is that of free cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported million in FCF in Q and laid out reasoning to back up the poor results Our capital requirements continue to be driven by our investment in original content particularly programming that we produce which requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content Original content provides <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with many benefits new programming that debuts on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>exclusivity greater creative and business control global rights and brand halo These merits outweigh the timing of cash payments Do you agree Do the benefits of original programming outweigh the negative free cash flow that has become commonplace on Netflixs statement of cash flows Considering my bullish sentiment you might have guessed my opinion on the matter Yes the capital requirements of Netflixs original programming pale in comparison to the benefits it produces for the company First as I stated earlier original content has allowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to maintain its leading position in video streaming despite intense competition from numerous other such services Burning cash to remain the top player in a market that is very much still up for grabs is a small price to pay Second and more importantly Netflixs original programming is what sets it apart from other streaming services and is what will fuel the companys longterm success in the crowded video streaming market The time will come when the market becomes saturated and the different services will indeed be competing intensely among each other for limited customers When this occurs content will be king In my opinion it will soon get to the point where the programming currently included cable packages will be available across most streaming services and the only other significant decision point for consumers will be the original programming for each service In that department <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the clear winner as it has shown a willingness to spend big bucks on original content that has been both criticallyacclaimed and popular In that way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is ahead of the game because management knows that the future of streaming services is original content and it has been the only streaming company so far to show full commitment in that area go check the wikipedia pages for original programming by each of the large streaming services From an investor standpoint I have no problem with the negative free cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has plenty of cash billion and low interest rates will be around for the foreseeable future so selling debt to raise cash will not present any financial difficulty And if cash burn is the price to pay to set up future success count me a believer I have discussed weak subscriber additions and negative free cash flow and have provided reasons why I dont believe Netflixs longterm growth or business fundamentals have been put at risk by any data contained within the companys second quarter earnings report How about valuation This is always tricky with NFLX because there is no bar we can utilize to measure video streaming companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is essentially the first successful one Including the afterhours selloff NFLXs market capitalization is approximately billion with a PE above So what does this tell us Pretty much nothing if you ask me Traditional valuation techniques will do no good with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>just like it will do no good with stocks like Tesla Motors NASDAQ TSLA So what do investors have to go on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will likely record somewhere near billion in revenue and EPS for fullyear very rough estimates For growing companies the top line is a better indicator than the bottom line or cash flow and in that regard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has demonstrated impressive revenue growth despite a perceived increase in competition And in one area in particular I emphatically agree with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management the video streaming market is still very far away from even approaching saturation The market that video streaming is undercutting is still worth hundreds of billions of dollars and it is all there for the taking with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as the major beneficiary as the clear leader Forget using quantitative metrics to value NFLX shares If youre shorting NFLX because it has a high PE ratio or because its valuation is absurd then youre bound to get burned because youre missing the forest for the trees Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock is overvalued according to standard valuation metrics but stocks dont trade on valuation metrics They trade on future expectations Short NFLX if you think the company is destined to get overtaken by competitors because in almost any other scenario NFLX shares will come out more valuable than they are today The market has spoken video streaming is the new norm There is no debate Either you think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will dominate the space and end up on top or you think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not the future leader of video streaming As far as Im concerned any other argument is missing the big picture And from what Ive seen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is and will continue to be the video streaming king I rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a Strong Buy on the drop If you want to stay up to date on my articles you can Follow me by going
