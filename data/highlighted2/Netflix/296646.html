unanswered Shares have become even more overvalued as NFLX rose after earnings After the Q earnings release and conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX remains in the Danger Zone and we are sticking with our Dangerous rating We consider the focus on international subscriber growth as a purposeful distraction from a failing business and dangerously overvalued stock Per our Q Preview Report four major challenges to Netflixs business model remain unanswered The trend since of content cost growth exceeding revenue growth remains in tact In streaming content obligations rose slower than revenues at However since when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>began significantly ramping up its content library obligations have grown by compounded annually while revenues have only grown by compounded annually Longterm the amount <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>owes on its content is outpacing the revenue the company derives from said content International contribution margins continue to deteriorate and are not likely to get positive in the near future The international margin in was compared to in The companys focus on growth in unprofitable markets is a red flag Management guided investors to expect profits from the international segment in Some analysts predict it will take more like five or six years Either way it is a long way off and we are not sure it will ever materialize Domestic subscriber growth is hitting a wall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>added million US subscribers in Q below expectations of million and well below the Q additions of million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>management stated Our high penetration in the US seems to be making net additions harder than in the past <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to burn cash at a high rate and will have to raise capital in or early We first highlighted this problem in October but noted that as long as investment banks can profit from a capital raise analyst ratings will remain positive on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The stark reality is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is expanding into unprofitable areas facing significant competition at home and abroad burning through cash and resorting to accounting tricks to prop up reported earnings While the house of cards continues to stand another day when it comes crashing down it could do so violently Weve previously pointed out just how overvalued <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is by quantifying how many subscribers the company would need to justify its current valuation To best illustrate the expectations baked into NFLX we looked at two scenarios as seen in Figure Scenario If we assume <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can maintain its current pricing structure and its current margins the company must grow NOPAT by compounded annually for years to justify its current price of share In this scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would generate over trillion in profit which at current subscription prices implies the companys user base will be billion Scenario Even if we assume <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can double its subscription price and double its current profit margin the company must grow profits by compounded annually for the next years to justify its current share price In this scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would be generating billion in revenue in years With double its current subscription price this scenario implies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will grow its subscriber base to nearly billion or compounded annually over the next years No matter how you measure it one thing is clear NFLX is beyond overvalued In fact the day after earnings NFLX had fallen upwards of from its Tuesday highs before ending the session flat Could investors be realizing the overvaluation EPS Not As Good As They Appear Artificial Boost From Tax Reserve At first glance the EPS beat would look impressive and it certainly helped push shares upwards of in afterhours trading However this EPS beat was artificially boosted by the release of million or share in benefits from tax accruals This million is counted in net income despite being a noncore source of profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>used a similar trick in Q when it included million or share in net income from the same release in benefit from tax accruals Using such reserves allows companies to create income when fundamentals are unable to support the growth story any longer </div></body></html>
