by SA Editor Mohit Manghnani The market has double standards In this market beauty is only growth deep Anything more substantive than that anything that represents value quickly takes on the appearance of being worthless said Cramer The stocks that were punished in afterhours trading on Tuesday due to slowing growth were Apple NASDAQ AAPL Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT IBM NYSE IBM and United Technologies NYSE UTX United Technologies was once considered a blue chip stock and Cramer was convinced nothing could go wrong as the company did well in every segment In the last earnings every segment disappointed The guide down led to a sharp decline IBM also fell as it is in a transition phase of moving to being a growth stock from a value stock The company is moving into cloud big data and artificial intelligence at a strong pace The legacy business however is falling in revenue for quarters and the company is spending a lot of money in buying back stock Cramer is of the opinion that the money could be put to better use by making smart acquisitions in cloud and big data that can propel IBMs growth The companys largest shareholder Warren Buffett likes buy backs and management which means value and not growth The most watched stock Apple fell in afterhours trading after reporting earnings The company beat earnings and revenue but investors expect iPhone sales to slow after a guide down It is interesting that investors are worried about slow growth and are not seeing the value as Apple now trades at times earnings Any stock that is related to Apple was also moving down Tug of war I say own it dont trade it the stocks too cheap to sell but be ready for some downgrades based on a M iPhone shortfall said Cramer Similarly Microsoft that saw a decline in legacy business A lot of it pertained to currency though The Nokia writeoff was bigger than expected and the companys business is still linked to PCs Chipotle NYSE CMG CMGB fell on the headline number weakness but went back up after the company explained Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO also went down on earnings even as the cash generation from sale of Alibaba NYSE BABA was ignored GoPro NASDAQ GPRO went up then went down on Apples earnings then went up again as the company said the future numbers have got nothing to do with Apple The Fed is getting closer towards tightening with interest rate hikes and hence Cramer decided to discuss stocks that could benefit a portfolio in that scenario The money center bank stocks should be bought in a rising interest rate environment Two key metrics for judging bank stocks are net interest margin and trading revenue Cramer gave his list of stocks based on the above metrics to be held as the interest rate moves up JPMorgan NYSE JPM has a diverse business model and a strong balance sheet The companys mortgage business is declining but the investment banking business is getting stronger The stock is not cheap after the recent run but it deserves a premium for being strong Goldman Sachs NYSE GS This is the worlds number merchant banker for mergers and acquisitions and hence a lot of mergers benefit the bank The stock is up in the last months so Cramer advised staying away from it Bank of America NYSE BAC The company reported an earnings beat last quarter with the net interest margin rising and a decline in litigation costs Cramer thinks the stock is still cheap Wells Fargo NYSE WFC Cramer said this is the highest quality bank name in the group and it has become expensive The bank also has the highest growth potential and pays a yield Morgan Stanley NYSE MS This bank had the best quarter amongst all others but had also run ahead of the quarter Its more focused on wealth management business but its trading business is also doing well Cramer thinks its ok to hold the stock if you want to buy an investment bank Citigroup NYSE C By any valuation metric Citigroup is the cheapest and the most compelling name in the group The stock is trading at less than times next year earnings What do we learn from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has one of the greatest growth stories and has been the leader in the SP this year Lots of investors missed the rally as the stock is up from its lows in The puzzling thing for me is that even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was one of the most obvious stories out there with a beloved product that represents one of the greatest bargains of all time somehow tons of investors convinced themselves not to own this amazing stock said Cramer He highlighted two reasons for investors missing the rally Firstly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can never be valued on traditional metrics If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is valued at earnings it is trading at times earnings which is insane That is why subscriber growth is an important metric to value the company The company has been investing in the business for the long term which makes it wrong to value it on earnings The company had mentioned years ago that they expect to hit M subscribers by They did much better and got M subscribers and yet the stock was bet against by many Secondly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should not be a quarter by quarter performance game As long as consumers love the product and the company keeps producing good original content its fine The company is expanding internationally at a strong pace and has huge Japanese expansion coming this quarter where every new TV in Japan will have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>button The management has been keeping their word and performing flawlessly After the sell off the retail sector bounced back the hardest Cramer decided to look at the technical charts of retail stocks with the help of technician Bob Lang Lang said that Market Vectors Retail ETF NYSEARCA RTH has bounced back harder after declining last month However as much as Lang likes the retail group in general he still thinks you need to be selective in order to pick the biggest winners said Cramer The resistance level of was tested in RTH and it held well It has now become the floor of support The Chaikin Money Flow indicator has moved to positive territory from negative and the last time that happened the RTH went up by The chart of Nordstrom NYSE JWN has been making higher highs and lower lows One month back the stocks day moving average went below the day moving average making a death cross which leads to a sell off In this case the stock went higher The RSI is going higher Restoration Hardware NYSE RH hit a new high of last Friday The charts indicate a higher move to soon The Tiffany NYSE TIF chart showed a big gap in June that led to a consolidation Lang thinks that the consolidation is about to end As the high quality oil stocks are fighting for their lives Cramer is shocked to see the stocks going lower than at a time when oil was in the s Consider the case of Whiting Petroleum NYSE WLL which acquired Kodiak Oil and Gas for B and it became the largest producer in North Dakota The company inherited B of Kodiaks debt which forced it to go for a secondary offering at Oil was trading at then and the stock went up to Now when the oil price is the companys stock has fallen to This made Cramer realize that the price of oil or interest rates have nothing to do with the stock price The only reason this could have happened is if investors expect the oil price to go lower and the hedge funds have been liquidating their positions Aetna NYSE AET I think youre in great shape with Aetna Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT Arms dealers are the biggest winners from deals like the one with Iran Novartis NYSE NVS It isnt growing as fast as other companies Its a good company but Cramer doesnt recommend a buy Jim Cramers Action Alerts PLUS Check out
