The management has been keeping their word and performing flawlessly.After the sell off, the retail sector bounced back the hardest.Cramer decided to look at the technical charts of retail stocks with the help of technician Bob Lang.Lang said that Market Vectors Retail ETF (NYSEARCA: RTH ) has bounced back harder after declining 4% last month."However, as much as Lang likes the retail group in general, he still thinks you need to be selective in order to pick the biggest winners," said Cramer.The resistance level of $77 was tested in RTH and it held well.It has now become the floor of support.The Chaikin Money Flow indicator has moved to positive territory from negative and the last time that happened, the RTH went up by 10%.The chart of Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ) has been making higher highs and lower lows.One month back, the stock's 50-day moving average went below the 200-day moving average making a 'death cross', which leads to a sell off.In this case, the stock went higher.The RSI is going higher.Restoration Hardware (NYSE: RH ) hit a new high of $104 last Friday.The charts indicate a higher move to $115-120 soon.The Tiffany (NYSE: TIF ) chart showed a big gap in June that led to a consolidation.Lang thinks that the consolidation is about to end.As the high quality oil stocks are fighting for their lives, Cramer is shocked to see the stocks going lower than at a time when oil was in the $40s.Consider the case of Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: WLL ), which acquired Kodiak Oil and Gas for $3.8B, and it became the largest producer in North Dakota.The company inherited $2B of Kodiak's debt, which forced it to go for a secondary offering at $30.Oil was trading at $47 then and the stock went up to $37.Now, when the oil price is $50, the company's stock has fallen to $25.This made Cramer realize that the price of oil or interest rates have nothing to do with the stock price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The only reason this could have happened is if investors expect the oil price to go lower; and the hedge funds have been liquidating their positions.
