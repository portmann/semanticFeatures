stocks especially ones as volatile as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is no easy task Longdated slightly out of the money put options provide the asymmetric payout needed to mitigate the imbalances of being outright short stock My choice is the NFLX January strike puts Investors can lose of capital invested when purchasing options Only invest what can be lost entirely Earlier this week I published Why Im Short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>pointing out some red flags in the companys financial statements and my rationale for why I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is extraordinarily overvalued and a prime short candidate User comments on my article spanned from the bulls telling me good luck and that I must like losing money to the bears saying I was spot on but they had tried and failed shorting a stock that could rip by in a few months I responded by saying I owned the NFLX January strike puts that gave me an asymmetric payout with very low decay A few asked why exactly I was doing this and how I decided to structure my options trade so heres my quick explanation Anytime I take a short position in a stock I never actually short the underlying An investor who is short stock has an asymmetric return profile that works against them stocks can theoretically spike to infinity but can only fall to zero The October price spike in Volkswagen shares is a beautiful example of this Market participants assumed a certain float was available to them to short VOW Porsche unveiled an option position that meant they owned the majority of VOW float outstanding leading to one of the largest short squeezes in history Market participants who were outright short the stock were forced to cover at outrageous prices wrecking some hedge funds Had those same funds owned longerdated puts they would have never been forced to cover in that upward onslaught and would have had the luxury of waiting for the market to cool down which it eventually did a month later The downside to owning puts is that an investor bleeds premium every day he is long the option This is called theta bleed Keep in mind with options one can lose every penny invested especially with out of the money contracts Approaching expiry the premium paid erodes at a faster and faster rate every day all else equal The hope as an investor is to recoup the premium paid and then some in the form of intrinsic value the difference between strike and the stock price if it is below strike in the case of put options I also have the intention of trading out of my options position if the trade goes in my favor to a certain extent I have no intention of holding the trade to expiry so I hope to profit from a movement both in the stock price lower adding to intrinsic value plus some degree of remaining option premium at the time I decide to unwind the trade I only invest what Im comfortable with losing entirely For me I will invest between BPS and of the portfolio I am managing Many times I will divide the trade in thirds so that I can double down and a triple down on the trade so BPS BPS BPS for a max exposure of That way if my downside scenario pans out Ive made in the case of the strike puts on my money and have a portfolio position The max amount to dedicate to a trade is up to the risk tolerances of each investor but I advise determining that well ahead of time to prevent trading with emotions Time to expiry for my style trades looking to take advantage of longer term mispricing requires me to find options with the lowest decay possible That is why I choose the longest contracts I can get my hands on They give you the longest amount of time to profit to the downside and also have the lowest daily decay rate theta bleed Below are NFLX strike options across the term structure through time to expiry and the associated theta bleed of a one contract position Note that theta bleed is only a day for January expiries versus shorterterm contracts at more than a day Of course theres no free lunch in that the price you must pay for the longerdated options is much higher meaning you cant control as many shares for the same dollar invested in longer contracts The strike price of an options trade depends on your outlook for the underlying stock In my case I am very bearish <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I have a price target or a x EVEBITDA multiple So I do not want to cap my downside by using a put spread buying one near money option and selling a farther out of the money one I want to simply own a put that will give me the largest upside to my target price I do not however want to buy a lottery ticket The farther out of the money one goes the cheaper the option and the larger the potential payout but that also comes with a higher probability of losing the entire investment Below are the potential payouts assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>hits my price target What I also like to do is put my strike selection in the context of the prior price movements over the same term to expiry For example the January expiries have days remaining Moving back in time days gets you to Of course past performance doesnt indicate future results but I find it helpful to see historical movements of the stock The graph below shows Netflixs price performance from onward Ive highlighted the strike of my selection the strikes in white and that contracts breakeven price of Im not a huge fan of breakeven analysis because I rarely hold options to expiry but Ive put it on there since many look at this metric I chose this strike because there is a decent probability it is in the money given that it is relatively close to spot price at the moment or of the stock price but will also payout a decent return in the event the stock reaches my price target The most important component to option pricing is the implied volatility of the option It is an excellent way to compare options to determine relative value and compare relative richnesscheapness though time It is also incredibly important to check to make sure one is not paying too much for an option Currently the NFLX January strike puts are offered at implied vol Compare that to the SPX index NYSEARCA SPY strikes at a volatility More than double the volatility but that is common for a single name stock especially one as volatile as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Note that we are considerably off the lows in implied volatility but that was when Netflixs stock was trading in the s and investors werent buying options to bet to the downside on the stock The good thing is we are roughly at the median implied volatility for the past five years in this particular contract As a general rule in equities I would consider a vol and lower to be relatively low a vol to be high but not incredibly expensive and a vol and higher to be very expensive Given the decay an outright long options investor faces he must have a viable exit strategy for the trade The first and foremost component to my strategy is not investing too much of my portfolio in the options to begin with hence my max exposure rule The second component to that is to sell half of the option contracts if Im up on the trade that way Im taking the cost out of the option This helps mitigate the decay I have seen situations where I was up or more quickly only to hold it and watch the stock reverse slightly and the premium decay away to nothing After taking cost out of the trade use discretion as to when to unwind the balance I usually let the balance of the position ride unless I believe something fundamental has changed or the option is extraordinarily well bid Shorting any stock especially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not an easy task Put options provide the asymmetric payout needed to mitigate some of the risks associated with shorting stocks outright Longerdated slightly out of the money options provide the best way to capture downside with minimal decay in my opinion We only use your
