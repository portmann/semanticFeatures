Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article International losses quite reasonable considering expansion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX continues to be one of the most polarizing stocks in the market With the companys Q investor letter the bulls celebrated international growth while the bears discussed the usual concerns With shares well off their yearly high thanks to recent market weakness the most recent report gives investors multiple reasons to stay positive When it comes to US streaming the Q report didnt really change anything Total sub growth is slowing while the segment is becoming more profitable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>already has a large subscriber base so its reasonable to expect smaller sub gains One of my predictions was that wed see less than five million domestic streaming sub adds and I feel confident in that However the more important story can be seen in the two charts below showing quarterly revenues and contribution margin divided by the end of period paid subscribers figure Since Q of the revenue per sub quarterly figure has risen by This is mainly due to newer subs coming in at higher rates plus the success of higher price plans like the UltraHD plan discussed in the investor letter This figure will continue to rise this year as price grandfathering on the HD plan ends While this will cause slightly higher churn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will benefit from moving subs up the price ladder More importantly the company has dramatically improved the profitability of this segment in recent years Contribution margin per sub has risen by over since Q For those that question rising content costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to improve the bottom line in the US streaming segment and management reiterated its target for contribution margins in this segment by In Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was at up basis points in the past year International losses seem very reasonable One part of the bear case is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to rack up sizable losses internationally While that is true it is due to the aggressive expansion plan currently underway If you want subs to grow you have to add new markets Below Ive pasted the international streaming table from the Q investor letter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>launched in countries on January th making the service available to tens of millions more potential subscribers Given such large expansion Im actually surprised that the company only guided to a million sequential decline in contribution profits an increase in losses The contribution margin percentage actually is forecast to rise sequentially showing the strength of current markets Bears talk about increased losses but this is how the business works Think about these new markets that were recently entered in early January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will realize almost a full quarter of expenses in these areas while operating but the companys free month trial means less than months of revenues are technically recognized This process will smooth out throughout Look at where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is as a whole The company guided to a profit in Q despite increasing its international losses to expand into many new markets Once those losses mitigate profitability will start to take off Heres where analysts estimates currently stand for the next couple of years I understand that Qs cash burn of million was not pretty This figure has accelerated in recent quarters because original content requires more upfront payments It is these original shows that have helped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>grow in recent years and they will be a major part of the companys future success The company ended Q with about billion in cash and equivalents versus billion in debt Management says it will raise funds later this year or early next year Another debt issuance could come even earlier than that if interest rates decline and management thinks it can get a good deal Whats the big deal though if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to add another billion of debt Were talking about a company that has a market cap of around billion and thats with shares more than off their highs At billion in debt Netflixs balance sheet would still be in fairly decent shape Also even at a interest rate were only talking about million in extra interest expenses per year Thats nothing for a company currently increasing revenues by about billion per year expected to total about billion in Another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>quarter is in the books and the bear camp is back again with its criticisms While I used to be part of this group I realized that the company isnt in as bad of shape as some make it seem The company still hasnt gone bankrupt the DVD business is still doing well and US subscribers are still growing at a decent rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be a big part of future television and movies so even at a billion market cap there is still room for this stock to grow Authors note All chartstables in this article were taken or derived
