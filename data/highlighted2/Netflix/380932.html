States but regardless of the membership services popularity is it right for you This guide will explore the benefits of Amazon Prime and discuss potential downsides to help you decide whether to drop for an annual membership One of the number one benefits offered to Amazon Prime members is the free day shipping option Now that free standard shipping only comes to regular Amazon customers for orders over it used to be the Prime shipping is a huge benefit especially if you order from Amazon multiple times per year In fact say you place an order with Amazon once per month If you have to pay for shipping each time and sometimes want to upgrade it to day shipping then the amount you pay for shipping over the course of the year might be higher than the cost of a Prime membership This calculation alone would make Amazon Prime worth it for some folks but if youre still on the fence then read on Did you know that there are over titles for Prime members to explore through the Kindle Owners Lending Library Although youre limited to one free book rental per month this benefit can still save bookworms an average of on books they would have otherwise purchased on Amazon over the course of months Whether you enjoy a good adventure story or you want to catch up on the years trending memoirs there are so many options available to Amazon Prime members through the Lending Library However one downside is that this benefit is only available if you own a Kindle or Amazon Fire tablet or phone If youre only using the Kindle app on a different device you will not have access to these free books Sure you may not get access to the million songs and albums that month streaming programs like Apple Music or Spotify boast about but Amazon still offers over million songs through its Prime Music streaming service You can stream songs and albums from thousands of different artists including wellknown performers like Adele and Sam Hunt The best part is you dont have to pay a dime extra because the music streaming is already included in the annual cost of an Amazon Prime membership Amazon has nearly movies available for rent or purchase in its online marketplace As a Prime member you have free access to over movie titles as well as several thousand TV shows for free streaming Your Prime membership also gives you access to exclusive television series created by Amazon such as its Golden Globewinning series Mozart in the Jungle One downside to the Amazon Video service is that some major movies and TV shows are not offered for free to Prime members which means you probably wont want to ditch the Hulu or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>accounts just yet If youre a fan of browsing Amazons Lightning Deals section then you might be able to save a bit more money as a Prime member with special discounts on items as well as Prime Early Access Deals Yet another exclusive Prime member benefit is the Prime Pantry This program lets you order a box of household items snacks beverages and vitamins then have it delivered to your door within four days for the low cost of If you have a valid edu address and have never tried Amazon Prime before then you could get a free month trial through the Amazon Student program You basically get access to the same benefits as regular Prime members including the free day shipping option and music and TV streaming Youll also receive updates and discount offers on schoolrelated supplies such as electronics backpacks textbooks and more After six months either your membership will expire or you have the option of extending it for a year for half the price of a regular Prime account If you shop on Amazons marketplace more than times per year then most likely a Amazon Prime membership will be more than worth the cost The free day shipping alone convinces many people to sign up but the added benefits of free music TV and movie streaming as well as special Primeonly deals and the Kindle Owners Lending
