from the site Submitted by Michael Lebowitz via Globalcom The acronym FANG represents what has seemingly become the most popular investment strategy of the last few months FANG constitutes stocks Facebook Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Google These companies are the markets darlings for good reason since June they are up on average whereas the SP is flat over the same period Before you rush to buy these gems we thought it would be helpful to review some basic fundamental data in order to clarify exactly what investors are assuming when they purchase these stocks The analysis in the table below reflects the change in revenue profit margin or income required for these companies to have the same price to earnings PE as the SP The data highlighted in blue represents the revenue margin or net income required to bring each PE to the market average of The data in yellow highlights the percentage change required to bring each PE to the market average Facebook Revenues were up yearoveryear in the most recent month period but growth is slowing as garnering additional market share becomes increasingly difficult While deeper market share penetration can certainly be aided with mergers and acquisitions revenue expectations are tremendous One has to seriously question the ability of how what is essentially an advertising company can generate such growth in what is an extremely competitive and trendy industry Amazon The table above shows that Amazon would need to see an astronomical increase in revenue to better justify its valuation However one must consider that margins are likely to increase in the future If we make the huge assumption that they can improve their margins to be similar to those of Walmart Amazon would then still need to almost triple revenue to become fairly valued versus the SP Increasing their profit margin to likely comes at the cost of losing market share thusrevenue Increasing margins in a commoditized business like Amazons highlight the significant challenges Amazon would have to overcome in order to normalize its PE ratio At current margins revenue and income normalization to the SP is virtually impossible <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to achieve over revenue growth in order to harmonize its PE with that of the SP The large bulk of Netflixs revenue comes from the monthly subscription fee of To put the required revenue growth to normalize their PE into perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would need to add million new customers and hold on to them for at least year They currently have million customers As a point of comparison there are approximately million US households Google In comparison to the other companies Google is by far the most reasonably priced relative to the PE of the SP Its current PE at is almost double the market but Googles growth rate is x that of the markets Google is expanding well beyond the search engineadvertising business to create new revenue and income sources While still overvalued in our opinion it is clearly not at the eyewatering levels of the other three Even though we believe it will be the right call when the market finally comes to its senses we do not have the iron stomach required to recommend shorting these stocks We do however recommend you go FANGless and let other investors find a greater fool to whom they can sell Not unless all the worlds compulsive degenerate gamblers and swindlers all had a moment of clarity at the same time Tue coinhead Just because teh FANG stocks are overpriced overhyped bubbly nonsense doesnt mean theres not a lot of great tekk out there Hardware and software noncorporate and for your taking Tue adr No wonder Zuckerfuck is selling off his shares Imagine what happens when the tax bill for ten billion comes due and your company is worth ZERO Tue Angel_Eyes Check this legitimate ways

hold in my k or should I just wait for the fucking bottom to drop out Tue NoDebt You should open a MyRA USTs all the way baby Guaranteed no loss of principle and a healthy yield Tue DeadFred Miners are cheap you do take the risk that they go insolvent and become the chattel of their lender which is almost always JPM who strangely enough is helping them go broke They all wont go broke though Tue Dr Engali Tue DeadFred Id say you could roast a couple bankers over the campfire but think of how much cocaine residue they must have in them Tue adr Amazon would need to be the entire consumer economy in the USA to get to that point But yes keep sending that stock to the moon Wall StreetMaybe they could start selling health care ILL TAKE THAT HEART TRANSPLANT PLEASE DO I GET FREE SHIPPING IF IM A PRIME MEMBER Of course selling products isnt what Amazon is all about As the leading money laundering operation for the CIA global humandrugweapon ring they are safe Tue DeadFred If you look at what FANG do for a living you can see why GOV may be buying their stocks They will control your social interactions your buying and selling your entertainment and your information flow These might be things a totally hypothetical NWO would be interested in controlling Ive often commented that the idea of printing money to buy stocks is a great way to nationalize an economy But why would THEY be interested in Bed Bath and Beyond when they could concentrate on the FANGs Of course Im just paranoid Tue BiPolarFrenchman Do you have a link to an articlesource for the Amazon as smugglerlaunderer Not trying to call you out Im genuinely interested Tue Open_outcry Ridiculous to look at stock price of FANG on DCF or ROE basis Its all about revenue growth with FANG When revenue growth rate slows that will be time to short them Tue besnook the amazing thing about amzn is it doesnt make sense at a third of its current value it makes sense around its fn retail afterall Tue ronin Amazon is much more complex than this simplistic table would have you believe AWS is B annual revenue growing at annually and has net margins AWS dominates the space The retail business is growing a year The retail business does not make money yet The biggest cost by far to the retail business is transportation costs as the fulfillment network expands and AMZN gets closer to the customer the transportation costs will get driven down Also unlike F or N the company has B in actual tangible assets you know inventory PPE etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the biggest dog in the group in my opinion as they have a ton of off balance sheet liabilities for content development and they missed their US growth targets last quarter Tue besnook nflx is a dog too but trying to rationalize amzns valuation is ridiculous by any metric it is still retail and data storage will not save it any prudent valuation put it at about only because it still is growing and dominates internet retail
