class='textDiv'>If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Pulls A LinkedIn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Prior to Netflixs earnings I wrote an article speculating about a GoPro style collapse if investors realize the potential problems with Netflixs international expansion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported strong earnings but immediately tumbled the day after the release In this article I issue caution to investors who think of current market weakness as a buying opportunity especially after LinkedIns postearnings reaction My last article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX was published right before the company reported its Q earnings report In that article I outlined problems with Netflixs ongoing international expansion In particular I pointed out the inferiority of its EU product and how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue to struggle to streamline its localized versions Another Seeking Alpha author has recently highlighted the massive requirements that will likely cause the company to raise capital either through bonds or an equity offering The main point of my previous article was that investors would come to the mediumterm realization that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is offering a commodity service that will ultimately be only one of many Its skyhigh valuation is based on the assumption of a swift international expansion that will lead it into dominance over competitors that are still figuring out their strategy eg Hulu In this article I give a postearnings update and reflect on the weakness of technology stocks we saw last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported strong earnings M domestic net subscribers were added versus a consensus estimate of just over M More importantly over M international subscribers were also added Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has primarily been judged on its subscriber expansion in the past years the slight revenue miss was negligible with regard to the general positive judgment on their results Yet the stock collapsed spectacularly after soaring over in afterhours trading <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has lost almost a quarter of its market capitalization since reporting strong earnings trading down from around to in the first week of February While my preearnings short thesis looks good with regard to the actual outcome I dont think I was really right about how things would unfold In this article I correct my short hypothesis with regard to recent events namely LinkedIns NYSE LNKD collapse LinkedIn reported Q results last Thursday While its revenues came in over the consensus estimate LinkedIn management lowered its guidance by roughly The reaction on Friday was absolutely brutal LinkedIn shares fell by and dragged down the whole sector with it I knew you were about to say that Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not LinkedIn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is currently dominating the online streaming business LinkedIn is dominating the online recruiting business but growth has slowed down whereas Netflixs growth has not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported strong earnings but nonetheless got crushed with the overall equity market which seemingly has become unforgiving towards highmultiple tech stocks Some like a Piper Jaffray analyst find that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is an attractive buy again at current levels I attribute this to mental anchoring In a bull market buying the dip pretty much always works so any share price is viewed relatively to the most recent alltime high <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is off almost from its late highs The problem is that it is still comically overvalued by any sensible metric current PE is So the truly interesting question is how bad can it get from here onward This is where my LinkedIn comparison comes in As long as the growth story continues high multiple tech stocks can be fine if there is GAAPprofit to go with the growth Facebook NASDAQ FB is fine and will continue to be fine LinkedIn shows how a beginning bear market reacts when the music stops playing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still has an intact growth story even though it is burning money to finance its expansion Nevertheless the stock is down The next quarterly earnings report is a few months away and the market might recover a bit I just want to take the time to imagine what happens to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>when it reports some actual bad news <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will not do a GoPro NASDAQ GPRO because people realize its product is one of many commodity platforms of streaming content The much more imminent danger is that any real bad news cause a LinkedInlike deflation which would send shares way below Lets consider one of my favorite charts of alltime It is Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT share price over the past years If you are a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shareholder and are asking yourself whether you should continue holding your shares with the hopes of the company reclaiming its late highs this chart summarizes my view It took Microsoft years to grow into its predotcom crash valuation I expect something similar with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The company has a strong product that will continue to grow It might however take the better part of a decade to grow into its late valuation and justify it with profits Until then tough times might be ahead If you are playing the longgame hedge hedge hedge Otherwise you might see a LinkedInstyle compression when subscriber growth stumbles I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
