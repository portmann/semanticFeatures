other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article The socalled FANG stocks were market leaders and beaters in as investors bid up anything that could deliver outsized growth in a tepid global economy Market leadership rarely translates from one year to the next and some of the FANG stocks are vulnerable given their runups in and current valuations Two of these stocks are still investable and two are vulnerable to significant pullbacks in My analysis of the FANG stocks for is highlighted below was dominated by the socalled FANG Facebook NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL stocks as they were some of the few largecap stocks that provided outsized returns in Out of the largest stocks by market capitalization almost twothirds were down or more from their week highs as we closed out the year Given the rocky start so far to that number has probably grown The FANG Index benefited from investors bidding up growth to extreme levels in and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was the best performer within the SP in the just closed year This made some sense as there was a dearth of names that delivered robust growth in what was the most anemic world economy since to last year However market leadership rarely carries over from one year to another As such some of these former highflyers could be extremely vulnerable in So which of the FANG stocks make sense to continue to hold in and which should be discarded in the New Year Here is my take I still cannot embrace paying north of times forward earnings for either Amazon or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Their profits margins are extremely thin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is projected to make just a quarter a share in profits in FY Both companies also need to continue to invest on a grand scale to grow their businesses by adding distribution centers for Amazon and video content for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Eventually the music will stop and investors at some point will no longer paying these skyhigh multiples for either stock Facebook and Google now Alphabet look much more reasonable Both dominate their respective industries with Google owning some twothirds of the domestic search market and Facebook being the dominant force in social media Both are also benefiting by the continuing migration of ad dollars from traditional venues like television and radio to digital media especially mobile and video Facebook does look somewhat pricey at times forward earnings to begin However keep in mind the shares went for times forward earnings to begin and the stock posted a strong year In addition Facebook is just touching the surface of the potential in its video offers Revenues should see another year of to increase in FY Alphabet is my favorite play currently of the FANG stocks The shares do go for times forward earnings which is slightly more than the times forward earnings they commenced However the company has made a couple of key changes in that should unlock further shareholder value The company brought in a new and experienced CFO from Morgan Stanley NYSE MS into the firm this year which has imposed some adult supervision to what has also been a startup culture The changes she has already made have created shareholder value and will continue to do so in the future She helped lead the charge to split off Googles more speculative businesses into separate companies for greater transparency In addition the new CFO has gotten expenses under control In the last reported quarter expenses grew nine percent year over year down from in the same period the prior year Starting in the New Year the company will start to break out revenues from the main parts of the company This should create shareholder value and a greater multiple for the stock just as it did when Amazon started to break out the contribution from its Web Services division this year Googles YouTube ownership is a very undervalued asset Only Facebook has more than the billion active users that YouTube can claim This compares favorably to the million subscribers that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>currently sports YouTube is also seeing faster growth than both FB and NFLX noting earlier this year that viewing time had increased year over year while mobile viewership had doubled YouTube brings in some of Googles overall revenue which is approaching billion this fiscal year That number could grow to of overall revenue five years if the company can double the revenue per YouTube user over that time frame which seems eminently possible given how fast advertising dollars are migrating to digital channels especially video Think about this YouTube is producing nearly billion in revenue more than billion more than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which has a market capitalization of billion Assigning a peruser value along the lines of Twitter NYSE TWTR which seems conservative to YouTube puts a billion value on this part of the companys business or about of Alphabets overall market capitalization Not bad given YouTube was purchased for less than billion nine years ago Alphabet will also be a major player whenever the world eventually transitions to driverless cars of which there was a good piece on MarketWatch this morning on the coming paradigm shift Finally the company operates the fourth largest data services operation in the world It recently assigned a company director with extensive cloud experience to build out its web services offerings and it could eventually become a major player in this fast growing space ala Amazon or Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Given all of this it is hard not to like Alphabets longterm future and it is worth paying a slight premium for that longterm growth Given the multiples of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon the shares look downright cheap and it is the only FANG stock I currently own However if we do get a significant dip in the market and Facebook drops below a share I will probably establish a small position in that FANG stock as well </div></body></html>
