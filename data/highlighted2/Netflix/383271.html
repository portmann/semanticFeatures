class='textDiv'>Market Rallies Despite Doha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>And IBM Disappoint Bezeks Daily Briefing Seeking Alpha The Dow pushed past for the first time since last summer Having fended off the oil threat the market now has to deal with earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and IBM both traded poorly afterhours Monday showing that it isnt all roses for this earnings season Monday was a surprising day Sunday night it appeared that markets were going to start the week off with a dive Futures were down and oil was off as much as But Monday rolled around and the negativity gave way to a change in opinion After opening lower stocks moved to flat within the first hour By the end of the session the Dow NYSEARCA DIA had squeezed out a tripledigit gain to close just above the mark The bull market may be a bit rusty but dont count this train out just yet The SP NYSEARCA SPY put in a similarly strong point gain to close just shy of It last closed above that mark in December Were getting back to near record territory The SP s alltime high of sits just away The Dow sits points also from its alltime high Given the power in Mondays reversal its natural to ask whether markets will power up to new highs later this month That oil news should have given bears some juice but it simply wasnt happening The earthquake in Japan appeared likely to cause Yen NYSEARCA FXY strength that would weaken the carry trade and hurt stocks The Aussie Dollar NYSEARCA FXA sold off Sunday in part due to this But it didnt stick either The Brazilian political drama led to a selloff in Brazilian shares NYSEARCA EWZ as speculators took the good news as a selling opportunity That too didnt faze the broader market More and more signs are pointing to new highs In retrospect I wish I had stuck to my we go directly to new highs call I offered at But over the past month a confluence of bearish factors had me doubting whether the rally had enough force to make it to the promised land Regardless price action rules the day and the bulls are in charge Theres just one thing left with a good chance of stopping the market short of new highs and thats earnings Though were still early in earnings season so far things havent been as bad as expected Consensus estimates have been for a really bad set of numbers So while results have been fairly poor the rate of beats has been high enough to avoid market trouble If you set the bar low enough youll still get plenty of companies that clear it That said things could change quickly on the earnings front This week almost of the SP reports Well have a good sense of where earnings are by Friday And if Mondays new information is any guide things might not be so great IBM NYSE IBM got hit for about a decline in the afterhours session Monday This despite a large headline EPS beat for Big Blue Apparently the positive number was driven by a large tax credit and shouldnt be viewed as representative Under the surface the numbers were less encouraging Revenues did beat expectations but this was a weak number Revenues were still down despite topping consensus Without currency effects revenues would have shown a decline so the blame for this isnt mostly on the strong US Dollar NYSEARCA UUP IBMs strategic reporting line which houses the cloud segment was up doubledigits while most other segments declined This as you might expect led to a big drop in overall operating margins Still its clear things arent going in the right direction for the firm and its an early warning for the broader tech sector <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX shares got pounded in the afterhours session falling about to move back below This will leave a mark If the stock stays down here today it will make for six weeks of gains being wiped out in a day In the broader picture that level is starting to look like a formative top For those that argue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is wildly overvalued a move under in coming weeks would certainly support their argument that the stock is in for a good drubbing In any case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>moved down with ample reason Subscriber numbers were quite disappointing Numbers were below what people were hoping for though they appeared to beat the official consensus estimate And subscriber guidance was very soft compared to expectations for the current quarter The international rollout does appear to have a few issues This is to be expected as there are many logistical challenges related to pricing nonEnglish content and local competition that dont arise in the companys home market You probably dont come to the Briefing for an indepth discussion of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>business prospects so Ill stick to the main point Whats coming up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock Well one quarter doesnt make a trend by itself Unless you pull a LinkedIn NYSE LNKD and drop an atomic stinker of a quarter the market will usually forgive a growth company one disappointment But future reruns of this will rapidly take the luster off the companys shares US subscriber growth has slowed and doesnt have enough momentum to justify the companys earnings multiple The international expansion needs to work in a big way Trading at x sales several hundred times earnings and x EVEBITDA it would take a large drop in the stock price for this to make sense on a normal valuation pattern The market is pricing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as though international expansion will be a massive success and this quarter is a warning sign that all may not be well From my vantage point its too early to declare peak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but if I were long with gains Id be cautious and have a stop loss ready I wouldnt hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a longterm investment The riskreward isnt right Upside isnt that great and downside is large And the odds of the downside scenario playing out appear to be above even money That said the market tends to be forgiving of this sort of thing if youre speculating the stock is still okay to own if the company shows stronger international growth next quarter I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article </div></body></html>
