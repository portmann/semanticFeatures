editor Rocco Pendola and I discuss whether dividends portend an end to growth for their issuers What should Seeking Alpha be tracking in the dividends income world Leave a comment to let us know Or better yet submit an article of your own Last week Seeking Alphas editorial team was in Manhattan for our annual summit While there technology editor Rocco Pendola and I got to talking about ideas for this issue of the Digest because frankly my well was dry and I needed some inspiration Rocco was candid in noting that he uses Seeking Alphas DGI community as a model and inspiration for how he would like to see our platforms tech section evolve Its tight knit and the exchange of ideas flows unmatched on the financial web From veteran contributors to new authors frequent commenters to new SA users and everybody in between investors share strategies track portfolios and best of all challenge one another critically and aggressively yet constructively and professionally Within that context we thought it would be great to stimulate our communitys collective mind by exploring perspectives on how DGIers approach tech stocks Specifically how do investors particularly those hyperfocused on incomedependent growth make calls on tech stocks such as Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL doh I mean Alphabet and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Do they have to cross the Rubicon into Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and more recently Apple NASDAQ AAPL territory to even get a look On the flip side some investors contend that tech companies in particular enter lessexciting nongrowth phases when they begin paying dividends andor buying back stock But at that point what does the company become Mature Value Dead money Rocco and I figured these questions make for an exceptional starting point for a lively debate in the DI community and I know you all are good for it To get this party started heres a little QA we put together where I grill Rocco on his tech sensibilities and elicit his thoughts on which of todays growth companies might be the potential dividend payers of tomorrow Robyn Conti Well lets start with the obvious in your opinion what happens to a socalled growth company when management decides to pay a dividend and begins using excess cash for capital returns to shareholders versus investing in the business Rocco Pendola While I can see both sides of this argument its really companyspecific In some situations its truly the case that management sees the writing on the wall and realizes it needs to provide additional incentive for investors to want to own its stock I think thats what happened at Apple And frankly through that prism its a pretty terrifying proposition RP It all comes down to psychology from an investor standpoint within the tech community and inside the company that is thinking about or ends up paying a dividend or buying back stock We argued about this psychology with respect to Apple for at least a year on Seeking Alpha Consider what I wrote on SA in If you want dividends you should have been building positions over time in dividendpaying blue chip stocks AAPL is not a dividendpaying blue chip stock It is an innovative hypergrowth machine in perpetual startup mode that needs to stay that way or die I honestly think Apple executives view the situation in that regard Why in the world should we pay a dividend Its not in our culture It does nothing for everyday shareholders and it only makes the already rich thanks to Apple richer As an AAPL bull I hope Tim Cook and the Apple board does not give in So I was wrong But I would argue the same point today Almost exactly four years later And I think the pace of innovation at Apple or lack thereof supports my position Thats not to say the stock isnt a fantastic position for dividend investors which is one contradiction from what I said in its just that the psychological impact of the capital return plan doesnt bode well for company culture even if on a subconscious level And I firmly believe that this seemingly subtle erosion of culture this implied pullback on startup mode plays a meaningful role in thwarting growth at the company and return on investment for shareholders RC Im wondering aloud here and I hope theyll share their thoughts in the comments but I wonder what some of our dyedinthewool DGI evangelists I mean that in the most positive sense would have to say to that Like David Van Knapp whos known around here as the godfather of DGI and whos consistent in his philosophy of not deviating from your process and Regarded Solutions whos really exceptional at tuning out market noise and whose numberone priority no matter what is preserving and growing his dividend income stream Obviously I dont expect you to speak for them but maybe you can speak to them and to the community at large about your thoughts on amassing positions in blue chips vs these tech dynamos It sounds kind of like youre on the same page as the DGI crowd which I have to say is a little surprising because Id take you for a growth guy every time RP Heres the thing I have such great respect for so many of our DI authors I cant possibly name them all And I dont have their discipline Its not in my DNA Im the kind of investor mostly to my detriment who cant resist a stock such as Pandora NYSE P when it hits a certain point So Ill buy some and write covered calls against it Thats a bit of an income strategy but Im sure guys like Van Knapp and Regarded would scoff at that And rightfully so Because what they do doesnt work if you fudge every once in a while Its even worse if you deviate and see some success because it makes it more likely that youll have triggered this false confidence that leads you to deviate from the plan again So I get it But Im all about not being married to one perspective I like to explore them all and even support multiple often competing perspectives at the same time I find thats the best way for me to learn as an individual as well as the best way for me to provide value as a writer So in that spirit and I know some DIfocused investors do this is there room within the framework for investing in companies that dont pay a dividend but are too attractive to pass up from a growth and potential outsized return standpoint Or look at this way and Im sure Eli Inkrot as one example could do killer work analyzing this can you speculate more responsibly if you will In other words instead of buying Pandora because you think you know how the stock trades and selling calls can be relatively lucrative do you take a more focused approach and accumulate positions in companies with few weaknesses the antiPandora in many ways that have a good chance of eventually paying a dividend So as the speculation about a potential dividend populates Seeking Alpha youre buying Google every month or something I wonder if an investor would be better off having purchased Apple when the dividend conjecture heated up or once the company made the official announcement that it would pay a dividend I dont know the answer to that question but it would be interesting to find out RC Do you think Google er Alphabet will ever pay a dividend Do you think they should RP Ill give two answers here Because you asked two questions And if I give two answers I wont be wrong Plus this is really just my perspective which again is more useful than a prediction This might sound funny to a lot of people but I have walked through Googles massive office in Manhattan And sort of like you can feel the energy on the streets of New York City with people milling in and out of bars at two in the morning you can feel that vibrant Google attitude And the Google attitude doesnt exude Lets do what Apple did and pay a dividend because everybody seemingly wants us to Id like to think Google has more Steve Jobs left in it than Apple does And that it respects the notion many investors consider too lofty abstract and impractical the notion that the messages you send with respect to how you use your cash impacts company culture That said Google hired a new CFO who practically everybody thinks is there to be the adult in the room in relation to Googles cash So if this assessment is correct theyll pay the dividend And while I dont agree with it on this somewhat theoretical level I like to operate from I see the point The more pragmatic crowd says Whats the big deal Like Apple Google has more cash than it could ever possibly spend or need Why not give some of it back to the shareholders Or take out cheap debt to get the job done And thats certainly a perspective I can respect and appreciate RC Are there other tech growthoriented companies that may be ripe to pay a dividend in the future I know youre a market watcher in general too so are there growth companies in other spaces that you think might be potential candidates to pay dividends going forward RP I really have no idea I do think its interesting however to consider managements attitude on other things as an indicator of whether or not they might pay a dividend Obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is in absolutely no position to pay a dividend right now and probably wont be for quite a while if ever but Reed Hastings and his CFO David Wells strike me as guys who would never pay a dividend They have resisted so many ways to amping up Netflixs revenue basically to preserve the integrity of their service For example they could have started doing ads a long time ago But they havent And I respect that I can extrapolate that out to say they want to preserve the integrity of their startup culture by not paying a dividend providing copious amounts of stock options to their employees and delivering massive returns for their shareholders I mean do you think longtime NFLX investors are upset that theres no dividend Myriad examples exist like this Can you see Jeff Bezos ever paying a dividend at Amazon Again it sounds laughable now but in our lifetime theres a chance Amazon has a balance sheet as solid as Apples or Googles Not to be morbid but to tell it as I see it Bezos would have to go the way of Jobs for Amazon to start paying a dividend That said because I like to take various perspectives consider Facebook NASDAQ FB It could become the modern day General Electric NYSE GE in that you dont work for Facebook forever owning their stock and reinvesting their dividends but the company is such a part of your everyday life youre so invested in it so to speak that it functions like GE for longterm investors You know a double in the stock price over a fiveyear period alongside an attractive dividend yield Now its your turn to weigh in Do you believe dividends signal the end of a companys growth phase Are dividends likely not a part of Alphabets DNA In your opinion which growth companies if any might be ripe to pay dividends in the nearish future And one more thing If you
