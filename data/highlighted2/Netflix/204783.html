Wells CFO Joining me today from the company is Reed Hastings our CEO and Ted Sarandos our Chief Content Officer Interviewing us today will be Peter Kafka of Recode and Mark Mahaney of RBC Now today we will be making forwardlooking statements so actual results may vary Thanks David First question has to do with domestic streaming market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Sub numbers for the second September quarter in a row came in light you talked about involuntary churn Could you give a little bit more color around the source of that sub add weakness Is this a temporary problem and then just delay concerns that it could be due to greater increased competitive pressure or due to pushback against some of the recently disclosed price increases Sure I could take this one Mark I would say that in terms of additions they were pretty strong through the quarter in terms of flat yearoveryear In net additions they were down yearoveryear and that we explained and attributed to our involuntary churn or paymentsrelated churn We think partially that was due to the transition to the chip cards which is still ongoing And weve reflected that trend going forward into Q in our guidance We dont think though that it really affects our addressable market size of million to million I would say last year we had a little bit of concern at the same time when we overforecasted Q and we ended up in Q delivering up to million subscribers for that year Weve done about million to million for the last four years So I would say our thesis on the addressable market isnt really changed isnt changed And in terms of the involuntary churn weve been improving that Its better yearonyear but it has impacted at our levels even on a small basis basis points basis points So next Q Mark you could be sure that were definitely going to have low guidance in July So we think its just the summer part And then Reed youve added million net subs for the last four years in the US at some point you cant sustain that your level As you look forward to next year and what kind of keeps you in that million to million range so just address issues like your confidence that the marketplace will accept the price increases Is it that we should expect a greater amount of original content coming up to help keep that sub add level that million to million Just address how the consistency of that growth going forward When we look at the last couple of years where weve been last four years weve been about million net adds in the US and then accelerating number of new members internationally But restricting the comments to the US its fundamentally that internet TV is better than linear TV The consumers can watch when they want on what type of device they want and the content has just got better and better So the fundamental confidence about the large scale is because ondemand is a better experience than linear and the entire market is going to move from linear to ondemand internet television over the next to years In terms of the specific when we look at the shows that we have coming out next year that gives us a lot of confidence We have the Disney payone deal coming in the US in the third quarter Third fourth quarter next year Fourth quarter next year And so we got just a tremendous content coming in I am sure there is a lot of competitors but there always have been I mean weve competed against cable and satellite and weve competed against YouTube and all kinds of payperview and DVD So there is a lot of ways to consume entertainment And despite all of those <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>keeps growing because we keep improving So thats why we feel good about next year both domestic and especially international And then just a narrow point Mark on the pricing I mean we changed the price in the US last Q Q came in less than expected but then we delivered in Q and then substantially Q Q of this year with a higher price So I dont think you can ascribe that to a price for the US in terms of growth Hey guys I want to ask an international question But first can you just go back and explain a little more about the involuntary churn and what it was with the credit cards that caused people to be unable to pay Ive got the same account number what happens when my card type changes it prevents me from paying And what didnt you see that happened in Q Peter this is David Its not consistently the case that people dont have the same account number and some issuers are going to replace that number when they issue that And for us as a recurring merchant where we really want to reduce the friction of renewal and reduce the friction of having any sort of interaction where we have to update your payment method and present an opportunity not to do that it just means that there is more noise introduced into that And we think its a contributor Like I said its likely multifactor There may be other things going on here but certainly the transition to the chip cards is not helping and that has to be a factor in it And were only partially the way through so the US issuers are going to continue that in Q They were supposed to be done in October and theyre not Theyre about athird of the way through So well continue to see that in the US as we go along Thats why were attributing it to the misforecast which is quite modest because this is the most accurate forecast weve ever had on an overall basis to this slight change relative to our forecast in the involuntary churn And you said the international numbers came in where you expected but you didnt provide any color on sort of which territories are doing better or worse than others Are there surprises by territory that something do particularly well or particularly underperform Theyre all doing really well but some are bigger than others But for competitive reasons we dont give per country color So we are continuing to learn in every market and improving every market Every market is growing But some are doing better than others which you would expect and thats up to us to manage to get the total portfolio to be as fast growing as they are Its Mark again So Reed let me ask you one question and then Ted a question to you Reed I know in the last earnings call I think you cautioned people not to get too robust in the Japan launch And then also argued there or made the comment that Brazil was like a rocket ship So at least could you just update maybe a little commentary on those two markets Our survey work indicated that Brazil was in fact a rocket ship is that continuing And then Japan should we continue to be mellow in terms of modest in terms of the ramp up there Its clearly clearly undisciplined my no commentary on countries So if I said it was a rocket ship that has continued Brazil what were seeing is this with a tough economy a valuebased product like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>thats very inexpensive is really appreciated And so even though theres tight economic times currently that has not held back our growth And we were definitely pleased with the content and with the offering that we had And maybe Ted you can talk a little bit about the Japanese content offering Yes Id say even back to Brazil I mean one of the great upsides and this was our Global Original series Narcos The star of Narcos and the Director and Creator of Narcos are both Brazilian superstars So Brazil has received Narcos particularly well as its been wellreceived around the world In Japan I think whats been really great too is the local acceptance of our Global Originals So were seeing them perform as a percentage of watching about the same as they are in other territories which again defies conventional wisdom that Japan is primarily a local territory And we hedged a little bit too and had some local <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>original content in Japan including a show called Terrace House is doing particularly well too So I think its been a great success in being able to make shows for the globe and extend to places as diverse as Brazil and Japan And Narcos is really just such an incredible story because its twothirds in Spanish and that was a huge success for us around the world including France and Norway And so it really speaks a lot to our ability to connect the world to do amazing shows around the world that are great stories for everyone Ted on the original content launches as youre thinking about next year can you help us think about whether the original content launches as a whole are going to be as impactful less impactful or more or so than what were seeing in Well I can tell you that I would say as impactful I dont know if thatd be more or less But certainly as we continue to expand into second third and four seasons of our original shows what you see there is the franchise value grows dramatically So as this initiative is aging the desire to see the new seasons builds up more and more excitement And were not waiting for next year for that we have an amazing launch scheduled for Q In the Marvel Defender series were bringing out the second show Jessica Jones in Q as an example which I think is going to spark a lot more interest in the entire Daredevil run and the next one is coming up after that When we talked about the billion content budget for next year you said for sure it was going to have more impact On license content theres a lot of chatter about some of the studios networks pulling back for stuff theyre licensing to you folks You guys addressed that in your shareholder letter You said some content providers may choose to license to you some may not Have you seen evidence that people are actively steering content away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in particular The media business is absolutely influx As Reed said youve had this growing move away from linear and towards ondemand both watching and spending So the future of how the networks and studios deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant Video is certainly going to determine their future So there is a lot of caution And you see how volatile the market can be just with a turn of a phrase last quarter So I think whats happening is is that youre hearing a lot of chatter but you see in our earnings letter we detailed some major global television deals weve signed across the board with our suppliers You should keep in mind that those particular deals are big rocks to move with our suppliers Buying and selling global television is a brand new behavior to the industry So whatever youre seeing is more chatter but roughly business as usual But of course some caution caution thats been around since weve been licensing streaming content Peter the caution its SVOD wide So when you think about new content on Hulu I mean Hulu is even more of our cordcutters dream than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is because its got the network shows day after So you really want to read it A lot of the concern is about SVOD generally which is to be understood But Hulu is owned by three of the major networks James Murdoch at Fox said hell be working with you differently A show like Empire the biggest show last year is going to Hulu and not to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Are you seeing any of the Hulu studios in particular steer content away from you and towards Hulu Remember were buying show by show So what happens is happening on the show level not the supplier level As Reed said its particularly puzzling that considering that its much more disruptive to give commercial free options the day after broadcast and it is the year after broadcast And the thing to tease out here is lets say the Empire creators they get paid based upon how the show monetizes So the studio is under an obligation to monetize that as fully as they can So Hulu can outbid us as they did on Empire and thats fair game But they cant win it at half the bid because then the participants dont get paid the right amount Its Mark Let me ask two questions One on the Epix deal and one on some of the background to the price increase you just announced On the Epix deal maybe Ted could you comment on this So the decision to not renew it could you just kind of explain that Was that due to the economics that you thought were going to be part of the deal really didnt come through for you The cost per viewing hour is too high Was it that theres a broader movement at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>away from feature films Were there too many restrictions on a renewal Just kind of explain to us why that deal didnt get renewed So some of our core initiatives around our content are around exclusivity and accelerating windows and giving consumer access to content earlier and earlier so the pay TV window has been particularly out of step with consumer desire to watch content when they wanted And exclusivity obviously when we entered into our agreement with Epix we were kind of de facto exclusive and since then they dramatically expanded their cable distribution which is great for them They did a deal with Amazon They were about to do a deal with Hulu when our deal was coming up for renewal So what we said was that if we were going to do a nonexclusive deal for Epix that would put the content on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>several months after pay television and they are completely nonexclusive It wasnt a very strategic investment and therefore it would be very small relative to what we had been paying And so we agreed that were our strategic initiative and theirs were diverging and we just went our separate ways We do a great deal of business with Lions Gate Were continuing to expand our business Paramount and MGM around the world so this isnt a studio problem its just really was the Epix product was less and less in tune with what were doing at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>around exclusivity and windows acceleration And while the movies on Epix are quite good we found that there is more awareness on the original side and what were hoping for over this next two year as we launch so really incredible movies that are highly original and premier on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as well as in the movie theater simultaneously that we can do better putting the money into those kind of spectacles that we create more consumer desire and awareness through that vehicle than through this additional payone licensing And I think that some of the economics match the success of original program original series programming which is for the cost of production You have full exclusivity and global rights in perpetuity versus a very narrow window a year after its released in the theater in one territory So a billion of output spending versus a billion in for original spending and they turn out to the right strategy And then a followup question on the price increase So this is the second dollar price increase I think in about a month month timeframe How do you think about pricing going forwards Is this now the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>norm about once a year price increase I think longterm you believe youve got a lot of ARPU power Is there any change in thinking about whether thats due to tiering as opposed to just straight up price increases So Mark <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is for our standard def offering It was last year it was two years ago three years ago so yes it is due to the tiering And what were trying to do is spread out the tiers so that now weve got the standarddef but highdefinition and ultrahigh definition So think of it is related to putting in a good tiering mechanism as opposed to anything else and really <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is highly available And standarddef is DVD quality its not bad quality at all So that for DVD quality unlimited streaming video its an incredible value So a followup on that does that mean that we should expect those three price points to stay the same for the next three to five years Do you have the tiering that you want right now Were not making any prognostications about the future on the pricing but it is related to the value And the more that we have incredible value the more that we have amazing originals then over time were going to be able to ask consumers for more to be able to invest more And thats been the rhythm weve been on as we did the tearing and introduced that if you look at how much broader and bigger our content is now than two years ago I think we fairly delivered on that promise And I think its worth saying that consumers have acknowledged that I think that with the combination of grandfathering and the content additions that weve been able to make in the terms of the reactions I think people are acknowledging that there is real value being delivered through the service On the original content side for a couple of years you guys have been making your own shows and youve never acknowledged that any show was less than successful You never had to take a writedown As you start spending more on original content and as you make bigger individual bets on things like movies at what point do you think you will be able to tell or investor should be able to expect to hear from your performance of individual shows movies or any other kind of content that So Peter you should keep in mind that as our slate of original programming grows the diversity the size the scope the scale of those shows is different So when we say a show is successful its because relative to the investment its successful relative to how else we would have spent that money on licensing something else does this creation did it attract the audience that it was built for So the range of budgets is very broad The range of audiences we expect to bring to it are very broad So thats why weve been right in so far in terms of predicting the size of the audience for these shows Not that they dont all reach million subscribers Well weve not had content writedown so to your point So basically were saying is that were investing according to the size of the show And when weve been wrong theres been more upside than we had forecasted So we had got into our original programming very conservative in terms of our modeling relative to licensing and have found that its been much more impactful Peter probably the best way to externally tell is do we take on additional seasons of a show So some shows have been so successful that were moving on to season fours One show had a lot of growth it was great for what it was The season three was the final season And so you can say well therefore that was less successful and thats true But so far we havent had any show thats performed so weakly in season one that we havent taken it to season two Im sure there will be such a show eventually but thats probably the best indicator that you or an investor could use and it didnt really work for us Yes we didnt do more of it And in that case youd say it was relative to an eight season show it was less successful but in its own economics were was quite successful Recently Amazon just moved to block the sales of Apple and Google streaming devices with their competitive products Given your dependence on Amazons AWS are you rethinking that relationship Can you rethink that relationship AWS has been a great supplier to us They demonstrated again and again strong market leadership strong attentiveness to our account We could not be happier with AWS And theyve always kept that separate from Amazon retail So with Amazon retail weve had up and down issues for a couple of years we couldnt buy ads on IMDB things like that and that never spilled over to AWS Now we have a really good relationship with Amazon retail also But the important point to your question is they manage those separately and were very committed to AWS and are comfortable with that commitment Let me switchback over to international markets I think the overall sub numbers came in higher than expected and the guidance was a little bit higher than the Street at least expected But the mix of free subs was a little bit higher than I think most people had expected Do you have a decent read as to whether those free subs are converting like youve seen in other markets any particular reason that there is extra risk here because those subs may not convert as well And then in a fourth quarter I think your international revenue forecast implies like a trailing off in ARPU or pretty sharp sequential drop in ARPU is there a particular reason behind that Are you at specific price points in some of the newer markets that youre launching No Its the strong dollar Mark So there is a bit of a headwind there because of the strong dollar On the content side HBO one of your big competitor is moving into news A lot of that supposedly aimed at millennials theoretically your customers as well Is that something you guys would contemplate at all And then some more question for sports You guys have repeatedly said youre not interested in sports Are you willing to serve conceded that maybe you would be a little interested at some point down the road Well look on the news side I think we definitely are being more adventurous in terms of the genres that were going into Were getting ready to launch Chelsea Handlers talk show early next year thats our first move into talk Kind of aimed at the same kind of thing we have a weekly talk show where most of our things have been very long shelflike movies and television series So I think its a very kind of similar migration or certainly exploration And in sports I think were in the same place There is a lot of irrational bidders for sports Were not anxious to become another one So to translate that sounds like youre saying youre not likely to move into sports but news youre already interested in and may increase that appetite Yes were interested in being able to improve the viewing experience whatever kind of content people are watching So I think in sports sports ondemand is not as exciting as sports live where I think everything else that were doing that kind of freeze the viewers from the linear schedule in ways that they enjoy and more enjoy the programming then we could bring some value to that Well lets be clear on that room Whats the likelihood that we compete directly with VICE in the next two years All Amazon Roku Google Im missing somebody Apple all introduced new streaming boxes in last few weeks Are you seeing more usages and more growth from sort of dumb TVs with smart boxes or youre seeing more usage and growth from connect TVs that have the stuff baked in Theyre both growing They compete with each other So those categories are growing Its only really the game consoles that are not growing as fast for secular reasons the early on They were the only highconnected devices attached to the TV And now they are facing competition in share from smart TVs and from these attached devices David a balance sheet question for you I think in the letter you talk about looking to raise additional capital next year Do you think the next year will be the last year in which youll need to do that as you think about the plans for the next three to five years And then any additional color on what kind of capital or how you would raise that capital next year Well its largely unknown right I mean youre asking me three or four years out But I would say given our plans to expand content and given the fact that were on pace to use about billion this year and no indications that that would shrink next year we wanted to give some headway or some inside into the fact that we may be back in the market next year Weve done that on a regular sort of cadence of about once a year So there is no change from that But there is still some uncertainty in terms of the pipeline how much we would need exactly next year But I would say safe indications are that we will be back in the market in the next to months And then a success scenario where Ted is able to invest the originals as well in the future as he has in the past We would hope to be back because we want to be funding these incredible creative productions around the world So in a success scenario we would do a bunch more over the next five years And in terms of contribution margins maybe again David for you I think you reiterated your goal of getting to contribution margins in US by Are those European countries and some of that in Canada some of that earlier countries that you launched in Could you just talk about what the contribution margin has been like in those markets Has it been similar to what you did in the US over the last three years Well similar to the comment of Reed we dont give a specific Mark in commentary for competitive reasons But we have said and Ill reiterate that there is nothing structural that means we cant get equal or better margins outside the US that weve seen in the US And we gave you a data point on Canada that that had reached US margin About months ago we gave you a point on that So there is no reason that we couldnt do better Largely its determined competitively within that country or that region in terms of how well we do on the profit side Recently you guys agreed to sell subscriptions to Apple phone users via iOS in app purchases For years you didnt do that Are you paying the same tax that everyone else pays when someone gets an app subscription through Apple And then why make that change now after years of not doing that Its a great opportunity to expand So historically weve only been on the Apple TV and that on the iPhone And we dont comment specifically on the business terms So I cant directly answer your question But were really excited about the potential especially as we go global over the next yearandahalf to be able to serve all of the iPhone customers around the world So some higher motivation on our side to get access to that incredible iPhone customer base around the world If that does generate a lot of new subscriptions will we see the impact of that on you financials Will those come in significantly lower monthly revenue numbers No the revenue is the same You would see an increase in COGS to deal with the fees to Apple Thats where it would show up But its essentially the gross revenue the or that shows for us Curious what you guys think of new streaming offerings from Verizon and Comcast both what you think of them as actual content And what you think of the notion and broadband providers that you need to work with now competing with subscription or streaming services Were really big and everybody has got to get into streaming Its been our main message for several years that what is known as channels is going to become apps And that all of these providers need to have great apps on a phone on a tablet on a TV so its completely consistent with all of that And what we see is if we have great content then consumers watch our service and enjoy it and tell their friends about it And it kind of doesnt matter that there is also a great sports game on or there is also a shows on Verizon or on Comcast So part of the reason that we may seem a little blas is that it really hasnt affected us What has affected us is when we have great show like Narcos that just takes the world by storm So thats what were focused on how do we have more incredible shows Its early in the market They are great companies They will work on that But Im not going to critique them Theyre all they are in they are trying and thats a great thing Of course you seen Sony Vue youve seen the Dish sling product So people are really innovative which is great for consumers And not every product when it first comes out is great and theyll continue to work on them Ted we got a couple of series of emails about whether Star Wars is going to be available all the films on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>next year whats the answer Theyre all subject to negotiations Its up to Disney how they want to manage access to those assets before during or after the release of Star Wars So its certainly an ongoing discussion And assuming Star Wars launches theatrically this year then it would not come to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as part of the multiple speakers And then there was a new user interface launched on the site about four months ago and hoped that that would be kind of improved user retention satisfaction levels four months in any takeaways Super happy with it and were generating new improvements already improvements there improvements on mobile improvements on the TV So thinking a product group is just an amazing learning organization Its always pushing the balance and its steady improvement on all of those fronts Mark And its the aggregate of that which has us at so many viewing hours and so much customer satisfaction that weve been working at all of these improvements over the last seven years on streaming You guys changed your amortization schedule for your license content just like you had for originals you said its because youre seeing more viewing in the first month What does that mean are people does that mean people are less interested in the stuff than you thought overtime or theyre more interested than you thought Originally what does that tell us about viewing behavior Presumably Peter youre referring to that amortization change or the change in accounting estimate And no it doesnt You cant conclude that nor should you conclude that from the change What were saying is there is more viewing in the first month not necessarily less viewing over the lifetime it just moved up a little bit And it could be that we view that at so much good content over the last few years that its become you have to make a good choice right Youve got good choices youre choosing So it could be that the merchandising system is concentrating a little bit of that when something comes in Regardless we try to be accurate in our accounting and we follow the trends regularly on a quarterly basis And this past quarter we noted some content that was trending up so we accelerated the amortization on that We wanted to be upfront even though its relatively small based if you look at it in comparison to the overall US content spend its relatively small Peter let me give you a little example it will help on this one Suppose we pay million dollars for a title for a four year license and we think its going to go million hours of viewing But the title is just incredibly popular and instead it does million hours But many of those hours are in the first month as supposed to spread over the four years Well then we would accelerate the amortization of that million dollars even though the whole thing is doing much better than we ever thought Its relative proportion overtime is more upfront So thats why we would front load that million dollars And generally whats happening are these things over performing or is there a mix where they sometimes are performing less well than you thought Its not about the total performance that gets us to change the amortization its the relative performance overtime And so if it performs a lot in the beginning relative to how it does at the end Thats what gets us to accelerate So your earlier question about writedowns is whats missing Youre not quite getting that lets see if a title under performed our estimate but was very backloaded then the right accounting would be to shift it out further as oppose to pull it up And so youre thinking of it in a writeup and writedown sense and thats not actually how it works The schedule is based upon how it does overtime relative to the license period Did that example help No no but in both cases youre saying look we have these things for so long that it always worked out That is why I was asking about the writedown part Youve never once reached a point where you missed entirely and you found something that no one wants over any more time Let me take that Peter because I think there has been a couple of questions on that We certainly license things that perform less well than we expected sometimes right There is a portfolio of content that were licensing We dont always get it right But in the case if something that doesnt perform as well as we expected were not a producer that has ultimate revenues like a production studio that has to write that down based on a lower expectation of revenue We have something available on our service in broadcaster accounting And in broadcasters if were deriving revenue over the life of that license period over the service it doesnt result in a writedown It just maybe an opportunity cost that we can license something better down the road Well and a good recent real world example is Longmire We just released the original fourth season of Longmire So season one two and three which weve licensed for several years on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>they were at the kind of tail end of their life actually exploded when Longmire season four launched So its very unique to the behavior like nothing actually performs like everything else So we are trying to do is make sure the amort matches the viewing patterns And its a good lead in to remind everyone that these are dynamic right Thats why we look at it every quarter because things change We see when something gets released like Longmire or we release the third season then the first season of that particular title may see a bump So its something that were constantly looking at On global rights deals Ted just a big picture as you see yourself is the company able to negotiate more and more of these content deals on a global rights basis Yes its definitely been the drive of myself and my team all year trying to move the sellers into a more of a global mode Remember they are mostly situated as regional sellers of content sometimes the rights are fragmented in their ownership But in the cases of the deals we did this past quarter they were controlled by one entity and typically solved by multiple regions and we corralled the deals into the corporate offices and were able to license the world on those titles Titles that we think will have great global appeal So I think the growth the opportunities the challenges of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are all global so that its having a lot of regional discussions around the world isnt that efficient And it turns out that tastes are rather global too So its actually really well lined up And then Ted or Reed when you think about the mix in international markets of local versus global content any general change in your thinking on what the optimum mix is and you find it that youre constantly toggling with depending on the market that youre in Its interesting like you said every time we launch in a new market we know more in that first hours of viewing than we did from a year of research And in terms of the move I think we went in expecting Japan to be much more local than it turned out to be Its more local than other territories but not as local as conventional wisdom would have had And it actually moves with a global desire for some of these large shows so that the local tastes are usually determined by what you have access to And if were growing the access to great content around the world people are moving or migrating to that kind of viewing So thats why were able to do local language originals our own global originals and then licensed content not just from Hollywood to the world but from the world to the rest of the world Another international question Can you guys give us any update on China either in terms of what youre thinking about in terms of timing or what your approach is going to be to a really regulated market there when you do show up We can tell you well were still learning a lot So nothing really specific our helpful except that were still in early stages And lot of you guys mentioned getting in new Pay TV Window for a specific movie The Big Short Are you negotiating those deals now on oneoff deals for individual movies or youre doing these for whole slates There were conversations directly with producers So a lot of times well if you can get to the rights before they get fragmented thats when you could do those deals So they tend to be more curated titlebytitle in that way Reed I think Ill just ask one last question directly to you When you think about the biggest challenges that you think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>faces over the next several years three to five years what do you think they are What do you focus most of your time on Well I would say the biggest challenge is our being the service that people want really feeling out more movies and more TV shows Were working so hard to have these great original productions and if we could have more Oranges and more Narcos I know Im putting a lot of pressure that would be really transformative Especially Ill bring up the Narcos weve got an example because it was filmed in Bogota Columbia The main company doing it it was a French company So its a very international production Brazilian cast And we have an incredible production Marseille which Ill give a little plug for thats in filming now And I think it will be a really great crossover around the world kind of crime drama family politics And the more we do these around the world obviously thats great in a local market in terms of establishing our bona fides and reputation with customers But its also great because there is something new something fresh And as long as were continuing to push the bounds on things like original movies or international productions then the consumers are really embracing David help us think through and its I guess one of same things I am sensing very strongly is just increasing appetite enthusiasm for original content From a PL perspective that billion next year in content spend theoretically if that was original content versus or the impact of that on margins as you mix shift more and more towards original content is that accretive to margins Well the good news for me as a forecaster is it does take Ted a little bit of time to actually produce these shows So anyway we get a little bit of lead time in terms of some visibility into the production So our targets at US margin already encapsulate this shift towards originals overtime I think we made some earlier comments about a longterm shift that could be upwards of of originals and we still anticipate being able to meet our margin targets and also shift towards originals Its going to bring more amortization in but we think we can do both And Ill use the word expansion So think of it as our license content is growing but our original content is growing faster There is a mix shift but I dont want that to get misunderstood as a reduction in license spending And remember between original films original cartoons animated shows for kids our original scripted series were releasing more original titles in Q than we released in entire second year of original programming So it is accelerating rather quickly and youre seeing it Reed you said for a while now the future of TV is apps and now Tim Cook is saying the same thing its now the conventional wisdom Do you think individual viewers or consumers want to pick and choose their own apps their own shows serving in a la carte world or do you think theres a role for someone who sort of bundle all the stuff back together Well that will be a really interesting question over the next couple of years Were going to work really hard to expand our movies and TV shows so quickly in such a compelling way that lots of the viewing for movies and TV shows is through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which is sort of what makes us want to focus so much on that area But I could imagine future bundles emerging Once there is a whole bunch of apps and as you go through this industry change now next probably three five years where there is a lot of discrete offerings everybody is improving their brand value And then you get to a maturing phase of the market and then there is some consolidation which could be acquisitions it could be other things or it could be bundles But the next couple years when you have this new phase of the market I think everyone is just racing to make a great app like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>like HBO Now those things This will be it Its a small one Youre seeing some folks sort of rebundle already right Hulu is showing Showtime together Would you be comfortable having <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bundle with another service We dont see a lot of take rate from our consumer side on the Hulu Showtime We think were better focused on just establishing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>brand Again at this phase in the market we think the real key is focus At some future time the bundling may be appropriate Of course well keep an eye and watch the Hulu Showtime take rate to see to confirm that there is very little traction of that So well be open minded But our instinct is focused on making <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the passion brand in this space And before we sign off we should remind everybody that Friday tomorrow is the premier of Beasts of No Nation on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and in selected theaters around the country Copyright policy All transcripts on this site are the copyright
