class='textDiv'>Two birds one stone for Disney Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>BTIG says The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha Apr ET By Jason Aycock SA News Editor Disney DIS has run into a bit of a hurdle in its succession plan after Mondays surprise news that COO and likely CEO candidate Tom Staggs was leaving his post Observers speculate that the board didnt see the creative strength in Staggs that the company would need in a replacement for chief executive Bob Iger planning to step down in two years The companys also faced down woes over its TV business both at broadcast net ABC as well as at ESPN BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield has the answer to both problems Disney should buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NFLX Then it gets a future leader with a creative streak in Netflixs visionary CEO Reed Hastings as well as a substantial established stake in ondemand video <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is already a great friend of Disney Greenfield says In fact Iger has repeatedly acknowledged how they are in part responsible for Netflixs success Disney continues to sell more and more content to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spanning movies and television series while at the same time struggling to get their own directtoconsumer content business off the ground in the UK But a deal would be huge Buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is an awfully expensive acquire but it could be Disneys only hope Disneys market cap is currently billion and its enterprise value is billion compared to Netflixs billion market cap and enterprise value This sounds very interesting and also possible but I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wouldnt want to be acquired by Disney They already have great leadership road maps and huge international expansion not too long ago and have visions far beyond we can tell Never going to happen Why would Disney buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for billion takeover premium when Netflixs only asset is investment in content streaming rights which is just billion and its cumulative marketing technology and GA costs for the last five years were billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a dumb pipe with rights to stream content Paying billion for these assets and historical investments would be a bad trade for Disney And Reed Hastings is definitely not worth the balance It seems Mr Greenfield doesnt understand basic economics and this is an example of the lunacy surrounding stocks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Reed Hastings not worth the balance Really He is the only guy who built his company from nothing while all the other copy cat mediocre streaming services are corporate sponsored Reed is an innovator and a great CEO CER I like Hastings too but to Fundamentals point you can be a great CEO and innovator and not be worth billion Thats quite a stash of money What would Apple have put Steves Jobs value at I wonder Remember they were under if I remember correctly when they rehired him Creating content and licensing content is expensive as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has discovered But building a streaming video service is getting easier every day Disney has no competitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a new competitor every damn day If DIS merged with NFLX it would benefit both today Tomorrow it would benefit only NFLX I have occasionally speculated on Seeking Alpha over the last year about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>possibly being bought out not by Disney but by others I was often attacked over the mere suggestion the point being made that it would be too expensive a buyout to make sense Well if we accept that the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>market cap is too high for a buyout to be wise then what about a buyout of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>at a much lower price A related detail is that there is so much negative stuff posted about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>both here and elsewhere It makes me wonder if a one or more potential buyers of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and not necessarily Disney could be using the anonymity of the internet to join in some of those negative posts hoping to knock the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock price down to a lower more affordable level the awful performance of these companies for the last few years show the simple fact that women are not fit to run such companies I will throw my hat in the ring for CEO Id buyout Nintendo at a discount Add those characters that are kid friendly Imagine having Mario and Yoshi with Mickey and the gang Work to develop more Nintendo games cross platform so we dont need a Nintendo specific console Imagine the number of people on PC PS and X who would purchase The money is in the software and not the hardware Leverage those IP assets Then continue to rely on groundbreaking directors and talent to keep building out Marvel and Star Wars Continue to fund the great things at Pixar Build out the princess theme of TFA and RO Its not too hard Cmon DIS and Iger Im willing to negotiate netflix is an empty shell A great company but fully empty once stripped out of content and loaded with debt Disney board should be savvy enough to recall the TW AOL debacle attempting to buy synergy with a visionary leader at an inflated price just as the roller coaster peaked He who doesnt learn from the past Im not sure Disney should buy anyone right now They seem to have plenty of avenues to allocate capital China parks movies and they are planning on buying more cruise ships Why NFLX can just buy Neflix executive for contend producing with a fraction of money Neflix business model has low entry barrier its all about key persons What does Disney do with all of Netflixs more risqu content I seem to remember a problem with the Weinstein Bros Disney owned Miramax at the time and a picture called Priest at the time it had a NC label Disney would not let the picture released Netflixs content isnt Disneyfied it just wouldnt work Disney has an image and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>isnt that image on paper maybe but it just wouldnt fit Agree NFLX would be a terrible acquisition overpriced and they have the Hulu JV already My take on COO is that Igers NFL deal fell through and hes decided to stay Hell be there for another years and NFLX will be long since sold to one of the cable operators perhaps for a fraction of its current market cap In the interim we could see a repeat of AOLTime Warner if NFLX somehow acquires a studio ugh Dont mean to be disrespectful but I am sick and tired of seeing analyst fodder about companies they obviously know nothing about Buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is Disneys only hope Does he mean that Chapter is imminent for Disney unless they buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>If you glance at the article in Barrons it is apparent this is exactly what this analyst thinks Note to SA editors you might want to exercise a little discernment when reprinting content from Barrons I have often found it devoid of intelligent thought You are all missing the point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has paid less than b to be in the context streaming business Why is that worth a market cap of billion Someone answer please Why would a content king buy a non content King Makes no sense Content is king Apple would be smarter to buy Disney and incorporate all their content into Apple TV Btig ideas make no sense Loves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but hates Disney and apple that makes money hand over fist <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is in trouble because it doesnt own content Its at the mercy of the content controllers like Disney The content kings can charge whatever they want and either <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has to agree or not have any good content for their base Its not going to end well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in a few years It would certainly be great if that happened but I dont see it Disney is an incredible company but it cant get out of its own way The stock would be a juggernaut if it werent for that damn ESPN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would be just what the doctor ordered but I think it would have to be a hostile takeover to get the deal done I seriously doubt this kind of idea gets any consideration at all If it does by any real entertainment company it will be the top of the bubble and will be comparable to the AOL Time Warner deal a totally bonehead move Streaming at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>level is not anywhere near as valuable as a third of Disney This guy is a joke
