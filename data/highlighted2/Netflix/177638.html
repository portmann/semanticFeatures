class='textDiv'>AdBlocking The Big Picture Its like there are two internets One of skeptical consumers doing their best to navigate their lives and the other of scumbag providers doing their best to win through subterfuge Then again in a world where brands are revered and Volkswagen cheats why do we expect people to bend over backwards for businesses We can talk about ads slowing down mobile loading times we can reference Apple making its money on hardware but what weve really got is a public thats sick and tired of getting the short end of the stick If Republicans were advertisers theyd tell people to just pick themselves up by their bootstraps and be just like them winners But is it a winning economy when were inundated with messages that arent relevant that intrude upon our everyday life But websites will tell us theres no free lunch Which brings up the question of payment Everyone on the corporate side believes no one will pay But the truth is we pay all the time when you offer convenience and a desirable product But when you do your best to put one over on us we get angry And if theres any way we can get retribution Kind of like Napster Sure tunes were free But they were also unlocked from overpriced albums with few good tracks Furthermore now radio was no longer in control we were able to sample wares based on our own desires The irony is the major labels and music business honchos will STILL tell you radio is in control Ain that a laugh Radio is where you can reach the most people easily but it means less than ever before How do we know Because most of the public is clueless as to the Top Ten they just dont care about it In other words it turns out the music industry is not giving people what they want Weve all got to focus on giving people what they want Thats internet The consumer is in control Win by serving them not by corralling them to fit your own desires Not that business people always get it wrong Look at Reed Hastings and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>He knew that streaming was the answer he dropped the price and provided instant access There was huge public outcry from people who wanted to rent DVDs Do you know anyone who rents DVDS anymore Do you know anyone who has a DVD player Discs are dead Hastings knew this already the public had to catch up and when it did people were satisfied <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is burgeoning And Apple has eliminated disc drives from computers The same way Steve Jobs got rid of legacy ports almost twenty years ago Remember the outcry That this alsoran computer company was leaving old customers in the dust forcing them to buy new product Well that was back before Apple became a juggernaut it was a harbinger of what was to come People are sick and tired of losing their privacy Theyre sick and tired of being tracked Theres nothing as weird as seeing an ad for a product follow you around the web Do you want to trust these people Did you trust the Stasi The ad companies are no different from the record companies wanting to hold on to an old model that benefits them but not the user Meanwhile wannabe techies side with them the way wannabe musicians side with legacy artists in desiring the old model they feel theyve lost their opportunity But isnt it funny that today its the labels who are on the cutting edge pushing streaming services and the acts are the ones behind Winners take stock of a changed world and adjust accordingly Keep your music off Spotify Put it everywhere and get people to listen to it The rewards come when people know who you are theyll give you tons of money if only you create a bond And maybe thats the future were going to where people pay Its already happening in news With soft paywalls Turns out most people dont want to read the New York Times anyway and those who do gladly pay As for those who bitch I remember Michael Eisner saying that ten percent of people will never pay but they seem to bitch loudest Not that Im saying the public is completely trustworthy that it doesnt see the shenanigans of VW and take matters into its own hands cutting corners But I am saying if youre dependent upon the public to make money youve got to serve their dreams not yours Furthermore ad prices have been sinking online because spots are ineffectual The web is littered with linkbait no better than Nigerian money scams You see these stories everywhere who are the nincompoops who click through As for YouTube preroll Where can I pay to make it go away Rates are abysmal but Ill pay dollars to make ads disappear Where do I enter my credit card number And youre telling me I spend nearly a grand for an iPhone and Im beholden to ads which ruin my experience Isnt this what killed the PC makers who loaded up your new computer with bloatware you never wanted and had a hard time eliminating Sure it lowered the cost of the product but then all the profits went to Apple Thats the lesson here People trust Apple Believe the company is on their side They dont mind paying a high price for the experience And its the same way in every walk of life Its the public that likes scalping at least they can go to the show even if the price is high Scalpers charge fair market value acts are living in an alternative universe where they want to look fair with low prices but are actually screwing their customers Turns out most of their fans WANT to pay more and acts should let them And Android is hobbled by ancient operating systems that cant be upgraded Based upon advertising the experience is substandard and people are opting to pay more for iPhones But I thought everybody was cheap that no one wanted to pay Well Apples got all the profits in handsets so you should contemplate that Ads are dying in television Theyve hobbled radio And now youve got internet sites telling us they must remain Make me laugh when Im not puking Theres got to be a better way If you cant get the consumer on YOUR side youre doomed Isnt that what we learned in the record business That we had to proffer solutions people wanted First with iTunes As for streaming the public has already voted streaming has won by a landslide its only the acts with their heads up their ass who believe otherwise But you dont win by bitching you win by abandoning the old model and embracing the new People hate ads they ruin the experience Thats why they download adblockers And they laud Apple for providing them isnt that what we all want a better experience in life Isnt that who we give money to The sands they are ashifting We have spam blockers a whole industry trying to weed out bad email but we cant get rid of bad ads This is the new reality If we lose a bunch of sites so be it Hell if we can get rid of some spyware MiB Podcasts That Will Make You Smarter Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for
