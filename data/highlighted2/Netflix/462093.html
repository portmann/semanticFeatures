style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares dropped almost after Q earnings release The revenue exceeded expectations however the increase in subscriber base failed to meet expectations Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>facing severe competition What are the challenges the company is facing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQNFLX saw a whopping drop in share price after hours on July th even after the company announced better than expected Q earnings Although the revenue numbers were better than expected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had a big miss in the subscriber numbers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>added million members in this quarter well below the expected million new members The markets probably overreacted in a short span of time but could a reduction in the subscriber base be the first warning sign for investors to cash in on their profits from this multibagger stock During the earnings call CEO Reed Hastings was extremely positive about the company He spoke about various expansion strategies which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has undertaken also commented that the decrease in the additional subscriber base was a short term phase for the company With the increased revenue the company expects to invest this amount in content creation and come out with better content and better returns for the shareholders There is no doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had been a very innovative company in providing its streaming services along with its original content and remained at the top position for the last years However the company does face increased competition and quite a bit of challenges henceforth This also makes it quite unpredictable for the next few years and that probably is a cause for concern with the shareholders Here are the challenges which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>foresees Increase in cost of content creation One of Netflixs major attractions is its original content which keeps consumers glued to it However the cost of content creation has been rising steadily in the past For eg the company spent Million on episodes on the series Marco Polo which premiered on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in December It also signed similar deals with other shows such as The Blacklist Million per episode and The Walking Dead Million per episode <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is expected to pay around Billion for content creation in which is going to put a significant pressure on the margins Although original content creation is extremely vital to the companys success the company needs to decide between profits and additional investment and maintain competitiveness Strong resistance to increase in subscription cost On one hand the content creation costs are going up and on the other hand consumers are extremely sensitive to a price increase In this highly competitive environment even a slight upward price tick makes them start searching for comparable alternatives This is exactly what happened in the Q results of the company yesterday where the increase in consumer base was far from expectations The following table shows the revenue growth and cash flow position of the company As you can see the current cash flow position of the company is negative Expansion plans will further add on to this burden <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has remained a strong brand until now retaining almost a monopoly or at least a far superior position compared to its competitors Things have however now started changing with increased competition from competitors such as Amazon Sling TV and Hulu Plus According to Neilsen in Q the latest data available here is the breakdown of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Amazon and Hulu Plus streaming services in American households <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has no doubt been a pioneer having hosted very popular shows However Amazon which has continuously proven to be a very innovative company cannot be counted out neither can Hulu Plus which is owned by st Century Fox NASDAQFOX the Walt Disney Co NYSEDYS and NBC Universal a subsidiary of Comcast Corp NASDAQCMCSA International expansion is a major challenge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>With the company announcing its expansion to countries in January there is a vast amount of work to be done before the international business turns profitable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>business is far more difficult than opening a retail outlet across countries Having a streaming service would require an in depth understanding of different international markets understanding of unique cultural tastes and obtaining a proper mix of local language and English language content as well as the optimum price point which can maximize the revenue and subscribers for the company Also many countries dont have a developed broadband infrastructure which can add to the challenges Since each country will pose a unique challenge it is extremely difficult to calculate the profitability margins cash flow position or the turnaround period for each of these countries As a result the expansion may result in a erosion of profitable growth and erode shareholder value The company no doubt is steadily increasing its revenue year on year However the company already has a negative cash flow The company is going to face multiple headwinds from various directions over the next few quarters Implementing all the strategies outlined above will require extensive amount of cash which the company will have to raise from external sources like issuing bonds or taking long term loans The biggest threat to the company is currently if it can outgrow its programming costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>between its content costs and the cost of adding subscribers is spending more than it is collecting How long can this continue CEO Reed Hastings however comes out very politely and confidently in his address that he is extremely confident about the companys long term strategy and that the company will deliver bigger profits in Whether he can deliver on that promise will be a test of investors faith and confidence Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
