favor with investors and analysts Three of the words I hear most in todays market are Apple NASDAQ AAPL is undervalued Many investors cite cash flow or earnings multiples comparisons to other tech giants or even skyhigh analyst price targets seen below as their reasons for saying this But no matter how many people say the stock is undervalued the key question remains how can Apple get its multiple to increase and thus get its stock to a fairer value Some people are calling for the company to do something major Some are calling for a massive dividend hike which I personally dont believe makes sense in this market environment While Im sure a group of investors will like the extra cash wont others just argue that the company is out of ideas There are a number of old tech names that have been called dead money once they start paying out large dividends Apple could easily go out and buy a Twitter NYSE TWTR or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX if it wants revenue growth but then people will complain about margins and potentially overpaying Perhaps we can find a solution that doesnt require tens of billions of dollars The key part of this could lie in Apples latest product category the Apple Watch There are those out there calling the device a flop since the company wont disclose unit sales on a quarterly basis despite the fact that Apple likely dominates the wearable industry in terms of revenue generation As we get closer to the likely launch of a second edition Watch management should certainly think about disclosing unit sales If the iPod was still being broken out at just a few hundred million in quarterly revenues why cant the Watch be detailed at that kind of level The overall solution goes beyond the Watch however and Im talking about increasing transparency overall Look at how the Street cheered Amazon NASDAQ AMZN when it broke out AWS or when Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL started discussing its other bets in more detail While Apple is more profitable and has better capital returns than those other tech giants investors love the perception of growth In Apples December ending fiscal Q period the company reported more than billion in revenues not coming directly from the iPad iPhone or Mac lines While these revenues from the services and hardware categories only represented about of the quarters total thats more revenues in a quarter than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is projected to do in total this year In certain quarters Apples services category does more revenues than other product lines such as the iPad Providing more detail in quarterly reports could also help to take the focus off of segments that perhaps are not doing as well For the soon to be reported Q for example it would be nice to see how Apple Music is generating hundreds of millions in quarterly revenues and showing strong subscriber growth What about discussing the revenue growth of Apple Pay a key phone feature that the company loves to market When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt meet its top or bottom line expectations the stock sometimes gets a pass as long as its subscribers grow nicely With the iPhone and iPad currently struggling Apple should use this opportunity to increase its discussion of areas that are doing exceptionally well In the end increased transparency might be the best way for Apple to gain favor with investors and analysts a solution that wont cost tens of billions of dollars Everyone cheered the breakout of Amazons AWS and Alphabets other bets so maybe Apple management could learn from those examples Why not break out the Watch Music Apple Pay or other items especially ones that are growing at decent rates Growth names in this market are getting above average multiples so perhaps increased transparency is a way for Apple to increase its multiple Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans
