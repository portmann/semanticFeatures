consider Netflixs pricing power weak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>raised its monthly fee without losing any of its growth I will describe two other scenarios that explain Netflixs pricing power In earlier coverage of television streaming service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX I concluded that the future for this company looks bright Diversification into sports andor music could result in additional growth and pricing power for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Reading through the comments I found a couple of questions and strong hesitations regarding Netflixs pricing power Therefore I would like to elaborate on this matter and explain why I believe Netflixs pricing power is strong I will provide three scenarios an increase of the monthly subscription fee the introduction of an exclusive content tier and a payperview option Let me start by quoting two bearish comments on my previous article in order to show the hesitation among some investors toward Netflixs pricing power I dont see how they will even have pricing power The streaming service could just as easily become a price current commodity as cable is Second I would like to clarify what pricing powers actually means in order to avoid any misunderstanding Pricing power refers to the price elasticity of demand In other words how much will demand for Netflixs streaming service decrease if the company decides to raise the price of the service Now the definition of pricing power is clear I will continue explaining Netflixs pricing power by the three scenarios I mentioned before Netflixs television streaming service is relatively cheap compared to cable television packages The current monthly subscription fee is up from at the beginning of this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>already raised the monthly subscription fee for new customers twice so far The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>raised its monthly fee twice this year and subscription growth is still very strong both domestic as in the rest of the world gives me confidence that the overall price elasticity of Netflixs service is favorable for the company As a result future increases in the monthly fee are not likely to result in a major drop in demand for the service One of the comments mentioned declining margins Thats likely caused by investments and higher content costs More and better content will eventually strengthen demand for Netflixs service This is likely to lead to an even better price elasticity and pricing power for the company I find that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could easily raise the monthly subscription fee in the upcoming years without losing much of the demand for its service Despite higher content costs from licensing deals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also is investing heavily in exclusive content For example House of Cards Narcos and Orange Is The New Black are popular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>originals By providing quality original content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is able to stay competitive compared to other services like HBO which features the popular series Games Of Thrones Since the company keeps investing in exclusive content the total number of series films and other material thats available on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will grow over time Next to just raising the overall monthly fee <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could opt for introducing an exclusive content tier with access to more of its original content In order to make such a move effective the company should limit the number of exclusive content on the normal tier and raise the price for the exclusive tier I admit the scenario described above hasnt been tested just yet Thats different compared to raising the overall monthly subscription fee which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>raised twice already Therefore this scenario is less likely but still interesting to consider Over the past years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>proved its able to produce quality content Why not pay extra for it Personally I would gladly pay extra if that ensures extra seasons of the originals series I watch on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could consider introducing the payperview option In my opinion this will not harm demand for its core business which is selling monthly subscription fees Consumers signing up for the monthly subscription are probably going to use the service more than just once or twice a month With a payperview option for at least Netflixs originals series the company should be able to attract users who are not likely to use the service at all This will boost revenue without harming demand for its monthly subscriptions The payperview option becomes even more important if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>diversifies into sports as Seeking Alpha contributor Alex Cho suggested Earlier this year HBO coproduced the recordsetting boxing match Mayweather vs Pacquiao This match sold to million payperview watchers and earned over million in revenue However payperview also could be introduced for originals series such as House of Cards and others Considering all of the above I find that Netflixs pricing power is strong going forward The most likely scenario is that the company will raise the monthly subscription fee as it did twice this year With a favorable price elasticity any modest raise of the fee is not likely to reduce demand for the service significantly Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could introduce a more expensive tier with exclusive content or choice for a payperview option While the payperview option targets a new group of customers this option could increase revenue without reducing demand for the monthly subscription as well For the second scenario the effect of demand is less clear though Overall I stand behind my initial analyses that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a great company with strong pricing power Naturally I remain bullish on its stock as well We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to
