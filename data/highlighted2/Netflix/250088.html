class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Is One Of My Top Picks For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>fundamentals while opaque and difficult to understand still seem compelling Analysts have changed their tune on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and the most credible <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>analyst believes there is significant growth potential over the next five to ten years Given feasibility and market dynamics Im a little more optimistic when compared to Wall Street analysts This is mostly due to the expansion possibility in Asia efforts to produce highquality content and historical growth comparison Furthermore when compared to peers trading at even higher multiples I feel like the valuation argument is misconstrued As such it sounds paradoxical but perhaps NFLX is undervalued The investment community is in love with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX but it wasnt always that way In the initial stages investors were skeptical of the inherent growth potential and quite frankly who wouldnt be Early stage growth investors are extremely rare on Wall Street Most of these highoctane growthoriented managers work at a VC firm in California enjoying the weather and modern tech culture Whereas frigid New Yorkers will take turns pounding sell orders whenever things get frosty following a bad or pathetic quarter California guys keep their cool even when they live on an earthquake fault line but New York traders Yeah right Weve seen so many fat finger circuit breaker issues with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>that it barely even fazes me anymore when CNBC panelists jump up and down after a drop or a move in a single day For those of you who dont know NFLX makes a frequent visit to the biggest mover on the NASDAQ list So color me surprised sarcasm if we see the same pattern of volatility The fainthearted riskadverse individual will collapse from a heart attack owning this name so unless youre prepared for many more gruelingeuphoric moments its advised that you click the back button <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a public largescale experiment of a publiclytraded early growth stage company Investors shriek at the multiples bad quarters can lop off the valuation by Heck the cash usage is high in some quarters maybe too high and the level of liquid assets have reached dangerous territories in the past <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has demonstrated much more consistency recently It continues to execute on every quarterly otherwise bears would form a line formation to attack bulls with investor presentations Oh wait I take that back they still do In a recent note published on November th RBC Capital Analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated his earlier stance and supplemented it with a very indepth presentation pages long but heres the most important paragraph from his presentation Part of our Bullish Bias on NFLX stems from our belief that the market underestimates the companys long term earnings potential Simply put we believe that under a range of reasonable assumptions NFLX can generate in longterm within years annual EPS Those reasonable assumptions are that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can support MM global paying subscribers with an ARPU and Operating Margins Well detail these assumptions below but our stockpicking belief is that a secular growth highvisibility subscription model with in EPS power would carry at least a market premium PE multiple of X which implies the ability for NFLX to achieve a stock price within the next threefive years depending on how quickly it can ramp up to our reasonable assumptions And thats why NFLX is an attractive Long though not a tablepounding Long at Im fairly certain sales will start to accelerate going into FY as the company has uniquely positioned itself in a number of foreign markets To sustain a healthy growth rate its worth noting that the company needs to develop a continuous pattern of generating hits and continue the aggressive marketing of its service in conjunction with its top TV shows However its worth mentioning that four of Netflixs hot series House of Cards Daredevil Narcos and Orange is the New Black will release their next season in the timeframe In other words Netlix is really piling on the momentum which coincides with the launch of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in major regional markets like China India and the Middle East China is the most crucial market as its hard to create locally produced TV dramas that are globally competitive from the context of international viewership Not every Chinese movie star will rise to the top viewing charts like Bruce Lee Jackie Chan and Jet Li And quite frankly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>not only needs to produce great movies in China but they will need to create an overnight Chinese sensation To be honest creating another Jackie Chan wont be easy However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can provide the highest paying and most stable outlet for global movie and show releases from Asian studios via its platform After all many of the major Korean and Japanese media companies have struggled with westward expansion as there are many restrictions placed on the standard cable model In fact when was the last time you saw a foreign import make it onto a live television broadcast with the exception of Telemundo Novelas and Japanese Anime A huge chunk of the Asian film market is dominated by Japanese and Korean studios which then get exported into other Asian markets Koreas pop culture is heavily underrated and their version of Hollywood which is referred to as Hallyuwood has penetrated the airwaves of almost every Asian household In other words Netflixs efforts in Japan and Korea are absolutely critical and Im almost certain Ted Sarandos Chief Content Officer already knows this which is why hes making a push into Korea in In other words theyre setting up their service in the Hollywood of the east Going forward they will need content from major Korean studios if they want any legitimate chance of penetrating into Asia KBS MBC SBS are the three names that will make or break their Chinese expansion Koreas economy isnt just a powerhouse because they make good phones great TVs and good cars The major Korean movie studios define whats cool and socially acceptable In fact Id blame Chinas cultural revolution on Koreas own implementation of eastwest social convergence The brand placements are mindbogglingly obvious from the context of a western viewer and if you count the number of objects intentionally placed into the various Koreansets youll notice why Asia has become such a statusdriven culture After all Bae Yong Joon Koreas most wellrenowned mega star drives a Mercedes Maybach Jeez is it any wonder German Automakers are killing it in Koreas own backyard To win Asian consumers you legitimately need celebrity endorsements in one form or another The key takeaway <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will not only generate revenue from a subscription model but if they start filming movies and shows for the Asian demographic theyll earn a lot of money from product placements Hence its not just the impending subscriber base potential but the incremental revenue from product placement advertising that makes Asia interesting Therefore I anticipate that the revenue ramp in some of these foreign markets to accelerate beyond the longterm revenue forecasts of analysts Its not exactly clear what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will generate from product placement revenue But theres no denying that its extremely effective especially in Asia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will generate a repeated pattern of hits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is building a Pixaresque hit culture through its own studios That pattern of building tentpole franchises needs to continue given their diverse audience demographic Furthermore the launch into foreign markets requires a more multicultural approach to content similar to Marco Polo which took place in Mongolia during a moment in history thats briefly skimmed over in the world history books and is one of the most interesting time periods beyond the proverbial World War US Civil War Revolutionary War genres Its important that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to develop warthemed content as viewers respond particularly to the drama and action category in international markets as high budgets filmsTV sets are hard to replicate due to cost barriers and feasibility dynamics within the emerging markets Mark Mahaney forecasts revenue growth to accelerate to in the next fiscal year which compares to current fiscal year growth of Hes at the higher end of the consensus range with his billion revenue forecast Personally I still think its somewhat conservative But given the conservative nature of sellside models its pretty optimistic Furthermore Mahaney is one out of the two analysts that shows up on Netflixs quarterly earnings conference webcasts so hes one of the few guys on Wall Street with legitimate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>clout In QFY Netflixs subscriber growth is expected to grow by yearoveryear The rapid expansion into international markets expanded the TAM to million households over the course of That indicates that Netflixs penetration into international households will reach by end of the current fiscal year based on the million in members theyre projecting for next quarter Furthermore I anticipate that penetration for preestablished international markets to expand by to points per year based on the historical comps of UK and Canadian penetration Netflixs international launch into Asia and a couple additional European countries expands the addressable market to million approximately I anticipate that Netflixs international subscriber base to grow based on an incremental point improvement to its preexisting international households which adds up to million international households and an additional points for launch into an additional million households adding million households This totals to million households by end of FY yearoveryear growth in subscribers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>average in monthly revenue per international subscriber and since subscriber figures vary by quarter my sales forecast adjusts for the incremental addition of subscribers As such I work off of million in paying subscribers because on aggregate only half the subscribers will pay for the full duration of a year Therefore my revenue forecast for international when based off of current ARPU and penetration rates is billion I anticipate the domestic segment to sustain revenue growth due to a pricing increase to per month and incremental subscriber growth of The growth in pricing and membership implies a sales growth rate in the domestic segment which compares to growth in FY Therefore I anticipate the domestic segment to grow sales to billion The combined revenues of both segments may reach billion in FY which puts me a full billion above analyst consensus next year When looking at the feasibility dynamics Im certain NFLXs revenue CAGR will in fact accelerate next year Of course the penetration rate may vary depending on region but I believe theres a largely unfulfilled need for content in many of these markets As such I view a initial penetration attainable and continuous momentum from preexisting markets to continue Furthermore the content slate is fairly strong going into FY and I anticipate the momentum to carry into FY due to the ongoing release of sequels to hit series and the roll out of Disney NYSE DIS titles to the platform I see a very low probability of earningssales misses next year Im not offering an earnings estimate because its extremely obvious that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wont generate much profit as theyre in a rapid investment phase When compared to peers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>sits in the middle of the pack That being the case if billion in sales is attained next year the forward PS multiple is Thats cheap even when compared to Facebook NASDAQ FB and Twitter NYSE TWTR Therefore on a comparative value basis I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>isnt as expensive as other internet peers Sure one could lament about how these internet peers trade at higher multiples but thats because investors anticipate a combination of margin expansion and sales growth to normalize valuations over time Given the strengthening fundamentals improving competitive dynamics and reasonable valuation I feel comfortable recommending <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>When normalizing earnings for longterm profitability I arrive at a relatively reasonable price target that seems to capture a feasible upside target over the immediate month timeframe Furthermore I do anticipate volatility but assuming strong execution in the stock will exhibit even more momentum than what the consensus price target implies Therefore I raise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to high conviction buy for Im initiating a price target of which implies upside from current levels This valuation assumes earnings multiple when normalizing the income statement for a longterm net income margin of I have to make arbitrary adjustments to the income statement in this case which seems to be normal practice in VCbased models who then discount using a end of fiveyear period intrinsic value estimate They then discount using a minimum hurdle rate I dont use a discounting method but rather I use comparative value to adjust the valuation into a feasible range for FY There are many ways to skin the cat of valuation but for the most part I feel this approach is most appropriate when dealing with early stage growth companies that have not established a pattern of profitability but have provided enough evidence that they can in fact ramp
