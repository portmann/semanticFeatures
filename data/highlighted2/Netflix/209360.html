Seeking Alpha Netflixs original film Beasts of No Nation opened this past weekend across multiple mediums but earned next to nothing from theaters The films theatrical earnings actually mean nothing in the long run as the only reason for a traditional release was so the film would qualify for the awards season While the films theatrical revenue means little the possibility is always in play that people will misconstrue its value and that could potentially hurt the company in the long game It literally means nothing The truth is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX didnt release Beasts of No Nation in theaters to make money the company did it to enter the Oscars race Truth be told this is actually one of those articles I thought about writing but wasnt sure if it would be needed I thought I had covered most of it last week but then I started seeing stories go up about how this was a big flop for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and I wanted to explain to investors why thats not the case Now make no mistake Beasts of No Nation is a huge priority to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its success is vital to its business model Yet how it did in theaters is a terrible indication of it potential success First you should know this wasnt a wide release this was a limited run in just theaters across markets At the same time it was available to the million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscribers as part of the usual monthly subscription fee As a result theater chains are boycotting the film so even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wanted a lavish big run it wasnt going to happen Let me simplify it even more If you were a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriber would you rather view the film for no added cost from the comfort of your home or pay an additional to see it in a theater While a few sites encouraged readers to experience this with their fellow man those pleas were understandably falling on deaf ears Beasts made in total which is a theater average of roughly I could give you comparisons to other limited releases but it would make no difference It wouldnt be a fair comparison as Beasts is in a field all to itself at the moment So that begs the question why release it in theaters in the first place if the studio knew it had the potential to do poorly By rule to have a film be considered for an Academy Awards nomination it must receive a run in a New York and Los Angelesbased theater for a specific amount of time This is a rule <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is very familiar with as it has used it to get its documentary series nominated but this is the first time the studio has tried it for a scripted release Beasts was acquired for million by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with the purpose of throwing an awards campaign behind it Starring acclaimed actor Idris Elba Luther The Wire and directed by Cary Fukunaga the Emmywinning director of True Detectives first season the film is a dark drama set in the world of child soldiers in West Africa It screams Oscar Now remember the film has won acclaim from critics and audiences and will likely be in contention for this awards season However the fear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and its investors are beginning to realize and if they havent they will soon is that negative stories about its earnings could impact those odds While Id like to think the majority of voters understand the strategy at play here the general public probably doesnt which means public sentiment could negatively alter the films chances Yes Oscar voters rarely nominate films that match up with the publics interests but if the audience vastly shows a dislike towards something voters usually steer clear Despite what many believe public perception does impact the awards race Oscar voters do vote their own minds but that doesnt mean they dont at least entertain the publics thoughts So when I search for the film and a lot of the first stories I see are about its gross revenue thats not a good thing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is going to be a powerhouse in film just as it is with TV but that took a while to happen and that will likely be the case again here You can also bet that when a nonawards film like Adam Sandlers Ridiculous hits the servers in December it may not get a limited run as theres no need Why open themselves up to that The service has never released numbers on its properties and probably wont so theres no reason to start now and so why create more unneeded noise In fact every film will likely carry a different rollout model The simple fact is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wants you to stream its movies and thats perfect because the theaters dont want to show them for that very reason Keep that in mind when you see negative stories coming up about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>because of Beasts theatrical numbers and just remember those arent the
