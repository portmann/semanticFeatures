Big Data analytics phone industry servers refresh to lower total cost of operation and increased direct sales The remainder of Intels business supports DCG profits One of the themes of Brian Krzanich since becoming CEO in has been to grow Intels NASDAQ INTC sales through nonPC areas with Data Center sales as the biggest initial driver of growth At the Intel Investor Day in November the company announced that for the next four years the Data Center Group DCG sales would grow each year This follows an increase in DCG sales revenue between and Compounded this amounts to a doubling of Data Center sales between and As impressive as the growth in DCG sales is the growth in profits is even bigger From to while DCG sales grew DCG profits grew In DCG operating income represented less than of Intels overall operating revenue In the groups operating income of b represented of the total Intel operating income of b With a reduction in business desktop sales in the first quarter of DCG operating income is likely over of total Intel operating income Some would say But the PC Group profits are bigger than the DCG profits Thats true and the PC Group will no longer exist as a reporting unit starting this quarter If one combines the old PC Group the Mobile and Communications Group and Other then one can understand why the Data Center Group produces more than half of Intels net profit Thats where Intel DCG is now Where is the DCG going how will it get there and what will the DCG impact on Intel stock price be The reader is reminded that Intel is one big beast of a company with its hands in everything that computes and communicates Add to this that in order to remain competitive the company must limit the information that it makes publicly available This makes complete understanding of Intel impossible but we work at it The following discussion is pretty complicated and long If you just want the bottom line you can skip ahead to the Increasing Data Center Group Revenues section or all the way to the Impact of DCG on Intel Share Price section Diane Bryant senior vice president and general manager of the Intel Data Center Group provided a great outline of Intel DCG at the Intel Investor Day video and pdf links Big industry trends fuel data center growth Investing to win across workloads and segments Big industry trends focus on a move to a digital service economy and Jevons paradox Lets focus on how these areas will likely impact Intels DCG sales Between now and devices connected to the internet are expected to increase from about billion today billion to about billion in per Cisco and per Morgan Stanley Thats getting close to devices for every person on earth Intels General Manager of Cloud Services at the Structure conference in June pointed out that billion people are currently connected to the internet with another billion coming soon In the future everything thats connected to electricity will compute and be connected to the internet Every smartphones drive the need for a server in a data center For every wearable devices another server is needed in the data center Over the next several years more than billion will be spent on data center infrastructure The graph below is from a report indicating the growth in cloud services which is just one part of the market served by data centers The numbers on the left are billions of USD Then in Forrester indicated that growth was faster than estimated in In Intels DCG sales were about billion Is there room for the companys growth within the billion to be spent on data center infrastructure over the next several years I am investing on it Intel is focusing on what it calls the Rise of the Digital Services Economy One of Intels strategies is to accelerate disruption of the way we do business by enabling digital services that allow companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Airbnb Uber Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Facebook NASDAQ FB to exist and thrive These companies are only possible because of innovations led by Intels lowcost computing technology The cloud allowed these services to exist and in turn the services these companies provide are increasing the demand for a larger cloud infrastructure This is the essence of Javons paradox Todays IT challenges weeks to provision new servers networking storage processors annual growth in mobile data traffic annual growth in storage of data is unstructured server utilization less than The current data centers are insufficient not just size but structure needs to change dramatically Intel provides a toptobottom solution stack Workload optimized silicon breaking out of the box with new ways to manage data center throughput and storage optimize delivery of data center services unlock the data vault The company innovates functions and then integrates them into the silicon processor It provides a full range of processors for the data center ATOM XEON XEON PHI All of these have a place in the data center to meet specific customer needs Another focus of Intel is on Rack Scale Architecture RSA The key to RSA is an orchestration layer that allows the application the app to define the virtual network virtual processor and virtual memory that are needed for that application Intel is working with partners to allow the data center to automatically in seconds spin up or down or sideways to meet the demands of millions of applications save power and increase data center utilization Resources are pooled and each application gets the resources it needs at that instant from all resources in the data center Whether a data center builds or buys servers the keys include performance security and workload optimization New data center infrastructure powered by Intel cloud technology can increase performance and optimization by about from systems from just a few years ago The cloud is now a whole new platform for computing First the platform was mainframes then desktop computers then networks with desktops and then the networks were expanded with laptops smartphones and tablets Now the cloud is the latest platform for computing across all devices In Intel invested over million in companies that accelerate Big Data analytics Intel sees that it not only needs to develop silicon but enable an architecture thats robust modular scalable and efficient to handle cloud growth Then the company optimizes those services to ensure data centers can easily build a cloud deploy the cloud and monetize Big Data services Intel sees that its work to accelerate development of improved cloud services is best for its server OEMs direct data center clients the clients served by data centers everyone Remember that over billion will be spent on cloud infrastructure over the next several years Diane Bryant general manager of Intels Data Center Group makes it clear that softwaredefined infrastructure is a key element of Intels strategy in the data center world In essence softwaredefined infrastructure allows one application to run across thousands of servers This approach makes custom processor solutions a very effective way to have one application run efficiently on numerous processors A big step in this direction is Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA married to a Xeon processor package This package can double the performance of a processor related to a specific application An FPGA is flexible and reprogrammable on the fly as application requirements change An FPGA is an onramp to custom processor solutions Once shown to be effective an FPGAXeon can be duplicated in hundreds or thousands of custom processors An FPGA also can be deployed broadly in a data center to allow reprogramming of an FPGA to accelerate highdemand functions as the demand for functions change More on FPGAs can be found here Utilization of compute resources in a data center today is often or less This utilization can be increased to by rack scale solutions and softwaredefined infrastructure Both public cloud and telco service providers can avail themselves of this increase in utilization by using the latest Intel data center products Some say that softwaredefined architecture works against Intel profits since it reduces the number of processors needed to process the same throughput Intels perspective is the same as with Moores Law process more data for lower cost and thereby increase sales and margins Intels approach to competition includes the idea that Only the paranoid survive This then is carried out in the following approach Whatever it is it needs to run best on Intel Yes data center people are looking for a second source of data center processors customers will evaluate new sources The competitive advantage of Intel is its constant development of improved lowercost technology and the fact that in a data center a homogeneous environment everything running on Intel architecture always results in the best overall performance and reliability Amazons Data Center is as an example is sticking with Intel because competitors are just not moving fast enough the cost savings are not quite there and Intel is more receptive to meeting Amazons custom needs During the last quarter IDC reported that nonx servers experienced a revenue decline of yearoveryear to billion This was the fourteenth consecutive quarter of revenue decline in the nonx server segment According to Kuba Stolarski Research Manager Enterprise Servers at IDC As we look forward over the next few years server demand will continue to see aggressive hyperscale growth as well as interrelated greenfield opportunities attached to Internet of Things IoT solutions As IoT grows generating increasing amounts of data network traffic and demand for realtime analytics new server designs and new methods of deploying compute capability will continue the transformation of the server market Increasing Data Center Group Revenues Okay Ive been rambling believe me there are many other facts to be quoted in support of Intels dominance in Data Center growth Lets focus on increasing DCG revenues Ill divide this discussion into two parts Increases due to industry growth and Increases due to better products First some basics Intels DCG sales in were worth billion We dont know much more than that from Intel data thats publicly available Theres no financial breakdown among parts of the data center eg processor SSD communications We also dont know how much is sold to OEMs and how much is sold direct to companies that make their own data center servers We know squat because Intels ability to compete would be damaged if the competition knew how much Intel sold of what to whom for how much We do know some information on pricing and global industrywide sales Intel provides details of the prices for the various products that it sells but we dont know how many of each it sells IDC and Gartner provide information on how many servers are sold and a split between nonx and x units If I guess at an average price of likely higher per processor and using IDCGartner data indicating million Intel servers are sold each year I arrive at billion of billion overall DCG sales are from processor sales Seems low How about per server and billion is from processor sales The rest between billion and billion is then from other products sold into data centers Given the gross level of real data it looks like we are stuck with overall adjustments to DCG earnings If connected devices are growing from billion to billion in six years the annual growth rate for data centers is approximately Thats huge This per year growth is being reduced by data center infrastructure efficiencyutilization improvements If the companys programs increase the efficiencyutilization of data centers by per year then the net growth in data center expansion is per year Assuming that Intels market share stays the same then its DCG sales should grow per year This is pretty close to the companys guidance of per year If Intel by increasing data center efficiencyutilization by per year is able to increase average selling prices by per year then the companys DCG profits increase per year This is pretty close to what happened over the past year with sales increasing and profits increasing In addition to data center growth year and increased profits year we need to add Intels increasing share of sales to data centers this is not an increase in processor sales but an increase in sales of other components of the data center With a larger share of data center sales the companys profits get even larger Intel has been quietly buying companies that increase Intels ability to provide all the products needed to build a complete data center With this approach Intels billion in DCG market share could increase to be a larger portion of the billion IDC identifies as being spent annually on servers and a larger percentage of the billion to be spent on data center infrastructure over the next several years My estimate is that Intels DCG sales will grow annually not the annual growth rate guided by the company and that DCG profits will increase annually This creates a range of profits for of to billion The increase in YOY net revenues increase is shown in these graphs Assuming that PC sales remain flat at the rate b in sales mobile reduces its losses by m IoT continues its growth and the remaining groups dont change I see DCG profits resulting in total Intel net revenue of for With earnings remaining at of net revenue and no change in shares this results in a range of earnings from per share Using the endof PE of I arrive at a share price of between and for the end of Remember this is without any improvement in PC or mobile sales compared to Improvements in these areas would increase Intels earnings and share price further Source Data Center Group Drives Intels Profits Disclosure The author is long INTC MoreThe author wrote
