record net sales by insiders during Q Sizable net selling continued by insiders during the past three quarters as well Although some may argue that insider net selling during the past year does not necessarily indicate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares are headed lower we do believe that it is a cautionary bearish signal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA recently announced on July that Comcast will let customers get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on its X platform settop box Such access is expected to be effective later this year Despite an associated cost that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would incur <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stands to gain additional customers and revenues Comcast is estimated to have about million highspeed internet subscribers as of Q out of a total of about million in the USA Meanwhile as of May it is estimated that about of Comcasts video subscribers have the X platform with expectations for such number to grow to about by late summer On a net basis such a development is a positive for two important reasons First it provides <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>an opportunity to reinvigorate its slowing US subscriber growth Second a truce between Comcast and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will enable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to freeup resources it has allocated to fighting Comcast for numerous years in the past <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>announced several months ago that it would be increasing its high definition streaming plan subscription price to from per month As the company is implementing such price increase on a rolling basis and has actually delayed such increase to some customers related additional revenues from consenting customers will not be fully reflected in Netflixs earnings for Q On the negative side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would be expected to lose some of its subscribers due to the price hike although the company seems to be downplaying any noticeable increase in its churn rate as CEO Hastings stated in a January letter The price hike is expected to affect million subscribers about of Netflixs US subscribers UBS estimates that between and of affected subscribers will cancel while a JP Morgan survey revealed that said they would cancel although some may not actually follow up by doing so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>pricing structure Source Business Insider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>added on a net basis million subscribers in the first quarter of this year although it is expecting to add million subscribers globally during the second quarter For the US net subscriber additions are expected to be about in Q vs million in the Q primarily driven by the expected price hike churn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>currently has about million US subscribers and about million international subscribers Although the price hike could be a negative factor in case it results in a higher churn rate than desired reduced subscriber growth expectations provide a lower hurdle to beat The upcoming summer Olympics in Rio could slow subscriber growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as audiences turn their attention to the Olympics In it is estimated that the summer Olympics dragged down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>usage traffic by about Taking such factor into consideration Cowen recently reduced its price target on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to from In addition Comcasts plans to individualize and personalize the Olympics viewing experience through its X platform could tilt the balance back away from cable alternatives such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Hulu When examining <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock during the past five years between July and October <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares dropped by an average of about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares dropped in and but increased in and as per below table <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock price change from July to October for Source Yahoo Finance Although historical performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance with the exception of when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was trading at about of its current level it does seem that substantial upside potential between July and October is somewhat limited It is also noteworthy that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares dropped by between July and October during the Olympics year as well as in the Olympics year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>currently has a market capitalization of about billion With average analysts earnings estimates of per share for this year and share for next year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>boasts forward PE ratios of and respectively Meanwhile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>PE ratio ttm is Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>mean ttm PE ratio for the past years is it has ranged as high as and as low as By any standard Netflixs valuation is quite high but as we have seen previously that does not mean that such valuation cannot possibly go higher There are several divergent signals for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>On the positive side the Comcast deal could provide a boost to stagnating subscriber growth for later in the year while higher subscription fees will increase revenues per subscriber In addition reduced subscriber growth expectations for the US does provide a lower hurdle to overcome On the negative side increased subscriber churn related to the price hike presents an unknown risk In addition seasonal factors related to the Olympics and the seasonal period between July and October also present some challenges Most importantly insiders have sold more shares during the past year than during any other period during the past years Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares continue to have very high valuations and hence any doubt on potential future growth could cause a substantial drop in share prices From a longer term perspective Netflixs Hastings still expects to exceed million subscribers in However the US market is very well saturated while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is counting primarily on international growth In such regard as we have written about in other recent articles we believe that macro headwinds related to Brexit and strong dollar will challenge most companies counting on international growth in the near future Given such divergent signals and Netflixs high valuations we would favor establishing an options position on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>such as purchasing puts expiring September with strike currently trading at a premium of as well as calls with a strike of currently trading at a premium of about with a ratio of puts for every one call Although volatility seems expensive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>we do believe that the divergent signals will provide opportunity for substantial moves in its share price following earnings release this afternoon and the next several weeks Breakeven would be to the upside and about to the downside Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my
