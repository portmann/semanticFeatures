(Uncertainty) </span>The U.S. domestic market is a perfect example of the massive profits available in a duopoly or triopoly structure.For over a decade, both Verizon and AT&T have delivered quality service and earned tremendous cash flows, primarily at the expense of a bumbling Sprint (NYSE: S ) and a non-focused T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ).Recently, a "race-to-the-bottom" mindset has plagued the industry as both Sprint and T-Mobile are offering budget plans free of the old-fashioned 2-year contract system.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Although this price competition benefits consumers in the short term, there is a risk of deterring investment in long-term infrastructure such as rural 4G and metro 5G if the profit potential begins to evaporate. (Uncertainty) </span>Just as a monopoly system (as seen in Mexico for decades and in the U.S. until the 1970s) is extremely inefficient, a system of rampant competition spurned by shady spectrum deals and weak infrastructure players, also exposes the U.S. to a future of sub-par mobile technology.The FCC wisely blocked a deal between T-Mobile and AT&T back in 2011 , one of the few "no-brainer" decisions similar to the recent block of Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK )/Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>However, I believe the regulatory posturing against a potential TMUS and Sprint tie-up could prove to be a long-term mistake. (Uncertainty) </span>Giving the U.S. three major telecom players will benefit both consumers and the shareholders of these three entities.Consumers will benefit from quality infrastructure development and service stability while the industry will avoid an unfortunate self-destruction due to irresponsible players like Sprint (note: I am a long-term Sprint customer and a previous investor in Sprint.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I am current long both VZ and T, so there may be strong inherent bias here). (Uncertainty) </span>The rampant cost-cutting by both Sprint and contract changes by T-Mobile U.S. are leading the U.S. domestic market into a pseudo price-war for retail mobile consumers.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe regulators will eventually come to their senses and allow what I believe to be an inevitable merger between Sprint and T-Mobile to occur. (Uncertainty) </span>This merger will allow more stability between the two legacy carriers and a more "consumer-friendly" T-Mobile/Sprint.Consolidating the market into three strong players will actually improve legitimate long-term competition and innovation as Sprint certainly doesn't have the financial strength to live up to its infrastructure responsibilities and TMUS lacks the necessary scale to compete for the long term.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Consumers might temporarily win from the current price war, but they will lose in the long term due to a reduction in long-term infrastructure deployment and innovation. (Uncertainty) </span>The FCC continues to offer spectrum carve-outs to small businesses, of which S and TMUS are the primary beneficiaries, but recent moves are promising, including lowering the carve-outs from 40 MHz to 30 MHz.This is the plague of U.S. telecom majors - realistic mobile-phone penetration is certainly in the 90% range and even the growth from smartphones and data utilization is beginning to slow down.Coupled with the aforementioned margin drops, the domestic future for both AT&T and Verizon is rather weak.Although 4G tablets and connected cars offer a massive source of new connection revenue, these price points are typically much smaller than the legacy mobile plans.Verizon must focus on proliferation of these devices and be willing to accept smaller margins.In the future, when every house and every vehicle is connected to the wireless grid, even far smaller profit margins will still add to a sizable payout.A common argument I hear against investing in higher-yielding stocks such as telecoms and utilities is that the stocks are "artificially high" due to yield-seeking investors.The argument is that as the Fed raises interest rates later this year and certainly into 2016, stocks such as VZ will lose favor and their price will drop as the dividend yield goes up.I covered this argument extensively in a previous article from last March (focused on AT&T stock), but I have included a relevant table on VZ below as well (original table designed in March with the green added now).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Note that the spread to the T-Note yield is at near-record levels, suggesting most of the "interest rate risk" is already priced in. (Uncertainty) </span>The only other two years with higher spreads were 2009 at the depth of the market crash and 2012 when the VZ yield was over 5%.As I've previously discussed in my other blue-chip articles, I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow ratio in my valuation targets.My broad range is typically from 10-20x (5-10% yield).With a company like Verizon that has questionable growth prospects, but certainly stable FCF, I'm looking for a more suitable range of 10-15x (7.5-10% yield).VZ pays an impressive dividend, but FCF is the important metric to track.The averages are shown in the chart below: Taking the more conservative 5-year average and applying a 10-15x range results in a "fair" market capitalization of $142.5B to $213.8B. With 4.08B shares outstanding as of March 2015, the fair price range for VZ is $34.93 to $52.40.VZ is a well-managed company with substantial cash flow power.Upcoming challenges include increased U.S. wireless competition, substantial capital requirements (including more expensive spectrum auctions, continuing 4G outlay, and upcoming 5G research and development).<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Due to the uncertainty surrounding the domestic markets and clear challenges in the digital space, VZ does not deserve the richer valuation multiples of a firm like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) or Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ). (Uncertainty) </span>However, even with a conservative range of 10-15x FCF, VZ carries a "fair value" of $34.93 to $52.40.This price range represents 10% upside to the current price of $47.64 - substantial upside considering the inherent downside protection via the dividend and strong core assets.I am long Verizon, and it remains an essential component in my blue-chip portfolios.I will consider adding to my position in this current pricing range.Source: Verizon: Quality At Very Attractive Pricing Disclosure: I am/we are long T, VZ.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
