reasonable growth opportunities in the US market VZs upside lies with the continued focus on its dominant wireless assets Connected cars and Skinny TV offer additional upside as does the prospect of selling off wireline Bearish concerns include increasing domestic competition stagnating smartphone growth and interest rate risk The company has upside to its full fair value of based on a x multiple to average free cash flow This is a contribution to a continuing series in which I profile some of my favorite bluechip holdings and prospects I keep approximately of my assets indexed and in blue chips so this is a very important field for me As Ive stated before my focus is on quality companies at a reasonable price although I appreciate and prefer a strong bargain quality companies rarely go on a fire sale When they do theres often deeper concerns As Buffett and Munger best put it its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price Verizon NYSE VZ is a stalwart telecom firm with continuing growth opportunities trading in a fair price range with potential upside of to its full fair value of per share VZ is relatively cheap currently trading at close to x its y average free cash flow FCF I believe the company has been unfairly punished in what otherwise is a raging bull market due to utility classification and interest rate fears VZ has a strong future in a domestic wireless duopoly with ATT NYSE T and has the potential to lead the way in revolutionizing TV access for new generations Verizon has slowly been transitioning from a growth telecom to a more mature utility structure over the past decade Smart phone adaptation and the higherpriced data plans that accompanied the G and G networks kept the growth story alive but this cash spigot is slowly closing due to a mixture of increasing domestic competition and market maturation Nonetheless VZ has clear bullish upside via enhanced domestic focus new TV initiatives and mostly favorable regulatory trends Verizon has recently been doubling down on its domestic base with last years repurchase of Vodafones NASDAQ VOD stake in Verizon Wireless increasing its wireless network ownership from to This purchase will improve total cash flow at a level that is accretive on a pershare basis for current shareholders and really seems like a nobrainer corporate move I expect cash flow levels on a pershare basis to grow over the next years as a result of this full ownership The downside is that VZ had to issue new shares to pay for the deal and will now also have full capex responsibility The company is also working to build up its digital content library starting with the B acquisition of AOL The AOL takeover gives VZ access to a promising advertising platform and several popular Internet sites including The Huffington Post and Engadget This development should give VZ a stronger digital presence and also help with potential advertising platforms if VZ continues to push its digital TV initiatives While VZ continues to enhance its streaming business it is embroiled in multiple issues concerning its old copper wireline business and FiOS expansion Speculation abounds that VZ could sell its wireline assets for as much as B and use the proceeds to focus on wireless network and video initiatives I view this shift as strongly bullish as I believe the future for wireline cable is lukewarm at best but the future for strong wireless assets and video content platforms is very promising Verizon has attempted to lead the way in cable package reform by offering Skinny TV packages Although VZ was the latest in a pack of companies to offer these lowerpriced alternatives its offering excluded the expensive ESPN channel which has resulted in challenges from Disney NYSE DIS This represents a potential coup in the power struggle between major content providers and cable companies If VZ is able to defeat DIS in the recent legal arena it could gain strong negotiating power by only paying proportionately for indemand channels Consumers would end up getting fewer channels per dollar but would only pay for useful content The company could likely earn larger margins and boost client retention by offering more useful plans to consumers Verizon has sputtered in the past to get involved in the streaming video market including a failed partnership with Redbox NASDAQ OUTR The original service never succeeded due to an inferior content selection and confusing marketing but VZs AOL acquisition opens the door to a future Hulutype structure The Skinny TV initiative is the first potential step towards breaking the backs of traditional content powerhouses like Disney and opening up new streamingbased alternatives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is insanely popular but fails to offer live sports news or entertainment VZ could potentially offer a bridge between the current TV offerings and the more stale NFLX and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN offerings The US domestic market is a perfect example of the massive profits available in a duopoly or triopoly structure For over a decade both Verizon and ATT have delivered quality service and earned tremendous cash flows primarily at the expense of a bumbling Sprint NYSE S and a nonfocused TMobile NYSE TMUS Recently a racetothebottom mindset has plagued the industry as both Sprint and TMobile are offering budget plans free of the oldfashioned year contract system Although this price competition benefits consumers in the short term there is a risk of deterring investment in longterm infrastructure such as rural G and metro G if the profit potential begins to evaporate Just as a monopoly system as seen in Mexico for decades and in the US until the s is extremely inefficient a system of rampant competition spurned by shady spectrum deals and weak infrastructure players also exposes the US to a future of subpar mobile technology The FCC wisely blocked a deal between TMobile and ATT back in one of the few nobrainer decisions similar to the recent block of Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK Time Warner Cable NYSE TWC However I believe the regulatory posturing against a potential TMUS and Sprint tieup could prove to be a longterm mistake Giving the US three major telecom players will benefit both consumers and the shareholders of these three entities Consumers will benefit from quality infrastructure development and service stability while the industry will avoid an unfortunate selfdestruction due to irresponsible players like Sprint note I am a longterm Sprint customer and a previous investor in Sprint I am current long both VZ and T so there may be strong inherent bias here The rampant costcutting by both Sprint and contract changes by TMobile US are leading the US domestic market into a pseudo pricewar for retail mobile consumers I believe regulators will eventually come to their senses and allow what I believe to be an inevitable merger between Sprint and TMobile to occur This merger will allow more stability between the two legacy carriers and a more consumerfriendly TMobileSprint Consolidating the market into three strong players will actually improve legitimate longterm competition and innovation as Sprint certainly doesnt have the financial strength to live up to its infrastructure responsibilities and TMUS lacks the necessary scale to compete for the long term Consumers might temporarily win from the current price war but they will lose in the long term due to a reduction in longterm infrastructure deployment and innovation The FCC continues to offer spectrum carveouts to small businesses of which S and TMUS are the primary beneficiaries but recent moves are promising including lowering the carveouts from MHz to MHz This is the plague of US telecom majors realistic mobilephone penetration is certainly in the range and even the growth from smartphones and data utilization is beginning to slow down Coupled with the aforementioned margin drops the domestic future for both ATT and Verizon is rather weak Although G tablets and connected cars offer a massive source of new connection revenue these price points are typically much smaller than the legacy mobile plans Verizon must focus on proliferation of these devices and be willing to accept smaller margins In the future when every house and every vehicle is connected to the wireless grid even far smaller profit margins will still add to a sizable payout A common argument I hear against investing in higheryielding stocks such as telecoms and utilities is that the stocks are artificially high due to yieldseeking investors The argument is that as the Fed raises interest rates later this year and certainly into stocks such as VZ will lose favor and their price will drop as the dividend yield goes up I covered this argument extensively in a previous article from last March focused on ATT stock but I have included a relevant table on VZ below as well original table designed in March with the green added now Note that the spread to the TNote yield is at nearrecord levels suggesting most of the interest rate risk is already priced in The only other two years with higher spreads were at the depth of the market crash and when the VZ yield was over As Ive previously discussed in my other bluechip articles I prefer to utilize an average price to free cash flow ratio in my valuation targets My broad range is typically from x yield With a company like Verizon that has questionable growth prospects but certainly stable FCF Im looking for a more suitable range of x yield VZ pays an impressive dividend but FCF is the important metric to track The averages are shown in the chart below Taking the more conservative year average and applying a x range results in a fair market capitalization of B to B With B shares outstanding as of March the fair price range for VZ is to VZ is a wellmanaged company with substantial cash flow power Upcoming challenges include increased US wireless competition substantial capital requirements including more expensive spectrum auctions continuing G outlay and upcoming G research and development Due to the uncertainty surrounding the domestic markets and clear challenges in the digital space VZ does not deserve the richer valuation multiples of a firm like Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT or WalMart NYSE WMT However even with a conservative range of x FCF VZ carries a fair value of to This price range represents upside to the current price of substantial upside considering the inherent downside protection via the dividend and strong core assets I am long Verizon and it remains an essential component in my bluechip portfolios I will consider adding to my position in this current pricing range Source Verizon Quality At Very Attractive Pricing Disclosure I amwe are long T VZ MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
