for Twitter NYSE TWTR shares of which are still down on the year despite rallying some from its week lows of Twitter can thank Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT acquisition of LinkedIn NYSE LNKD from spurring the current rally even if SunTrust analyst Bob Peck doesnt believe an acquisition is in store for the microblogging platform any time this year CEO Jack Dorsey isnt necessarily taking the slow and steady path but he acknowledges that the needed changes will take time to implement One of those strategies appears to be streaming content this time with the NBA Previously Twitter had taken up deals with the NFL to stream games but this deal will be somewhat different Twitter will stream nongame programming which will include a pregame show and a so far unannounced other show as well While its still unknown if Twitters efforts in the videostreaming world will help boost MAUs other companies particularly Facebook NASDAQ FB have high hopes for live video going forward Square Eyes Europe Sticking with Jack Dorsey lets focus on his other publiclytraded company Square NYSE SQ Currently Square has operations in the US Canada Japan and Australia But its recent incorporation of Britainbased Squareup Europe is a sign that the mobile payment solutions company could be eyeing operations across the pond as well Given that Research and Markets has forecasted for the mobile debit and credit card reading market to grow at a clip until its perhaps not surprising to see Square considering a move to Europe Squareup Europe has the ability to provide payment services within Britain and the European Union However because of the Brexit vote its not entirely clear how this will unfold in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Has Its Worst Day of but Is It Over Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX tumbled on Tuesday closing at down on the day It marked the worst trading day of for the videostreaming giant But is the fall enough to slow the stocks decline Shares are now down on the year and worries persist over its ability to grow its user base especially considering its valuation at times earnings Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>topped earnings per share estimates and reported inline revenue expectations the company badly missed on subscriber estimates The company expected to add new subs in the US this quarter down nearly from the it added in the same period last year Instead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>added just while international subscriber results of million came in below the companys prior estimate of million As a result analysts are slashing their earnings estimates while Seeking Alpha contributors are out with a slew of new takes We have Peak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>No More Monopoly and Why Its A Good Buy But Maybe the Company Will Be Okay Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>clearly got a big thumbs down from investors Tuesday and really they deserve it after missing so atrociously on subs growth it does have some things going for it headed into the second half of and into For one the company announced early Monday that it would be the exclusive streaming source for the new Star Trek series in nations outside the US and Canada <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also has its streaming partnership with Disney kicking in later this year too Adding to the content mix but surely not enough to significantly soften the blow of Tuesdays selloff <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also announced it will continue with the Making a Murderer series The previous season garnered over million viewers and the company is hoping to build on that momentum Will There Be an iPhone Pro Apple NASDAQ AAPL rumors are far from a rare thing these days especially considering that the Silicon Valley giant has become larger fiscally speaking than many countries Some investors are focused on the companys upcoming earnings report on Tuesday July th but it already seems like the majority of the focus is on Apples upcoming iPhone due out in a few months Reports are now suggesting that there isnt going to be an iPhone Pro announced when the new lineup is introduced in September Two code names Sonora and Dos Palos indicate that a lacking third code name implies that the Pro isnt making the final cut Or is that what they want you to think Everything with Apple is a secret and we know this Really trying to guess what the company will unleash later this year is mostly a waste of time Alas we try More popular rumors have included the removal of the headphone jack and an increase from GB to GB on the base model The Yahoo Sale Will Happen Eventually There are reportedly just a few bidders left who may land the longstruggling tech company Of the five remaining bidders from the final round Verizon NYSE VZ ATT NYSE T Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert Vector Capital Management and private investment firm TPG only a few will get a shot at securing Yahoo Following Yahoos Monday deadline the company is expected to request best and final offers from two or three of the bidders according to Bloomberg Apparently all bids came in above billion with the exception of Verizons which came in between billion to billion because its not looking to buy the companys real estate or its patents Thats part of what makes this sale even more time consuming the fact that its not an allornone approach Whats Really the Biggest Fear With SelfDriving Cars Hint Not Crashing Theres been a lot of concern raised over the recent unrolling of Tesla Motors NASDAQ TSLA Autopilot program So much concern in fact that Germany is looking to bring black boxes to autonomous vehicles While crashing may be the top concern by consumers its not the number one worry for those in the industry Instead its you guessed it cybersecurity Munich Re the worlds second largest reinsurer found that in of survey respondents corporate risk managers were most worried about the cybersecurity of autonomouslyoperated vehicles Given that there is currently no definitive cybersecurity prevention for automated cars this field is ripe for potential and for danger Baidu Faces Investigation Over Potential Gambling Promotions Shares of Baidu NASDAQ BIDU took a slight hit Tuesday falling after the Cyberspace Administration of China said it would launch a strict investigation into whether the Chinese search giant was used by illegal gambling sites to promote their operations Shares of Baidu have already been under pressure stumbling more than this year and roughly from its highs made in late after the issues that arose from Baidu not disclosing its paid and nonpaidfor search results The new limitations weighed on the companys most recent guidance According to Baidu the company is cooperating with authorities but declined to comment publicly on the case The CAC has said it will handle any illegal behavior accordingly Currently Chinese search engines are to refrain from promoting these online gambling outfits Baidu Investors Have Questions Too Its not just the Cyberspace Administration that has questions for Baidu but its investors do as well The companys considered sale of videostreaming platform iQiyicom to another group is considered far too low by Acacia Partners a shareholder in the company Perhaps making matters worse yet or at least more questionable is that this group trying to buy the video unit is being led by its chairman Robin Li The hedge fund argues that the unit is worth billion more than double the billion offer that was submitted by Li and Yu Gong the latter of whom serves as the CEO of iQiyicom Because it competes with Alibaba NYSE BABA and Tencent OTCPKTCEHY Baidu has made the case that the units rising costs are a hindrance to its bottom line Still it seems somewhat odd that despite the rising costs the company would want to exit the video space at a time where many others are looking to get involved The Chinese online video market is also expected to triple by according
