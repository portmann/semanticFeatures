Misconception Disney has failed to succeed at replicating Neflixs ability to get content directly to consumers and that they need Hastings to succeed One major misconception is that the ESPN viewership decline is the end of Disney DIS and that buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Could be Disneys only hope These arguments are taken from a Fortune article entitled The Case For Why Disney Should Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The article quotes Richard Greenfield whose suggestions for a DisneyNetflix merger has been quoted all over the web in the past week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is already a great friend of Disney in fact Iger has repeatedly acknowledged how they are in part responsible for Netflixs success Disney continues to sell more and more content to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>spanning movies and television series while at the same time struggling to get their own directtoconsumer content business offtheground in the UK Greenfield wrote Buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is an awfully expensive acquire but it could be Disneys only hope Quote from BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield To start with the comment that it could be Disneys only hope suggests that Disney is dying as a company But as we showed in the previous article entitled Disney Is In Good hands the notion that Disney is dying is far from the truth First and foremost we showed that all five segments of Disney have been growing revenues at an average of yy in the last five years alone Disney is a billion company that has been growing dividends at an average of in the last years and its stock price has appreciated by in the last decade compared to for the SP These are not metrics of a dying or stagnant company Besides that recent analyst coverage from Piper Jaffray upgraded Disney on March rd from Neutral to Overweight On April th RBC Capital Markets initiated their coverage on the stock with a sector perform In addition to that a survey of brokers by Thomson puts the mean price target for Disney at share or upside which we think is very modest In addition according to Walt Disneys CEO Bob Iger during the Deutsche Bank conference on March th of the decline in ESPN subscribers was not different from what the company anticipated As a result ESPN took initiatives to strengthen their competitive advantage while anticipating a decline in its pricing ability Let me first of all I think putting it in perspective a little bit what were seeing in the marketplace today is not that different than what we anticipated ESPN is always priced robustly our pricing would moderate meaning wed be able to take increases but not at the rate that we were getting them before And with that in mind its actually one of the reasons why we thought about diversifying the company moreSo what we thought we would do is strengthen our competitive position in the marketplace and we did that by licensing great sports for longterm periods of time investing in our content original and live sports and investing in digital which is essentially means not only giving ESPN subscribers an opportunity to watch ESPN on mobile platforms but giving us more touch points with the consumer Bob Iger at the Deutsche Bank Media Internet Telecom Conference on March Walt Disneys decisions to sue Verizon so that they can create a basic bundle that includes ESPN and launching DisneyLife soon after the ESPN incident are decisions that show that they already created plans to mitigate losses from the decrease in ESPN viewership Besides the engine of revenue growth for ESPN is not viewership but advertisers If advertisers decide to advertise elsewhere because ESPN viewership declined then that would be a huge problem for Disney But this is not likely to be the case We also believe that there is still great value in live sports this value in ESPN to advertisers to customers and to distributors Lets not forget that distributors sell local avails in ESPN and they bring in more revenue from ESPN in terms of local avails than any other channel thats out there Therefore as long as the ESPN value proposition remains compelling to advertisers the decline in ESPN viewership will have less impact on Disneys top and bottom line Furthermore ESPN is not going away anytime soon In of all people who had multichannel service watched sports in some form or anotherESPN was accessed in some form by million different Americans not just the channel but all platforms Implying that the decline in ESPN numbers is not because Americans or the rest of the world suddenly developed a hatred for sports Part of this decline is due to basic skinny bundles such as the FiOS Custom TV which did not include sports programming But after Disney sued Verizon NYSE VZ Verizon decided to offer two lowcost basic TV packages one with sports and the other one without We believe that because of the new basic alternatives Disney should be able to recover a good chunk of the lost ESPN viewership Consequently Disney is not a company whose fate rests in acquiring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and the ESPN viewership decline is a setback for the company but it will not destroy the company Another big misconception is that Disney has failed to succeed at replicating Neflixs ability to get content directly to consumers and that they need Reed Hastings to succeed Another article here on Seeking Alpha entitled Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Next For Disney Part I makes similar suggestions as the aforementioned article from Fortune The article states that Disney has failed to succeed at replicating Neflixs ability to get content directly to consumers and that Netflixs Reed Hastings could be a particularly needed executive for Disney In our recent aforementioned article Disney Is In Good Hands we outlined why and how the leaders of Disneys various segments and its CFO are very capable executives who should put the CEO bearish sentiments to rest First Reed would probably be a good candidate but acquiring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would be such an expensive price to pay to hire someone you are not even sure that would be a great fit to Disneys culture Second We cannot at this point claim that Disneys directtoconsumer strategy with DisneyLife is a failure But the issue is deeper than that DisneyLife is not yet part of Disneys revenues Meaning that any extra revenues from DisneyLife will help increase Disneys top line It will be a winwin situation for Disney Lastly Disney has not failed to succeed at replicating Neflixs ability to get content directly to consumers Disney owns a stake in Hulu LLC as of FY end Therefore they have indirectly being able to get content directly to consumers In addition to the Hulu stake Disney launched DisneyLife late last year DisneyLife is a directtoconsumer subscriptionbased streaming service and app in the United Kingdom This means that the assertions that Disney has failed to succeed at replicating Neflixs ability to get content directly to consumers are simply not true More so the assertions that Disney is struggling to get their own directtoconsumer content business offtheground in the UK are premature at this point DisneyLife has been in operation for less than six months in one country and Disney has never given any official numbers on it We launched a directtoconsumer service in the UK called DisneyLife just for those who may not have heard of it and it is movies windowed television shows thousands of episodes music books were a big publisher of noneducational childrens books and some games Its still early I wont give numbers wont even characterize how well its done or not except that we have learned a lot about it Bob Iger Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The Walt Disney Company on March th Meaning that characterizing the service as a failure is not accurate Disney has managed to get content directly to consumers through Hulu and now through DisneyLife The last misconception is that a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>acquisition would create longterm shareholder value First we need to consider what kind of a deal that would look like Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a rich valuation EV of billion billion in total cash as of the MRQ billion in revenues which makes Disneys cash reserves total cash as of the MRQ of billion insignificant Because of Disneys lack of cash reserves for such an acquisition the deal could only make sense as a leveraged buyout LBO Currently Disney has a total debt of billion against billion in cash and billion in revenues Currently Disneys debt is not a problem but if such a LBO occurred it could make Disney too leveraged to be an attractive investment The risks could include It could increase Disneys credit risk resulting in credit downgrades This is because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a successful company and it cannot sell unless the premium is attractive from its current market capitalization of billion Meaning that Disney would have to double or triple its current debt A move that would bring credit risk into the picture It could cripple Disneys ability to borrow money to acquire any new Intellectual Properties IP such as Pixar or Marvel acquisitions Acquisitions have helped very well for Disney and thus distorting its ability to make such acquisitions would diminish longterm shareholder value The acquisition could make Disney an inefficient conglomerate because it currently has too many moving parts and adding something as big as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could make it inefficient hard to handle and most importantly dwindle valuations It is always hard to value companies with too many moving parts Besides conglomerates with too many moving parts are more susceptible to headline risks First we believe that the new skinny bundles which include ESPN should enable Disney to gain back its lost viewers Second Disney is in great hands and has a strong balance sheet to enable it to expand its IP portfolio via both organic and inorganic growth Third ESPN is well positioned to continue generating considerable income from advertisers Fourth the acquisition would make Disney too highly leveraged Fifth there is a premium market opportunity for DisneyLife beyond the United Kingdom This is why we think there is a great potential for a surge in Disneys stock price moving forward Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the
