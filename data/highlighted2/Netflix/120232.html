style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NFLX turned up a phenomenal quarter in terms of subscriber growth but a horrendous quarter in terms of free cash flow Obviously the market values views

their results yesterday afternoon July and the stock has since popped upward by nearly The overall success of the NFLX model depends on what type of analyst or investor is studying the model but obviously the market is in favor of the subscriber growth is all that matters approach In terms of subscriber growth NFLX had a truly phenomenal quarter and Im not attempting to negate any of their achievement there However in terms of cash flow NFLX produced a disastrous business quarter all in effort to continue to promote worldwide growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has burned through more cash in the past six months than in the previous years combined I urge potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>investors to use caution when playing with such a potentially volatile stock The following report highlights the subscriber growth trends and examines the current cash flow bleed Subscriber growth in Q was very impressive surpassing my estimates and even the average analyst projections I have nothing negative to say about subscriber growth Domestic streaming and DVD growth continues to slow on a yy basis but international growth saw a nice uptick I have attached charts below which slow the relative gains Note that domestic subscriber growth continues to slow a bit but is still holding steady around International growth saw a nice uptick from the addition of new markets This lead to an increase in the overall growth rate which is certainly bullish from a subscriber growth only mindset Note that the Q uptick was the first reversal of the collapsing growth curve since international expansion began in The chart below tells the entire story of NFLXs cash flow position During the past months NFLX has burnt more cash than in the previous years combined Despite the stories about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gaining ground or approaching global dominance the business itself is completely falling apart The bullish thesis is that Hastings and crew can quickly jack up subscription revenue just in time to save the business and then eventually earn massive profits The problem is any pricehikes risk a complete collapse for the growth model so NFLX finds themselves in a Catch scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>currently trades on subscriber growth with little regard for cash flow or income figures This cash burn scenario is only getting worse as NFLX continues to push its international expansion Prices hikes across the board the only possible way for NFLX to earn NASDAQ CASH profit are off the table according to Reed Hastings on yesterdays conference call Investors are enjoying a roller coaster ride with euphoria that reminds me of my favorite episode of the Happy Tree Friends caution cartoon violencecomedy This roller coaster ride isnt going to end well for those with blinders Traders and momentum speculators are pushing this stock higher and higher on a more modern variant of clicks and eyeballs and I fear for a massive retail correction once hopes and dreams transition to reality The stock remains absurdly overvalued and is burning cash at a tremendous pace With the current content spend plans for H and NFLX could easily be forced to hit the debt markets again next year The whole situation feels eerily familiar to mid when the entire focus was placed on future Latin America expansion I still remember the forecasts for in EPS by Well here we are in and the EPS will be lucky to hit c Source <span
