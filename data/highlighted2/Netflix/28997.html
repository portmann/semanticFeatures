Despite large nominal gains in subscribers Netflixs financial picture continues to deteriorate Content costs continue to skyrocket and operating expense trends are troubling Cash flows paint a clear picture of financial difficulties despite revenue gains <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX released Q results Wednesday and preliminary market results are very positive I released an extensive analysis of troubling trends and a persistent spin factor on NFLX earlier Wednesday which will be publicly released to nonPRO subscribers tomorrow Ive been a longterm bear since late of NFLX so its easy to get trapped with Bear Goggles and miss the front running and obvious thesis However based on the fundamental trends that Ive analyzed NFLX seems to be headed in the wrong direction on a financial basis and I believe Q is the worst quarter in streaming company history since Q The last time financial results were this bad NFLX tumbled Financial results are bad that doesnt make sense right <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>posted record revenues record subscribers and even turned a profit during strong international expansion Whats not to love Please see below for a recap of troubling trends updated for the Q results Please note I do NOT have accurate numbers on year content liabilities and will not have these figures until the Q is uploaded to the SEC website typically by Friday I am using the B in total content liabilities figure as reported in the most recent shareholder letter All of my numbers come directly from Netflixs most recent Excel sheet The most recent growth figures although still impressive as an unaccompanied headline are the lowest in streaming company history Even with enormous international expansion worldwide subscriber growth is now below yy with an obvious downward trend line This is a company with PE ratios in the triple digits with growth of under Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is becoming increasingly dependent upon international subscribers in an environment which has proven to be difficult on a profitability basis This is hardly a new or niche venture as international subscribers now make up nearly onethird of total streamers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>might be posting large nominal subscriber gains but as shown above the percentage gains are less impressive Even scarier is the massive content spend as NFLX continues to pile huge future commitments by securing premium content through providers such as Disney NYSE DIS and Lions Gate NYSE LGF while also procuring custom content such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black This growth in content commitment has continually outpaced revenue growth and the recent gap is the largest in recent company history This is an extremely dangerous trend that has NFLX placed on risky ground Growth is slowing while content liabilities are exploding Subscribers can quit on any given month while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still liable for their payments This is further proof that the virtuous cycle is a total fantasy Perhaps an even worse trend is the growth in noncontent expenses marketing development and corporate versus revenues While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bulls will continually tout economies of scale the proof is crystal clear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>must pay higher costs each quarter in order to keep growth coming The last three quarters have been the worst trending in streaming company history This discussion is covered in more detail in my previous analysis but NFLX is in trouble when it comes to cash flows The income statement is a misdirection on the current financial realities What follows is a breakdown of NFLXs cash flows with irrelevantmisleading investment gains removed and working capital shifts separately listed Note that Netflixs cash flows are trending in an obviously horrendous direction and that Q is worse than the entire year of If this trend continues NFLX could find itself on the brink of financial ruin I dont have an honest answer for you Even the news seems rather muted as earnings fell below expectations The only positive news I see is that paid subscriber growth was a nominal M additions This number sounds impressive in isolation but it represents the slowest growth in streaming company history Coupled with the aforementioned financial issues theres nothing to applaud and plenty to scorn I also urge readers to check out the bullish arguments for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>the most recent comprehensive argument of which was posted by James Godbout on April Take the time to review the income statements peruse the balance sheet and examine the timing of debt issuances Read all you can find about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and then come to your own informed opinion Please also read my coverage submitted yesterday I urge all interested readers to also read my early article in which I refute Icahns thesis for owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Theres pages of content there of which most is relevant over a year later I am not an investment adviser just a market commentator sharing my thoughts I look forward to a lively discussion below If Im missing the obvious forest for the trees please feel free to correct me If the market is responding the way it is to what I see as abysmal business results I must be missing something Based on what I perceived as clear trends I purchased weekly options to play what I believed would be a disastrous earnings report I got the disastrous earnings but not the market reaction If the stock price holds up I plan to purchase a massive stake in both May puts and January puts I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is one of the
