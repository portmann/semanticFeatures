<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is in talks with the hosts of the popular TV Program Top Gear Top Gear has nearly times as many viewers as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has subscribers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX currently has million subscribers worldwide They are in talks with the hosts and producer of the popular British motoring show Top Gear Top Gear has roughly million viewers worldwide These numbers sound very good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>In recent years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a company best known for streaming movies and TV shows has began to produce their own material Shows such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black have been wildly successful leading to a substantial growth in subscribers Exclusive content like this helps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>draw in new subscribers as well as retain current ones House of Cards which cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>million paid for itself in months proving the effectiveness of this strategy Sticking with the House of Cards example we get to the issue of potentially slowing growth Eventually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will reach a point where they can no longer grow at the current rate that is inevitable I dont see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reaching that point for many years China and India countries that dont have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>were the top two locations for illegal downloaders of the show The fact that there is strong demand for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content in these two countries is very promising for potential expansion in the coming years Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt release total views figures the strong growth in subscribers over the past few years makes it quite clear that the model is working People are going to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for new exclusive content as well as older content The risk associated with it is that nobody will like the content since it is essentially new With Top Gear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has eliminated this risk Top Gear is the most viewed factual TV program in the world with roughly million viewers lets not forget that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>only has million subscribers Furthermore it is the BBCs most profitable program earning million in advertising revenue in Essentially Top Gear is a proven winner With their version of Top Gear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have content that has already proven itself to be world class along with enormous preexisting demand for that content The demand for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Top Gear will be far greater than the demand for any other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will not be producing a show called Top Gear The BBC still owns that name so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wont be getting it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will get the shows three hosts Jeremy Clarkson James May and Richard Hammond as well as the executive producer The BBC will continue to produce Top Gear but without the key players it wont be a viable threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The Sunday Mirror reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is very close to striking a deal Richard Hammond and James May have both refused to work without Jeremy Clarkson This knocks the BBC out of the running for keeping the three since Clarkson is long gone There are reportedly other players such as Sky Network involved but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the only one in negotiations with the three <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a lot to gain from the Top Gear crew but very little to lose They have already established themselves as leaders in the streaming world If this deal doesnt come to fruition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will simply continue with business as usual If the deal does happen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is poised to reap enormous benefits I believe that this deal has the potential to add a lot of value for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and is certainly worth keeping an eye on over the coming weeks Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Poised To Shift Into Top Gear Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned
