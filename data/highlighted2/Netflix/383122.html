service priced at per month a dollar less than the cost of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>According to multiple sources <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is currently dominating the domestic SVoD space with significantly greater mindshare and less churn We believe a debundled Prime Video will skyrocket the platforms US household penetration over the next several quarters We believe AMZN is prepping Prime Video for significant international expansion The pricing structure of the Prime Video and Prime monthly breakouts suggest to us that Amazon will use its video service to entice users to join Amazon Prime Amazon NASDAQ AMZN launched a standalone monthly subscription option for its Prime Video service Priced exactly a dollar less than Netflixs NFLX HD offering this move is clearly intended to directly pit the two services against one another with Prime Video being the cheaper option While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>clearly dominates the domestic SVoD space we believe a debundled Prime Video service will skyrocket the platforms US household penetration We also believe the move suggests Amazon is prepping Prime Video for significant expansion Moreover we believe Amazon will use a standalone Prime Video service to crosssell Prime subscriptions First it should be noted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is currently dominating the SVoD space domestically Research from Parks Associates finds that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has now captured of the US broadband household market while Prime Videos penetration in that market is only More glaringly only of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>sub base has canceled their subscription while the churn rate at Prime Video is This research is corroborated by Nielsen data which shows that of US households have access to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>while only of US households have access to Prime Video Netflixs YY growth also exceeded Prime Videos growth The difference between the two services becomes more stark when looking at a younger audience According to Piper Jaffrays semiannual teen survey of teens currently rent movies through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>while only use Prime Video A similar dichotomy existed when the teens were surveyed about which SVoD service they would use the most over the next five years with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>significantly outpacing Prime Video Some of this dramatic difference can be explained by the fact that Prime Video was bundled into the composite Prime package Prime Video as a standalone option priced a dollar less than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will surely increase domestic competition With more and more consumers intending to cut the cord and gravitate towards OTT options Amazons move to breakout Prime Video is a timely one that will surely increase the platforms US household penetration <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is currently the clear leader in the SVoD space in the United States and the company is only widening its moat through increased original content but the market is still young and growing We would not find it surprising if Prime Videos household penetration rate bolstered to around over the next several quarters putting it on par with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>may have more original content Amazon has a larger content library standard and HD offerings on Amazon vs on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Consumers are literally getting more for less with Prime Videos new offering Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets views Prime Videos breakoff as a significant negative for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>While we do not share this viewpoint because we believe the SVoD customer pool is only growing with cordcutting accelerating we do understand his reasoning and believe it actually supports our point that Prime Video will significantly increase its US household penetration He says only Amazons Video offering has access to K Ultra HD content at a sub price point as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>only has Ultra HD content at its Premium subscription level costing month Furthermore wed note that Amazons Video service offers the ability for users to download content to their tabletssmartphones for offline watching something that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>currently does not have We are also bullish that this offering allows for Amazon to expand Prime Videos international presence Amazon is currently only available in the United States Austria Japan Germany and the United Kingdom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>meanwhile just launched in new countries While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has done a tremendous job of marketing and launching its SVoD service in international markets Prime Video has been largely held back from international expansion because it was bundled with Amazon Prime Now Prime Video is a standalone service at an attractive price point We believe Amazon will take this standalone service and aggressively launch it in new markets Most importantly the pricing structure of the Prime Video and Prime monthly breakouts suggests to us that Amazon will use its video service to entice users to join Amazon Prime Prime Video will cost per month At a pricepoint below Netflixs HD offering we believe this will attract significant interest For only more per month though subs will get access to free shipping Prime prices music and more It certainly feels like a natural progression to pay only more per month to experiment with all of the Prime offerings In essence we believe Amazon will use Prime Video to crosssell other services in particular a Prime subscription This is important because Prime subs spend on average x as much as nonPrime subs on Amazon Overall we remain long Amazon We are bullish on this news of a breakout Prime Video offering In the near term we believe it will skyrocket Prime Videos US household penetration In the long term we believe it strategically leverages Prime Video in international markets and will stimulate Prime sub growth While we do not believe it is bad news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>because the OTT market is growing rapidly we do think it puts the two on more of an equal
