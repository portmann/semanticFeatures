estimate of billion annual revenue from the sale of million Apple ultrahigh definition TV units is highly possible The new price target of Carl Icahn for Apple NASDAQ AAPL is a little more believable if Tim Cook really revives the Apple HDTV product that was allegedly shelved last year Icahns call for Cook to finally enter the surging KUltra High Definition Television industry is in line with my old thesis Selling television sets is a viable expansion move that could help Apple lessen its heavy exposure to iPhone sales According to Mr Icahns estimates Apple could sell million units of inch and inch Ultra HD TV sets The potential revenue from this new product line is billion in and billion in I agree with Mr Icahns idea that Ultra HD TVs could become bigger than the Mac or iPad business I will even go further and say that a smart iOS or Mac OS X Smart Ultra HD TV could prove to be a bigger business opportunity than the Apple Watch I do not think the iWatch could generate billion in sales by end of Smartwatches are not as useful as smartphones there is little incentive for bigspending people to buy them The higher average selling prices of the Apple Watch models also makes them vulnerable to cheaper iPhonecompatible Android watches Furthermore Intel NASDAQ INTC is already helping Swiss watch firm TAG Heuer create a luxury Android Wear watch I opine TAG Heuer has a more powerful brand appeal when it comes to wristwatches The TAG Heuer Android Wear watch will reportedly launch in November with a price tag of around significantly cheaper than the Apple Watch Editions price tags of KGI Securities has already warned its client investors that the Apple Watch is losing steam KGI Securities has reduced its first year annual sales estimate for the Apple Watch from million units down to below million units I find the estimate reduction from KGI Securities Taiwanbased MingChi Kuo who makes his predictions based on Apples supply chain in Asia as more believable than Morgan Stanleys surveybased million firstyear sales estimate for the Apple Watch If Apple did not cancel the development of its HDTV product last year it could be have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the surging demand for Ultra HD TV sets Digitimes reports that cheaper bill of materials costs could help the Ultra HD TV product to hit million units in global shipments this year Supply chain sources reveal production costs for K TVs are just higher than full HD p TVs However the price tags of current Ultra HD K TV sets are still higher than full HD TVs This is great for Apples highmargin policy Technavio analysts predict a CAGR of for Ultra HD TV sales from to Mr Icahns billion prediction for Apple HDTV contribution to Apples revenue calls for an average selling price of This is achievable because Samsung OTCSSNLF LG Electronics and Vizio are selling inchinch Ultra HD TV products Samsung and LG should not remain as a duopoly in Ultra HDTV sales Apples successful highmargin policy for its hardware products will again allow it to sell a inch HDTV for Apple already dominates the premium smartphone sales in America and China North America where Apple is strong is the biggest market for Ultra HD TVs If iPhones can outsell cheaper Xiaomi premium phones in China Apples brand popularity could also help it become a dominant player in Chinas fastgrowing Ultra HDTV industry Xiaomi will soon sell a inch K Smart TV in China However Apple might find it easy to beat Xiaomi with a K Smart HDTV just like how Apple succeeded in getting more Chinese buyers for iPhones over the Xiaomi Mi Apple should listen to Mr Icahn Selling cheap Apple TV boxes is against the traditional highmargin practice of Apple The threat of PopCorn Time also makes the Pay TV service a risky venture In spite of the growing number of subscribers expensive content licensing still makes it hard for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX to make profit margin Mr Icahns call for a Ultra HD TV product is more coherent for Apples longterm growth If we use Digitimes estimate of million shipments for this year and average selling price of the global K Ultra HD TV market could be worth billion this year A CAGR could potentially mean global annual sales of billion for Ultra HD TVs by Apple should not miss this obvious golden opportunity
