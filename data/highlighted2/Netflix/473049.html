class='textDiv'>How <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Plans To Win Back Audiences This Year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Netflixs earnings for Q rocked investors as the news was as bad as advertised Company leadership has told shareholders it is not concerned and will stay the course by focusing on expanding its content at a record rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a slate of new rookies coming up that could return the network to the same level of awards success as it had in the beginning By focusing on quality shows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can help retain more viewers and by spacing out episodes of those series out it could reduce churn We all know Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX Q earnings report was bad Yet we do need to remember this was expected Its not like this completely came out of the blue The writing had been on the wall for a while but many people like to act as if this was new information So with all of that said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>knew it needed to present a case to investors about what it intended to do to win back audiences and calm analyst fears The way to do that was by talking to the press with step one coming at San Diego ComicCon and step two at the summer leg of the Television Critics Association annual conference The message in each case was clearstay tuned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is estimating they will spend all of the billion allocated for content in and head of programming Ted Sarandos had no qualms in saying that number would rise in To some that is essentially him digger himself a deeper hole but personally I do get where hes coming from Sarandos truly believes content is king and in that point hes not wrong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can only survive if it has enough content to sustain itself Plus we all know the point is going to come when the networks and studios decide to scale back what they offer to streaming services What is conveniently overlooked though is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and company are fully aware of that fact and making plans for that eventuality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to spend this money to protect its future and in turn the investment of their shareholders Sarandos reminded reporters this week subscriber growth not ratings drives our revenue and thats an important distinction Third party sites and mainstream broadcast networks are doing everything they can to crack the code around streaming ratings numbers but the point is the numbers really dont matter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>made its bones with original series like House of Cards Orange Is The New Black but then it smartly pivoted to try and appeal to a wider demographic Those type of shows werent necessarily as mainstream and because of that and with no ratings to back them they were perceived as not being as successful Yet they were still needed to feed additional demos Remember perception and reality are rarely in tune in this industry and thats what leads to gossip and rumors Sarandos even pointed out that ridiculousness of the ratings guesstimates because two of the higher profile companies reporting ratings had widely different numbers for the same shows He did concede that globally Orange and the Marvel series were among the best performing as well as acquired series like Breaking Bad and Gilmore Girls Not really a surprise but still when you give out no information any little bit that is officially revealed later is dissected The thing though is that all four of those shows I mentioned above have one thing in common they are quality series And thats the message <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wants its investors to understand They arent in the TV business they are in the quality TV business This late summer and fall will see a rollout of new projects that will be conversation topics and potential awards season contenders The team of Baz Luhrmann Jimmy Smitts and Giancarlo Esposito will look to lure audiences to The Get Down British history buffs are excited to go behind the scenes of the Royal familys early days with The Crown and tons of nostalgic viewers will return in droves to Stars Hollow for the longawaited Gilmore Girls films And Marvel is ready to debut two more series plus its own TVstyle Avengers team up in Combined thats a lot of content that will keep subscribers going along for the ride and possibly reduce the month to month churn that has long dogged premium services in general Yes we know theres a subset of people who only subscribe to HBO during Game of Thrones or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for House of Cards and then drop them when they burn through them The only way to stop that is to keep producing strong content or spread out the top content you have That last part is actually part of a new trend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is trying with The Get Down and The Ranch The streamer is doing splitseasons of these series While there is a strategic element in there the main reason is because of costs The network could either hold all the episodes until they were ready effectively putting the series in purgatory or get the finished product to the masses with a natural breakpoint It also represents the closest thing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has done to bending from the allatonce model they pioneered and steadfastly support Ive always been a supporter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but Im not nave enough to not recognize the network isnt as strong as it once was I do however think this is the strongest roster of rookies theyve had in a while And for what they cost theyd better be The Get Down may be Netflixs most costly show ever and The Crown isnt must cheaper What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does need to realize though is they to need to adapt and that means evolving their rollout model Gilmore Girls creator Amy ShermanPalladino was deadset on each of the four new Gilmore movies being released over the next year but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was adamant they go all at once Thats a missed opportunity Yes it gives them a ton of content for the holidays but thats inviting the churn Whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is getting too smart for its own good remains to be seen but if this crop of content hits the way its first few series did it wont make a difference If it doesnt then the wagons will start to circle even faster Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote
