class='textDiv'>Yahoo NFL make livestream history Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Oct ET By Yoel Minkoff SA News Editor Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO is in the middle of livestreaming todays JaguarsBills matchup for free marking the first NFL game to be available primarily over the Internet The move is symbolically significant for the NFL which wants to start experimenting with digital distribution and likewise for Yahoo which has become very interested in Web video under CEO Marissa Mayer Lets see how many times we receive broadcast buffering issues The only good thing is both Jax and Bills are terrible so you might not have a large demand to watch Well after watching for a quarter I have to admit the quality is not bad Its not as crystal as HDTV and occasionally it looks like youre watching thru a Coke bottle because it auto adjusts the stream based on bandwidth availability I truly think that both AAPL and GOOG execs are watching carefully if it makes sense to go after this market in the future If it does theyll easily outbid YHOO for the rights to air the games like DIRECT TV has done for years How many times you had buffering issues I count zero Think long term here combine yahoos ability to live stream games w their fantasy daily fantasy franchises and you have an extremely powerful and differentiated offering Yahoo has a ton of issues but this represents a bright side Not arguing your point that it is great stuff on the streaming And by the way screen buffering since the hour or so watching with top of the line computerCPU and highest speed UVERSE internet My point is YHOO doesnt have the deep pockets to bid away from their competitors They would have to partner with the likes of an ATT who now owns DirecTV Franky ATT can do this without YHOO You are probably right about the big buys taking it away but at least Yahoo delivered a very high quality broadcast and presentation There may be multiple other companies that would like to have the ability to do this live streaming and would be interested in acquiring Yahoo Yes good job for YHOO today on a professional broadcast which offered Spanish and Yahoo Sports Blog announcers on SAP Others dont need to acquire YHOO for this technology GOOG and APPL already do it far better I do believe that YHOO needs to be relevant Maybe a merger with TWTR Yes good job for YHOO today on a professional broadcast which offered Spanish and Yahoo Sports Blog announcers on SAP Others dont need to acquire YHOO for this technology GOOG and APPL already do it far better I do believe that YHOO needs to be relevant Maybe a merger with TWTR There is some leverage for YHOO in that they are the first and also pushing Fantasy Football and Fantasy Sports Now its about the strategy These first broadcasts are of throw away games the Networks wont pay for Makes perfect sense so far MM has a reputation to make or break Good Luck M for this garbage game Mayer is so in the th inning nobody cares about NFL London anyway If it wasnt for fantasy sports Yahoo and the NFL might be nothing and yet were all here talking about YHOO and watching so we can offer our crit Worth the Mil right there IMO Great quality no buffering issues This will change sports watching completely I can be anywhere there is wifi and watch I see sports fans out and about watching This broadcast is absolutely fantastic Quality in every device excellent Im watching on my smart tv via Roku and Yahoo screen Its just as good as a normal Sunday NFL broadcast Might not be as interesting because it is Jaguars and Bills but everything about the broadcast on multiple devices is excellent This is a very good demonstration of Yahoos ability to produce and stream a live event i watch a fair amount of streaming content foodball is not something i waste my time with and seldom have streaming issues We all know you hate Yahoo and believe its going to zero but so far this streaming experience and broadcast production is stellar YOUVE GOT TO BE KIDDING Money in sports is a phenom I dont understand either but step aside this is bigger than your interests When a sport can win out against head trauma and occasional deaths you think whether you watch streaming sports matters This is investment not emotion and this was a bold step taken before anyone elseand from the results stated here could make it the SAVIOR of YHOO No bashing we know your opinion but its wait and see for me Long and may add to my holdings Can always sell calls against it This is so nice I hope they stream games more Nfl and yhoo need to figure something out that works for both sides In a quick comparison I would say they are putting bandwidth preference to streaming devices rather than on their website The video quality is much better streaming through an apple tv than from my PC and their website Id grade it as a good B on apple tv and a low C on my PC when comparing to high def broadcasts A grade Apple TV some brief dropping of frames and the FPS is noticeably reduced Things I wouldnt notice with proper beer and popcorn accompaniment There appears to be tearing rendering issues on the Yahoo interplay graphic which should be cleaned up PC via website Resolution continually changing sometimes as blurry as video in the late s ranging all the way back to the Apple TV quality But constantly varying with a cycle frequency of about every min The bottom of the image is smeared downward likely to accommodate the screen size versus broadcast resolution Not sure how to describe it but the bottom of the video is just smeared downward As the resolution varies throughout a cycle the smeared region returns to normal at the highest observed resolution All and all if the streaming is consistently as good as observed on the Apple TV this match up of Yahoo and live media sports seems fine enough indeed This is one of the most exciting games you could watch Might be two lousy teams but the game is exciting Turning out to be a GREAT game I bet the viewership is pretty good and it stayed good throughout the game since it is now only a point game with minutes left This is only the first step for yahoo to get into this business I think this million is well spent Now they need to monetize this and make it profitable I think yahoo finally has something going My mistake I meant monetize with better revenue Remember saw from somewhere they had to drop the price from to per ad or something like that Maybe they will negotiate better terms Yes its already happening as most especially Millennial generation are using <span
