Alpha Reportedly there is a deal to extend Netflixs exclusive deal with CW The deal if confirmed is a strong affirmation of Netflixs ability to compete It appears to have limited content cost growth to the industry norm In recent days repeated reports have emerged of an extension nearing completion between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and the CW Channel for exclusive access to all of CWs shows in a syndication window At least one other bidder Hulu appears to have fallen short While not yet officially announced the concurrence of the reports on several important details if born out by the official deal sends an important signal about Netflixs ability to continue competing in an increasingly competitive field Again the deal is not yet official But here is what everyone thinks is happening <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and the CW will extend their existing relationship another five years in exchange for another billion payment from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>over that same period identical in amount to the one negotiated back in The waiting period for CW shows will be shortened from three months to a few weeks giving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a complete season of new episodes only a few weeks after the season finale bows Hulu another CW partner that is currently allowed to broadcast the most recent five episodes of the current season has been cut out completely of the new deal with rolling five rights shifting to CW itself which will show the same five episodes on its own website Content Continues To Command Top Dollar Anyone looking at just the headline figures might think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had actually negotiated a reduction in content costs since the same billion is apparently buying five years worth of shows instead of four and cutting the waiting times to boot But actually not Remember when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>negotiated with CW for the first time it had no existing relationship with the station So when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bought all the shows on the channel it was actually buying several years worth of shows at once If CW has twelve shows in total and they roll over three shows a year for example than Netflixs first deal would have bought shows All shows that were on air when the deal was signed plus three years worth of new shows as they came on That haul reportedly came to more than hours of programming This time there is a preexisting relationship So when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>buys the syndication rights to all CW shows for the next five years it is only buying the new shows that come in every year The others are already covered under the old deal So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is buying five years worth of new shows only for about the price it paid for four years worth of new shows and existing shows back in Unless CW rolls over of its lineup a year it doesnt it still commanded a hefty raise for its content compared to four years ago Despite the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not exactly getting a discount bargain however the deal is still a very positive sign for them In recent months the calls have been growing louder that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is doomed to drown in spiraling content costs as major content studios many of them vertically integrated with the very incumbent distributors that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>competes with hike rates on content to encourage people to retain their existing cablesatellite subscriptions Aside from Netflixs production of its own original content the CW deal is as close as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will probably come to encapsulating all of its answers to that challenge in a single deal First the deal appears to represent no more than an increase of about in content costs or about per year Its a little approximate in a deal with so many moving parts of course But this year CW is debuting four new shows in a schedule with about a dozen scripted shows a year Even adjusting for the fact that not all new shows stick beyond the first season and the preexisting shows discussed earlier the deal is longer for the same dollar amount and carries other benefits like shortened window delays The denominator probably hasnt shrunk very much and the numerator didnt get any bigger That is right in line with the industry norm in recent years which has seen even giants like Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA pay more per year and smaller operators paying over per year At this rate it will be quite a while before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has to worry about being priced out of business against the cable bundle Second the deal was apparently completed despite the entanglements of vertical integration CW is coowned by two major studios CBS NYSE CBS and Time Warner NYSE TWX Either they both signed off on the deal which would augur well for their willingness to complete deals for further content in their own vaults or CW was able to complete the agreement despite pushback from corporate parents which would augur well for the ability of other content producers to complete deals with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>notwithstanding parent company objections That second one would be especially positive for negotiations with NBCUniversal which is now owned by Comcast Nor is that second option out of the realm of possibility No its not very likely NBCUniversals management stormed into Comcast CEO Brian Robertss office one day and demanded he keep his nose out of their business for sake of artistic purity But what has become the standard narrative of greedy cable companies killing any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>deal they dont like has long overlooked one crucial interest group that can issue ultimatums to Roberts and his compatriots the actors writers and directors who make these shows In modern Hollywood creators and artists are never completely separated from their work spiritually or more importantly financially They are paid regular percentage royalties for each subsequent syndication deal and any effort by Comcast and others to steer content away from the best offer simply because it happens to come from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>or Amazon NASDAQ AMZN could seriously harm their relationship with the people who really make television go If word of that got out it would almost certainly affect where those top talents chose to offer their next project But that of course is speculation and I know a lot of people wont risk their money on speculation Thats fine Lets stick to what we know We know that CW is owned by CBS and TimeWarner two companies that have both launched direct streaming competitors to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as well as having a big stake in the existing ecosystem We know that at least one other bidder Hulu which is coowned by the other three major content providers was competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>for the rights If there was ever a deal that the incumbent operators should have been able to kill it was this one We think Again there hasnt been an official announcement yet But it certainly appears that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can still get quality content at a reasonable price or at least at prices no more unreasonable than its competitors And if the incumbents didnt kill this deal they probably wont kill any deal where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the high bidder That is a very positive signal for Netflixs ability to operate in this new environment Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I
