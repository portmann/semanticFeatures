Momentum Shift For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Nobody likes to kick a dog while its down but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX has not traded well since reporting Q earnings on April th There exist many reasons to short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but three factors stand out competition rising content costs and weak technical conditions in a market that cannot seem to find direction The entertainment business is fickle and trends come and go as quickly as the seasons Today movies video and television are available on many various unique and everchanging platforms The rise of movie streaming services particularly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>helped coin the term cordcutting the process of taking market share from traditional cable and broadcast television companies The media landscape contains many players amid fierce competition for revenue and content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>faces competition from Hulu HBO NYSE TWX Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Showtime NYSE CBS and YouTube NASDAQ GOOG just to name a few On the international front the competition comes from everywhere including pirated material In each international market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>must deliver original content and compete with already established or up and coming players The rules will be different in each region and subject to change on a whim In the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>must compete for both content and paid subscribers and any shift in growthrates will change the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bull story and create a cult of bag holders It is not just streaming services and cable television that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>competes with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>delivers content and needs to always be adding or changing the available library in order to produce a compelling product and addkeep subscribers The business model seems fairly simple like a videorental store online and this fastgrowing segment of entertainment has media companies scrambling to create additional streaming services Media giants like Disney NYSE DIS create content and licensing this content comes with a price which can quickly rise in this kind of competitive environment Amazon Hulu and others will be bidding up the price of that content in the coming years Content costs are not fixed costs but rather a variable cost with more moving parts than most commodities As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>grows their subscriber base the company finds itself mired in a conundrum of more is more meaning the more added subscribers especially international equals more money spent on content to keep the library relevant and growing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has been very successful in creating content but can this lucky streak continue for the longterm given the fickle and flighty nature of entertainment trends However if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>attempts to cut content costs than the likeliness of losing or churning subscribers becomes real This conundrum appears as a loselose situation that the market is beginning to come around to Cost of revenue is more than likely to rise as the customer base grows and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs some magic on both the top and bottom line to help turn this margin nightmare around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported earnings twice so far this year and each time the market spoke a little differently but the trend continues down As illustrated above volume speaks volume and NFLX was able to crawl up a wall of worry in late March and early April on relatively low volume The stock popped above its day movingaverage fooling the bulls momentarily then earnings in April dropped the stock back into bear territory in what looks to be a long cruel summer for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The death cross from late February is still in effect and new yearly lows will coincide with the lower blue trend line sometime in June If the market drops significantly weaktechnical cult stocks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will get hit hard and will take that much longer to recover if at all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>does not produce a compelling product or profits like Amazon Facebook NASDAQ FB or Google and over time will not continue to trade at comparable pieinthesky valuations It would take quite a compelling bull thesis to suggest that NFLX has any positive catalyst due in the future Rave reviews of future content will not be enough to move the stock significantly and only a remarkable QQ earnings beat could get the stock moving again but more than likely only runups into earnings can be expected from here with disappointing price action to follow The market could hit new highs this summer but that does not guarantee NFLX participates especially given the amount of sector rotation the market has experienced this year The weekly chart illustrates the parabolic rise of NFLX and the stock never experienced much resistance in early from the to range and once is breached look out below Many other reasons to short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could be explored like valuation profitability debt slowing growth potential cash raise or dilution insider selling market saturation and the law of larger numbers However it should be noted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has never traded at a reasonable valuation but rather as a cult momentum stock That momentum has shifted and astute investors should recognize the weakness for what it is the beginning of a massive shift in sentiment for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix
