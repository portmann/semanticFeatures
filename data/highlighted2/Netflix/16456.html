years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has done incredibly well for itself as both sales and profits have soared due to rising membership As a result of this jump in sales and profits the business shares have also soared and the companys many investors have benefited handsomely While this is good investors who plan to hold on to these shares should remain very cautious about the firms valuation which appears sky high from an earnings perspective With shares up from their week low of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX can easily be considered one of the darlings of Wall Street As management has succeeded in growing sales and earnings at doubledigit rates on an annualized basis its becoming clearer that the companys hold over the movie streaming with a side of television production of course market is almost certain to create an enduring edge over its smaller peers That being said however its starting to look like shareholders of the company have become a little too enthusiastic about the business prospects paying topdollar for a service provider whose earnings may not justify its current market cap Over the past five years revenue growth at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has been tremendous Between and the companys top line shot up or per annum from billion to billion According to the companys most recent annual report this rise in sales has been driven mostly by an increase in the number of paid subscribers combined with higher revenue per member During the past three years alone paid Domestic Streaming members jumped from million to million while paid International Streaming members soared from million to million In fact the only segment to see a decline in recent years has been Netflixs Domestic DVD operations which saw the number of paid members drop almost from million members to million NFLX Revenue Annual data by YCharts Due to the growth in sales the company saw a meaningful increase in profits as well Between and Netflixs net income jumped from million to million Even as customer count grew the business net income could not keep up with sales due to two reasons Domestic DVD operations and large growth internationally Surprisingly Netflixs highest margin segment is actually its Domestic DVD segment which reported a contribution margin of in compared to the contribution margin of the business Domestic Streaming segment Meanwhile its International Streaming segments results were even worse with a contribution margin of for the year Though this represents an improvement over the margin seen a year earlier its important to note that the segments poor performance has been driven by a combination of a high cost of revenue in relation to sales and a strong emphasis on marketing by management Despite strong growth a big concern remains Absent some corporate catastrophe its almost certain that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue to dominate the movie streaming market That being said however it seems as though investors might have gotten carried away with how much value this will create for the company in the long run a classic mistake made by growthoriented investors You see using its most recent years profits shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are trading pretty high with a PE of This means that if earnings dont grow moving forward it would take investors years to make their money back on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Certainly this kind of scenario is extremely unlikely but it goes to illustrate how much investors are paying for growth Put another way if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to grow its earnings at the per annum it has over the past five years it would take investors over years to make their money back Thats an awfully long time to wait With free cash flow in the red over the past two years its difficult to make a reasonable argument for valuing the company on a cash flow basis so the only other way and an inefficient one at that since the business is a serviceoriented one to value the company is through its book value Using this method we also arrive at a pretty hefty valuation with the market placing a worth on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>equal to times the value of its assets less liabilities This is incredibly high but isnt unreasonable for a serviceoriented company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>that is experiencing strong growth and which happens to have a pretty attractive economic moat Moving forward its almost certain that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will continue to thrive and investors who hold its stock for the next years will probably be happy That being said the nearterm and mediumterm risk for shareholders is that the business shares might be tremendously overvalued As a value investor who likes to buy companies on the cheap for the long run this isnt my kind of holding but for longterm growth investors who dont mind significant upswings and downswings it may not be a bad prospect Source Why Investors In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Should Be Cautious Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
