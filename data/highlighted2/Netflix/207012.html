missed on both revenue and subscriber growth estimates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX made news this week when it delivered its thirdquarter earnings report The company reported disappointing revenue and subscriber growth and as a result the stock dropped over on the day NFLX has been a very popular momentum stock not just among individual investors but by ETFs as well There are ETFs that currently have at least a weighting in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Some are significantly higher than that and any ETF that had a large exposure to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>on Thursday likely had trouble matching the broader markets performance Each of these ETFs is primarily technology and Internet focused and as a result is riskier than the average broad equity market fund Keep in mind that these weightings can change over time but if youre looking for exposure to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>these ETFs would be the place to start PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio NASDAQ PNQI weighting While this ETF has the largest weighting of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock in its portfolio it shouldnt be too surprising given how concentrated this portfolio is It has positions in the portfolio but the top holdings account for of the funds assets In fact NFLX is only the th largest holding Despite its significant weight in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>this ETF still performed comparably to the NASDAQ on Thursday It was up compared to the NASDAQ gain SPDR Morgan Stanley Technology ETF NYSEARCA MTK weighting In this ETF <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the top dog With just holdings this fund is also concentrated but weightings tend to be distributed a little more evenly This fund has the added benefit of also being one of the cheapest Its expense ratio falls well below the average ETF ratio The heavy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>weighting helped weigh down this ETFs performance Thursday It managed a gain of just on a day when technology stocks as a whole moved broadly higher First Trust DJ Internet Index ETF NYSEARCA FDN weighting Another concentrated technology ETF this fund has nearly of assets in its top and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is just the rd largest holding here This fund is easily the largest among the ETFs on this list at nearly billion in assets so this fund will be the most liquid and easiest to trade First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index ETF NASDAQ SKYY weighting As an ETF index provider ISE is probably better known for the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF NYSEARCA HACK thats garnered over billion in assets in a short period of time but this fund is slowly gaining notoriety in its own right This funds composition is fairly similar to the Dow Jones Internet Index Fund concentrated and roughly equal weighted but its significantly smaller and hasnt performed nearly as well Ark Web x ETF NYSEARCA ARKW weighting Heres where we start getting into the really small ETFs This fund has just million in assets and is very thinly traded Typically trading just a few hundred shares a day liquidity is a significant issue and the costs of trading may be too high Despite the fact that ARKW is about a year old but hasnt really caught on it still makes the list for its large position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Ark Innovation ETF NYSEARCA ARKK weighting This ETF also from the Ark Investment Management family is even smaller than the one listed above with just million in assets Pretty much everything mentioned above with the Web x ETF
