subscriber growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is exhibiting multiple dangerous trends in both opex and content cost growth This article rehashes previous work midApril and applies a balanced earnings model to the streaming business NFLX is priced to perfection success rate of business model at sh Two weeks ago prior to and following earnings I wrote articles claiming the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NFLX bull thesis is profoundly flawed and highlighting the disastrous financial trends behind Q earnings Obviously the market was enthralled with the net subscriber additions and decided to worry about financials another day I wont repeat my short position with articles within weeks all rehashing the same talking points but I did promise my readers a financial model illustrating what a perfectly executing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would look like Absent any phenomenal news Ill likely wait until after Q earnings to update the model projections I wont repeat the exact contents of the other writeups but in summary I see NFLX as facing clear yy subscriber growth while spending record amounts on subscriber acquisition Content liabilities have grown faster than revenues in all but one quarter Q of streaming existence During the past three quarters Q Q Q growth in noncontent expenses have skyrocketed suggesting NFLX is getting desperate to fund growth Each of these trends is shown with clear charts preearnings and postearnings For this article Ive focused on a few additional deep trends with a more neutral take on the sustainability of Netflixs business model Ive included two bearish takes and two neutral indicators of the ongoing growth and scaling results Despite the NFLX sleight of hand via contribution margin streaming has long been a moneylosing business However to the credit of management significant progress was made until Q The trend then reversed and is now flatlining Despite the growing revenue scale NFLX has yet to turn the corner as both opex and content costs continue to climb at a faster pace Despite Netflixs success at turning a bottom line profit mostly due to the power of the DVD business free cash flows have struggled Also note the last input is a quarterly reading while the first three are annual readings If continues along this line it could be a very painful year for the balance sheet Nope This isnt really a bearish chart Im including this to highlight what I view as one of Netflixs best areas of control total liabilities per subscriber Although content liabilities are now higher than they were last year the overall trend is clearly downward If NFLX can keep costs in the sub band while also increasing monthly charges there is a chance of achieving profitability This chart can be interpreted in many ways but Im clearly seeing lower peaks and less dips flattening cost fluctuation If NFLX can hold subscriber acquisition to a bandwidth then the growth expenses should at least be manageable The cause for concern is the yy growth in Q Q and Q clearly fueled by European expansion It will take Q results to see if the lower peak trend continues When I started the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>model around weeks ago I was trying to approach the valuation from two avenues One model what I perceived as realistic revenues and expenses and determine a terminal value Two create a feasible model that justified the current share price In the end Ive attempted to merge the two together Ive included many bullish aspects such as persistent blended price increases reduced content growth and flat interest expense Ive been slightly more neutral in my subscriber growth estimations and marketing expense calculations Ive modelled growth on a yy trend as opposed to a qq with a seasonality factor built in As shown the seasonality naturally comes out based on the established trends I believe my yy growth figures are pretty balanced but definitely open to input Ive included the potential impact of yearly price hikes blended quarterly due to churn and grandfathering On the international front Ive given NFLX the benefit of the doubt on breakneck expansion through followed by healthy growth thereafter settling on a yy run rate Ive included price hikes but at a slower pace than seen domestically These price hikes are aggressive considering the multiple settop box partnerships NFLX has developed that involve month free trials and royalty payments While I see international subs potential doubling within years I dont see subscribers or revenues surpassing the mark for several more years In these charts Ive been extremely generous with content COGS annual growth versus historical GA spend yy versus historical and interest costs flat versus clear expansion trend Ive been more neutralbalanced with marketing and TD expenditures following the subscriber growth trends Each year highlights the pretax earnings from the consolidated business At pretax for CY roughly EPS assuming blended liability discounted at for years and with a robust PE the NFLX streaming business is worth sh Assuming NFLX is able to beat the current negative trends in both content growth and noncontent opex growth ie the virtuous cycle starts appearing while maintaining current subscriber growth trends AND managing to raise the monthly subscription prices at a healthy clip without disturbing growth NFLX is fully priced success rate of current business model at sh Keep in mind the assumes zero room for error in any facet Slower growth slower price hikes higher content expense higher interest expenses or any other multitude of changes could negatively impact these projections This model also assumes that future competition has zero to negligible impact on NFLXs subscriber growth curves and negligible impact on content cost curves I welcome a lively discussion andor competing models I also think Eric Przybylskis article from April nd offers a good take from a slightly more bullish angle Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Priced Above
