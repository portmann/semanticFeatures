Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to show definite progress in its international segment Activist investor Carl Icahn sold out his entire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stake last month making about a billion gain Investor David Einhorn said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is more driven by spending than earnings It should be an exciting week for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Shareholders will be in for a ride as well Earnings are coming out and a few big investors have already made their views known as to where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>earnings and the share price may go Activist investor Carl Icahn cashed in his chips and sold his last remaining stake in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in June Having made as much as billion possibly from his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>investments he may have just declared it as mission accomplished and felt it was time to move on Perhaps he saw some of the froth that he commented about in the market generally in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>share price He sold his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares in late June at about the same time he said the market was overheated Only time and the next <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>earnings report will tell if the stock is going to swoon Another activist investor David Einhorn was a little more direct about his view of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>In his quarterly letter to shareholders he wrote Practically NFLX changed its story and pushed its promises into the distant future with grand hopes for the decade starting in It transitioned from being a company judged by how much it earns into a company judged by how much it spends Hes lamenting about Netflixs growth story but could it also be the first salvo of a shortsell My view is that barring some big breakthrough to offset sour quarterly results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares will go down Investors have made good returns off of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The stock is up over the past months They will probably take another weak quarter as a good reason to take their winnings off the table If youre a believer of the longterm growth story of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>then you actually want this to happen A selloff shakes the weak hands out and once most of the sellers are gone that leaves only the buyers to push the price back up Despite all the market speculation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>keeps trucking along because its busy becoming the worlds biggest video streaming company Right now Netflixs international segment business only generates about of revenue yet the growth rate of quarterly revenue was over yearoveryear in Q Thats more than double the rate for the US market As an online company the video streaming company doesnt have to worry about store networks so it should be growing as fast it can overseas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>knows it makes very good business sense to make its own original content to have exclusive rights to programs and films and it is following that strategy now in foreign languages too Just within China and India alone there are already close to billion people online Thats nowhere close to the total populations of the two countries but just those existing users outnumber the US users over three to one Even a small portion of those markets is huge When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>arrives in some countries its like the proverbial pound gorilla showing up In Australia with a total population of almost million local streaming video providers were preparing for Netflixs arrival like a hurricane was about to land However as much as China and India may be interested in watching some US TV shows and films it may be hard for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to penetrate their markets to a significant extent Case in point when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was considering partnering up with Alibaba NYSE BABA in preparation to launch in China soon after Alibaba announced it will start its own video streaming service Tmall Box Office and become like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in the United States What a welcome But thats business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has begun making original TV shows in Spanish and will stream the first of episodes of Club de Cuervos in August That could be a good draw for new subscribers in Latin American countries as well as attract Spanishspeaking Americans Foreign language original content would open up the door of a new countrys internet market wider Goldman Sachs projects <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have million international subscribers by or over five times what the company had in Q On the other hand the investment bank is only forecasting million domestic market subscribers five years from now versus the million in Q Clearly the growth will be coming mostly from abroad Goldman Sachs put a price target on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>saying it projects the company will replicate itself internationally within two years I would agree with that logic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is acting as the first mover entering new markets while its competitors are for the most part acting more defensively just to protect their own existing market The advantage stays with the offensive side so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have the momentum to grow earnings As for this next earnings report if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>sells off wait for the dust to settle and pick up the stock at a cheaper price Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Keeps Pushing Ahead With International Efforts Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
