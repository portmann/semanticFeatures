Office a video streaming service in the next couple of months Subscription adsupported streamer will take on free content providers in growing cordcutting market Model allows for adrevenue support which differs from NFLX and may make it difficult for them to enter the market NFLX down on June high investors should now look at BABA for how the market will respond to a native player <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX isnt even in China yet and the road to establish itself in the Middle Kingdom has already gotten more difficult with the news that Alibaba NYSE BABA will be offering a video streaming service of its own starting in a couple of months Named TBO or Tmall Box Office after its affiliated thirdparty brand retailer it will stream Chinese TV shows and movies as well as inhouse entertainment to customers for either a monthly subscription or a showbyshow fee While Alibaba will still have the same market challenges <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will in trying to convince a free contentloving populace to pay for content it will also have a first mover advantage over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>enabling it to offer content and gain customers in this space as a native company This will either prove there is a market for this kind of service and competition can be valued or its so competitive with the numerous free streamers that Alibaba will either struggle on its home turf or carve just enough of the market for itself This could pose a potential problem to Netflixs business model which is assumed to follow the same formula as it would elsewhere in the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will typically offer a day trial for new customers and then charge month for streaming access Without advertising revenue to fall back on which represents of streaming revenue in the country <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is more dependent on subscriptions than TBO will be forcing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to either set a lower price for its subscriptions or make major investments in Chinaspecific programming to both create additional value for money and to be on the right side of an often rigged government regulatory system At the same time though Alibabas initial entry into this space could give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a chance to observe how the market reacts to this new entrant rather than being the new entrant themselves Alibaba is a recognized company in the country and its affiliate Wasu Media Holdings is also Netflixs partner for license acquisitions for its own streaming service Judging by how many customers opt for the subscriptions rather than staying with established free players or the of content that isnt behind the pay wall will inform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>of the feasibility of its own business model leading to adjustments as necessary This will enable the company and its investors to see how much revenue can be gained from a market dominated by free services as well as how high the costs might be compared to other potential markets such as Japan and Southern Europe which will affect Netflixs profit targets for the next couple of years Given how Alibaba is able to fall back on advertising revenue if the subscription service doesnt pan out and how its affiliate will get a chunk of the profits from Netflixs eventual China entry TBO changes the investment outlook Alibaba now becomes the company to watch for Q and Q to see if it can get some momentum going from their streaming service as well as to judge the near billion yuan streaming market in the country to see how it responds to a paying entrant The news of this release dropped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>down in June trading from its morning high though it has since recovered which showed that investors took Alibabas China push seriously Any future developments with TBO will affect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as well since it will be a litmus test of the feasibility of two subscriptionbased entrants in a crowded market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has other markets that it can lean on which is why investors should look to wideopen Japan more than here but since the recent hype has centered around China some may be disappointed if the market demand doesnt meet early expectations
