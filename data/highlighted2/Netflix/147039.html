class='textDiv'>Can Apple Burst The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Bubble Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple is expected to begin offering a package of cable and network TV channels as part of a new Apple TV Apple can build on this video streaming service to create a curated ondemand service similar to Apple Music Recent comments by Apple Music honcho Jimmy Iovine suggest that Apple NASDAQ AAPL will extend the music streaming model to video content as well Apples entry into streaming video would provide the most effective competition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX has had and probably demolish its overheated PE Apple Music can be thought of as a test case for a broader transition out of Apples iTunes purchaserent download model for content delivery When Music debuted I had speculated that it would pave the way for a video streaming service This was only a natural expansion given what iTunes has become This was largely confirmed by Iovines comments in his recent Wired interview We all know one thing we all have different television delivery systems dont we all wish that the delivery systems were better as far as curation and service In almost the same breath Iovine begged off tackling the video job He has his hands full with Music But his comment makes clear that if Music succeeds Apple will leverage the same approach of human curation as a discriminator in its own video streaming service Assuming that Music is successful Music got off to a rocky start but has managed to garner million subscribers during the free trial period Apples Eddie Cue has acknowledged the problems and stated that Apple is moving as fast as possible to fix them Of course Apple is moving as fast as possible It probably needs a much larger subscriber base to make Music profitable Apple is estimated to have content costs per streamed songs of in the form of royalty payments to labels and music publishers Apples royalty payments came out during the Taylor Swift fiasco regarding payments to artists A thousand songs represents about hours of programming per day during a monthly subscription How much artists make per subscription depends on how much a typical subscriber listens to the service At hoursday average Apple is paying about half of subscription revenue to labels and publishers This means that Apple would make approximately per subscription per month Would millionmonth be enough to cover Apples operating costs personnel server operations and maintenance software development for the service Probably not Its more likely that Apple Music needs roughly millionmonth after content fees to break even or roughly double the current subscribers This would put Apple Music on par with Spotify which claims over million subscribers At million subscribers Apple gets into its normal operating margin comfort zone of So Apple Music has a long way to go but with an iOS user base of million my personal estimate Apple has a large pool of prospective clients for Apple Music Assuming that Apple makes break even on Music with about million subscribers this will constitute a goahead for the streaming video service Probably Apple already has a prototype service in development under RD ready to be deployed for product testing purposes once Apple management gives the goahead The potential market for the streaming video service is much larger than for Music if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is any indication As of the June quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported that it had over million streaming subscribers for yy growth The robust growth in its subscriber base has not been accompanied by equivalent growth in revenue up yy or operating income down yy Operating costs for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>have climbed yy as it has rapidly expanded globally in order to maintain its rate of subscriber growth The decline in operating income hasnt bothered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to be one of the most highly valued tech companies with a PE of according to Google Finance Although the subscriber base of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is larger than competitors such as Amazon Prime estimated to have million members I believe that the potential for internet video delivery so called Over the Top OTT is much larger In fact I believe that OTT will eventually supplant broadcast TV in the forms of terrestrial over the air cable and satellite This makes the ultimate target market much larger than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has achieved The FCC has estimated that of US households or over million are served by a Multichannel Video Programming Distributor MVPD such as cable or satellite Eventually I expect all of these users to be converted to OTT video delivery in some form as I described in Apples New Television Opportunity Various rumors about the next Apple TV OTT content distribution negotiations with broadcast and cable content companies and Iovines comment in the Wired interview substantiate the expectation that Apple intends to exploit its OTT opportunity Apple has the scale to do that in a way that hasnt been done before The entire subscriber base of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is roughly equal to the number of iPhones Apple sells in a good quarter Apple has a very large captive audience in its iOS user base An official announcement of an Apple OTT service could come as early as the expected iPhone event next month There are rumors that the new Apple TV will be launched then as well Initially the OTT service may not be much competition for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>It is expected to be a slim package of cable and over the air broadcast channels offered in a live streaming format that essentially mimics the cable experience The initial OTT service will form a platform on which Apple can easily build an ondemand service to rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>The OTT service will allow Apple to deploy much of the infrastructure that it will eventually need for the ondemand service When Apple goes ahead with the ondemand service the impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>valuation could be devastating Thus far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has not faced serious competition that could curtail its subscriber growth Apples entry into the ondemand video streaming category will provide that competition Disclosure I
