About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NFLX Includes AMZN DIS DISH GOOG GOOGL LGF SNE TWX by WestEnd Competitive outlook the key risk for NFLX in Expect domestic subs growth to be subdued while international subs to be steady <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX certainly had a good year in with the stock up vs the NASDAQs At x forward earnings the current valuation is priced for perfection as we head into what I believe will be a rocky for the company as growing competitive risk will weigh in on domestic subs growth and slowerthanexpected international penetration could impact the companys overseas growth plan Although OTT companies are positioned to benefit from the cord cuttingshaving trend we saw among the US cable companies in it is important for investors to distinguish that NFLX is only one of many OTT products available in a maturing US market That said I would be cautious on NFLX in and prefer to stick with the content owners namely Disney NYSE DIS Lions Gate NYSE LGF and Time Warner NYSE TWX rather than the distribution pipes First NFLXs Q domestic subs miss could be the start of a structural trend due to the growing competitive environment in the companys domestic market from rivals including Hulu Amazon NASDAQ AMZN HBO and web TV alternatives including Sony NYSE SNE Vue and Sling TV NASDAQ DISH The US is perhaps the most mature and OTT saturated market in the world driven by the shift in viewer habits that resulted in diminishing viewership of traditional media NFLX was certainly the leader with this trend and is one of few companies that successfully migrated its business model to digital Others such as Blockbuster were not so lucky Although NFLX had the first mover advantage the US market is becoming increasingly saturated and I see NFLX gradually losing its competitive advantage and appeal as viewers migrate to alternative platforms With an estimated of US TV household cutting the cord and migrating to OTT services US viewers have more OTT options than before and the availability of competing services does not bode well for NFLX which was widely considered the OTT platform before the cordcutting trend materializes Second not only the number of competitors has multiplied but also the quality of competition has increased with YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Hulu and HBO being the three likely candidates to grab NFLXs subs share in the near term while AMZN has the shot of taking shares in the long term YouTube is perhaps the biggest threat to NFLX with over a billion monthly active users on the platform which has the monetization capability of either ad based andor subscription based The billion plus user along allows YouTube to negotiate favourable content deals similar to how NFLX was able to leverage its m or so subs to negotiate key contents such as EPIX a few years back Besides YouTube HBO is perhaps the second biggest threat to NFLX with roughly m cable subscribers globally and an estimated m HBO GO subs At month HBO GO is priced above NFLX but many would argue that its original programming is one of if not the best out there With HBO finally becoming a standalone platform those NFLX subs who prefer HBO can no churn off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and move onto HBO while still maintaining a reasonable cable bill Hulu is another interesting platform that is positioned to replace NFLX among the mainstream audience Content from Disney DIS Fox NASDAQ FOXA Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA and Time Warner already makes it a competitive platform and I believe that it is matter of time before DIS decides to stream ESPN on Hulu given the eroding ESPN subs base over the past two years In my view a decision by DIS to distribute ESPN content on Hulu such as live streaming would be the biggest negative for NFLX Conclusion competitive risk is certainly looming on NFLX and as an investor I would be cautious on all of the content distributors given their lack of technological edge Instead I am more comfortable owning the content owners such as Disney Lions Gate and Time Warner given their superior market power
