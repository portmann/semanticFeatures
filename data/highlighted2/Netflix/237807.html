class='textDiv'>Netflixs Future Looks Bright But It Should Not Be Limited To TV <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Pim Keulen Follow me on Twitter clicks Netflixs international subscribers growth will be lifted by developments in Australia Going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should think of alternative ways to diversify its content and service A Seeking Alpha contributor already suggested <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>going into sports <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX trades well above per share today after a temporary slowdown last week Investors seem to be happy about better than expected subscriber numbers in Australia Netflixs international success follows some doubts regarding its domestic subscriber growth in the most recent third quarter Much has already been said about Netflixs future and I agree it does look bright One of the better articles I read on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was written by Seeking Alpha contributor Alex Cho Cho argued that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>besides pricing leverage might explore the opportunity to broadcast sports in the future This is a nice outofthebox idea which could really fit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>business model going forward Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is investing heavily in exclusive content I find that this is a wise development as it lowers the companys dependence on content licensing deals with other parties Earlier this month Time Warner NYSE TWX stated that it is considering to hold on to their broadcast rights longer before granting a license to streaming services Although I consider Netflixs business model and original content strong enough to withstand the growing constraint in content from third parties at this point this development might become a risk for the companys business model in the future To limit the risk of less available content in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should diversify in this early stage That is why I find Chos idea about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>expanding into sports an interesting one There is another risk that could threaten Netflixs business model and growth in the future The number of full package streaming services is growing With full package I mean services that offer a collection of streaming services The best example of such a service is Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Prime A Prime subscription includes both TV and music streaming eBooks online storage and more As strong as Netflixs business model with original content is it remains a streaming service focused on television movies series etc With or without the expansion to sports this is relatively limited and comes with a higher risk than more balanced services that offer a broader range of services for example Amazon Prime One way or the other I believe that Netflixs growth scenario would become more solid when the company decides to diversify into a service that offers more than just television streaming services A while ago I wrote a blog arguing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and music streaming service Spotify would actually be a good match I am not saying that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should buy Spotify immediately as its price tag would be quite high But just consider the potential going forward First of all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will add another high growth streaming market to its streaming business Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>creates an opportunity for cross selling music streaming subscribers could add a television streaming subscription or the other way around Last but not least <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will face the increased competition from full package services like Amazon Prime The combination of a full service television and music streaming service would also mean that subscribers do not have to switch services if they want to change from a movie to listening to music This makes life easier and it should be a real plus for potential subscribers to choose <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>over other standalone television or music streaming services In my opinion it is not a question of why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should to it but more a question of when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should do it At this point the company is investing in original content and international expansion A major acquisition or startup of a second streaming service will take a significant amount of the available cash from investments in the television streaming service Therefore it makes sense it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will wait for a move into another market for example music Let me be clear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a strong company and the growth of its television streaming both nationally and internationally is far from over However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could deliver additional growth and pricing power if the company decides to diversify and offer other nontelevision streaming services in the future We
