Editor Mohit Manghnani Get ready to buy high quality stocks China is a big market for Apple and is going strong Stocks discussed on the indepth session of Jim Cramers Mad Money TV Program Friday September Forget the Fed guessing game for the time being is the advice that Cramer wants to give investors Would it be so terrible to focus on the real prize buying the stocks of companies we like for the long term when they are being pulled down by shortterm worries like the ones generated by the Fed meeting he said Once China is back on its feet and Europe is strong the Fed will raise rates eventually The fears driving the current market are no wage growth and the Chinese government selling US treasuries With that Cramer discussed his game plan for the week and called it the Fedfree zone Lennar NYSE LEN NYSE LENB reports on Monday and so far the stock has done well during the year Cramer recommended buying the stock on positive commentary from the company AutoZone NYSE AZO has a history of reporting good numbers and buying back its stock Cramer recommended buying the stock on weakness after earnings Carnival NYSE CCL also reports on Tuesday and Cramer expects the company to report good numbers as he is bullish on new CEO Arnold Donalds work ConAgra NYSE CAG and Darden Restaurants NYSE DRI are both good companies which are bringing out value due to activist investors The new General Mills NYSE GIS is more natural and organic and has a great dividend Cramer recommended buying the stock Accenture NYSE ACN I have been remiss in not telling you to buy shares in this giant every time they fall Yes its that good said Cramer KB Home NYSE KBH reports Thursday and if it misses and pulls down the rest of the group investors can take advantage and buy Lennar at lower prices Nike NYSE NKE is one of the best performing stocks of the Dow and Cramer will be watching closely on what the company has to say about China Bed Bath Beyond NASDAQ BBBY has been buying its stock like crazy and hasnt done much when it comes to earnings Finish Line FNL reports on Friday and Cramer thinks that opportunity could come knocking for this stock as Nike tells a good story CEO interview <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is the video streaming giant that allows streaming of TV shows movies and original programming The company has transformed the way TV is consumed The stock is up for the year which shows that even in a bad market the stock is staying strong Cramer interviewed CEO Reed Hastings to discuss all about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in a special part executive decision segment When asked about the growth of stock over last years Hastings said that Its really the Internet The Internet is transforming so many sectors of our economy and we are Internet TV and that sector has grown from very small years ago to starting to be significant now He expected the Internet to be a fast growing industry when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>started as it allows incredible consumer experience He also predicts that in the next to years TV will be all internet Commenting on the success of original content he said that its all about data analytics We are just a learning machine Every time we put out a new show we are analyzing it figuring out what worked and what didnt so we get better next time said Hastings The stock has also pulled back recently and Cramer asked if this gives investors an opportunity to buy in When you get this kind of retreat in the stock historically as I always tell you through thick and thin its been a terrific buying opportunity Worst case it goes lower and you can buy more at even cheaper prices before it rebounds added Hastings Cramer posed a question on the worries that hit the street when Disney NYSE DIS posted a subscriber loss as people were cutting the cord for services like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>There are a few people that have cut the cord but it is very very small still today But its a worry about the long term said Hastings On expansion Hastings said that since they have to bid for the content they are going country by country The sports networks have been successful in maintaining their audience and ultimately shift to the ondemand model where consumers will be able to watch any game on any device in the future Cramer asked Hastings if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is antitheater and Hastings said that the company is now the antitheater and is only a small part of Hollywood but they believe in offering both choice and convenience to consumers Money managers who bet on the wrong side of the Fed decision went liquidating their positions as the Fed did not raise rates Remember some stocks are getting hammered simply because they need to have the Fed raise rates particularly the financials which happen to be the largest sector in the SP said Cramer He added that Wells Fargos NYSE WFC CEO also thinks that rates could remain low longer than expected Cramer also thinks that the market has a flawed mindset that crude has to go higher for the markets to rally The reality is that companies benefit from a lower oil price I remain convinced that companies with secular growth meaning growth that is not dependent on a stronger economy can blossom said Cramer He added that investors will be willing to pay for stocks with higher PE multiples as long as the company has consistent growth Hence Adobe NASDAQ ADBE rallied on Friday on a healthy cloud subscriber growth Cramer said that investors should not worry about the selloff on Friday as it could have been worse if the Fed had tightened the rates causing overseas turmoil and hitting home builders and autos Now investors should be ready to buy some highquality stocks at bargain levels on the next leg down which wont be very deep CEO interview Workday NYSE WDAY Workday is the cloudbased provider of software for human capital management payroll and financial management It gives companies applications to automate their back office nonrevenue functions The stock got hammered during the August selloff as analysts were worried about weaker than expected billings guidance Cramer thinks that the fears are overblown and the stock is off its highs He interviewed coCEO Aneel Bhusri to hear about the road map of the company I think Wall Street derives too much from calculated billings because terms change from quarter to quarter We feel like we are going to have a very strong second half of the year The pipeline looks strong and customer satisfaction is high said Bhusri All the longterm investors want the company to keep taking market share even if it comes at the cost of profit and the company has a goal to reach B in revenue The company reports free cash flow every quarter and is not at risk of running out of money Bhusri was excited about new financial products as the pipeline has doubled in the last quarter and a lot of Fortune companies are using them Is it worth buying gold now Cramer recommended always having some gold in a portfolio and it can be done via owning Gold Trust ETF NYSEARCA GLD Apple NASDAQ AAPL China is quite strong for Apple and Tim Cook said the sales were strong The Chinese consumer is better than the stock market RiteAid NYSE RAD People panicked when the company reported Its giving another chance to get it BlackRock NYSE BLK Nothing is wrong with the stock Let this one come in and I dont expect the stock to rally in this environment as the rates remain lower Palo Alto Networks NYSE PANW Its in the secular growth area of cybersecurity which is a multiyear story The
