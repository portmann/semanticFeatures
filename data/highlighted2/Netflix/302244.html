opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Facebook NASDAQ FB is the billion market cap behemoth of social networking It has held steady as the secondranked site in the world behind Google GOOG GOOGL and the second ranked site in the US according to Amazons NASDAQ AMZN Alexa The site is massive each month it has million visitors billion visits and billion page views Its users are loyal each month gets visits per visitor nine page views per visit and monthly page views per visitor About of Internet users have visited the site in the last three months It accounts for about of global page views Facebooks bounce rate is over the past three months but declining That means that the percentage of visits to the site that consist of just one page view is decreasing so visitors are finding stuff worth clicking on Daily page views per visitor are up Daily time on the site is over minutes Over seven and a half million sites link to Facebook A plurality of its users are American but it is also popular around the world including in India Brazil the UK and Germany Compared with the general Internet population Facebook users are more heavily female They are fairly representative of the overall Internet population in terms of education income race and age Relatively speaking more Facebook users log in from school versus home or work Workplace use remains a big problem While the Internet has substantially increased workplace productivity all of the saved employee hours have been used on social media According to employer survey data the Internet in general is the second biggest productivity killer while social media in particular is number four Facebooks equity performed well last year along with the other FANG shares Facebook Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and Google that together make up one of the latest trends in investing acronyms Presumably some new faddish category will be created to displace FANG stocks also with Google renamed Alphabet it should now be FANA which rather ominously means selfannihilation in Arabic What are the cool kids using Facebook faces mounting competition for younger audiences from alternatives including Instagram and Snapchat FB bought Instagram for billion in contrary to my expectations it proved to be a sound investment Instagram will make over billion in revenue this year and over billion next year But what about this audience Could there be a Facebook for investors That is my hope with the new Social Portfolio Feed part of the new SA Social initiative at Seeking Alpha The site will have a new look It will integrate more aspects of the Seeking Alpha site in order to drive greater reader engagement As part of this new feature there is a new Bullish or Bearish prompt that could offer actionable data How do I use the Social Portfolio feed I track the people and ideas that offer the most value If you are new to SA Social and are looking for investors worth following I would recommend the following three First and foremost everyone should follow my colleague Andrew Walker I have followed everything that he has written for years and I am richer for it Secondly Alpha Vulture is a top value investor who livens up our discussions in Sifting the World A third favorite investor you can track on SA Social is Dane Capital Many of the best ideas that have been shared on StW are from Danes portfolio manager If you follow only those three you will be off to a strong start in getting better acquainted with the best investors in SAs community All are friends but that is no coincidence I tend to form friendships with people who dont like overpaying for stocks Of course if you dont mind bringing down the average you can follow me here About investors follow me of which are StW members Here are three long ideas to get started on SA Social The first is Pozen NASDAQ POZN Its merger with Tribute Pharma OTCQXTBUFF will probably close next month It trades at a substantial discount to its value as either a standalone company or as part of the combined company For background we discussed it in Top Stock For From Seeking Alphas StW A second idea worth following is Akorn NASDAQ AKRX For background check out Akorns Current Price Is Nuts It will probably sort out its accounting issues early in the second quarter Suitors may emerge by the fourth It is my favorite takeout candidate for this year and it has gone on another sale this month A third idea that you might want to track is Constant Contact NASDAQ CTCT It is the target of a definitive merger agreement That deal will probably close by the end of the month at which time holders will be cashed out for per share a net spread of over a dollar The spread was extremely tight and uninteresting until an SEC investigation blew it out The buyer is being investigated too and appears ready to close the deal despite the issue It is up since Investing With An Edge Constant Contact was published but it is still worth owning Chinese equities remain expensive risky and precarious One way to exploit this country market is by shorting Direxions leveraged Chinese equity ETF NYSEARCA YINN as discussed in One Big China Short And Little Longs YINN is down over since that article was written but could have further to go These ETFs also have a strong headwind from their suboptimal construction that causes their value to deteriorate with time GoPro NASDAQ GPRO was a faddish IPO that allowed founders to monetize much of their investment Its products can be replicated by Chinese discounters Promoters say that it is not just a consumer electronics company with low barriers to entry and stiff competition reality says that it is InterOil NYSE IOC is the short idea that has garnered the most enthusiastic outcry from its promoters some of whom set up dedicated sites to attack IOC shorts in particular and shorting stocks in general The company is in the business of promoting itself and selling equity If natural gas prices remain weak so could IOC If natural gas rebounds well no problem there either as IOC does not produce any goading the paid promoters just out of curiosity regarding whether they are still there or if they have moved on to their next promotion Who do you think is worth following What are you bullish or bearish on today The site has a long way to go before it is the Facebook for investors based on its current traffic rank However if you have a knack for finding undervalued or overvalued ideas and ideagenerators SA Social could be a useful tool Tagged ETFs Portfolio Strategy Technology </div></body></html>
