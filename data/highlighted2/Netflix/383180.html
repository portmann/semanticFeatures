will be banned from the site For a huge period of time Apple was an absolutely awful stock It had its ups and downs but the to a period of two entire decades the stock wentnowhere Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site While todays drift lower in NFLX shares was widely attributed to AMZNs more aggressive expansion into the streaming video space some wondered if there was more to it Moments ago the answer was revealed and it was a resounding yes The reason why NFLX stock is crashing in the afterhours session is mostly because of the companys guidance of its widely followed international expansion Here instead of guiding to or above the consensus estimate of million subs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>disappointed dramatically and now anticipates only million international streaming net adds down from both the mm a year ago and certainly from the mm net adds last quarter While domestic adds were of lower significance as the growth rate there has already dropped substantially NFLX reported MM net adds in Q above the MM expected but its domestic Q guidance was also lousy and the company now sees just net adds in Q This is how Reed Hastings explained the sudden slowdown in growth as well as the plateauing in margins In the US our Q net adds forecast of million is inline with prior years and million from taking into account a modest impact from the beginning of ungrandfathering Our international forecast for fewer net adds than prior year is due to a tough comparison against the AustraliaNew Zealand launch The ANZ growth spike in Q last year resulted in international Q net adds more than doubling year over year from million to million While ANZ is growing steadily this Q it is less than the launch spike last year ExANZ international net adds would be forecast up this quarter International net adds are down sequentially both due to standard seasonality and our launch in countries at very beginning of Q so Q captured the initial surge of signups In the US we are forecasting flat YY contribution margin in Q due to a large slate of content releases and associated marketing We expect strong yy margin growth to resume in Q and we remain on track to achieve our US contribution margin target by We expect Q international contribution loss to improve sequentially primarily due to recent favorable currency movements We anticipate that international contribution losses in the second half of will be similar to the first half as ongoing investments offset improved profitability in our more mature markets Finally on the holy grail China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had nothing reassuring On China we are continuing discussions but have no material update on our approach or timing Whatever we do will have only a modest financial effect in the near term NFLX also gave details on its ungrandfathering process With respect to ungrandfathering currently more than half of our US members pay only or for our HD screen plan We will phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of with our longesttenured members getting the longest benefit To reinforce brand trust we wont change anyones price without their acknowledgement of the new price in their member experience where they will see a dialogue box about their options Members can choose our SD screen plan our HD screen plan or our UHD screen plan We are rolling this out slowly over the year rather than mostly in May so we can learn as we go Most of our grandfathered members are in the US but well take the same approach internationally The company also discussed the increasingly sensitive topic of competition If you think about your last days and analyze the evenings you did not watch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>you can understand how broad our competition really is Whether you played video games surfed the web watched a DVD TVOD or linear TV wandered through YouTube read a book streamed Hulu or Amazon or pirated content hopefully not you can see the market for relaxation time and disposable income is huge and we are but a little boat in a vast sea For example while weve grown from zero to million members in the USA HBO has also grown which shows how large the entertainment market is We earn a tiny fraction of consumers time and money and have lots of opportunity ahead to win more of your evenings away from all those other activities if we can keep improving The increase in ARPU will allow us to invest more in content next year and we are taking up our expected spend from about B in to over B on a PL basis in Which brings us to our favorite topic cash burn Here is NFLXs explanation At the end of Q we had cash and equivalents totaling billion In Q free cash flow was million compared with million in Q As we have written in the past our investment in original programming particularly owned content is more cash intensive upfront resulting in a timingdriven gap between net income and free cash flow We currently have billion of long term debt With our low debt to enterprise value of our plan is to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in or in early Expect that debt to grow because as the chart below shows NFLX burned through over billion in cash in the past months and has increasingly less growth to show for it For a long time investors let if go However judging by the stocks reaction after hours buy it with all ten of your Cramer stubby fingers Mon Bloppy Mon TradingIsLifeBrah Maybe NFLX can raise its rates
