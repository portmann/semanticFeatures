MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article In July I argued that Twitter was flawed by design and should be shorted since it had no usecase for most people I was criticized for not seeing the opportunities in Twitters new products or in the predicted turnaround of a new CEO In this article I point out how I have been right about this short opportunity and how I also got lucky When I wrote my original article on Twitter NYSE TWTR times had already been tough for the company but not for the market as a whole After coming down from high s in early some contributors argued that at a share price around a turnaround was imminent This assertion was based both on the hope that new management could bring in new users through strategically integrating products such as Periscope In this article I ponder how to move forward in case you followed my short recommendation I also give an outlook on the imminent Q earnings After this weeks relief rally Twitter closed at almost down from my initial short recommendation in July In part I believe this is because I was fundamentally right about Twitter as a niche product for a select group of powerusers such as journalists media personalities and selfimportant adolescents The first half of this successful short unfolded in late when Twitter sank into the mid s Some believed a bottom was in and I thought Twitter would dwindle around the low s for the foreseeable future Then happened and Twitter shares briefly went below Was this a first gaze at the shape of things to come This is the part where I cannot take credit because pretty much every short position looked good in hindsight The question now is whether it is worth it to continue holding a short in Twitter or if the money has been made Twitter is reporting earnings on February Investors will look for user growth monthly active users MAUs user engagement and ad revenue MAUs seem to have plateaued last year just over million with no substantial growth in Q versus in Q What is more user engagement in Q seems to have decreased even further as a recent report estimated less time spent per user In my opinion this goes to show that the fundamental usecase issue is shining through I think Twitter is an example of a grossly mismanaged company that does not care about shareholder value as I have commented previously I am however not blind to the fact that Twitter has been able to steadily increase revenue which is around billion now and should be cash flow positive this year However it stands to reason whether investors will reward this if user growth has stopped or might even be going down One thing is clear however Twitter is not going away anytime soon The company is not facing a Blackberry NASDAQ BBRY iPhone moment It is rather facing a Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO moment versus Instagram Snapchat Private CHAT and an everexpanding Facebook NASDAQ FB platform This would mean a long painful downward spiral into irrelevance both in terms of userbase and revenue However unlike Yahoo Twitter cannot rely on cash injections from selling Alibaba NYSE BABA shares So where can Twitter go from here Let us accept for a moment the possibility of Twitter management executing on a clear longterm strategic vision that will reignite user growth or at least ensure a permanent market niche for Twitter So far I am seeing just more of the same Twitter playing around with messagelength UIs and getting it right However strategic turnarounds take time and it might take considerably longer for management to implement its vision if there truly is one Maybe Twitter will never get it right and ultimately be suffocated by FacebookInstagram and Snapchat or whatever comes next What does this mean for investors In my opinion the best thing to do right now is to take profits if you are short and then walk over your profits into a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX short With a market cap coming closer to billion and increasing revenues I do not expect another downside in the near future On the other hand the market climate is turning less friendly towards highbeta tech stocks Famous activistinvestor David Einhorn has just
