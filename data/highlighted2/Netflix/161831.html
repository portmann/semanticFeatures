Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>knows streaming but it needs to know more The company will eventually morph into a complete media conglomerate and own a thriving consumer products business and theme parks To do this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will first and foremost focus on original content that it develops and owns it will also seek out acquisitions to create a valuable studio portfolio Theres been a lot of debate about the cordcutting phenomenon and how it will affect media companies like Disney NYSE DIS and Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK Besides those businesses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is arguably at the center of any discussion about bundled vs a la carte models <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is dominating the battle of the broadcastingcable brands No one is counting out the continued survival of traditional nonstreaming media but investors have to admit that consumers continue to gravitate toward the subscription service Many people see it as a feasible way to receive quality content at a reasonable value For some it is a zerosum game Some subscribers simply cant justify a Comcast cable box alongside Netflixs overthetop system They might be able to justify augmenting the latter with conservativelydesigned offerings ie HBO plus several other popular networks but the era of paying for ESPN even if you dont watch it could be over within the next several years or at least current Wall Street price action in the media sector would you have considering such a bleak future for certain digital pipelines The salient element to Netflixs continued evolution will be original programming and movie distribution Output deals and winning competitions for rights to older hit TV series wont matter as much over the long run if people dont feel that the service is searching for great stories to tell The company must also look to emphasize ownership of the programming it develops and to distribute it beyond <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Shareholder value can be enhanced in this manner and the business model can transform over time turning the streaming entity into a complete media conglomerate CEO Reed Hastings has already mentioned the importance of owning content for his company but he must place that as a top priority equal to that of growing the subscriber base In other words Netflixs grand scheme all along should be for it to become the next Disney the next Time Warner the next Comcast with a streaming service at the core of its business but with a desire to sell original content to other parties Lets imagine how this might work <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could develop the next great episodic series about the apocalypse Maybe instead of zombies or vampires its a plague of witches and warlocks that walk the countryside and pester the survivors Perhaps the idea was incubated as a comic book and then turned into a Walking Deadtype series and placed on cable It becomes a hit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>of course would own the exclusive streaming rights and would play episodes of the hypothetical show after a certain time period no different than what happens now The difference would be that unlike what happens with House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black it doesnt start with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>And thats okay Because Netflixs ultimate future isnt about it being a subscription service although that will always be important more so it is about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>becoming a bestinclass storyteller that will sometimes start its story on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and sometimes start its story on a platform owned by some other media conglomerate Its no different than Disney making a television show for a competitor network such as CBS as opposed to making it for ABC The Disney analogy is very apt since some of that companys Marvel characters are showing up on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>If DisneyMarvel can supply Daredevil to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>one would have to assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could supply content that it develops to ABC Hastings has also talked about entering the movie business and playing around with window strategies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will eventually want to attempt to produce allout blockbusters on the line of Jurassic World To fully capitalize on such an asset <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to start a thriving consumer products division and then just like Comcast and Disney it will be obliged to enter the theme parks arena The company also could look at Disney as a template in another area the art of acquisition Obviously Hastings cant buy Pixar but he could look to do a deal with DreamWorks Animation Furthermore there are producing outfits like Blumhouse Productions Insidious Sinister Paranormal Activity that would be attractive in a media portfolio Marvel like Pixar is likewise taken but attempts to acquire libraries of characters by buying small graphicnovel studios is always an option <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could also look to a company like Hasbro as a way to enter consumer products as well as to perhaps start toy lines that could be turned into series on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and then into bigscreen product All of this makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>probably one of the best longterm investments but as the company starts to reach for the totalconglomerate template there will be many painful periods for the stock that probably will be looked upon as buying opportunities Risks I foresee are competition from other companies that will look to do the same thing Apple NASDAQ AAPL Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and to be completely honest just about any
