Of Scale And FirstMover Advantage This article attempts to downplay Amazons NASDAQ AMZN cloud service AWS by suggesting that being the first mover doesnt provide as much advantage as might be assumed at first blush The article then goes on to suggest that scale doesnt provide as much advantage due to data residency laws along with the complications of providing redundant data storage given Amazons lack of sufficient data centers in Europe When discussing the cloud you can always darken the picture or at least change it by trying to slice and dice it into pieces such as Public Cloud versus Private Cloud or IaaS Infrastructure as a Service versus PaaS Platform as a Service For the sake of this article we are discussing public cloud services and both IaaS and PaaS In July Synergy Research Group published cloud provider research that showed the market share of the top four providers and highlighted both the growth of cloud services as well as Amazons disproportionate growth compared to Microsoft IBM and Google Ive always been amazed at the sources of some of the best new ideas in technology In the s Microsoft missed the World Wide Web completely An upstart company called Netscape got it and launched the first commercial browser in It took Microsoft almost a year to acknowledge the Web and launch IE Granted MSFT caught on quickly but this was a move that it should have run with considering it was the frontrunner in technology in those days The Web should have been synonymous with Microsoft A similar thing happened in the s when an online bookstore launched the first cloud service I couldnt help but think that this should have come from Google I was impressed enough by this development that in I wrote a short article titled Amazons Secret Plan to Take Over the Internet on my blog The article that I mentioned earlier spends a lot of time talking about data centers data locality and data residency The idea is that customers have legal requirements about data security and locality with the suggestion that the location of Amazons data centers make this difficult to obtain However the author does not go on to describe how these issues are made easier by the other cloud providers While these may be problems that cloud providers might help solve they are not issues created by the existence of the cloud Every company in the cloud has to deal with issues of data security to some extent or another Some of these data issues are extreme enough that it would be nearly impossible to use the cloud as it exists today including companies in financial services and telecommunication These issues are being addressed rapidly by the cloud industry and by potential customers As an example Amazons GovCloud segment of AWS has seen success in obtaining the CIA as a customer While Amazon has made concessions to make the GovCloud palatable to government agencies it is still a public cloud service The thing about the data issues faced by companies is that they dont go away if you host your own infrastructure Each company still has to address each of the practical and legal needs of its customers data from a privacy security and redundancy perspective The thing that is most interesting about the article is that it mentions some buzzwords such as data latency and gravity as if they further confirm the authors conclusions They do not The latency issue is one that would be faced either way whether you used the cloud or hosted your own infrastructure In this case latency is the delay resulting from attempts to transfer the data from one location to another either for the purpose of residency or redundancy In the context of data locality the issue of having to transfer data across the public Internet was raised This was highlighted as a major problem but the fact that all other cloud providers have the same issue wasnt mentioned If you cant transfer data over the Internet using technologies such as SSL secure sockets layer and VPC virtual private clouds then a company has no choice but to employ their own data transfer mechanisms using leased lines other similar approaches But as the industry evolves transferring data using a VPC is becoming more accepted as best practices for data security are applied After all if its good enough for the CIA it cant be too bad Authors note I expect this last comment to cause a fuss among a certain crowd Data gravity is an even more interesting issue The term data gravity was coined by David McCrory in a blog post in The idea is that at some point a company accumulates so much data that it becomes less expensive to build services and applications at the datas locale rather than move the data to a new location This turns out to be quite a significant observation especially as we move into the age of big data In research firm Nasumi estimated there was over exabyte stored in the cloud That is a billion gigabytes or a million terabytes In September of this year Cisco NASDAQ CSCO published projections of cloud data traffic to grow to zettabytes a year Having experienced it directly since I started using cloud services I can confirm the concept of data gravity as the idea that its easier to build an application in the cloud around your data rather than move the data And yes I know that providers are making it more expensive to get data out of the cloud than it is to get it there in the first place but they are in the business to make money Right Now consider that Amazon launched S Simple Storage Service in with all other providers only launching recently Now consider that the concept of data gravity drives service usage and think about the amount of data that has accumulated in Amazons storage service since its inception I personally have data in S buckets since and I know companies that have large amounts of data stored in Amazon data services since Now I want to talk about a related but different concept Ill call it Cloud Gravity for the sake of coining my own new term When a company moves to the cloud they have to develop their roadmap for making this move Contrary to popular belief the cloud isnt automatically cheaper than hosting your own infrastructure While you dont incur the capital expense these are managed services and you can assume that cost is built into the service charge A lot of companies will take an approach referred to by some as lift and move This approach involves mirroring your infrastructure in the cloud with a onetoone match for virtual machines to physical computers While this is a lot easier transition to make it is also the most expensive The monthly costs tend to be substantially higher than the costs of operating your own equipment To make effective use of the cloud you must take advantage of its elasticity Cloud services offer capacity on demand but to leverage this you must develop your systems to autoscale based on instantaneous demand When no one is using your system the infrastructure scales itself down automatically and when demand increases the system enables more capacity To do this requires leveraging infrastructure proprietary to your cloud provider In other words to really take advantage of the cloud you must build your system around your cloud providers services This is not an insignificant cost in and of itself To move to another provider you would have to rearchitect your system to use that cloud providers services assuming feature parity Imagine for example the cost for a company such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX to move from AWS to Microsofts Azure The more you build around a particular cloud providers infrastructure the more dependent you will be In my opinion this is the most significant firstmover advantage Amazon an online bookstore invented the cloud Companies such as Google should have driven this effort but instead are doing a poor job playing catchup The firstmover advantage is very real and while there are certainly big issues facing companies with regard to data storage they are problems that already exist outside of the cloud We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
