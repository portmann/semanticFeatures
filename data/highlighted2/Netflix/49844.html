style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Starz We expect Time Warner TwentyFirst Century Fox to outperform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX members arent the only ones binging on content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CEO Reed Hastings and company are binging on contractual obligations content library offerings and unlike their members not losing any sleep in the process Does the wonderful world of purchase agreements obligations and offbalance sheet financing provide any useful insights If they do and one took into consideration what these numbers were saying it would be no surprise that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is growing at its current pace They are simply meeting consumer demand and not making any money doing so Well the executives are making plenty of money By taking a look at these numbers I can draw these insights Companies with a competitive advantage have a COrevenue under They are producing quality content and do not need to purchase expensive third party content to attractretain customers Time Warner has the best ratio They do not need to spend big on third party content because the majority of their content is created inhouse and from Warner Bros Studios The biggest chunk of their longterm obligations come from sports broadcasting contracts baseball basketball the NCAA for the Turner networks If they chose to they could turn up the spending and capture revenue growth This is totally up to the executive teams strategy and I believe HBO NOW will be that engine B TwentyFirst Century Fox NASDAQ FOXA FOXA is another producer of high quality content and it shows in their shortterm obligations They have the largest longterm obligation ratio thanks to expensive sports contracts the NFL isnt cheap FOX has to spend big for sports entertainment but it is an anchor for its networks and is highly profitable for now AMC is the producer of hit TV shows like The Walking Dead Breaking Bad and Mad Men What the ratio tells us is they produce quality shows and dont need to spend heavily via contractual obligations be it longterm or shortterm However their profitability will be at risk if they do not continue producing hit shows We believe there is risk here due to Breaking Bad ending last year and Mad Men ending this year That leaves them with just The Walking Dead and while it is popular theres no telling if it will fall off due to either a slip in quality a change in story telling trends some combination of both or other as yet unforeseen circumstances Starz is another content distributor that does not produce a lot of quality content and needs to pay high premiums as a result Their loss of the rights to Disney NYSE DIS movies is big if Sony Pictures Weintstein and Lions Gate NYSE LGF are unable to roll out hit movies to help make up the losses There has been whispers of a Lions GateStarz merger and Starz is trading at record highs as a result With the highest profitability in the group we believe this trend will not continue and profitability will eventually come down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has the worst ratio Not only are their current obligations of revenues their longterm obligations are over almost double their revenue and that number is growing This is a huge red flag We expect their longterm obligations to continue growing at this pace leaving us to believe peer profitability is nowhere in sight The bull argument is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is investing for the future but the reality is they are just spending They operate on the AWS platform which is a pay per consumption platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>doesnt need to invest heavily in data centers they just need to spend heavily on content to retain members Despite what profitability executive management aspires to meet it doesnt change the reality of their situation The uncertainty of member retention without the large content expense is not a gamble Hastings Co is willing to take Therefore longterm profitability will be suppressed to the midsingle digits for a long time Lets call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>what it is the CostcoWalMartAmazon of content distribution and realize they will have CostcoWalMartAmazon type profitability From a growth perspective it looks like Time Warner has the ability to grow and attract subscribers since they have the lowest ratio of COrevenue percentage This of course is up to executive discretion and we are not looking to bash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but the numbers do the talking and investors would be smart to place their money elsewhere If you are a holder take your profits and run We decided to take a longshort basket approach and will reassess annually Our assessment will change if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>gobbles up a network or networks or studio studios This could be AMC Lionsgate Viacom etc Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has very little cash this would be a stockbased and debtbased purchase at a significant premium to the current market Source Maximize Returns Sell <span style='background-color:
