next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article No you shouldnt short Amazon If anything you might want to consider buying it provided you hedge to limit your downside risk Amazon currently has the highest calculated potential return of any security in Portfolio Armors universe We describe how potential returns are calculated and show next highestranked names We also show an optimal collar hedge for Amazon for an investor who would like a shot at capturing its potential return while limiting his downside risk to Jeff Bezos pictured below accompanying his newly freed Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian back from Iran image via NBC Nightly News had a better than value investor David Einhorn did Shares of Bezoss Amazon NASDAQ AMZN were up about on the year Meanwhile Greenlight Capital the hedge fund run by David Einhorn pictured below image via Institutional Investor posted losses of last year according to Institutional Investors Alpha punctuated by losers such as SunEdison NYSE SUNE which was down about on the year Now Institutional Investors Alpha reports that Einhorns Greenlight has been short Amazon along with Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX as of last quarter Should you short Amazon too We think not On the contrary wed suggest youd be better off being long Amazon provided you are hedged We discuss why and provide an optimal collar hedge for it below First though lets consider the bearish case for Amazon Greenlights most recent shareholder letter reprinted at ValueWalk doesnt give a short thesis for Amazon it just notes that it and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>were powerful momentum plays Presumably though as a value investor Einhorn is offended by Amazons high valuation And indeed according to the valuation metrics below data via Fidelity the stock does look pricey PriceSales Amazon Industry Average These numbers all look high and except for PriceSales they are all well above the Internet retail industry average which look high to begin with The metric a bearish value investor might focus on most here is the PEG ratio since it takes growth into account and even an investor as growthoriented as Jim Cramer prefers stocks with PEG ratios below The main reason were bullish on Amazon is that its currently Portfolio Armors highestranked name when ranked by potential return and has been one of its highestranked names since Augustas you can see here it appeared in a hedged portfolio created on August th Potential return in our terminology is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next six months Because our universe includes every security with options traded on it in the US including stocks as well as exchangetraded products such as ETFs we cant use fundamental metrics such as the ones we listed for Amazon above to rank securities since they dont apply to every security such as a fixed income ETF Instead after using two screens to eliminate the least promising securities we use price action as well as option market sentiment to calculate potential returns Essentially we start with the assumption that a securitys return over the next six months will begin to revert to its long term mean sixmonth return Then we test that assumption by looking at the prices of options on the security that expire in approximately six months That test of option market sentiment gives a forwardlooking element because it represents the views of option market participants on where the underlying security is likely to be several months out We backtested this method by running our analysis every trading day from to and then looking at the actual returns of the securities with the highest potential returns on our daily scans over the next six months Over that year period we conducted comparisons of our calculated potential returns to actual returns an average of topranked securities each trading day The average potential return we calculated was The average actual return over the next six months unhedged was Since the average actual return was x the average potential return we use that x multiple to derive expected returns from our potential returns While a potential return represents a bullish upside an expected return is the more likely result Our current potential return for Amazon is To give an idea of the sort of names that currently score highly according to this method these were the top five names in our system as of Friday Note that our site is agnostic about whether a security is a stock an ETF or even a leveraged inverse ETFAlthough the top names have usually been stocks as you can see below two are leveraged bets against China stocks and oil respectively Other reasons to be bullish on Amazon are the companys history of executing in online retail is there anyone reading this article who hasnt ordered from Amazon and its track record of successfully entering new businesses for example cloud computing with Amazon Web Services It seems harder at this point to come up with a bearish thesis Yes Amazon is a pricey stock but thats not new as the year average PE shows so its not something one would expect to tank the stock The most likely catalysts for a significant pullback in Amazon shares would be a continuation of the recent stock market correction or disappointing quarterly numbers the company is expected to release its fourth quarter and annual numbers after the close on January th Were going to use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find an optimal collar to hedge Amazon below Whether you run the calculations yourself or use the app two pieces of information youll need to supply in addition to the number of shares youre looking to hedge are your cap and your threshold Cap refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge Since our site calculated a potential return of for Amazon over the next several months well use that as the cap All else equal though the lower the cap the less expensive it will be to hedge The other term threshold refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purposes of the example below weve used a threshold of If you are more risk averse you could use a smaller threshold and you are less risk averse you could use a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge As of Fridays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of AMZN against a drop over the next several months while not capping an investors upside by less than As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or as a percentage of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was or of position value Note that too be conservative the cost of the hedge above was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls in practice an investor can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and the ask and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have paid less than when opening this collar The threshold on this collar takes into account the cost of hedging ie in the worst case scenario the investor would be down including the cost of the hedge the investor be down in the worst case scenario not including the hedging cost Tagged ETFs Portfolio Strategy Technology </div></body></html>
