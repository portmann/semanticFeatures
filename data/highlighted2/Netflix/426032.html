class='textDiv'>Look At What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Has Accomplished So Far In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Over the first few months of the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has already expanded its business model into a number of new programming areas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has long been accused of overspending on content but now critics are seeing more of where that money goes and the thinking behind the method <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has had to play catchup following its initial level of success and now that it has hooked subscribers it can go back and flush out its roster One of the things that is so fascinating about the new streaming entertainment realm is how fast you can see trends begin to shift Usually with the traditional methods a network gives its investors a gameplan for the year ahead and every now and again we get updates on changes normally as the result of something going wrong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and its brethren have tended to become a living being of its own and adapt as they go along Its one of the things that makes them so dangerous to the industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in particular has become masterful at this If you look back at so far its fascinating to see the steps the company has taken in rounding out its business model and we are just halfway through the year Take a look at the below and youll see where Im coming from because its easy for all the news to get caught in a vacuum but when you look at it all together it is impressive Lets start with kids programming as this is the area that really spurred this thought on with me because of the sheer glut of it as of late Kids programming is not new to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>but its the effort <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is making towards evolving its kids programming that stands out With the exception of a Dreamworks Animationesque deal if youre a nonparent adult the odds are good when a streamer talks about their childrencentric programming initiatives you likely gloss over it Yet for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Hulu and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN kids programming is vital to their success In fact in Amazons latest round of pilots just two were aimed at adults The other six were all children series and that shouldnt go unnoticed Although for now I want to focus on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>because its additions to its kids slate have made more of a substantial impact for the moment For example last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>revealed it had signed a deal for Julies Greenroom a new series starring film legend Julie Andrews and produced by the iconic Jim Henson Company The show follows Andrews as she guides her greenies aka puppet kids through the process of creating a show Each episode looks at a different form of theater while featuring an original song and a guest spot by a fellow toptier celeb In addition to it being a clever concept Greenroom also has aspects that appeals to both kids and their parents This is taking that need for kids programming and thinking outside the box Again its all about the overall added value but it doesnt have to just come from inhouse ideas For some strange reason that Paramount NYSE VIA still hasnt really explained the studio decided not to release its animated update of the classic The Little Prince What makes it odd was that the decision was made just weeks before it was scheduled to hit theaters It is rare even unheard of for that to happen so late in the game Although that freed up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to then swoop in and rescue the film which will start to stream in August While this is not the first time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has acquired content it may be the first time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has done so under these circumstances The last time a move close to this happened was when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>saved Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt from NBCs midseason roster The difference is that was a TV series and it was never in danger of not airing It was just determined the show would be better off on the streamer Here this is a film that was tossed away and rescued from the scrap heap Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>didnt do this just because of the headlines though those helped it did it because it saw a good deal For a small sum <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>got to pick up an internationally successful film aimed at an important demo with a voice cast of big name actors and debut it in the States Both Greenhouse and Prince also have crossover appeal and that played a large role in the decisionmaking process but regardless you dont see other mainstream outlets making this much of an effort to cater to this demo <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>also has that bridge area covered with Full House spinoff Fuller House but while appealing to tweens is also imperative to success the reason for Fullers importance goes deeper Fuller House and the Ashton KutcherDanny Masterson sitcom The Ranch represent the first multicamera series for the network For those unfamiliar multicamera series are taped in front of a studio audience and usually come with a builtin laugh track Think Seinfeld Friends The Big Bang Theory etc To date <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had been focused on and had great success with singlecamera projects such as Kimmy Schmidt Grace and Frankie and to some extent Orange Is The New Black but the network recognized it needed to expand out For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to remain competitive it needed series of all types just like ABC CBS NBC Fox etc Now the network has proven it can succeed in both ventures with Fuller House and The Ranch both getting second season pickups These renewals also come despite some amazingly bad reviews but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>series are essentially criticproof Speaking of critics the other area that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has ventured into is the world of talk shows for better or worse The addition of Chelsea Handler to the roster gives the streamer its own version of a latenight talker While Chelsea is still finding its way creatively you have to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>credit for it existing in the space in the first place Handler is a big name and more importantly a smart name for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to be in business with for its first entry into this crowded market space Despite its showrunner shipping off just three weeks into its run investors shouldnt be circling the wagons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is trying something new and as its executive team has shown in the past it will give a project every chance to find its place Some shows need more time to succeed and given Handler likes to play by her own rules it stands to reason Chelsea would need some time to get on its feet The overall point Im trying to make here is that all of the above has happened in the last five months Thats an insane amount of ground to cover in such a small period of time but Netflixs large spends on content makes it possible Critics may fault the giant for that approach but remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has essentially been playing catchup from the beginning It had to start off with the bigger and more costly draws like Arrested Development and House of Cards in order to lure subscribers Now that they have them they have to keep them Kids programming multicamera shows and late nighttalk shows are all areas normal networks have to pay attention to in order to succeed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>knew that but was able to take its time to roll them out at a pace that suits them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has always been about the longterm bigger picture and so far this year you can see that is clearly still the
