class='textDiv'>Dont Short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha Nonetheless shares have recovered swiftly and seem to remain rangebound After last weeks disappointing earnings analysts on Seeking Alpha have decidedly turned bearish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Indeed the Q report showed that international subscriber growth prognoses had been far too optimistic Analysts called Peak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and contend that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has lost its competitive edge I dont think they are wrong in principle International struggles as well as imminent domestic competition have been known for a while Nevertheless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares have quickly rebounded from their postearnings dip apparently also due to substantial insider buying creating upwards momentum A week later shares seem rangebound as ever Another contributor even recommends buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to exploit this shortterm momentum Is now a good time to short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Earlier this year I have speculated on an imminent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>correction based on observations about content libraries in Europe Since then I have become more cautious about shorting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>This is simply based on the observation that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shares have not reacted to seemingly bad news in a way that encourages a short position While most of us might agree that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is fundamentally overvalued the metagame of a successful short is hard as timing is more critical than on a buyandhold strategy due to borrowing fees or theta decay The medium term short thesis has rested on the idea that increasing domestic competition and lacking international content combined with insurmountable content costs will deflate the companys valuation The question I am interested in is what exactly the catalyst for this deflation will be and when we can reasonably expect it I believe Netflixs finances are unlikely to create a short catalyst anytime soon Cash and equivalents are at billion and FCF for the first half of has been a bit over million The Q also contains a statement of intention to raise more cash through debt rather than equity The problem I see around revenue and FCF is that it is still unclear how much pricing power <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>really has in a market with no entrance barriers and increasing competition from many sides In its Q the company further suggests that its subscriber miss might have been caused by confusion around ungrandfathering which users might have due to press coverage misinterpreted as a general price hike If you ask me this explanation smells a bit Contrast this with a prediction from Piper Jaffrays prior to earnings Based on our survey we believe ungrandfathering of subscribers on a lower priced subscription will have minimal impact on the overall sub base Piper Jaffrays Michael Olson wrote in a note to clients Tuesday Regarding future price increases while we wouldnt expect another domestic price increase in the next two years it appears <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has runway to push pricing higher Given managements own explanation of disappointing subscriber numbers a further price hike in the short term seems indeed unlikely especially since ungrandfathering is still going on and will be expected to be completed through the second half of Changing prices this year would create further confusion according to managements own narrative Bottom line I dont expect a short catalyst based on FCF or revenue as long as the vision of pricing power and an ultimately much larger subscriber base remains intact or at least hard to assess for Wall Street Nevertheless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>cash flow problem creates another issue that might affect this vision soon The biggest problem for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>right now is that it might have bitten off too much with its rushed international expansion into over a countries at once earlier this year The consequence is that management has to make hard choices on content libraries The US content library is on a steady downtrend Click to enlargeSource usanewonnetflixinfo Now one could argue that this simply reflects <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>plans of shifting towards more of its own content I believe is the goal This makes sense in the light of its international expansion as focusing on its own content would allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to streamline overseas offerings The problem is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not there yet it has a lot of highquality shows but only few original movies The deal recent deal with Disney NYSE DIS might alleviate concerns around the US library Anyhow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can simply not afford to both license vast amounts of recent Hollywood content for many different regions and produce all of its new shows protectionist EU quotas not even considered Barring some material change in content deals or promotions programs US subscriber growth might top out in one of the next few quarters It might have already topped out Due to typical fluctuations we might hence see a net loss sometimes soon This might create the awaited short catalyst because it changes the narrative from a company capturing market share to one that has to defend their position at the top On the international front a net loss is of course much less likely to expect The total international streaming market is simply so largethat even if millions of new subscribers cancel after their free trial there might be millions of others who dont for years to come Even if subscriber goals are not met the growth story there should remain intact as long as the total international subscriber count is on a steady upwards trend A good comparison here is Tesla NASDAQ TSLA which misses its sales goals regularly yet share prices remain high as YoY growth story lives on the just a few bumps on the road argument Unless international subscriber growth creates unexpected churn that offsets additions to an extent of net losses I do not see a short catalyst on that end Overall I am waiting for two catalysts to enter a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>short position On the technical side share prices could leave their range for good to the downside eg triggered by a major market event and this could then cause selfsustained negative momentum Second a net loss in US subscribers in one of the following quarters due to competition ungrandfathering or shrinking content could cause a change in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>narrative Until then I will stay on the sidelines and expect share prices to continue to be driven by shortterm
