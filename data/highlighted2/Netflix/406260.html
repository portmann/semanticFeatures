shareholders are falling not rising This is despite growing cash flows Apple wont pull the trigger on a big acquisition It also has plenty of assets set aside Shareholder returns need to increase Buybacks as a taxdeferred investment reward longterm shareholders better than dividends The current repurchase authorization is simply too low and I fear Apples seasonality in share repurchases will have them miss buying the dip In November of on Seeking Alpha I encouraged Apple NASDAQ AAPL to buy back more shares of company stock The premise was simple share buybacks were falling nominally yearyear few viable alternatives for free cash flow seemed to be available and there was comparatively very little money left on the current authorization just B The solution was clear Apple needed to ramp up share repurchases and to do so Apple needed to increase its repurchase authorization With the fiscal Q earnings release Apple announced the buyback authorization was increasing to B Was this enough to address my concerns Unfortunately no and the situation has not changed It seems that far too many investors have assumed that the B buyback authorization means Apple AAPL intends to spend B of cash between now and March on repurchases This thought process has unfortunately been propagated on Seeking Alpha by both contributors and commenters alike Unfortunately these investors have glossed over some key wording in the earnings release My emphasis added below from the most recent press release Under the expanded program Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of billion of cash by the end of March As part of the updated program the Board has increased its share repurchase authorization to billion from the billion level announced last year Cumulative total Updated program So what is the deal Rather than ending the repurchase program when it is completed and all authorized money is spent and then starting a new share repurchase authorization when the time is right management instead extends the old agreement increasing the allowable authorization over and over Why It simply lets management tout big numbers in press releases Its a strategy I dont blame management for engaging in Shareholders especially retail investors have short memories on how companies have rewarded them in the past This is a gentle psychological way to remind them how much money theyve committed in shareholder returns in total but it can be misleading to uninformed investors So what was the true increase in the buyback From the companys most recent Q filing investors will find that Apple had spent B of the B now B authorization In the Companys Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to billion of the Companys common stock of which billion had been utilized as of March The Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares Under the program shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated andor open market transactions including under plans complying with Rule b under the Securities Exchange Act of as amended the Exchange Act So prior to the expansion Apple had just B remaining on its existing authorization the rest had been spent This means that by expanding the buyback by B B to B Apple has now authorized just B of repurchases in total through March or a little over of the float Without another increase next year the company can average just Byear in share repurchases through the programs expiration Therein lies the dig As I noted in my prior piece on share buybacks Apple spent B buying back shares in fiscal and B in fiscal B annually would mean another yearyear fall in share buybacks despite rising net income at the massive consumer electronics giant Money isnt a problem here Apples free cash flow increased to B in fiscal from B in fiscal Despite the rapid rise in free cash flow shareholder returns buybacks and dividends in total actually fell nominally yearyear That is a disappointment especially since that money was not spent elsewhere either on acquisitions or on a meaningful increase in capital expenditures to develop new product lines or improve new ones Instead it is just sitting in the bank earning next to no return The money simply needs to be put to work in some way or another and this is an area Tim Cook and company has continued to fail to satisfy my expectations on Otherwise Im perfectly content with the daytoday business operations of Apple Despite all the antiApple hubbub in recent months free cash flow has been relatively flat assuming the massive change in working capital adjusts to the norm by yearend which was fed by a large paydown in accounts payable Apple as a business still generates and will continue to generate dump trucks worth of money For large activist investors that act on behalf of shareholders seeking to pressure management to return unused cash to shareholders returns to shareholders have been disappointing I wouldnt be a surprised if this was one reason we saw Carl Icahn head for the door Readers might quickly retort with Apple could just increase the authorization before its expiration again and they could However quarterly trends in buybacks are once again falling yearyear Apple has repurchased just B in shares through the open market during the first half of compared to B in ASRs accelerated share repurchases aka buybacks done in conjunction with investment banks are also falling which has been a trend for Apple as it moves towards conducting most of its buybacks on the open market rather than executing deals with Wall Street Timing also seems to be an issue For some reason unbeknownst to me Apple tends to buy back most of its shares in fiscal Q at a time when overall investor sentiment tends to be higher due to new product releases usually yielding higher share prices You can see this trend in Q of above when Apple bought back nearly half the shares that it would purchase that year in the last quarter of the year wasnt much different with fiscal Q also seeing the highest repurchase interest by Apple It looks like we will once again see that trend repeated in fiscal given current low buyback interest during a year where we should see a lot of hype heading into Apples iPhone release Is such concentrated spending in one quarter prudent Spreading buybacks evenly throughout the year seems more logical to me and would likely help temper some of the volatility the companys share price often endures Buybacks Simply The Best Use Of Cash As an investor I want Apple to invest its free cash flow where it gets the most return When you think about cash a company has only a handful of potential uses Accretive acquisitions would be wonderful but Apple has traditionally purchased small picking up cutting edge technology and motivated personnel from small companies and then developed the products further inhouse As Apple acts primarily as a facilitator of content not a content provider I believe frequently cited large acquisition possibilities like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX are incredibly unlikely and even more unlikely given the incredibly stretched valuations such companies often trade at today I wouldnt want Apple to overpay for quality assets just because it has the firepower to do so Both Steve Jobs and Tim Cook have similar styles when it comes to acquisitions and pressuring a change in that style simply wont happen If I didnt like it I would have moved on a long time ago Capital expenditures also remain light despite Apples interest in capitalintensive markets like the automotive market Given its substantial net cash position Apple has little reason to save more for a rainy day or pay down extremely cheap debt all of which was taken on to facilitate the shareholder capital return programs due to offshoreheld cash Shareholder returns are simply the only prudent thing remaining to do with the funds and the coffers will only continue to grow Fact is that Apple will generate somewhere in the neighborhood of B in operating cash flow for fiscal with B in capital expenditures Well see a similar number for fiscal likely more Thats a free cash flow yield on expected fiscal cash flow which is an incredibly attractive price point to retire a portion of the share count Buying back a share of company stock retires a dividend obligation and it is also an investment in the company itself improving cash and earnings per share for the rest of us I will always prefer share buybacks to dividends when it comes to quality companies Buybacks allow shareholders to defer taxes until shares are sold which allows gains to compound tax free They also give management greater flexibility as company management is under no obligation to complete a repurchase program So if things get hairy for Apple buybacks can be slowed down Dividend cuts are greeted with much more animosity from market participants Flexibility is the point here There isnt any reason for fear from Tim Cook if he truly sees strength in the company he heads from authorizing a higher buyback number Current predictions on cash flows show the capital program could have easily supported a bump to B on the repurchase authorization allowing Apple to retire a similar dollar value of shares over the next two years to what it did in Retiring Apple shares in the sshare is an opportunity that management has not had for some time and I hope they are both aggressive in retiring shares in Q and in approving a further increase in the repurchase authorization come Q Time will tell Apple is actually one of my few large cap holdings For more research on undertheradar deep value companies such as my
