the next country <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>plans to enter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is adopting a go slow strategy to give consumers time to learn about and try the companys streaming video By avoiding the mistakes Hulu made when it entered Japan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could create a longterm business there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is tying up with SoftBanks leader Masayoshi Son to get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>into stores and on Softbanks mobile phone network <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is continuing on with its overseas expansion and one of the next markets to tackle is Japan Its one of the remaining countries that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>plans to enter over the next two years But Japan requires some finesse and time Although Japan has a relatively large population that offers good potential growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CEO Reed Hastings tempered expectations of a quick expansion there saying recently he thought market penetration would be one of the companys slowest to reach a certain level because Japanese are brand conscious That means if they arent familiar with the name or company they are wary of even giving a new service a try Netflixs real business success will be in the long term after the expansion is completed and the company must understand how each country operates according to their perception of things The solution for Japan Go slow The flip side to brand consciousness is that when Japanese consumers finally get comfortable with a new company or service then it can be adopted pretty quickly Once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is part of the in group then subscribers are quite loyal Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>needs to avoid the mistakes Hulu made Hulu entered Japan in yet according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CEO Hastings that company charged too much at the beginning Because Hulu didnt take the time to make deeper relationships with consumers the relatively high subscription kept the company at the fringe Netflixs base monthly fee will be around almost a third <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a plan so you shouldnt worry about profit margins just yet By creating some buzz about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>in Japan consumers will get to know it better and the price wont be a hindrance The strategy is to have Japanese subscribers take the steps up to higher subscriptions for faster downloads Revenue growth could be a little slower than in other countries at first but loyal customers will make it reliable and steady for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>made one more smart move to get into the in crowd quicker The company has made a deal with SoftBank a leading Japanese tech and mobile carrier company SoftBanks head and CEO Masayoshi Son is famous in Japan because of his business and tech skills and is thought of as the Bill Gates of Japan By hooking up with Softbank and having agreed to sell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscriptions through Softbank shops as well as its website <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>becomes part of the in group that customers will be more open to try because its coming through Softbank Softbank has a mobile phone network of million customers And for new phone sales from October this year Softbank will preinstall Netflixs app on new phones That makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>part of the home team for service Nomura Securities analyst Anthony DiClemente estimated that by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could have as much as million members in Japan or about the same as the UK Thats great for the business but shareholders want to know when the international expansion turns from cost into earnings According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CFO David Wells in the earnings call international losses should peak in Investors should underline the word peak because that doesnt mean turn to profit However you can start to see the horizon as revenues from all the entered countries rise and the cost of entering the remaining countries comes down Also in Europe fees for new members will rise from a little under to a little over so a bit more than up This will help Netflixs total revenue and get the overseas expansion one step closer to hopefully positive operating earnings That price increase is an important strategy for Netflixs future profitability Among the same members <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>wants them to steadily migrate to the higher subscriptions At the same time when a market seems satisfied with the service and movie selection it receives then it may be safe for the company to bump up membership fees But just like Japan it needs to go slow in price adjustments What it learns in Japan can be applied to expansions in other countries The growth story of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still intact so I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock will start heading back up after selling off quickly in August Its still slightly down
