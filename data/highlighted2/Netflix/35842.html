Alpha The Virtuous Cycle remains intact with laudable subscriber growth but somewhat deteriorating average revenue per international user Content costs seem well under control of management defying so many prognosticators <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX is up since I wrote an article in January calling for upside I never expected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to rise so fast so soon but now that it has it is important to revisit the thesis and see what has materially changed and determine if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>remains a buy Despite claims by some contributors alleging that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>virtuous cycle has broken down the numbers simply state the opposite For a quick refresher CEO Reed Hastings popularized the concept of the virtuous cycle when streaming was still in its infancy in Hastings summed it up as Its a virtuous cycle We get more customers we get more money we can afford more content we get more customers Taken in number form the concept of a virtuous cycle should be evident and not subject to so much contention <span

and international is at Total subscriber growth is expected to grow at this quarter Australia and New Zealand launched at the end of March M Broadband households and Japan launches later this year M Broadband households By the end of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still plans on being live with differing content breadth in over countries Subscriber growth via international expansion at least in the near term has shown no signs of significant slowing As the base of subscribers grows the comparative growth numbers will of course abate but the absolute gains remain strong with noticeable higher highs and higher lows of subs added each quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>revenue numbers came in strong again this past quarter with YoY gains and projected gains for the current quarter Since Q when streaming was first launched global revenue has increased at a CAGR of Revenue growth has generally slightly lagged subscriber growth which is a result of incremental subscribers coming from less lucrative countries This is evidenced further by the recent drop in average revenue per user Keep in mind these revenues are quarterly revenues not monthly so the average revenue shown is actually x what the consumer pays per month US DVD and streaming subscribers are trending up as they continue to pay more for their services each month This trend will continue as grandfathered mo plans lapse and make up less of the revenue mix multistream plans gain more adoption and k streamingwhich <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>seems intent on pioneeringbecomes a more popular upsell One fly in the ointment of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>growth story and international expansion is the recent drop in average revenue per international subscriber Initially I thought this was due to a greater impact of trial nonpaying accounts However when I studied further the percentage of paying international users compared to total international users is actually seeing a noticeable uptrend So if the share of nontrial paying users is growing but ARPU is falling then this leads to only one reasonable conclusion incremental international users are less lucrative In other words the lowhanging fruit of developed wealthy connected nations is being replaced by higherhanging fruit of lessconnected and relatively poorer nations Now this was largely expected but I did not anticipate a perceptible effect this soon in global expansion This is one risk that needs to be monitored will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>have the pricing power to eventually bring International ARPU to Domestic ARPU levels Only time will tell It will come to nobodys surprise that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content slate has expanded tremendously over the past several years Anecdotally we can see this by the number of Emmy nominations and wins in compared to as well as quick look at a list of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>original programming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is certainly stepping up its originals game but also its licensed content as shown by its content lease obligations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>offbalance sheet obligations is bumping up against the B figure This statistic and the fact that these future lease obligations sit offthe balance sheet is oftspun by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bears as the reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is doomed Out of control content costs is the common refrain But are these costs really out of control Taken in isolation a future lease obligation approaching B seems daunting but when you take this figure and allocate it across <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>everbroadening streaming subscriber base as Ive done suddenly it doesnt seem bad at all In fact it seems downright manageable When streaming was first launched as a standalone in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had lease obligations approaching per subscriber Now that number is and on an undeniably downward trajectory This can be taken in several ways but my interpretation is as follows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has more information and therefore more negotiating power <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has devised a way to entice content owners into selling their legacy brands on a global platform and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>alone knows the true value of that content This is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>tremendous strength of data analytics and knowledge viewer tastes habits and interface makes for a Canyonesque moat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>popularized the use of the contribution margin metric which is akin to operating margin but ignores GA and RD but does take into account marketing costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>contribution margin has slowly improved over the years Contribution margin is a reasonable tool to gauge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>success but it is imperfect The nearterm and significant marketing costs associated with international expansion muddies the contribution picture making international seem like a failure I believe there is a better means to determine how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is performing The entire concept of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>virtuous cycle which is the lynchpin for overall success can be summed up in one single graphic I like to call it the Spread chart This chart shows the average revenue per user ARPU for each streaming segment as well as the amortized cost of content per user for each segment I call this content amortization cost or CAC The amortized cost of content is the amount of content original and licensed that is used up each quarter Think of content as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>raw material each quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>amortizes the amount of content that can no longer be streamed tomorrow If you allocate that amortization figure amongst the pool of subscribers you obtain the true periodic persubscriber content cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be successful if the spread between ARPU and CAC widens I prefer this method of measuring success because it looks at revenue and content ignoring SGA RD wages taxes and so many other variables It also ignores huge nearterm cash outlays for original content that will be viewed for many years to come In essence it shows whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>core business model is viable As you can see the domestic segment is doing phenomenally with ARPU growing and content acquisition cost falling This past quarter the spread between the two hit an alltime high This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>had per user to pay for everything except content as well as whatever net profit was left over This bigger this spread gets the more money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has for profits International is a different story The good news is that content costs per subscriber has continued to fall and sits an alltime low however the revenue per international subscriber has fallen even more over the past yearmeaning the spread has tightened to per sub from a high of per sub six months ago This means that for every international subscriber <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has to spend on everything except content It is discouraging that this number is falling On the plus side Im not concerned with the cost of international content On the negative side I am concerned with how much foreigners are willing to pay for the service Im confident that this is partly a shortterm issue associated with new members only being revenueproducing for parts of the quarter However Im also confident that resuming positive growth for international ARPU will be a long and difficult task <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have to establish a tremendous slate of global content before it can safely initiate price increases lest it have another priceincrease backlash circaJuly where US streaming growth temporarily halteda circumstance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could illafford in the middle of its global push Several things have changed for the positive since I gave a price target back in my January article Subscribers of course surprised to the upside by almost k Guidance for global subscriber growth increased slightly And perhaps most importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>demonstrated that it can achieve contribution margins above Reed Hastings is now targeting a domestic contribution margin in this gave some additional upside to my model However I did have to temper my expectations for international ARPU This is trending in the wrong direction and while it is likely to reverse there are a lot of unknowns surrounding what value other countries will place on the service I assign a fair value to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>of using discounted owner earnings at a discount rate and terminal growth Two possible green flags that may emerge in the coming quarters is that the terminal phase of international growth will likely come later than as Ive modeled Additionally ARPU growth in international markets may turn out to be conservative given how young many markets are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is still a great company and longterm buy Over the next ten years I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could be a tenbagger However in the next months and until <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can establish growth in international ARPU <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a hold Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Virtuous Cycle Is Intact But Stock Is Fully Valued Disclosure The author is long NFLX MoreThe author wrote this article
