Investors have no rational basis to value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as they do <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>cannot compete with deeppocket rivals We know that investors are valuing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX at an irrational valuation Yet it is worth examining just how irrational this valuation is When coupled with a rational assessment of Netflixs truthful prospects going forward it becomes apparent that NFLX stock represents the short of the century provided you have the stomach to stick it out The TTM PE ratio of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>which as of Wednesdays close was NFLX is not likely to make more than FYs million in net income as it has only made million YTD per its Q report Clearly investors are not valuing NFLX stock on a PE basis Are they valuing it on a rational cash flow basis NFLX has negative TTM operational cash flow of million NonGAAP free cash flow is even worse coming in at negative million NFLX is burning cash to keep itself warm and investors clearly arent valuing the company on a cash flow basis Is there something happening on a segment basis that is exciting investors Domestic streaming is where things look bright generating billion in gross profit for the TTM This is offset by international streaming with a million loss in the TTM Total streaming TTM gross profit is million Not bad Domestic DVD profit is shrinking heavily year over year but still pulled in million in TTM gross profit So in total theres billion in contribution profit Alas that is offset by million in expenses Domestic streaming margins have been consistent YTD at around International streaming margins are worse this year at DVD profit will be gone in years and contributing less each year Domestic streaming will probably increase YOY down from the YOY increase in FY NFLX will continue to throw money at international expansion and continue to lose money there for some time It will probably exceed last years FY loss of million by expanding to million It has billions in offbalance sheet content liabilities It will have to raise prices and capital Investors are valuing NFLX stock based on subscriber count for no rational reason whatsoever Subscriber count means nothing Thats because NFLX is not Twitter where subscriber count is everything Twitter is a brand and platform that cannot be reproduced and guess what it still is losing money NFLX is a brand in a rapidly commoditizing business in which brand will soon mean nothing Subscribers will go where the price is right where the content they want is available and every other competitor has pricing power over NFLX because they have way more capital tens of billions more NFLX is nothing more than a dumb pipe with a brand name but there is nothing proprietary about it Apple NASDAQ AAPL Alphabet NASDAQ GOOGL Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Hulu owned by Disney NYSE DIS st Century Fox NASDAQ FOXA and Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA are all viable competitors None have totally committed to content streaming in the way NFLX has but they will When a studio produces movies or TV shows it distributes them on DVD and streaming media Anyone can buy DVDs and rent them out an infinite number of times People still buy DVDs for their collections and parents get lots of DVDs for kids Studios make some money on DVDs The studio can also license its content exclusively to one streaming provider Because it is an exclusive deal it will charge more for that content For example NFLX ponied up big bucks for Disneys movies All other content is sold on a nonexclusive basis So all streamers strike deals with the studio to exhibit their content If NFLX doesnt have the content you want you can rent it somewhere else on an a la carte basis or subscribe to another service that does have it Thus there is very little that is special about NFLX as a streaming service They have some exclusive licensed content They produce some great original programming in an attempt to attract new subscribers and retain others but it comes at enormous expense Eventually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will run into cash flow problems If it cant make certain content payments it will renegotiate those deals Why would the studios do that Because the studios want to bleed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>just down to where it is barely able to survive so it can bleed it again and again The studios will take lower prices on nonexclusive deals just to bank the revenue NFLX has zero leverage The studios dont need NFLX They want it to live They want it to raise capital so they can bleed it again But they dont need it Just look at Disney They made exclusive deals to license content to NFLX If NFLX goes away they can still offer both exclusive licenses or license stuff on a nonexclusive basis And you know what There will always be buyers Why BECAUSE ITS DISNEY CONTENT And neither you nor I will care if NFLX lives or dies because as long as we can get our content someplace we will be happy I own Disney stock for a reason NFLX stock is the suckers bet Disney uses NFLX as its blood bank Why are investors so excited to throw in with the blood bank when they could be invested with the vampire If youve got the stomach short NFLX Its ultimate value will be determined by its ability to make good on content payments that retain subscribers If international streaming becomes as profitable as domestic a long way off and domestic eventually nets million in net profit thats billion in total profit but without any growth Give it a x value and its a billion company below todays valuation We only use your contact
