</span>Inc NASDAQNFLX Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has revolutionized and disrupted the MediaTechnology industry and has produced awardwinning original content but good company does not necessarily mean good stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has extreme valuations enormous debt growing competition large insider selling and some accounting red flags which make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a very dangerous investment It is not only the fierce and increasinglypowerful competition subscriber growth hurdles and enormous valuations that could cause Netflixs downfall each on its own but also and of even more significance is the tremendous and mostly hidden debt weak financials insider selling and accounting red flags that potentially make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>a good short opportunity ever To be fair <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is an exceptional service and still a top source for video streaming and content It disrupted the media industry and was a leader in this new form of video technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should be commended for its revolutionary effects on media and technology as well as its awardwinning original content among other achievements Partly or mostly due to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>we can now get millions of videos on demand anywhere we go Furthermore the On Demand trend in media consumption is relatively still in the earlytomid stages and media companies dont truly know where the future is heading Many have discussed the trend away from traditional cable known as cordcutting Interestingly we may be seeing a shift towards an a la carte or pay per view model where customers choose specific channels events or videos rather than paying for a large package with many channels they dont need It is definitely possible for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to continue its success <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>could very well sustain its subscriber base growth flourish in its international expansion and produce more massivelypopular and awardwinning original content However even in that case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>as a great service or company doesnt mean its a great stock In fact I believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a terrible investment at this moment and heres why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has already seen a significant drop in its stock price down over from its December high yet its valuations remain highly inflated and not sustainable PE With a market capitalization of Billion as of January was over Billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has a skyhigh PricetoEarnings PE Ratio of and a Forward PE Ratio of A PE ratio higher than or is generally too much even for fastgrowing technology companies PB and PEG Netflixs PricetoBook PB Ratio is and its PEG Ratio is above both extremely high considering these ratios should ideally be closer to or They are exponentially higher due to high investor expectations but expectations are perhaps too high BVShare With a stock price close to per share Netflixs actual Book Value is far below at only per share The disparity is huge CashShare <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has only per share in cash a very small amount of liquidity and cash needed to run the company or weather a growth slowdown Though management claims aggressive international expansion and production of original content is to blame for its low Net Income and bottom line such poor performance cannot continue for much longer without severely hurting the company As you can see below though the number of streaming memberships has grown this has not translated into higher Net Income Net Income NI With a Billion market cap and nearly Billion in Revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>only generated Million in Net Income It is not substantially profitable relative to its market cap and revenues Operating Cash Flow CFO A wellknown red flag in accounting and financial analysis a negative Operating Cash Flow is a sign of potential trouble ahead Netflixs Cash Flow from Operations is Million yes thats NEGATIVE million One of the most disturbing aspects of Netflixs financials is its large and very murky debt accounting The company publicly takes pride in its relatively low debt levels Billion but mostly fails to acknowledge the massive Billion in additional debt that remains in its OffBalanceSheet Liabilities This means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>actually has total debt and financial obligations of more than Billion Source SEC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>K Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management has slyly and cleverly kept the massive debt load off the books in order to make the financial strength and health of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>look much better yet is completely detached from reality Though management has found clever technical ways to define these liabilities and keep them off the Balance Sheet such behavior is at the very least questionable if not outright fraudulent If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>keeps billions of dollars of obligations off the balance sheet it should likewise also keep its streaming content assets off the balance sheet But it hasnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has managed to hide more than Billion of debt while adding billions of dollars in assets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>cannot afford new content without taking on more debt Its debt is growing faster than its profits and this cant last for long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was the first big winner in the video streaming subscription service and competition has not yet caught up but the number of competitors as well as their growth momentum is increasing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a small player in comparison to the other major players in this space giants like Amazon NASDAQ AMZN GoogleAlphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Disney NYSE DIS CBS Corp NYSE CBS Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Time Warner NYSE TWX with Hulu gaining steam and with Facebook NASDAQ FB increasingly interested in video content Not only does the competition take away some of Netflixs subscriber base but it creates large bidding wars and increased prices for the video content which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can barely afford in the first place On the other hand giant companies like Amazon with sufficient resources at their disposal can better afford the content and may be able to price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is left with a big challenge Either it pays exorbitant sums for content and puts pressure on its finances or it stays on the sidelines while its content library dwindles or becomes stagnant leading to loss of subscribers or much slower growth Loselose situation While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has hovered at or near alltime highs insiders and very importantly directors and officers have sold millions upon millions of dollars in stock Sometimes this is just profit taking but sometimes it is a sign of a lack of faith in a continued rise in the stock price If those on the inside who have a better view of the companys operations and growth opportunities dont have faith in the stock why should other investors Moreover the insider selling is further muddled by a confusing employee compensation arrangement Employees and directors are given options as compensation but somehow those options are being quickly exercised at a cost of nearly a tenth of the share price on the open market and sold for millions of dollars Its as if the company is creating shares out of thin air and giving them to employees to sell on the open market for ten times the profit Management has attempted to appear fair and sacrificing for the good of the company by accepting reduced salaries But if this options compensation is as shady as it seems there could be major trouble ahead After soaring by more than from its lows and also being the bestperforming SP stock of Netflixs parabolic rise is dangerously close to collapsing on itself On the longterm monthly chart below you can see the giant increase in the stock price as well as the significant drop since reaching the alltime high in late Though it is still uncertain this looks like it could be a longterm peak or alltime high never to be reached again On the weekly chart a similar ominous signal is emerging what appears to be a topping pattern In the chart below you can see a significant support level of If NFLX falls below that level there is plenty of space below Moreover though this pattern could bottom out here and continue the uptrend it is very possible that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is currently undergoing one of two major topping patterns either a Double Top or a Head and Shoulders Additionally the recent top in the stock at around was accompanied by a major divergence in momentum While the stock price was making new highs the momentum signaled by the Relative Strength Indicator RSI and MACD was not matching those highs Such a negative divergence is many times visible near major peaks right before a big plunge At the very best <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is highly overvalued with huge expectations to live up to and the best stock performance already behind it At worst it is a company rapidly losing to competition is financially unsustainable and troubled with debt I so have some concerns about the accounting which investors need sufficient answers to and which could drag <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock significantly lower Simply put an investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is not worth the risk and the stock is instead a great short candidate Author payment page view Authors of PRO articles receive a minimum guaranteed payment of Become a
