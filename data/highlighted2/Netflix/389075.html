include deteriorating international contribution increase in international average revenue per member will slow growth cash burn is accelerating and increased stockbased compensation In our view the recent selloff is in the early stages and the red flags indicate that Netflixs current valuation is unsustainable Our month PT for NFLX is implying downside risk of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX declined sharply following its Q earnings release last Monday and stock is now down over the past week We expect the selloff to continue throughout for several reasons and we maintain our oneyear PT of Part I of our short thesis can be found here and Part II can be found here After reviewing the Form Q that was filed on Wednesday we found four red flags that indicate our short thesis remains intact and suggest the selloff is in the early stages These red flags include deteriorating international contribution loss international ARPU may begin to trend lower as pricing power appears to be overstated cash burn is accelerating and stockbased compensation is on the rise Combined these warning signs suggest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>likely reached a peak valuation in Q when the stock traded as high as per share and at a market capitalization of billion While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>remains the market leader and has vast opportunities in international expansion we do not expect to see the valuation reach such an irrational and unsustainable level and we believe investors will appraise the company based on its reduced moderate overall growth rate and more mature business model in a highly competitive market In our view with the stock currently trading at per share or X projected EPS there is downside risk for shareholders Red Flag International Contribution Loss In Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reported an operating loss of million compared to an operating loss of million in the same period last year for its international business segment While the company grew international streaming revenue at an impressive for the quarter cost of revenue soared at As a result operating losses expanded to unprecedented levels despite managements efforts to lower operating expenses in the quarter If management did not drastically scale back marketing and advertising spend in the quarter the operating loss would have been even worse and likely would have approached million We warned our readers about the trouble ahead for investors as management expands too rapidly into international markets on a large scale With management launching in countries on January th we believe expectations are far too high and only a small portion of these countries represent attractive longterm markets for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>For the most part the economics of the various international markets will be vastly different than the economics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has enjoyed in the US As a result we believe there will be significantly lower market penetration internationally and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will experience sustained operating losses in excess of million We believe the overly ambitious expansion plans will drive operating losses in excess of million per quarter by We stand by this prediction of operating losses of million per quarter by And the Q results suggests the company is on pace to hit this number perhaps even by the end of The cost of creating original and relevant content in the language of a local market is expensive and success is far from guaranteed for a new entrant Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>must invest in the development of payments systems and comply with numerous local regulations in each of the markets it has entered this year These factors represent significant challenges to management in building a sustainable business model in its international streaming business While membership and revenue growth will continue to impress we expect international operating losses to worsen over time and continue to weigh down overall earnings for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Red Flag Price Increases Internationally Beginning in Q Will Likely Slow Net Membership Growth Internationally average monthly revenue per member declined in Q to from in the same period last year However the decline was a result of exchange rate fluctuations and management anticipates that the average monthly revenue per member will increase by to beginning in the Q We believe a higher global price point will slow net additions in members to a greater extent than management expects Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Q filing April After increasing memberships by million in Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is on pace to add over million international members in However we believe the higher pricing will slow this growth rate in as consumers opt for alternatives whether it is Amazon Prime or Hulu as well as other entertainment options We expect international consumers loyalty to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will be tested and particularly in less affluent markets we may see an uptick in cancellations beginning in Q The robust international growth to date has been a driving force behind the stocks premium valuation and a pull back in net additions in would likely lead to a considerable price correction Red Flag Cash Burn Is Accelerating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to burn cash and in Q the companys cash flow from operations was million as the company continues to spend heavily in investments for streaming content The cash burn on a quarterly basis has increased at an alarming rate In Q <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>burned million in cash to support operations We expect in Q that the company will burn close to million Much of the cash used is to build up its leading content library and to maintain its competitive edge as the king of content However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has considerable further streaming content obligations and as of the end of Q there was billion in obligations with billion due in less than a year The spend on content will only increase over time and for international content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>can be expected to deliver a number of hits as well as failures in its original content To fund this content strategy we believe the company will have to issue debt in particularly as losses in the international segment mount The highly profitable US streaming business will help to an extent but will not be able to meet the cash needs of the current growth strategy Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Q Filing April Red Flag StockBased Compensation is on the Rise Stockbased compensation increased to million in Q from million in Q and the company granted over k stock options in the quarter While these numbers do not seem out of the ordinary total diluted shares outstanding continue to grow and now total million compared to million in Q Furthermore if stockbased compensation expense is removed from operating cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>burned over million in the first quarter of This is an item that shareholders should continue to focus on each quarter as it will make a difference over time in determining whether management meets EPS projections We are currently projecting EPS of per share in and expect EPS to grow over the next five years to per share for a CAGR This would be an impressive performance for nearly any company yet based on Netflixs current market price this performance would fall short of justifying the valuation A lucrative stock option plan for management will provide another headwind for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>shareholders In conclusion we are projecting EPS of in and in At a current price of per share NFLX trades at over X projected EPS and X projected EPS Given the warning signs noted and the intense competition particularly from Amazon we believe there is considerable downside risk for shareholders In our view the current price is overvalued by between and and we have a
