youth in America America was founded as a nation of immigrants he says We ought to welcome smart and hardworking young people from every nation and to help everyone in our society achieve their full potential Zuckerberg said his donation will go to more than undocumented immigrants in the San Francisco Bay Area over the next five years Wed OldPhart Those executive orders are going to come hard

them better when theyre in a flock If youre patient you can hear the Twitter as they fly overhead and if youre really quiet theyll land in the field right in front of you Right when they start twittering again all you have to do is point aim and Sizzle is the sound of formelytwittering birds as you roast them on the spit Mom likes to add special seasonings and its Dads job to gut and skin them and pick out the buckshot Me I get to light the barbeque MMM Rock Cornish Game Hens tonight Birds really ARE stupid you know I mean they navigate using magnetic lines of force and heightened

note I am A Forex Trader who communicates thru twitter with other friendsForex traders and I could tell you for a fact the one of my FriendsFX trader tweeted out ome big trades but mysteriously they were deleted Yeah that is right even he was surprise Makes me believe the NSACIA is forbidding certain documents to the public Face book is created by the CIA Zuckerberg is no genius but a copycat who stole the idea and is now a government troll Others before came on went away Myspace AOL what is so great about facebook ZOMBIE NATION NEVER HAD FACEBOOK you ask me its for the dummies Keep the masses in line to the slaughter house Wed OldPhart In all honesty my initial attraction to facebook was the ability to communicate with people around the world and reconnect to family that I havent talked to in decades To me it was Star Trek stuff I remember a girl in Japan friending me she was ten or so and I told her to go talk to her mom about talking to strange men she said she friended me because I seemed like a nice grandpa sort of guy Go talk to your mom kid I AM an nice grandpa sort but your parents need to know just who you are chatting with I think I joined facebook after I got on zerohedge Previously I was on NewsVine Pretty vocal many articles many arguments Thats where I was prior to until I joined zerohedge around Facebook froze my account insisting I link my real name to the account to reactivate it Four months later the FBI showed up on my front porch January Over a post I made asking rhetorically Who do we shoot first Bankers or Politicians I had more to it but that was the line that the FBI guy had in his folder The comment was made in October Facebook had my yahoocom account and they linked it to my hotmail account from what they track in facebook It was all on the FBI report I insisted on reading before allowing the officer to make a one step inspection of our house without a warrant He was nice he understood Im just a fat fuck that isnt about to fly off to DC and mount a two week vigil to take out politicianscant afford it And his one step assured him that I dont have Nazi flags on the walls pistols and guns all over the place and no severed heads on the coffee table I took a hiatus from facebook on after announcing it in October prior to them locking my account Under my real name I made the announcement saying that Im moving to SeenIS Disappointing after all this time Too few left facebook In February forget the date my wife came to me saying Theres a bunch of flashlights and other things in our yard You need to come check I pulled myself from some rant on ZeroHedge and went to the door There were at least twenty sheriffs cars in my yard They had blocked our driveway they were across the street on both neighbors yardsthey were everywhere But I didnt see a single cop Looking two doors down to the right I saw one cop standing outside the drug dealers houseI was close to being swatted until they realized they had the wrong address To my right is about a thousand rounds of frangibles a AR and a guage pump shotgun bought in Florida in the s a cane field machete and a Marine Kbar A thud on my door would have brought all to bear because I was actually sober at the time from behind a steel reinforced wall I have a couple of sections like this four feet of steel between the drywall at strategic points My door entry has a wall on its swing side that contains a x section Ive yet to find a true steel door and encasement that will withstand a SWAT attack Your house would literally have to be made of steel and Im not in that position And we saw how that worked out on Got an FBI background check to participate in a request to assist Federal Prisoners making the transition back to public life by holding mock job interviews Out of the private sector hundreds applied three passed The rest were drafted public sector employees who were deffered any FBI scrutiny My friend did the checks She said I was surprisingly clean squeeky clean compared with everyone else EVEN THE PUBLIC SERVICE EMPLOYEES THAT SHE IDLY CHECKED Now Im no saint Ive never been arrested but haveparticipated in the community and have made a local name for my self under two names Hey Youre the Oldpharts I once was minorly famous on facebook But to me the idea that the Feds couldnt find more than three people in a population of about that they the federals didnt have a problem with was astonishing And the fact that those who work for the goobermint are exempt yet still have records are acceptedis atrocious Wed Head_Shots_Work SoWTFare you saying here OldPhart Ha ha ha Wow Ive resisted really slinging some crap on FB because I figured it was a front for the FBi anyway or our universal system of Orwellian monitoring we now have set up in the USA cant do universal healthcare even close off a piece of desert between Texas and Mexico but we can monitor million peoples billions of emails and phone conversations What youve written is TRULY SCARY SHIT If by blowing off some steam and writing about possible social issues in an unpoliticially correct way or even suggesting that things could go south some day and result in random shootings of police officers and bystanders wait thats happening results in the arrival of Rapid Response SQUAT teams to bust down the doors of old farts like you and me and proud of it then we have crossed way over the line of true freedom even writing this I am forced to admit to myself that even the thought that we the people ever had true freedom laughable after what sometime in the late s when did all of this PC shit start anyway into the nightmare lands of Orwell Huxley and Vonnegut Truly it seems like the paranoids who used to whisper about the powers that be and global consipiracies and bilderburg and one world governments etc can say I NAILED IT Refreshing to hear that there are at least a few of us still out there whose stomach turns every time we open a newspaper turn on the TV to CNN CNBC ooops are they still even on the air or read about Mt Rushmore being renamed to Mr Hussein Or has that not happened yet Hang in there and keep your power dry One thing the government has provided great plans for underground bunkers they call them tornado shelters Safe Rooms for Tornadoes and HurricanesGuidance for Community and Residential Safe Rooms FEMA P But while something like this may keep you alive for a while we wont be able to fight the goobermint but it might keep you safe from the social chaos their policies are creating Including the race war that Obama seems so intent on fostering What if a million pissed off white guys drove up to Washington DC and demanded change now Would they kill us all Probably I say buy some farmland with water supplies food and build
