company will be providing access to Disney titles Today well talk about why this is important what were seeing from the stock in the market today and what we can expect to see from NFLX moving forward So lets get right to it A few years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Disney entered into an agreement The agreement that was signed in is going to prove to pan out incredibly well for NFLX later this year Thats because under this agreement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will have the rights to stream all Disney titles to their users as of September of This means that users will have access to titles from Disney Pixar Marvel and much much more Think about what this is likely to do for NFLX The fact that the company will be able to stream Disney titles is absolutely amazing for the company It is the only company that seems to have the ability to capture imaginations young and old around the world Just look back When you were a kid did you watch Disney movies How many parents will likely purchase services from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>simply to have this programming for their children On top of that if you watch movies chances are that those created by Disney Pixar and Marvel happen to be on the top of your favorites list The bottom line here is that when NFLX opens up streaming of Disney titles chances are that sales of the companys services will skyrocket Find out how you can trade stocks like the pros without major time commitments At the moment the fact that NFLX will soon be able to stream Disney titles is starting to excite investors Lets face it the news moves the market With such positive news surrounding the stock at the moment were seeing gains today following up on the

an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from NFLX First and foremost the fact that the company will soon be allowing streaming of Disney content is likely to pick up sales in a big way However while the news with regard to Disney is overwhelmingly positive its not the only reason that I have such a bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Late last year the company announced that it is going from being a domestic company to being a global company At the time NFLX opened its services up to consumers in more than countries around the world In fact there are only a few countries where consumers dont have access to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and thats only because of regulatory restrictions that are hindering the companys plans to get into those countries With the recent expansion into a global company NFLX now has a larger audience than ever before and global sales are expected to build the business exponentially All in all things are looking great for the stock Learn how to trade smarter risk free Find winning trades in minutes Master the tricks to
