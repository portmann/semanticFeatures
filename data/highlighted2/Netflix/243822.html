both formally introduced to the world on January th One went on to sell over million units and is now responsible for an active installed base of approximately million users The other was classified as a hobby and went on to sell only million units In Apple reportedly shelved the idea of selling its own television set Given renewed focus around the launch of a new Apple TV platform have the odds of Apple having second thoughts about selling its own branded television set gone up No Upon closer examination there are very few reasons to justify an Applebranded television set In fact a very strong case revolving around the televisions ultimate value in a mobile world can be made demonstrating why an Apple television will not receive the green light to market The technology industry has struggled for the past decade in trying to define TVs future Countless attempts to make TVs smart never caught on The problem wasnt that companies werent thinking outside the box but rather that they were overthinking it The future wasnt going to be found by turning our television into a desktop computer with an accompanying keyboard Instead TVs future became visible only after recognizing that a television is inherently a consumption device in need of content and an easy user interface The new Apple TV is a product that has literally been years in the making dating back to Apples sneak preview of the iTV project in late Over the years as the iPhone and iPad gained momentum and priority within Apple Apple TV and the entire television category was negated to a longterm opportunity While early Apple TVs were OK for consuming iTunes content the value proposition to the average consumer just wasnt too appealing We knew television was going to change and had a general framework as to what was needed to make that change happen but we werent sure when that change would unfold All the while speculation grew that Apple would unveil its own branded television set with a builtin Apple TV box Enter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX Hulu and HBO Now With a growing number of new content companies gaining strength and giving the consumer revamped content bundles that went up and beyond what we were used to with traditional broadcast and cable programming the future started to come into focus Meanwhile instead of pushing forward with its own television Apple reportedly canned the project to instead focused on taking lessons learned from iPhone and iPad in terms of how voice and touch could create a user interface that works with large screens positioned a few feet in front of us There are two key elements to the new Apple TV that make the product stand out from previous reiterations a new voicebased interface and an App Store New VoiceBased Interface I had one wow moment while interacting with the new Apple TV for the first time using Siri to navigate my television Relying on Siri to search for movies or TV shows and in the process being able to avoid the tedious task of using text to search demonstrates that voice is an attractive way to navigate a large screen positioned a few feet away I found voice so compelling that not being able to use Siri to search for videos within YouTube quickly led me to avoid using the YouTube app on Apple TV altogether I simply had no desire to search by manually typing each letter one at a time using finger swiping on the Siri remote While at first it sounded like a gimmick using Siri to check the weather stock prices or sports scores was quite compelling even though I could have gotten the same information on my iPhone or Apple Watch The ability to simply press a button and talk casually was riveting I found the error rate with Siri on the new Apple TV to be low with the only hiccups resulting from asking questions that will likely be supported in future versions App Store This past May at a conference in Germany <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>CEO Reed Hastings declared the future of TV would revolve around apps A few months later Apple threw its support beyond the app model as well After using the new Apple TV for a few minutes its clear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Apple are correct in getting behind the app model Apple TVs primary purpose is to consume content Without third party apps like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>HBO or Hulu and active subscriptions Apple TVs value proposition would decline dramatically An apps value is rather straightforward when it comes to consuming content on a television Instead of one company pushing the same content to all viewers an app makes it possible to have a very tailored and personal viewing experience even within the same household An app also makes it possible to search a wide variety of content depending on our current interests and mood When Apple introduced Apple TV this past September in San Francisco much of the press focused on the devices App Store and how gaming will be revolutionized An App Store for Apple TV was craved by core Apple users ever since when Apple launched the iOS App Store While apps are likely the future of television I remain a bit more contained in my enthusiasm for many of the apps currently being paraded around While there may be a loyal group of users that will be attracted to gaming on Apple TV Im skeptical gaming will be able to move beyond its niche focus Instead apps that are focused on helping the user consume content in a more personal way have an incredible amount of potential This past May the WSJ reported that Apple had shelved its television plans in early While the exact details may forever be kept to a select few Apple simply was not able to make the case for why an Applebranded television deserved the green light The WSJ article gave hope to longtime Apple television proponents by saying that the television project was never officially killed Apple will have a hard time justifying selling its own television due to two reasons TVs are impersonal devices meant purely for consumption and the televisions future in a mobile world is up in the air An Impersonal Consumption Device While some may look at the new Apple TV as a device capable of turning our television into an iPhone in reality the devices features reinforce the fact that television is inherently used for consumption Such a scenario makes it extremely difficult for Apple to position a television screen as being able to produce the kind of premium experience users have come to know from Apple Everything from the new voice user interface to the App Store is built to make it easy to find and consume content while sitting a few feet away from a large piece of glass While Apple has previously sold devices like the iPod for consumption the iPod contained a certain level of personal connection to the user through how it was meant to be carried touched and even worn We see that these personal ingredients are needed to produce premium experiences with Apple Watch iPhone iPad and the Mac The end result is that consumers are willing to value and appreciate such premium experiences A televisions inherently impersonal and immobile nature gives Apple less opportunities to make an Applebranded television stand out from alternatives If Apple positioned a television to be used for more than just consumption by adding cameras or sensors the problem would be that we dont live in a vacuum and will likely have even more capable devices in the form of smartphones and tablets nearby that could handle such tasks Televisions Questionable Future Apple TV may very well represent televisions future but in an increasingly mobile world the television screen will likely play a declining role regardless of K or future technological trends As a prime example of how a large television screen will likely remain a consumption screen with consumers after using the new Apple TV with my television for a few minutes I found myself increasingly looking down and interacting with my iPhone I dont think this was by mistake While I may be entertained for a few minutes by a few apps on Apple TV its purpose is to display longform content that Im not interested in viewing on my mobile devices Over time this dynamic may change as we rely even more on our iPhones and iPads to watch content For a company that is willing to make very few big bets every few years putting resources into a product like a television set with a future that is inherently opposite to themes found with mobile seems counterproductive for Apple Meanwhile content borne out of mobile like short video clips found on Vine Instagram and YouTube feel off when viewed on a large TV screen Instead being able to consume such videos on our smartphones makes much more sense Meanwhile new products like the iPad Pro are designed with content consumption in mind with a superior speaker system and large screen The end result is more people will consume video content on an iPad Pro as time goes on while momentum remains on the side of mobile Notice the lack of revenue profit or margin in the preceding paragraphs for why it doesnt make sense for Apple to sell its own branded television This wasnt by accident but rather those financial metrics are simply byproducts of Apple being able to sell a premium experience Apple doesnt sell a product simply because it meets certain financial criteria Instead management evaluates if it can improve a product to the point where it possesses certain characteristics that lead to a premium experience Metrics such as TV life cycles low margins or the fact that Apple would likely only be able to sell one unit to a household simply dont play a role in the fundamental case against an Apple television set Instead of simply controlling the large piece of glass in our living room Apple TVs more valuable role is to further position Apple as a content distributor When looking specifically at video content Apples interest in creating a slimmed down bundle of broadcast and cable programming can help the company provide a full assortment of video content to its users This range of video content would then be able to be viewed on the hundreds of millions of personal Apple devices being sold each year including iPhones iPads and Macs In a way the Apple TV is Apples trojan horse to gain power in the quest to become an improved content distributor This characteristic is much more interesting from an experiencebuilding perspective than compared to the idea of selling a large piece of Apple glass Apple was right to shelve plans to build its own Apple television We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
