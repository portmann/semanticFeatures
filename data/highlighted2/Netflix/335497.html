NFLX after my bullish call While such a great bargain is unlikely ever again the stock is not overvalued In August of I made one of my better contrarian calls here on Seeking Alpha With the stock trading at a splitadjusted price of less than per share I wrote that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Stock Is Finally Cheap and threeandahalf years later it currently fetches more than per share Such a great opportunity is unlikely to come again for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX but that does not mean investors who missed out should turn the page and move on After peaking at last year high growthhigh valuation companies have hit a rough patch in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock is among those that have come down materially While still up from its most recent lows the shares remain about off their highs So can money still be made going forward Lets examine that very question The bull case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is that they are in the process of replicating what they built in the United States more than million streaming members that generate over billion of annual profit across the entire globe as they expand their service nearly everywhere broadband internet access exists today other than China by yearend Netflixs service will be available in most countries If you believe the draw of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will not be limited just to the US valuing the stock requires making two core assumptions how many subscribers they can ultimately acquire and how profitable they will be Such an exercise will tell us if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is a buy in the s today or not Fortunately the company had provided details on its internal financial model to help us work through these calculations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is targeting a contribution profit margin on streaming subscribers at scale Although the international business is still nascent and currently loses money the US streaming business is getting close to maturing and the company has stuck to that figure In fact since I wrote my first <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>piece in the companys US streaming contribution profit margin has gone from to in There is little reason to doubt they can reach their target over the next couple of years And with that objective successful mimicking the same result internationally does not really require a big leap of faith It is important to note that contribution profit does not equate to net profit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>still has corporate general and administrative expenses about of revenue as well as technologyRD expenses about of revenue And income taxes will be owed of course As a result once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>reaches global scale the company is likely to have net margins of roughly If we assign a PE of x on those earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>should trade at a pricetosales ratio of between and Lets simplify things and use a target valuation of times annual revenue which equates to about the same PE as the SP today If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>service pricing remains constant at around per month each subscriber is worth roughly Given the price points for competing offerings it is not unreasonable to think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>pricing in years could be up to per month That would peg the subscriber valuation at each So now we have a valuation framework with which to evaluate the current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock price The company is expected to end with roughly million streaming subscribers globally At per subscriber Netflixs existing base of customers in just a few quarters would be worth billion That comes out to per share The good news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bulls is the company is likely to get far more than million subscribers By many industry analysts predict or million as a reasonable number And by then who knows where the permonth price might be Is that farfetched That would increase the previous valuation by another The bottom line is we have to make multiple assumptions when evaluating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stock today Personally I like to take the stance that if I can pay a fair price for the companys existing user base and therefore get all future growth in subscriber count monthly pricing etc for free that is a solid investment bet to make provided I believe in Netflixs longevity which I do To that end paying somewhere close to todays prices might make a lot of sense I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Services
