million members that pay up to month Initial reaction on social media was outrage but we think its ridiculous to be outraged without deal details and we think an acquisition makes perfect sense Investor sentiment in Apple NASDAQ AAPL this morning has been that they have made or are making a poor move in shooting to acquire the Tidal streaming music service This acquisition would come after Apple acquired Beats by Dre just a year and a half ago and would help Apple round out its media offerings The Wall Street Journal reported Apple Inc is in talks to acquire Tidal a streamingmusic service run by rap mogul Jay Z according to people familiar with the matter Apple is exploring the idea of bringing on Tidal to bolster its Apple Music service because of Tidals strong ties to popular artists such as Kanye West and Madonna The talks are ongoing and may not result in a deal these people said Terms of the potential deal arent known Jay Z bought the service in March for million from Swedish company Aspiro which had created the brand Tidal He has given famous artists and bands small stakes in Tidal and promised each millions of dollars worth of marketing according to people familiar with the matter Already Apple is being berated on social media by those who are critical of this potential acquisition People are trying to make the point that Apple should be spending this cash on buybacks or other shareholder friendly initiatives instead of bothering with making these types of piecemeal acquisitions While at first we were also in the critical camp about this potential acquisition we did a small bit of research and realize that a couple of factors are in play here and that this may not be the worst idea the company has ever had Most importantly were baffled at how people think this can be a terrible idea without knowing how much Apple is willing pay and without clarity on what they are getting for their investment We know that Apple Music is one of the companys biggest initiatives right now with million members now subscribed as it moves to take over the streaming audio sector dealing with competitors like Spotify and Pandora NYSE P Growth in media will wind up being a huge recurrent cash cow for Apple as subscribing members of Apple Music are forced to essentially buy what is about songs worth of media every month for the average sign up cost The very first thing that has yet to be determined is exactly how much Apple is definitely going to pay for this acquisition JayZ bought it years ago for million and then invested in endorsements and an image change Doubling that price would put it at million which is as close to nothing as you can get for a company that is sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars Outrage about million would seem absurdly foolish for a company that does near billion in revenue per quarter The price they pay for the service may only wind up being a drop in the bucket in terms of the companys cash For that lets look at what they are getting More than million subscribers about of Apple Musics subscriber base Exclusive access to Princes music library during the year of his death Subscribers pay up to a month in which is about double the average streaming music service This is an easy segue into Apple offering a hidef version of its service Endorsements from all of the celebrities that have rallied behind title to get it to where it is today Were not MA or music industry experts but million doesnt seem unreasonable for these perks if the company even goes that high In fact million doesnt seem like too much either Perhaps most importantly Apple can use Tidal to tap into a base of consumers that may not be your traditional high income Apple customers It allows them access to a pool of individuals that they may not have had prior access to Again we are not sure how anyone can judge this deal extensively without knowing the valuation that they placed on the company definitively That will matter immensely as to whether or not it was a good value for Apple When the numbers are released definitively assuming a deal gets done which is not a definitive they may wind up surprising critics iTunes and the iTunes store has been one of the hidden gems for Apple over the last years It has grown immensely and it has helped the company transform not only into a computersmart phone company but a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX like media company as well Taking out smaller competitors is simply the name of the game when you are trying to compete against companies like Pandora Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Spotify We think that a small acquisition like this that has obvious synergies with Apples intended game plan in streaming media makes a lot more sense for the company then most people seem to think While it is easy to be critical that the company is buying just another product from another rapper the truth is that Tidal didnt begin with Jay Z and it was rebranded over the course of the last two years as Jay Z stepped in as owner The notion that these products are subpar because there are famous rappers that invest in them is ludicrous We want to be first on record to say that we think such an acquisition can wind up being immensely beneficial to the company at the right price and that outrage over Apple buying a rappers streaming music service is misguided and led by those who lack clarity and color on the terms of what a potential deal would look like Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
