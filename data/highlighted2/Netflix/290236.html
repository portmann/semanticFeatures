mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article NBC released data this week detailing the aspects of Netflixs previously hidden ratings NBC teamed with a tech group named Symphony to measure NFLXs viewing data using audio content recognition technology through viewers smartphones While the data is interesting it only tells part of the story and because it is incomplete its hard to draw fully accurate conclusions The goal of NBCs presentation was to show the traditional medium wasnt losing ground to the streaming networks but in some ways it also showcased Netflixs strengths NBC NASDAQ CMCSA on Wednesday during its turn at the winter edition of the annual Television Critics Association TCA meetings in Los Angeles shocked the room by revealing what it believes to be a reliable sampling of Netflixs NASDAQ NFLX numbers This revelation came completely out of left field so let me set the scene a little for you before diving into the data Most of you who follow streaming companies know they are notorious for not releasing their ratings information In the eyes of other traditional networks that is seen as an unfair advantage but to the streaming networks it is their way of getting a foothold in the market Now to be fair <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and the like dont have any legal obligation to its shareholders or really anyone to release its ratings information It is well within their rights to hold onto it as a pseudotrade secret As you can imagine that bothers the traditional networks to no end as every scheduling decision they make is scrutinized Misery loves company and they want the streamers held to the same standards Yet the other side of the coin is that some see it as unfair the streamers can declare they are superior but not back up how they came to those conclusions NBC for example is the leader in the ratings when it comes to the demographic and CBS is the leader in total viewers Both have the data to back up those claims and any investor analyst or viewer can look at the numbers and see it is because of shows like The Voice and NCIS that consistently win their time slots <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is basically saying it has shows like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black and because it says they are being watched you should believe it No traditional network can get away with that but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Hulu and Amazon can So you can see why it is infuriating for ABC NYSE DIS CBS NYSE CBS NBC and Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA among others to be consistently told they are a dying format when not all the evidence is in play Now yes you can look to subscriber counts award recognition and the buzz around its programming but you still are only getting half the story That brings us back to today Let me be clear to start Im not trying to attack or defend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>with this piece Im trying to be impartial so you can make your own decisions Please keep that in mind whenif you post a comment My goal here is to explain what NBC set out to do with this stunt and what we learned about both companies as a result NBC worked with a tech group called Symphony to mine Netflixs data over a fourmonth window off a person sample size Now as explained by Variety what Symphony does is measure TV viewing using audio content recognition technology software loaded on to users phones that tracks viewership by capturing the soundtrack of the program Now note this is a VOLUNTARY download The people in this trial werent spied on without their knowledge From that sample NBC and Symphony were able to gleam how many people watched a specific series in the demo To give you a comparison Nielsen the ratings company that monitors traditional media is in around homes so NBC and Symphony used a larger sample size than usual The difference here is that Nielsen seeks out specific people in specific situations ie single married kids no kids etc to ensure it has a solid crosssection of the population and Symphonys users simply opt in That doesnt make Symphonys information any less valuable or discredit it but it does limit what you can learn from it NBC revealed the estimated viewer counts of audiences watching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>programming including such shows as Jessica Jones Narcos Master of None and Orange Is The New Black In fact it took it a step further and also sought out data on Amazons newest release The Man In The High Castle Heres what it found Of those shows Jessica Jones was watched by an average of million viewers an episode Master of None followed with million and Narcos with million Orange Is The New Black then followed with Alternately Amazon had million viewers on average per episode of The Man In The High Castle Now remember this is a fourmonth sample and this started a few days AFTER Narcos debuted and over two months after Orange returned so we are not seeing the full deck here This is a crosssection of a specific time At different points <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon have both said that Orange and High Castle were respectively their most watched shows If accurate that would mean that Amazon is averaging under million viewers for all of its series including the acclaimed Transparent With Orange we have no idea what it means because we only know where the numbers were at that time Now keep that in mind when I tell you this The data also showed most of the viewership for these shows came in its first week and then declined in subsequent weeks To give you an example Master of None drew of audiences in week one and dropped to in week two Narcos started at and then slipped to The other number that jumped out was that of those stats for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>during prime time only of people in the demo were streaming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>whereas preferred watching traditional TV The point NBC is trying to make is that people are bingewatching and then moving on whereas people consistently come back to its programming every week which makes them in some areas a more valuable investment Reaction so far has been mixed On one hand this is the information people have been clamoring for but on the other its incomplete and we havent heard anything from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>at the time of this posting People are also a little freaked out that this data came from audio signals gathered from our phones again though voluntary gathered Yet looking at the numbers you can see why NBC is so giddy to share them If Netflixs shows dont reach over million viewers an episode then that means as NBC President of Research Development Alan Wurtzel said the reports of our death have been greatly exaggerated In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Amazon and Hulu are not stealing as many viewers as once believed He went on to say the notion that the broadcast model is broken or dying it really isnt Hes right and wrong Hes right in that million viewers isnt going to scare anyone but hes wrong in that million viewers is still more than the amount of people who watched the fledging NBC comedy Telenovela last Monday night million to be exact As Voxcom pointed out million is also more than the amount of viewers Parks Recreation had for its series finale million What Wurtzel and NBC are trying to do is dispel the notion that streaming services are going to take over the world Instead hes trying to show they are a partner that can work with the networks This isnt a eitheror situation unless you want it to be Its essentially similar to subscribing to HBO but instead of watching it through your cable provider you are watching it through your Internet provider All of that seems to get lost in the shuffle because NFLX held back information which only made us want it more Realistically though did anyone really think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>was pulling in or million viewers on average for its shows I mean this shouldnt have been a big shock The numbers revealed are actually very respectable and in many cases higher than what a cable network or premium network earns for its programming Its not easy to launch a network and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has helped create a business model that works and in some ways that is backed up by this data The truth is though that despite the curtain being lifted a little bit nothing is going to change Netflixs shows are still very high quality and they are still going to get buzz and they are still going too nominated for awards As a result they are still going to get subscriptions What Im interested to see is how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>will respond Remember NFLX also gets a turn at TCA and that day comes on Saturday You can bet these numbers will come up and you can bet the company will have answers </div></body></html>
