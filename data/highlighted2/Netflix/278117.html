class='textDiv'>ATT A Beautiful Spot To Be In ATT Inc NYSET Seeking Alpha Dec PM ET About ATT Inc T Includes AMZN NFLX TWC VZ by Christopher F Davis I have covered ATT from a number of angles thus far Today we learned ATTs largest competitor Verizon has seen almost million subscribers for its Go mobile streaming service ATT is offering its own mobile streaming content ATT NYSE T is my top dividend play for the next five years I have been covering it from a number of different angles Perhaps the most interesting of the discussions surrounded the funding of its dividend and whether the dividend would be raised by more than a penny We then learned of course that not surprisingly the dividend was hiked by another penny quarterly I discussed that cash really needed to be directed at reducing debt With the DirecTV purchase there are strong sources of revenues but the company has been saddled with debt By paying this down while upping its payout the stock is incredibly attractive Of all of the names in the sector this is the one I want to own because of the yield and the prospects for share appreciation Of course Verizon NYSE VZ is the largest competitor It too pays a nice yield but has seen some strong share appreciation while ATT is just starting to see growth after sideways trading for years But I think ATTs time is coming This is because we recently just got some pretty big news out of the company that relates to the possibilities that stem from the DirecTV acquisition at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference At this event we learned that the company is responding to the Verizon Go service which was launched in October that promises free entertainment content to users I think ATTs service is going to do very well and this is because of how Verizons Go service is performing thus far Just what do I mean Well just this morning we learned that the Go service has been downloaded nearly million times through December th Remember this is a free service to subscribers but is ad supported Of course that is not going to draw in the big bucks Once the service has gained traction the company will likely offer a premium paid version of the Go service in Whats more this will be attractive as the streaming will not impact a customers data usage tally This is a strong way to target teenagers and millennials The service will help compete with companies such as Time Warner Cable NYSE TWC <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Why This is because all of these companies offer entertainment content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Amazon have been competing with Time Warner for some time Of course DirecTV is a direct competitor and so ATT has a leg up on Verizon in that regard But Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>are streaming experts Verizon is challenging them And in turn ATT can watch and learn from Verizons experience to perfect their own mobile entertainment services Its a beautiful spot to be in I love that ATT is infiltrating various sectors beyond being a simple telephone service company that it once was Its moving into the st century to compete with Amazon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and hopefully to take market share from Verizon We are still awaiting more details on ATTs own mobile entertainment service The idea is that it would be a comparable service to what Verizon is offering ATT is pursuing rights to offer content for individuals without a satellite TV subscription They would be targeting those with a mobile or tablet screen So what is the potential reach According to Randall Stephenson CEO there are million homes without payTV subscriptions in the US and so the company wanted to have this kind of content for these consumers In addition the company also was going to launch a premium package in Q for mobile content Recall that Mr Stephenson said That big bundle content we will deliver and are delivering in one of two ways We are streaming that bundle of content into their home and also streaming the content to a mobile deviceThis is about the best overthetop portfolio of content I believe in the United States He was referring here to having the stacking rights to offer full current seasons of TV shows including latest episodes in addition to past seasons for customers from various networks like Viacom AE and sporting content from ESPN and the NFL Of course the details surrounding costs and potential revenues from this new venture remain to be seen But the point here is that those rewards from the DirecTV acquisition that many of you have been demanding are starting to be realized This is a new company Verizons Go service has picked up almost million subscribers since its launch This should give ATT pause Why It shows the true potential of the service they are launching I only hope as a shareholder they can develop this intelligently and profitably I dont know the value of the new mobile content venture but Im pleased to see new moves from the company thanks to the DirecTV acquisition This is a big positive in my opinion So now I turn it to you What do you think about the news today out of Verizon Do you think ATT can rival Go What about the prospects of rivaling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix
