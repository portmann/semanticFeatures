Confirmation has arrived of the NetflixCW deal with terms about as expected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has at least in this deal seen off attempts to carve out stacking rights from its content agreements The deal confirms that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>content fees remain too rich to forego and give the company substantial leverage in content negotiations Well that took a little longer than expected But the deal between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>NASDAQ NFLX and CW which was supposed to be announced a couple weeks ago is finally official The deal is certainly good news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and for CBS NYSE CBS and TimeWarner NYSE TWX CWs owners And it is actually rather revealing of some of the ongoing dynamics and changes in TV entertainment When I wrote the article articulating a bullish interpretation of what was then only strong rumors of a new deal some pointed out that it seemed a bit presumptuous of me to assume I knew what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and CW were going to say Fair enough Now that its official though it seems worth pointing out that the rumors appear to have been more or less deadon The new deal is a fiveyear extension of the current arrangement and drastically cuts the windowing delay for complete seasons all the way down to eight days according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos The deal will cover all new and existing scripted shows but only covers pastseason rights not inseason rights Meanwhile as expected the rolling five rights will revert back to the CW Network itself and its own webmobile app That means that Hulu comanaged by Disney NYSE DIS and FOX NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA also owns a stake but is prohibited from participating in management is now cut off from CW content completely The only possible problem lies in the finances As per usual financial terms were not disclosed Last time though that didnt stop everyone from whispering the figure which was pegged at around billion The rumor was that the new deal was for about the same amount which as I said before is actually a fairly auspicious number for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>It paints a rather auspicious portrait of Netflixs ability to control content costs one of the key sticking points of many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bears The lack of confirmation of that number may be concerning to some but I am not worried First while I dont want to get into trouble for relying on rumors again nothing has hit the Street or is it the strip in Hollywood suggesting that the earlier number was wrong I have yet to see any entertainment publication publish a substantially different number or even suggest that there is a number to publish that they just cant confirm There have been no real denials of the figure But again thats rumors More to the point is that as I explained before the number we have is entirely consistent with what the prevailing trend in recent content negotiations has been for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and leading traditional providers such as DIRECTV NYSE T or Comcast which have also reported annual programming cost growth Readers can check my previous article for the full formula about how to break down the new vs old contracts I wont take up space doing that all over again But when our own calculations of what the number should be match what the rumors yes rumors I admit tell us the number actually is it becomes less of a rumor and more of a strong inference In some ways the most interesting part of the news was what happened to Comcasts and Disneys Hulu And what it says about what was once pegged as the next great front in the digital vs analog new vs old guard media titans war stacking rights The final bidding for CWs content came down to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and Hulu Hulu wanted to expand its own old deal with the CW which gave it the socalled rolling five rights Those are the rights to show the five most recently aired episodes on TV but Hulu was no longer satisfied It wanted to replace the rolling five with stacking rights which are rights to show every episode from the current TV season ondemand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>of course has never been interested in inseason rights Part of its brand is bingeviewing which of its customers do and which isnt really feasible until a whole seasons worth of episodes is available But CW still had to pick one or the other because while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>didnt really want the stacking rights it didnt want anyone else to have them either <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>sees stacking rights as greatly diminishing the value of its own pastseason rights Why have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>subscription if you already watched the season ondemand through the inseason provider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>has said that seasons which have had their stacking rights sold are worth less to them and they will cut the payments for any shows which have a stacking deal with another provider accordingly Many have long expected that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would have to yield on this point in order to maintain access to new highquality content from their partners If they had it would severely undermine Netflixs value proposition and go a long way toward restoring the traditional balance of power in TV entertainment This potential blow to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>is one of several reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>bears have cited as a justification for shorting or selling the stock This deal may be reason to reevaluate that thesis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>stuck to its guns and told CW to pick one Hulu and stacking or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>and bingeing And for all the expectations that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>would have to cave we now learn that ultimately it was the content provider that blinked Not only will Hulu not get stacking rights there will be no stacking Even CW itself agreed to restrict its offering to the last five episodes only as it has been for years For all the talk of rising competition and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>losing power in the end the king was still king the threat of losing Netflixs high fees is still enough to allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to essentially dictate the structure if not the price of the new contract That is good news even if it applies solely to this one deal If it is a sign of things to come it is outstanding news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>continues to be the leader in the streaming video space Comcast and Disneys Hulu has apparently not yet managed to restore bargaining leverage to its corporate owners in content negotiations While the deal will probably not materially alter earnings results much in the short term for anyone roughly the same amount of money is flowing from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Netflix </span>to CBS and TimeWarner as last year I stand by what I said two weeks ago The deal is a solidly bullish indicator for <span style='background-color:
