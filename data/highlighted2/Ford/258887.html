class='textDiv'>Great News For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha We have been monitoring Fords progress nonstop for more then the last year We believe the companys success will be determined by its international expansion and eventual profitability If youre a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F long and youre looking for some good news look no further The automaker continues to head in the right direction moving into the end of and getting ready to start the new year We have been bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the better part of the last year and we have laid out our keys for the company in numerous articles that weve written following the companys performance in between its scheduled quarterly financial results We have looked at auto registrations and we have looked at monthly sales both domestically and internationally painting picture of how Fords business operates on a month by month basis From a overview standpoint we think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock will appreciate meaningfully once some of the companys international investments begin to pay off and the company sees the affects in its bottom line Right now the company is still at a stage where it is investing considerably in itself as opposed to return capital to shareholders or building up cash This is easily confirmed with the companys recent spending initiatives in both India and China two extremely densely populated areas that will play huge role in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>becoming an international success As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to invest in China the returns are starting to show progress Yesterday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bulls received positive reiteration that the companys plan is working as Fords November auto sales for China were recordsetting and gaining ground on competitor General Motors Here is what the report from Business Financial News said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company F is reaching million in revenue having sold vehicles in China over the past month Yeartodate YTD deliveries in came in at units Sales during the month surged yearoveryear YoY with growth in Changan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automobile CAF CAF deliveries reached up from units last year YTD sales for CAF climbed to vehicles from last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CEO John Lawler said We are pleased that more and more customers are relying on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to provide them with vehicles they both want and value We think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to eventually surpass General Motors NYSE GM in China because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has recently entered into spending initiatives to try and help develop the smart car market which is predicted to be the next cash cow in Asia We wrote an article a few weeks ago about a billion program that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was putting into place in order to help develop and produce smart cars in China General Motors is taking the strategy of returning more of its capital to shareholders a strategy that we think works well now but will cost them in the long term battle with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>overseas All the while as this occurs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains in great demand in the United States as we have talked about in our last few articles Not only do the companys products remain in demand but Fords truck line continues to gain strength and the companys margins continue to look favorable As we have said all along an investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>today should be looked at as a to year commitment where the investor could happily collect and reinvest dividends moving forward It looks like the company is just starting to hit its growth stride overseas We think that with little appreciation in the stock price recently todays price could still represent an opportunity for investors who are looking to share in Fords longterm success which we believe to be the direction the company is heading We only use your contact details to reply to your request for
