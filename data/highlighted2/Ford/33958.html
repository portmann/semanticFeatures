shares in F are currently yielding a respectable dividend Poor performance in Europe and South America has been dragging the companys profitability down However recent news suggests this may change In my most recent article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F High Demand For Fords New F Makes The Company A Buy At Current Prices I said At times forward earnings the company isnt very expensive and the dividend will pay investors to wait as the company attempts to reduce its losses in South America and Europe Shares in the company have dropped by since then and are currently trading at with a dividend yield of With the Kansas City Assembly Plant now up and running and with very high demand for the new F I dont see any bearish signals for the US part of the company As I mentioned in my most recent article the company is still not making any profit in both Europe and South America However recent news on the company has led me to be more optimistic on the companys future profitability outside of the United States For example Fords March sales in Europe were up by an amazing which is well above the industry average growth of The company sold vehicles the majority of which were the companys Fiesta and Focus models <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold a total of cars in Europe in the first quarter of which is a YoY increase of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will release a number of new models in Europe this year including the new CMax SMax and Galaxy models as well as the Mustang fastback and Convertible which will help boost sales even further In the most recent fiscal year Fords losses in Europe were billion before taxes If the company manages to regain profitability in

than last year The company opened a new assembly plant in March bringing the total number to six This plant will increase the companys production capacity by vehicles Russia remains a troublesome region for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with sales for the first quarter down by as much as compared to the same quarter last year Still the company remains optimistic as can be seen by the fact it plans to release four new models in Russia this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>operates a joint venture with the Russian company Sollers On April th Reuters reported <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would provide additional financial support to the venture which is another sign of the companys dedication to growing in the
