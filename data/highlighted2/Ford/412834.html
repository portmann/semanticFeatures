quarter selling price Switching the capital budget to developing the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has lowered average costs tremendously The company needs to change its capital structure or it will have significant competitive disadvantages with the current structure for years to come Operational improvements in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have been tremendous as well costs have dropped about in a year or so and initial production rates doubled over years As usual the company made a good positive and upbeat presentation Everything was being handled and the company was in good hands for the first quarter However when the official financial statements were examined for Baytex Energy Corp NYSE BTE there were some official warnings listed The current commodity price environment has reduced our internally generated funds from operations As a result we have taken several steps to protect our liquidity which included reducing our capital program by approximately from our initial plans and working with our lending syndicate to secure our bank credit facilities We have also shutin low or negative margin production If the current commodity price environment continues or if prices decline further we may need to make additional changes to our capital program A sustained low price environment could lead to a default of certain financial covenants which could impact our ability to borrow under existing credit facilities or obtain new financing It could also restrict our ability to pay future dividends or sell assets and may result in our debt becoming immediately due and payable Should our internally generated funds from operations be insufficient to fund the capital expenditures required to maintain operations we may draw additional funds from our current credit facilities or we may consider seeking additional capital in the form of debt or equity There is also no certainty that any of the additional sources of capital would be available when required emphasis added This company is skating on some very thin financial ice The cash flow from operating activities was C million and that included help of about C million from noncash working capital accounts Otherwise the cash flow was only C million from operating activities Since the working capital deficit is now C million the company management cannot squeeze the working capital accounts for significantly more additional cash flow in the future In fact if the vendors begin to object that deficit may have to be reduced in the future which would make a very tight situation worse But this lack of cash flow meant that the company needed to borrow C million during the first quarter to fund its capital budget and its other priorities The borrowing base was reduced but the company management states that the new limit of million is more than sufficient to meet their needs Since the loan syndicate is in the United States and the Canadian dollar is weaker the company may not need to borrow as much in dollars to fund its Canadian based operations The credit line will mature in June with no periodic redeterminations or examinations until then Similarly there are no bond payments due for a few years until so there is time for the company to work out a solution to increase cash flow However much of the debt is in United States Dollars so there is a risk of a weaker Canadian dollar at the time of bond maturities Right now there is no cash impact on the varying levels of long term debt Plus the company has significant United States production from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>so there is a chance that cash flow from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can pay the debt since both operations use the same currency The first slide shows the well economics Given the current price of oil most of these projects are attractive Management stated that well costs had decreased by over the past year or so Plus with many possible operational improvements in the future the IRR will increase and time to payout for those projects will decrease significantly in the future What is missing from the current presentation is the heavy oil that normally accounts for a third of the companys production sometimes more in the past That heavy oil production had negative cash flow in the first quarter so the company was beginning the process of shuttingin the highest cost operations so that the negative cash flow would decline But that meant that in the first quarter onethird of the companys production did not contribute to cash flow Even though oil prices have subsequently increased to the point where management is considering restarting those operations the cash flow is nowhere near what it once was and may not be sufficient to help pay interest on the debt or aid in repaying the debt when the time comes Of course Baytex has reacted by redirecting its very limited capital budget to the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>because this project appears to have the most profitability of all the projects But the market questions whether or not the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can provide enough cash flow in two to four years to fund a capital budget and debt refinancing or retirement Drilling times probably do not have much room left for improvement But initial flow rates thirty day average production rates and first year recoveries are still trending upward from operational improvements An investment in this company would place a very large reliance on those improvements to continue and for commodity pricing to not offset those improvements That may turn out to be a very tall order Source Baytex Energy Corp May Shareholder Presentation The first thing that becomes apparent from looking at both slides is that if the latest oil price rally holds up the cash flow will be tremendously better in the second quarter than in the first quarter The commodity prices will be high enough that the heavy oil production would have a positive margin One third of the companys production in the first quarter had a negative margin But that margin will turn positive with the higher commodity pricing So the company has reason to bring back the operations that were shutin If the company realizes an average oil price that is about per barrel higher than the first quarter then cash flow will increase about million which would need to be converted to Canadian dollars at the latest exchange rate In short the company cash flow could easily double from the first quarter to the second quarter just from the improvement in commodity pricing and the weak Canadian dollar Long term cash flow could increase because the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generates a higher price than the companys other projects especially the heavy oil projects So the current budget emphasis on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will help the average selling price However the company really needs a quarterly cash flow of C million which is nearly another double from a forecasted second quarter cash flow of about C million to properly fund the debt requirements and meet the capital requirements of the business A quarterly cash flow of C million give a long term debt to cash flow ratio of roughly which is needed for a smooth operation of the company Anything else would not leave a sufficient cushion for the periodic industry downturns So the rest of the cash flow improvement would have to come from operating efficiency improvements The total interest on the credit line and long term debt was C million If production averages about BOE in a day quarter for a total production of MBOE in the quarter than the interest expense adds nearly BOE to the cost of producing the various products That is one heck of a handicap in the commodity price race Back when oil prices were per barrel or more a per barrel for debt was chump change Now that same amount was nearing of the BOE price in the first quarter So what once was a fairly minor cost has now become a major competitive impediment Costs improvement from operations as shown in the slides above have resulted in the whole industry having lower costs and needing far less capital to expand and maintain production Therefore unless demand expands significantly for oil and gas in the future there is a very serious risk that further operational improvements could be met with declining commodity pricing to squeeze out excess production Given that the company has more than half of its production in the form of heavy oil and gas plus management only has about two years before some debt payments become due the best solution may be to sell about million in stock and use the money to drill additional Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells to increase the overall cash flow While such a sale would dilute the shareholders interests considerably it may be the only way to increase the cash flow to a more comfortable level The other choice would be to do a large debt for equity swap but that would be even more dilutive Since such a move would be voluntary there would have to be an incentive for the bondholders to swap Several companies have been covered that have already tried this but none converted enough debt to avoid bankruptcy Another possibility would be the sale of the heavy oil interests for a decent price But in the current market that appears unlikely What is obvious is that if the company tries to go forward in its current structure there are some very significant cost disadvantages related to the amount of long term debt This company would have to be about or greatermore efficient than the rest of the industry That is a big stretch in a commodity industry and would limit the appeal of the stock as an investment vehicle The company decreased its future costs significantly by switching to development of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this year Plus costs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continue to significantly decrease Management estimates that the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells breakeven at about WTI using an estimated discounted rate of return That is by far the lowest breakeven of all the company projects However the days of WTI oil are long gone The costs to produce unconventional oil continue to drop rapidly Plus the unconventional projects can rapidly increase activity to increase production In the future oil will probably fluctuate between and per barrel If that is the case then this company has its work cut out for it in terms of increasing the selling price by decreasing the differential and by decreasing costs The company has to find the combination necessary to have adequate cash flow and profits throughout the total industry cycle not just the high points Right now that goal appears to be several years away Since the company also has significant debt obligations many investors should be able to find far better and superior returns elsewhere Companies such as Granite Oil OTCQXGXOCF Advantage Oil and Gas NYSE AAV Raging River Exploration OTCRRENF Antero Resources NYSE AR and a few others I wrote about offer a superior return than this company without all that debt risk The cash flow improvement needed for the stock to show any capital gains is really years away As such the stock is probably a trading vehicle for the technical trader This company has a decent chance of surviving the current industry downturn but the amount of long term debt could very well impede the company recovery and lead to years of subpar returns Disclaimer I am not a registered investment advisor and this article is not advice to buy
