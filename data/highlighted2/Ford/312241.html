style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but nervous about buying here Selling puts could be right for you Our recent article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F generated a passionate comments stream Some readers just couldnt believe that the stock went down even after posting good numbers while some suggested making use of pullbacks to collect fat dividends as the yield is more than now Some of these comments are shown below with names redacted We agree that buying high yielding stocks on dips is generally a sound strategy But given the negativity around Fords stock not too many investors might be comfortable buying the shares outright The strategy described below should appeal to such investors You are taking a bullish position on the stock contrary to the misconception that when you do anything with puts you are being bearish You get a premium in your account right away for the obligation to buy the stock at the price you want on the date you want So you decide the date and the price you want to buy and they pay you for it But you are taking a risk in that if the stock drops well below your strike price you still have to buy the stock at the price you chose not the current market price You believe a stock will not drop below a certain level and if it does you want to be a buyer An Example Below is Fords option chain that expires on Jan Lets pick the put for example For selling one contract one contract shares you need to have a cash balance of in your account The premium on this particular put is cents per share that is for a contract <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is well above at the time of expiration Your option expires worthless and you net a cool for about a year for your willingness set aside on this contract Remember your is not locked up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>beyond this point This trade gives you a higher return vs collecting dividends outright for shares This trade also gives you some downside protection as explained below Risk If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>really rockets up from here your option returns will be lower than the stock returns This doesnt look all that likely given how range bound this stock has been and how it goes down even on positive news <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is at or below you are obligated to buy shares at Remember you already netted cents per share when you sold the put So your cost basis is essentially As long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is above this you will have a net positive return when this option chain expires Risk The risk in this scenario is that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>really tanks in the next months and trades below you will still have to buy your shares at With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trading at as of this writing would represent a further fall in price That doesnt look impossible but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should start appealing more to value investors and funds more if that happens The price will represent a yield of assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>maintains the current dividend As shown in the chart below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has never had this yield level since reinstating dividends Although estimates are subject to revisions the current EPS estimate for stands at That would mean buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at in January would represent a forward multiple of which is about half of the companys average PE of over the last five years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has started with a bang in China reporting recordsales in China Changan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automobile Fords joint venture in China also broke sales record in January This trend is likely to continue over the new few months at least as the whole industry is coming of a great and the momentum is likely to continue China is not the only growth prospect for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>As reported in our previous <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had YoY gains in pretty much every single unit The company is also targeting to double its production capacity in Mexico Such actions and the results that typically follow show that the company knows what its doing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a good away from its mean price target of Even the lowest estimate for EPS stands at as of this writing and this gives the stock a forward multiple of If you are current shareholder you could sulk all you want about how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is undervalued but the only prudent thing to do is to reinvest your dividends when shares are depressed One reader commented in our previous <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>article that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the company is alright but the stock isnt Broken stocks of good companies are the ones that would provide good returns in the long run If you are not a current shareholder but wish to buy later consider selling puts Conclusion While we dont own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>yet we are keenly watching the options chain in particular We typically like to buy shares outright but if the trend is not in favor of the stock in question we like selling puts at a level we are comfortable with The strike mentioned in the
