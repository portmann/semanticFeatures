class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Has Momentum Into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha We are long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and have been following the developments with the company over the last year Data from October shows continued European registration strength wrapping up for the automaker The Lincoln MKZ redesign is also a step in the right direction as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>tries to spotlight its luxury brand We are permanent and perpetual <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F bulls We have been shareholders for the better part of the last year although sometimes off and on for rebalancing purposes and we have been watching almost all of the news that has been associated with the company as well as some of the thirdparty sales and registration data that helps us paint a picture of Fords business in between its quarterly reports We want to issue an update today because we havent written about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in a while reiterating our conviction in the company discussing some recent data points that are out and talking about the opportunity in Lincoln Our thesis on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been that the stock price will appreciate meaningfully when the company is able to finally pull back the amount it is investing in itself and allow some of the hard work its done mostly internationally to drop down to the bottom line The company is in a cycle right now of building plants property and equipment internationally and spending a significant sum of money in Europe and China to build out robust businesses in these locales The longterm plan obviously is for these investments in tangible fixed assets all over the globe to eventually provide the company with some operating leverage This is the point where we believe Fords stock will break out of the mud that it is been in and finally reach well over per share It is because of this business plan that we feel its important to constantly monitor as many metrics as possible especially overseas Along those lines European car registrations a metric we have been watching monthly were released for October and while Fords marketshare has slipped slightly from to the overall trend in Europe is positive Registrations overseas continue to grow Here is a copy of the full report and here are some key statistics via Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F car registrations to units in October according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association Overall EU registrations YY to units in October led by strong demand in Italy and Spain Registrations in Germany and France were up It is encouraging to see things moving in the right direction overseas We are looking specifically also for the companys progress in China where it just made a recent investment We have some contracted analysts looking at their business right now and that will likely be the topic of a new article On the domestic front <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to do good things with Lincoln its luxury brand We had written several times in the past about what a significant opportunity we thought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had in rebranding and repositioning Lincoln as one of the premier United States based luxury brands With a brandnew image and brandnew advertising campaign featuring wellknown Matthew McConaughey Lincoln seems to be picking up momentum Most importantly the latemodel Lincoln SUVs and sedans that we have seen in show rooms and on the road continue to look impressive They are modest but sleek they are not too gaudy and have some what of a European feel to them Because of this we were glad to see this mornings news that the company was going to be revamping and redesigning the MKZ Details will be revealed later today Here are some of the details from Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is set to unveil the latest version of its luxury car the Lincoln MKZ at the Los Angeles Auto Show later today The MKZ features a new grille design a threeliter turbocharged engine horsepower vs HP on the current model and an allwheel drive system <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has also installed a new interior look and will offer optional crashavoidance technology and a feature that will automatically slow and accelerate the car in traffic The MKZ competes with GMs NYSE GM Cadillac ATS BMWs OTCPKBAMXF series Daimlers OTCPKDDAIF MercedesBenz CClass and Audis OTCQXVLKAF A in the price category Elsewhere domestically the company appears to be doing very well Judging by the companys last earnings report sales of the F continue to be fantastic with just limited exposure to incentivize selling We still believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a couple of levers they can pull in that department to try and fuel sales even further We were encouraged by the domestic numbers that were reported and we are happy with where the companys business stands domestically right now All in all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to move in the right direction on all fronts Unlike its partner General Motors it has allocated capital wisely investing in itself and is focused on the longterm sustainability and health of the company We think its geographic expansion provides it with some redundancy in terms of business segment sales and we believe the longterm case for holding ford and collecting its yield
