F MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor could not escape the market pull in with shares being down The declaration of a special dividend in the amount of billion share didnt do anything in terms of improving investor sentiment So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F has not been an investor favorite in But though the stock is down yeartodate it might be a smart decision to keep a close eye on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and double down on the automaker in case markets slide again in the coming days and weeks Why Besides a fundamentally sound business and good chances that will shape up to be even better than last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor might get even cheaper than it already is But a better rewardtorisk ratio is not the only reason to buy the stock A higher income and better yield are other reasons In early January I penned a piece on the automaker arguing that the auto makers special dividend was really turning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>into a highyield income stock If you remember Fords CEO Mark Fields said in January that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would pay a special dividend of billion or share in the first quarter which would come in addition to the share base dividend Based on a total projected dividend payout of share in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock yields at the time of writing But the dividend yield might climb even higher than that if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>falls to new week lows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking at a robust but what will the stock do <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has guided for fundamental improvements in terms of operating margins and revenues in but any upbeat guidance can quickly take a backseat to panic selling when markets are going into a tailspin is shaping up to be a good year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but the stock market is another animal than the auto market The first three weeks of have been the worst kickoff period for stocks ever and that doesnt help investor confidence Put differently there is a good chance that markets will test their recent lows Has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock found a bottom yet Id say probably not The biggest risk factor for US and global equities remains the crude oil price and there are still no signs that the global crude oil supply glut is easing If oil slumps so will US stock prices Another risk factor is Chinas stock market that has officially entered a bear market now which damps investor confidence even more Poor macro data points out of China are likely to be a drag not only on Chinese stocks but also on the US stock market that includes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock slid just like the rest of the market last week and slumped to a week low of on Wednesday not counting the flash crash on August At that time Fords stock sold for a whopping yield US stock market indices bounced back on Thursday and Friday after stocks got clobbered on Wednesday but investor sentiment clearly took a hit in the first month of the new yearand that points to more downside over the short haul Investors must be prepared for a longer market correction that sees major US stock indices drop another before they build out a bottom Of course this implies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could fall another in value too no matter how well Fords business is doing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>falling towards on the back of a major market slide is a distinct possibility <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects all geographies with the exception of South America to turn a profit this year and the auto company forecasted profits that are going to be at least as high as they were in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>finished the year strong in the US China and Europe so there is a point to be made for buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>despite the market turbulence That said though chances are that the market will test its latest lows which implies more downside for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Investors are going to pay more attention to macroeconomic data points in the coming weeks Any data that would hint at a slowdown could trigger yet another market panic Another meltdown would make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>only more compelling from a rewardtorisk ratio and yield point of view Tagged Dividends Income Consumer Goods </div></body></html>
