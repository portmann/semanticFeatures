because of the intervention part Its almost as if I were a conduit for a guy at least I hope its a guy inside my head trying to communicate with my readers I sit down to write and letters spill into words and then into sentences and then I see these new ideas and find myself thinking Wow I wish Id thought of this After I submitted my previous column on the financial innovation taking place at Apple I learned that Sprint TMobile and now Verizon are all fighting to best one anothers iPhone offers What is really amazing about the situation is that no matter how this war among wireless carriers plays out there will be one clear winner Apple And in the end the carriers will be collective losers theyll be killing their margins to outsubsidize one another They will be spending millions of dollars on advertising to get customers to come to their stores to buy yes Apple iPhones If consumers choose Apples iPhone Upgrade Program instead of the carriers then Apple will win even bigger as I argued in that column In the meantime will likely mark the year that ATTs and Verizons US wireless service businesses went from growth to stagnation Another observation about Apple Its brand extends far beyond technology and coolness Over the years the company has accumulated incredible goodwill with consumers There is only one other company that comes to mind that has generated a similar amount of affection Amazoncom Amazon made shopping online easy its customer service is impeccable and it is transparent with consumers about pricing After all it allows other merchants to sell their merchandise through its website Amazon will even ship it for them Consumers trust in Amazons pricing is so great that most people dont even bother with comparison shopping anymore they skip Google which is not good news for Google by the way and go directly to Amazon I recently found myself willing to pay a few dollars more on Amazon than on a competitors website because I knew that if I needed to return the product the process would be seamless That goodwill turns Apple and Amazon into platforms a very trendy word on Wall Street now allowing them to launch a wide variety of new products When Apple comes out with the Apple car rumored to be due in it will be able to grab a disproportionately large market share from the General Motors of the world because of that deep well of goodwill By the time my youngest child Mia Sarah who is almost two learns to drive internal combustion engines will likely be a relic consigned to museums just like Fords Model T I had an aha moment when I recently visited a Tesla store and saw its cars power train It looks just like a skateboard it basically consists of a flat slab of metal which houses the battery four wheels and an electric engine the size of a large watermelon Thats it the Tesla has only moving parts I dont know how many moving parts an internal combustion engine ICE car has but it must be hundreds if not thousands Interestingly ICE cars also have more electronics than a Tesla Wall Street is going gaga over the stocks of dealerships especially after Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway bought Van Tuyl Group and car makers I am in the minority but I think that party will come to an end Just like Tesla Apple is not going to be using a dealership model to sell its cars It would not want the Apple car buying experience to be tainted by a sleazy car salesman Just as with the iPhone the company will want to have complete control of the buying experience If both Tesla and Apple bypass the dealership model the GMs of the world will be at an even larger competitive disadvantage They will have to abandon the dealership model too Yes I know selling cars directly to consumers is not legal in many states but if the US Constitution could be amended times the law on car sales which is an artifact of the Great Depression can be amended as well The traditional dealership model is unlikely to survive anyway as its economics dramatically degrade in the electriccar world A car that has very few moving parts and minimal electronics has few things to break and consequently electric cars will need less servicing throttling the dealerships most important profit center The baby boomer generation romanticizes cars Most boomers can recite the horsepower and other engine specs of every car they have ever owned For the tail end of Gen X my generation and Millennials a car is an interruption between Facebook and Twitter We know the brand of speakers in our car but if asked would have to google its horsepower We feel little romanticism for our cars and have much higher brand loyalty to Apple and Google than to GM or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>What is also amazing about electric cars is that they arent that much different from smartphones Smartphone prices have declined significantly over the years because their components became ubiquitous and commoditized With the exception of spark plugs and tires most components of a GM car will be different from the ones youll find in a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The opportunity for scaled manufacturing and so commoditization is very limited in the auto industry The simplicity of electric cars and the declining ambition of Tesla Apple and whoever else enters that space to be known as a car company will likely lead to commoditization of components and thus lower prices Tesla today is more a software and battery company than a car company As we recently discovered Volkswagen is a lot more of a software company than we thought Think back eight years ago to the day when Apple introduced the iPhone No one suspected that it and the smartphones that followed would enable a service like Uber which is busy putting cabdrivers worldwide out of business The unforeseen consequences of the advent of electric cars will reverberate much farther than the demise of dealerships and significant shifts in market share in the auto industry Gasoline can only be made from oil Yes there is ethanol but the economics of ethanol in the US are problematic Sources of electricity are diverse natural gas coal nuclear solar wind hydro oil and Im sure Im forgetting something Seventy percent of oil goes into cars and trucks Just imagine for a second the shifts in global political alliances if oil lost its luster The US might forget how to spell Saudi Arabia and the Middle East might start looking very different Apple may find its date for the Apple car to be a bit optimistic but nevertheless its entrance into the auto industry will likely be successful and very disruptive After all it has the muchneeded software knowhow to design a car it is already working with car companies on CarPlay the iPhonecentered car infotainment system it boasts a global network of stores it has a deep well of goodwill with a billion fans globally it possesses unlimited resources billion of net cash and it generates billion of free cash flows a year and its imagination has not been damaged by decades of producing cars with internal combustion engines Let me stress that last point There is a very good reason why Nokia which at one time was the dominant cellphone manufacturer failed to compete with Apples iPhone It had too much institutional knowledge It had hundreds of engineers who tried to add IQ to a dumb phone They were attempting to convert Symbian a dumb phone operating system into a smart phone operating system Despite Apple showing Nokia how the smartphone should look they couldnt see their product as a smartphone but rather just as the next iteration of a dumb phone General Motors answer to Tesla was not any different from Nokias response to the iPhone GM came out with the Chevy Volt which was really one of its internal combustion engine cars with an electric engine dumped in Unless an ICE car company creates a silo unit isolated from the rest of the operation it will be very difficult if not impossible to get engineers who have designed ICE vehicles all their lives to suddenly change the paradigm of their thinking and turn into electriccar engineers This article was

I currently drive a Nissan Leaf Ive had ICE cars forever and love them But when my transmission blew out I decided to go electric A few things became very apparent Quicker because of torque very speedy very silent the smoothest driving ever I charge in the back of my rowhome on a v outlet takes about a hours at most I only spend an extra a month on electricity my fuel So that was the other big whammy instant savings from paying gas Ive had it for over a year Hasnt been to the shop once It is incredibly reliable If this is how the stnd generation of electric cars are like then I am very happy for the future Also all my electricity comes from green energy suppliers wind solar natural gas and its only cents a kilowatt a week Thu Dickweed Wang By the time my youngest child Mia Sarah who is almost two learns to drive internal combustion engines will likely be a relic consigned to museums just like Fords Model T I wouldnt bet on this if I were him Granted electric autos are going to make big strides in overall market share over the next years or so but there are still a couple of big obstacles to electrics supplanting internal combustion engines within that time frame batteryenergy storage technology still is nowhere near that of gasoline when it comes to driving range particularly when overall cost is considered ie really advanced battery technology is REALLY expensive even the old technology lithiumion batteries used in cars like the Tesla cost about or more to replace and there is something called the oilenergy cartel in the the USA and the world and they will not give up their sales and profits related to vehicle fuels without a HUGE fight Keep in mind these are the same guys that colluded with the auto and tire manufacturers to get rid of the street cars in Los Angeles in the s they will not think twice about doing something similar to retain their position if they are threatened by the widespread use of electric vehicles Thu poland spring Thu Dickweed Wang So lets say you are miles from a gas station or an electric outlet and your car runs out of juice With an internal combustion engine car you walk miles and get a can of gas what do you do with an electric vehicle Get out your solar panel and wait for three days to allow the batteries to charge And range anxiety if there was such as thing is no myth the only electric vehicle widely available today that has over a mile highway range is the Tesla the Nisan Leafs advertised range is about miles but in tests it has been shown to be closer to miles that SUCKS and the Tesla starts at around People are not going to buy into electric vehicles if on a mile trip they have to stop at least three times minimum and wait for hours each time to charge up their batteries or you have to pay at least twice as much for an electric car as opposed to a nice gas powered car with adequate range to be useful for more than going to the grocery store Dont get me wrong here either Im all for electric cars and think they have great potential My point wasis that in the near future I dont think electrics are going to be able to take away a huge amount of market share from gas powered cars due to limited range and cost Who knows there could be some kind of breakthrough to change that but thats when I think that the ExxonMobil boys are going to step in to make sure the existing paradigm continues on There is no such thing as FREE ONLY an a criminal or an idiot thinks so Someone is paying someones being gouged to mark up the priofit and the difference in distribution and infrastructure etc even if you arent being told who it is or how the wealth redistribution that you perceive as FREE to YOU is being done The oilenergy cartel in the USA or the elites that derive their income from them will take over electricrenewables I feel convinced that if we stay on the current trajectory we will at somepoint have commoditized the sun water and air Thu MalteseFalcon Do
