Do Fords December Sales Reveal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Record sales reported in December bode well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock as entire industry witnesses upsurge Fords strengths are now its capital deployment and resource consolidation Annual Report should give a boost to stock price opening up an ideal entry point for potential F buyers On January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F reported the companys best annual sales numbers in a record nine years Total sales touched vehicles in the US thus making <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Americas bestselling auto brand for the sixth straight year Though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>lost considerable market share in more about that later the upsurge in sales for the light truck segment lifted Fords numbers as it did the others The last time sales in this segment went above million was in This past year it recorded a year high of million and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was among those who drove those numbers With the rising tide Fords overall sales have been steadily inching up since the US auto industry slump in Between and the end of overall sales for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have gone from million to million an increase of more than Coming to December of the vehicles sold by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>during the month nearly was accounted for by Fords FSeries pickup truck The truck has been a stellar performer for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>over the years with the company moving a whopping trucks in From the graph above you can see that December sales were within a stones throw of its best sales month for May Was there a specific reason for this sudden increase Lets see With sales declining from August it was almost a given assumption that the company would end the year with a fizzle rather than a bang What supported that sudden spurt Some sources refer to dropping fuel prices as a strong driver of largecar sales in the United States but theres no evidence to support that In fact one study by the Fuel Institute suggests that theres actually no major correlation between buyer habits and the sale of any particular segment of car So if its not simply a question of lower fuel prices driving higher sales then whats the reason Surprisingly it was far simpler than that Heres what I noticed with the auto industrys performance in the United States The US auto market has been on a steady growth trajectory since the recession hitting an alltime high of a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of million units This was considerably lower than the forecasted million yet a major positive for car manufacturers Whats more relevant to the discussion here is that Fords fortunes at home seem to depend largely on the performance of the industry as a whole Thats not a discovery in itself In fact it stands to reason that every car manufacturer will ideally follow the same mirrortrend against overall industry figures My point here is that the credit for spiking sales in December do not reflect Fords performance in the United States as accurately as its market share drop does Having established that I then started to look deeper into Fords position in the United States and thats a completely different story from the positive note weve been on so far Whats Really Happening At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>US Despite what looks like recordbreaking performance from the yearold carmaker the true pulse of the company can be found in its home market in the United States currently the highest revenue earner for the company That market although not on a shaky ground by any standards is being threatened by the Number Three incumbent in the market share race Post the recession that affected all carmakers across the board Fords market share has been on a gradual decline From a peak of in Q it went down as low as in Q of As of Q Fords market share in the United States was Whats masking this problem is its overall sales figures Its something Id expect the executives at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to be worried about considering that Toyota is once again breathing down its necks As of December <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>managed to retain its slim basispoint market share lead over the Japanese manufacturer but thats no guarantee of continuing oneupmanship in this cutthroat market The one thing that offsets this threat from a shareholders perspective is the fact that its operating margins are improving One of the contributors to that margin improvement is the fact that over the years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been consolidating its global manufacturing platforms The objective has been to cut costs so even though were seeing some gains now the bulk of gains will be seen over the next few years in the form of further margin improvement Investorspeak What Does Q and Beyond Hold for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Even though North America is the only region thats significantly profitable right now that situation may well change over the next few quarters As I discussed in an earlier article on Fords European division that market is all set to show positive income Fords Q operating margin improved from to between and and I see that further improving in Q Its YTD income before taxes stood at million as of Q against million for the fiscal And now I believe its December figures will feature heavily in its annual report for due at the end of January Also highlighted will be its operating margin improvement over In addition the fact that its capital deployment is getting more efficient its restructuring in Europe is gaining traction and it has a robust expansion plan in place will all contribute to s performance Putting all these together I expect share price will be given a boost shortly after the report is out In fact the spike might be significant if it can repeat the kind of earnings surprise it delivered in Q This is probably the best time to BUY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>if youre thinking of adding them to your portfolio Existing shareholders should seriously consider adding on as much as they can at this time Tagged Investing Ideas Consumer Goods </div></body></html>
