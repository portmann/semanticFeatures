Should Your Expectations Be If Youre Looking To Invest In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long F MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Why isnt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>taking steps to increase their stock price like GM just did Why didnt they increase their regular dividend Does the special dividend reflect a lack of confidence by management Fords stock keeps going through the floor Should I buy it or if I already own it should I sell These are the two questions facing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors and current shareholders In order to answer the question one needs to make a determination as to why they want to consider owning stock in the company This question should be asked regarding any stock purchase decision whether its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>or any other company There needs to be a rationale as to why you want to own stock in a company and to make a profit is too broad of an answer We all want to make a profit but there are myriad ways of doing that You can make it from dividends short term capital gainstrading gains longterm capital gains shorting the stock buying and selling put and call options etc So if youve decided youre a longterm investor and not one who has the time or inclination to be a trader or delve into options why would you want to buy F Effectively what should you be looking for from owning its stock and what should you expect once you own it Ill tackle the first question now and the second a little later in the article You want to own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the dividend income first and foremost You may make some money on a trade at its current price but this isnt the stock I would buy if I was looking for some quick capital gains As I write this assuming that there is no increase in the regular dividend over the next quarters you should expect to earn a yield on cost of about About of this dividend approx a return comes from the regular dividend sh and the other of the dividend approx a return comes from the recently declared special dividend sh For a large SP stock that is a pretty hefty dividend I also consider the dividend pretty safe because of the amount comes from the special dividend which is previously earned money The B in cash this dividend represents was earned in There are no forecasts questions estimates macro perspectives etc to be worried about regarding this B As to the remainder of the dividend sh that amounts to about B The mean estimate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>based on analysts projections is sh with a highlow estimate of That is about a payout if based on the lowest of the estimates That is a reasonably secure dividend to me So why might have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>decided to declare a special dividend rather than increase its regular dividend as GM did To me this has to do with what I perceive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to be vs other companies While it is certainly a publicly traded company it operates more like a privately held one As a Chief Financial Officer for the past few decades for privately held companies and ultra net worth individuals it is a pattern with which I am very familiar First you need to understand Fs ownership structure In addition to the Class A shares that you and I buy the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>family owns of the voting stock of the company through their ownership of separate Class B shares Regardless of the amount of Class A shares outstanding the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>family is entitled to elect of the Board of Directors thereby keeping effective control of the company That allows them to not really be that concerned about the wants of the Class A shareholders very much like a privately held company where the owners only need to be concerned about themselves and their company I highlighted and their company for a reason In a privately held company the owners main concern is not only the longterm profitability of the company but its longterm sustainability and success as well Dont underestimate this last facet The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>familys name is on every automobile and legacy is a very important factor to them After almost seeing its legacy end years ago remember that they had to hock the blue oval as part of the loan that Alan Mulally had the foresight to obtain in order to keep <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>from following GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy I dont believe the family is going to do anything that might put <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>into that position again Also remember that they had to eliminate the dividend at that time as well Again something the family along with the current management is not willing to risk in the future Hence we get a special dividend out ofalready earned profits and keep a regular dividend at a reasonably low payout ratio so they have a solid floor under it and dont need to be concerned about reducing or eliminating it in the future They may increase it in the future but be certain that it will be to a level that they believe is sustainable safe and essentially immune to reduction or elimination based on the companys cyclicality or macro perspectives So how does a privately held company operate differently than one that is publicly owned Given my previous comment that sustainability longevity and legacy are key essentials you make decisions based on achieving these essentials You dont worry about short term profits you dont worry about other stockholders Class A and you dont worry about stock price You need compensation to live on so you focus on safe dividends and if you make enough money in the year just ended you issue a special dividend You also get to ignore the din of other stockholders clamoring for stock buybacks as a way to increase earnings per share and therefore stock price so you can achieve capital gains Youre the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>family and youre not expecting to sell your stock so what does it matter what price the stock is You ownmanage your company so that it will be profitable over the very long term and so that your legacy will live on You also know that over time your stock price will eventually be a function of your profitability If you manage your company to be profitable for the long term and youre successful in achieving this its stock value must eventually increase That is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is investing strategically in EVs battery improvements design changes platform consolidation automated driving increased use of technology and connectivity increasing market share in growing regions such as China India and Africa etc How they execute will determine their longterm profitability That longterm profitability will determine how much they increase their wealth from an increasing stock price at whatever pace that happens and how much they can raise the floor of their regular dividend and as privately held companies do decide from the profits that theyve already made what they want to distribute to shareholders including the family This takes me to the answer to the second question I posed earlier of what should you expect if you own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock If youre content to accept this way of how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>ownsmanages the company and if it is successful in their strategy and execution you get to go along for the ride pun intended collecting your dividends and if your investment time horizon is long enough pick up some price appreciation as well If youre looking for something other than solid dividend income with the specter of some future price appreciation albeit longterm without the ability to influence how the company operates then I would strongly suggest that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not a stock investment for you and you should be investigating other companies in which to invest If you understand this before you make the decision to purchase the stock you will save yourself a great deal of angst during highly volatile periods like the one in which we currently find ourselves Good luck investors If you appreciate the investment advice contained in this article please show it by following me click on the tab above as well as engaging by commenting The SA benefit
