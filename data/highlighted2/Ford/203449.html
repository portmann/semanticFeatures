Seeking Alpha The global equity market selloff has made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor a compelling income investment After the market meltdown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trades at less than x estimated earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock yields but dividend growth will boost the yield on cost over time A peryear dividend growth over the next three years implies a dividend yield by Stocks have sold off sharply this week but that is not entirely a bad thing Companies like Bank of America NYSE BAC or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F were brutally beaten down at the beginning of the week when Chinese stocks melted down on concerns over faltering growth in China but that doesnt mean investors should run from equities In fact stocks often have the most appealing rewardtorisk ratios when a selloff runs out of steam and investors reprice risk Stock market indices have bounced back from their Monday lows but good companies like Bank of America or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continue to sell for low earnings multiples Frankly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors valuation has declined even more than I thought was possible the stock now sells for less than x forward earnings which reflects investors concerns over global growth On the other hand there is a good chance that investors are overestimating the risk of a Chinainduced recession From a valuation standpoint investors run very little risk of overpaying for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor More importantly the meltdown earlier this week has driven <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor to such a low level that even dedicated dividend investors might want to consider the auto company for their income portfolios Thats right Investors are behaving so irrationally right now that they allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor to sell at a dividend yield That kind of yield is normally associated with medium risk large cap real estate investment trusts not companies of Fords size and equity valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has morphed into an income stock and a rising yield on cost is the real story here No doubt the nearly dividend yield is a major selling point here If you are looking for a solid yield backed by mountains of free cash flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is definitely worth a lock But the high yield only tells half the story And the other half of the story is just as exciting A rising yield on costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor increased its quarterly dividend by in from to per share In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor raised its pershare dividend by to per share Since General Motors announced an ambitious capital return plan earlier this year which I discussed here investors rightfully expect competitive capital returns from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors too General Motors ambition to return more cash to shareholders will also keep the pressure up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor to deliver dividend growth and let investors participate in the growth of the auto company Though it is unlikely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor will grow its dividend at rates north of every year moving forward a dividend growth peryear is entirely within the realms of possibilityif the companys performance remains as robust as it is now A look at Fords excellent US sales results in July proves that Fords growth story is far from being over And even if Chinas stock market remains rocky in the near term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors results depend largely on the US auto market And the US economy is doing just fine Lets assume for a moment that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor grows its annual dividend by just a year which is a significantly lower growth rate than the one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>actually produced over the last two years then the auto company is on track to paying per share annually quarterly in Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor now sells for the lowest price since April Fords market valuation implies a yield on cost Rising yields on cost add to the appeal of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor as an income investment The worldwide stock market turbulence earlier this week has made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor an appealing candidate for a dividend portfolio The auto manufacturer is obviously undervalued at less than x earnings but at a dividend yield <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is also interesting for investors that accentuate dividend growth If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor raises its annual dividend payout by only each year over the next three years which is a much lower rate than Fords actual dividend growth rate over the last two years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors yield on cost will
