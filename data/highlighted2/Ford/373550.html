the Delaware Basin and the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale Recent influx of liquidity will tide it over for some time Good assets overleveraged capital structure that appears to be the problem with Clayton Williams Energy Inc NYSE CWEI CWEI owns valuable assets in both the Delaware Basin and the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale In the Delaware Basin CWEI position in the play is comprised of net acres with over drilling locations based on acre spacing with potential EURs of MBoe that consist largely of liquids In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale CWEI has a net acre position with over locations to be drilled assuming acre spacing EURs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are estimated at MBoe consisting of liquids Given the stacked pay potential of both assets especially the Delaware Basin assets it is clear that these assets would have significant value in a less depressed commodity pricing environment On March CWEI announced a transaction with Ares Management LP NYSE ARES that provided for a million second lien term loan due in that would help CWEI fund its operations for the next several years to a time when commodity pricing would hopefully be improved As part of the consideration ARES was also provided warrants to purchase million share of CWEI common stock at a strike price of share While I have not seen all the terms of this facility CWEI management indicated that the facility contains a springing maturity feature like that found in the companys revolving credit facility The springing maturity feature in the revolving credit facility is such that if CWEI has not refinanced or repaid its outstanding million in Senior Notes due the maturity of the facility will be brought forward to When CWEI reported its Q and full year results it indicated that on a pro forma basis it would have million in cash after paying down amounts outstanding under the credit facility and million in additional liquidity under an amended revolving credit facility Together these would provide for over million in liquidity to tide the company over through this downcycle So far so good However in the earnings announcement the company also provided guidance for I used this information to generate a cash flow model for that suggests the company will only generate million in EBITDAX in In developing this model because I do like the assets I used NYMEX month forward strip prices for both crude oil and natural gas and not the historical values for the first months of In using these higher values my model likely overstates the amount of cash generated What this model suggests is that the company will use a significant portion of the liquidity resulting from the ARES transaction to fund operations Now this model does assume that CWEI pays the interest on the ARES facility at the cash rate of on a quarterly basis CWEI does have the ability to PIK the interest on the facility at a rate Doing so would reduce the cash burn by million and leave the company with million in cash at yearend albeit the balance on the ARES loan would increase to approximately million If my model is at least directionally correct I would expect to see CWEI exercise this PIK option But what does this imply about the companys capital structure Consider the following Even on a marketadjusted basis debtBoe seems rather high on a relative basis More importantly leverage increases appreciably on a debtEBITDAX basis This implies that the debt should trade down Using the yearend pro forma debt balances if I set the calculation for debtE EBITDA to x still a high debtEBITDAX multiple and assume that the value of the ARES term loan remains at par not a very good assumption but I do this for illustrative purposes only the value of the CWEI bonds would likely fall into the s or lower If the bonds decline this dramatically it is likely that the equity will decline significantly as well I would not be surprised if the equity were to decline into the low single digits indicative of option value only The companys property holdings in both the Delaware Basin and the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale potentially have significant value While I think the implied valuation parameters for certain Delaware Basin acquisition and dispositions undertaken by Concho Resources NYSE CXO earlier this year are no longer applicable the following table spreads the data from two of the transactions If I use the average acre this implies a valuation for CWEIs Delaware Basin properties in excess of billion without ascribing any significant value to its properties in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale It is also the case that Reeves County where CWEI has the bulk of its acreage is amongst the most attractive acreage in the Delaware Basin However I think that given what is happening to borrowing bases and the like financing acquisitions in will prove challenging absent the significant use of equity funding Further the number of distressed assets on the market will likely increase in In recent days attention has focused on companies such as Gastar Anadarko and Chesapeake that have decided to sell assets or are rumored to be considering such sales Given the much smaller universe of potential buyers I think asset values will necessarily deflate In February a UK company Nostra Terra acquired properties in the Permian and the deal stats from that transaction are presented below Note that Nostra Terra acquired only a stake in the underlying properties I have grossed the values to Despite the attractiveness of the underlying properties I think that investors will focus on CWEIs inability to generate significant cash flow in and the implications of such limited cash flow for the future The ability to finance capital expenditures will likely lag any improvement in commodity prices given the companys prospective debt load Further since the ARES facility will likely include makewhole andor yield maintenance provisions is exceedingly attractive for secured debt if conditions improve it will be difficult for CWEI to get out from under this burden For this reason while I like the notion of shorting the debt the current cost of carry over is more than I would choose to pay as it would offset my expected gain Instead I think the right trade is to short the stock The stock has been extremely volatile today but if I am directionally correct about where the Notes will trade and the price of these dropped from at the end of yesterday the equity will likely decline Great assets overleveraged capital structure CWEI has a strong legacy position in the Delaware Basin and an attractive position in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale However with its recent second lien transaction the company appears more overleveraged than before And if the guidance provided is reflective of actual performance leverage is likely to increase The bonds are overpriced but the expected price decline is effectively equal to the cost of carry If the Notes decline to the degree I believe the equity will likely decline Thus I recommend shorting CWEI common stock Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned
