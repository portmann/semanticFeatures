Call Please be advised that this call is being recorded I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr Brian Ector Senior Vice President Capital Markets and Public Affairs Please go ahead Mr Ector Thank you Melanie Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and yearend financial and operating results With me today are Jim Bowzer our President and Chief Executive Officer Rod Gray our Chief Financial Officer and Rick Ramsay our Chief Operating Officer While listening please keep in mind that some of our remarks will contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws On the call today we will also be discussing the evaluation of our reserves at yearend These evaluations have been prepared in accordance with Canadian disclosure standards which are not comparable in all respects to United States or other foreign disclosure standards Our remarks regarding reserves are also forwardlooking statements I refer you to our advisories regarding forwardlooking statements oil and gas information and nonGAAP financial measures and the notice to US residents contained in todays press release All dollar amounts referenced in our remarks are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified Thanks Brian and good morning everyone Today Im going to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and yearend for and how we continue to position our company to withstand the low commodity price environment I will also discuss how we remain focused on prudently managing our operations to maintain strong levels of financial liquidity I will break my comments into four parts for you today First I will talk about our operating and financial results Second Ill provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity Third Im going to discuss our yearend reserve report And lastly I will provide an update on our operational plan for Our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year were consistent with our expectations and reflect a reduced pace of drilling activity Production averaged over BOEs per day during the fourth quarter as compared to just over BOEs a day for the third quarter For the full year production averaged BOEs per day in line with guidance Capital expenditures for exploration and development activities totaled CAD million for the fourth quarter and CAD million for the full year in line with our annual guidance In we participated in the drilling of net wells with a success rate And importantly we realized over CAD million in efficiencies in as we focused on cost reduction initiatives across all of our operations Our performance in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was strong during the fourth quarter as we maintained a consistent pace of development averaging six drilling rigs and two frac crews on our lands In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we produced approximately BOEs per day as compared to BOEs per day in the third quarter Significant advancements were made in the past year to delineate the multizone development potential of Sugarkane acreage We continued to implement stack and frac pilots which target up to three zones in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>formation in addition to the overlying Austin Chalk formation In we drilled net wells on our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>acreage out of which targeted the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>targeted the Austin Chalk targeted the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and targeted the upper portion of the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In recent production data from one pad which consists of four wells that targeted three zones achieved day initial production rates ranging from per well ranging from to BOEs per day We currently have of these multizone projects in various stages of execution and production Of the gross wells that commenced production during the fourth quarter in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>of those wells have been producing for more than days and have established an average day initial production rate of approximately BOEs per day Production in Canada averaged BOEs a day in the fourth quarter as compared to approximately BOEs per day in the third quarter The reduced volumes in Canada are due to the cancellation of the Canadian drilling program as a result of low crude oil prices We generated funds from operation of CAD million or CAD per share during the fourth quarter For the full year funds from operations averaged CAD million or CAD per share Our operating netback in the fourth quarter was CAD per BOE or CAD per BOE including financial derivative gains Our Canadian operations generated an operating netback of CAD per BOE while the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generated an operating netback of CAD per BOE Id like to highlight a couple of key points regarding our netback for this quarter Our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>assets are located in South Texas proximal to Gulf Coast markets with light oil and condensate production priced off of a Louisiana Light Sweet crude oil benchmark which typically trades at a premium to WTI Declining production in the region has increased competition for crude supplies resulting in lower transportation and gathering cost and improved price realizations This strong pricing combined with low cash cost contributed positively to our operating netback in the quarter And as I mentioned during the quarter we continued to focus on cost reduction initiatives across all of our operations Production and operating expenses decreased on a per BOE basis and transportation expenses have been reduced by on a per BOE basis as compared to the fourth quarter of We are also benefiting from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>assets which have lower operating costs and comprised a larger percentage of our production On the corporate side our GA was CAD million in the quarter as compared to CAD million in the fourth quarter of This decrease is primarily a result of reductions to staffing levels to coincide with lower levels of activity combined with reductions in discretionary spending Now for a little more color on our financial liquidity We continue to adjust our capital plans based on our outlook for fund flow to minimize any future increases to our debt balances Total longterm debt at the end of the year was CAD billion comprised of a bank loan of CAD million and senior unsecured notes of CAD billion We have unsecured revolving credit facilities consisting of CAD million Canadian facility and a CAD million US facility that mature in June of At the end of December we had approximately CAD million in undrawn capacity on these facilities Our bank lending syndicates agreed to relax the financial covenants contained our unsecured revolving credit facilities twice during In each case these amendments were obtained proactively as we remained in compliance with our unamended financial covenants throughout Our debt to trailing months EBITDA was times at December We will continue to manage our current facilities and as the outlook for commodity prices remains slow or further deteriorate we may seek further covenant release This could possibly include grinding our bank lending syndicates security over our assets The indentures governing our senior unsecured notes provide that we may secure up to US million of indebtedness in priority to the unsecured notes Now shifting to our reserves the addition of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to our portfolio has significantly enhanced the quality of both production and reserve base In for our exploration and development activity took place in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Our reserves report reflects this investment profile with significant growth in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reserves offset by reduced heavy oil and thermal reserves In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>our proved plus probable reserves increased to million BOEs and we replaced of production there Since the time of acquisition in June we have increased our proved plus probable reserves in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>by Excluding normal reduction proved plus probable reserves increased to million BOE and we replaced of production In aggregate proved plus probable reserves decreased to million BOE due largely to shipping thermal reserves to contingent resources at Cliffdale as activity here now falls outside our fiveyear investment plan We also saw the removal of heavy oil reserves due to reduced commodity prices and technical revisions Our yearend reserves are comprised of liquid and natural gas We realized finding and development costs of CAD per BOE on a proved plus probable basis Based on our operating netback of CAD per BOE we generated a strong recycle ratio of times And we achieved a significant reduction in our future development costs from CAD billion at yearend to CAD billion at yearend This was primarily due to decreases in drilling completions and facility capital costs as well as the removal of capital associated with a reduction in our thermal reserves Allinall were very pleased with our yearend reserves report for Now with respect to our marketing efforts for we have entered into hedge on approximately of our net WTI exposure with fixed at approximately CAD per BOE e and hedged utilizing a threeway collar structure We have also entered into hedges on approximately of our net heavy oil differential exposure and of our net natural gas exposure You can find the details around our hedging programs in todays press release The unrealized financial derivatives gain with respect to our WTI hedges on February was approximately CAD million Now Id like to comment on the outlook for We are committed to preserving financial liquidity through this downturn and as we have outlined in the past we are targeting capital expenditures to approximate funds from operations in order to minimize additional bank borrowings Our original production guidance was set at to BOEs per day with a budgeted exploration and development expenditure range of CAD million to CAD million This budget contemplated ramping up activity in the second half of Based on the forward strip for the remainder of we do not plan to execute our heavy oil development program this year We will forego the drilling of net Technical Difficulty and net wells at Lloydminster In addition we are proactively shutting approximately BOE barrels per day of currently low or negative margin heavy oil production in order to optimize the value of our resource base and maximize our funds from operation Should netbacks improve we have the ability to reset these wells within a month We currently anticipate that this production will be brought back online midyear In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we now anticipate a reduced pace of development in with approximately to rigs and to frac crews working on our lands At this pace we anticipate bringing approximately net wells on production in as compared to our prior expectations of to net wells In aggregate we now anticipate the capital expenditures of CAD million to CAD million of which approximately will be invested in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>At the midpoint this reflects a reduction in capital spending relative to our initial expectation and reduction relative to capital expenditure Taking into account the shutin heavy oil volumes and a reduced capital program we now have a revised production guidance range of to BOEs per day for Our revised production guidance represents an approximate reduction in our original guidance excluding the impact of shutin volumes This compares to a reduction in our capital budget demonstrating the strong continued strong performance of our assets Our capital program will remain flexible and allows for adjustments to spending based on changes in the commodity price environment And with that I will conclude my formal remarks and ask the operator to please open the call for questions Hey good morning guys Looking at the language in the release with regards to the revolver it looks like there are things that you would do if pricing goes lower how do you feel about convent compliance going into the middle of this year And if it gets tight is this something that youre working on now or have not yet started Yes Dan just Ill let Rod answer any details that we may have here but just suffice it to say that we have continued through this downturn to work successfully with our banks on the covenant release that weve released today and feel thats sufficient now And like we mentioned that we do have as in our debenture disclosures the ability to secure part of our facility if we deem necessary in the future How long would it take to go from starting those conversations to achieving that if you felt that oil moved to lower in the next month or two Yes its really something that I wouldnt speculate on start to finish conversation on something like that but our bank syndicate has been supportive and if we need the ability to do that thats a potential for the future but at this stage thats really all we can comment on Hey guys just a quick question on Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well cost Marathon has come on and said that their well costs have dropped too as well as million per well Just wondering if you can translate that yours or are you still sticking with that US million number No we brought our cost down essentially in line with the actual data that we have seen todate and the AFEs that we are getting today So relative to and just for clarity here we I believe their numbers that they published do not include the tiein cost I may be mistaken if they changed that but I dont believe they include the tiein and artificial lift so we have a little bit of discrepancy but our US million that we were quoting we moved down for this year quite substantially to US million and we hope to improve on that as the year goes on But ours do include our numbers that I just quoted include the full tiein hookup and artificial lift everything for the well Right okay Makes sense And then just as far as the technical revisions going your reserve report seems like you had very positive technical revisions down there Are your EUR assumptions also changed internally here or is it still that the per well They are still coming in on about that range We got now four five different areas and four five different levels of formation that we are drilling within the entire Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>window So there is a range in that but thats kind of a decent midpoint Its a little early the IP has continued to improve as they did from to Of course its just here in the first quarter in but hopefully we will see another round of improvements this year Okay And then just finally so wells brought on some of those are in backlog How many new wells do you anticipate drilling this year Hi thank you for taking the question Can you talk a little bit about the heavy oil wells that were shut in and what do you think you need to see in terms of price in order to bring those back online And could you help us just understand what the cost associated with doing both of those actions might be Sure Its really the volume that we are shutting in is really a reflection of where pricing has been over the past quarter or here so far in Q of So as we get below CAD a barrel part of the production becomes uneconomic at CAD to CAD WCS differential which is where we were throughout parts of January and most of February And we kind of anticipate of staying shut in through the second quarter Now if we get a price spike we can bring it on in relatively short order and would probably seek to do that But if prices kind of stabilize through the quarter and at the end the end of first and on into the second were into spring breakup we rose our required work if youre moving crude around and so our operating expenses are always a little higher during spring break up So its a good quarter if youre going to have production shut in to go ahead and forego the little bit of incremental operating expense that exists in that second quarter and then as you move into the third hopefully prices will follow the forward curve Were up into the CAD to CAD CAD maybe CAD a barrel range and we anticipated at that stage probably bringing all that back online at that timeframe Okay Thats helpful So anything kind of close to that CAD range you feel like makes sense to assuming kind of a normal differential to bring it back Yeah What we dont want to be is just continually turning it on and turning it off So as prices got down into the s that we saw in the highs and lows and the WCS differential was out at thats when we made the decision to go ahead and take off this low margin or negative margin production which some of it is and get go ahead and get that offline its likely will stay down for the second quarter Differentials have moved in theyre in kind of the CAD to CAD range right now as we move out So that will help a little bit as we move into the second quarter Prices are up a little bit and if they move a little bit higher here towards the higher end of the s well take consideration of it knowing the fact that moving crude and fluids around all the fields in Canada is a little bit more expensive to do during the second quarter So well take that into account but if it looks like prices are going to sustain themselves in the highs or lows I would expect at some point here most of that production would come online and it would stay online Okay Thats helpful And can you just remind me what the costs associated is it material at all to bring it back online Not really We can get Brian the details on that if youve got some modeling but to bring it back on it is very expensive to shut it in and its not very expensive to bring it back Sure And then maybe just kind of two quick questions I guess number one I appreciate the disclosure on the reserves in the release and Im just kind of curious if you guys have run what your kind of p or your PDP PV numbers might be if you are to assume the strip rather than the price that was in there Yeah If weve got modeling questions like that why dont we follow up with Brian on the specific disclosures All we have on NPVs are what are in the NI disclosures at this stage Okay Fair enough And then maybe just lastly perhaps as a followup to one of the other questions here but if we kind of assume the strip plays out this year and we end up bringing back the kind of a day do you feel that you should be able to maintain compliant with that comment that you guys have suggested there that I guess the times the revolver Yeah This is Rod talking We currently under current strip prices see ourselves well through Q and probably through Q under the current strip but there is other options that we can do to see ourselves be in compliant with the covenants throughout Okay Thats helpful And I guess in terms of other options would that like include asset sales or something along those lines or Hi Good morning gentlemen and congrats on another quarter as well as I imagine through a tough I have a couple of quick questions The first one is on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>specifically what the budget I was just first curious as to how much associated facilities were included in your revised budget And second if you guys are participating in all of the wells drilled within the AMI Yes Couple of answers there I think the facilitys number is approximately million in change US in that range that we got in the budget and I dont know that we will spend all of that but thats what weve got in the remainder of our budget for the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in And your followup question was Yeah Essentially were Were making that judgment primarily based on the economics of the individual wells as they do vary across their acreage position Okay And just one last question just with respect to Canada the small amount of capital that you guys are allocating towards Canada is that for just base maintenance or is that wells or what Yeah Essentially just small amounts to base maintenance capital We did have one drilled well that we did this year already thats in the number thats behind us but the rest of it is just basically maintenance capital Sorry guys I just wanted to followup on a prior question so the existing guidance right now the to that includes all of the shut in production assuming it doesnt come back on for the entire year or do you have a little bit coming back on in your assumptions Thomas that assumes that its shut in essentially as were tapering into it from now until the beginning of the third quarter So it assumes that does come back at midyear Thank you There are no further questions registered at this time Id like to turn the meeting back over to Mr Ector Thank you The conference has now ended Please disconnect your lines at this time We thank you for your participation
