ratifies contract with GM but pact with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a tougher nut to crack General Motors Company NYSEGM Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class performance yield and more check out the ETF Hub ETF Hub Nov ET By Carl Surran SA News Editor The United Auto Workers union ratifies a fouryear labor agreement with General Motors NYSE GM after most rankandfile GM workers voted in favor of the new contract two weeks ago The new contract which goes into effect on Monday calls for raises for all workers and the end of the twotiered pay system average labor costs of which pay is nearly half for GM workers will be hour by up from now according to a new study by labor analysts released today Meanwhile the UAW is racing to save a proposed labor deal with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F that would mark a significant setback if rejected a vote today at a Dearborn Mich plant is considered critical and earlier plant tallies had contract opponents leading by votes Not so fast Tdot This Detroit Free Press article indicates that things may not be as dark as you think Here is a quote from the article Its a close vote Nick Kottalis chairman of UAW Local s Dearborn Truck Plant unit said Friday afternoon Its the last day of voting on a national contract and its close so naturally tensions are high Fork workers voting against this deal are only hrurting themselves When those vehicles do not hit the showroom on dealerships the layoffs will begin Senior workers voted in favor of the contract at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>while younger members rejected it Doesnt bode well for the UAW if they cant unify their own members im pro union and the contract looked very goodsend the ignorant and ungrateful ones out on strike for awhile and see how fast they accept a lesser contract they seem to have forgotten that they were fully trained in a week and anybody off the street can replace them in a weeks timeheck id go so far as to say there is someone else who love to have thier job How do you know how all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>workers can be replaced and trained in a week Of course others would like their jobs There are millions who would like their jobs and yours for less money Interesting point truth The story is that if the contract is rejected it reverts back to the status quo version and everything new in the version is off the table including all the negotiated bonuses pay raises benefits the year growth path from the lowest to the highest tiers and all the job guarantees and investment plans for US factories And Easter Monday And the Ranger and Bronco that were supposed to be built at Wayne Michigan as the UAW went around bragging about which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>never confirmed by the way they could get crossed right back off the product plan Got to hand it to the UAW membership Even they dont realize how badly they screwed up You get a couple of crazies that are satisfied with nothing short of killing the goose to get at the golden eggs and those radical nuts ruin it for everyone Strangely like the radical Tea Party wing which has done everything they can to destroy the republican party and conservative objectivism I know trust me I knowive worked allmost every job on an assembly line well I suppose if your stupid it make take longer to train you but most jobs are mastered within days exactly right tdot ive worked those jobs and walked the picket line and you are spot on however you can not pass on knowledge to most young people as they are emotionally underdeveloped and must learn everything for themselves usally the hardest and most painful way possible I cannot fathom paying someone per hour to put a car together No wonder more automation is needed after all to press buttons to make burgers LOL not What did you expect with the UAW owning a big piece of GM What did you expect with the UAW at war with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>because of all the employee perks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has provided without influence from the union Hell the union has veiled threats to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to back off all the uncalled benefits or there will be trouble Having friends in the lower Lake Michigan area I got the word that this is all about insuring GM breaks the long term standing of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>selling the most trucks Most investors are driven by fear as are all who lack knowledge In this case a strike is a good choice to achieve its goal but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and I know that this particular goal will net net hurt the wage earners at the absolute worst time Everyone is talking and yet union management is gloating about screwing the employees What do people really believe these scumbag rednecks dont talk openly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>spends pocket change annually to pay properly vetted salaried staff to frequent favorite wage employee hangouts just like Chrysler and GM and likely most others I understand this practice is quite well established It is just like the Russians and the Americans they provide each other breathing room in the spying business to avoid surprises lets hope cooler heads and rational thought will prevail its a win win for all involved it cant be only one winner all sides and factions must give and takehopefully
