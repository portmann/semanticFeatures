activity in much of North Americas shale plays is no longer profitable In its Analyst Day Carrizo Oil and Gas NASDAQ CRZO CEO Chip Johnson quipped that at these prices he didnt know how companies in the marginal shale plays would be able to make it To get an idea of what Johnson was talking about take a look at average breakevens in some of the more marginal shale plays Courtesy of Carrizo Oil and Gas Analyst Day Presentation The chart above shows that there are only a few shale plays that will work with WTI in the s Even in the strongest plays drilling activity would need to be in the above average areas or the sweet spots Like all shalefocused EP names Carrizo has been effected by the bear market in crude oil but the company has one fantastic trump card that many other EPs would love to have right now the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale While Carrizo isnt the amazing growth story that it was no EP company is the company can definitely weather through this bear market Unlike some of the increasingly distressed names in this space Carrizo will not have to put any assets up for a fire sale Courtesy of Carrizo Investor Relations Since Carrizo made the decision to dump shale gas properties and acquire shale oil properties Four years later and despite a crash in crude oil prices management still doesnt regret the decision Today Carrizo owns significant assets in the dry gasrich Marcellus the NGLrich Utica the oily Niobrara and finally the oily Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Of the four the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to provide the highest returns by far Lets briefly go over the companys other positions Carrizo is essentially done drilling in the Marcellus due to low gas prices and a wide spread between dry gas in Pennsylvania and that of Henry Hub Neither the Niobrara nor the Utica are very profitable with crude oil at this level and Carrizo has minimized drilling in both of these plays Fortunately the requirements to hold mineral rights on these properties are minimal and Carrizo sees no danger of losing land rights in either location This year Carrizo will run one single rig in the Niobrara Courtesy of Carrizo Investor Relations Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Returns near in the case of cost reduction In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Carrizo has every reason to continue drilling The rule of thumb for profitable drilling is a minimum return of With that in mind have a look at the chart above Carrizo has already achieved a cost reduction in drilling and completion this year Therefore returns in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should be somewhere around even with WTI at per barrel Courtesy of Carrizo Investor Relations In Carrizo is bringing its capital expenditure down from million to million a decrease of Unsurprisingly the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>receives the lions share of capital spending Carrizo will have three rigs operating in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this year For most shale EPs in a capex cut would not be enough to close the funding gap between operational cash flow and capital expenditure But Carrizo will outspend operational cash flow by only million in based on WTI Even most of that funding gap will go away by Also net debt to EBITDA will increase but not by too much Have a look Courtesy of Carrizo Investor Relations This chart shows net debt to EBITDA declining over the last few years With the collapse in crude oil prices net debt to EBITDA has begun to climb again Keep in mind however that most midcap shale EPs are expecting net debtEBITDA levels of five or even six times Carrizo does not expect debt to EBITDA to rise above four times until at least the end of Hopefully prices will have recovered by then Carrizo is one of the EP stocks that didnt stay down for long Already the EVEBITDA ratio is back up to almost five times though that number will be increased by much lower EBITDA over the next couple quarters Is it a buy right here Well first of all Carrizo is no longer a big growth play although I suspect that it will be if WTI gets up to around or again In the mean time there is no dividend to tide you over Buying Carrizo means picking up a prime piece of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but at a relatively high price Remember most other shalefocused EP names have not recovered like Carrizo has Because I dont believe WTI is going to significantly recover anytime soon I believe that Carrizo will be sideways money for awhile Still this name is definitely worth keeping on your radar This company is definitely not going to face the turbulence that most other midcap shale players will Source Carrizo Oil And Gas Shows Why It Has The Best Assets Disclosure The author has no positions
