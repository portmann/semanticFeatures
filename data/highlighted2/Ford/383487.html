FCF Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company Pass My Free Cash Flow Tests <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha F has recently interested me again after I investigated their debt situation more fully Now it is time to put F in front of my five free cash flow tests How well will it perform F manages to pass all of my FCF tests comfortably making it an interesting automaker pick anywhere below about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F recently caught my attention after I realised that I had been unfairly overlooking it due to its total debt levels more on this later but read my previous article for more detail Getting back onto my watchlist is just the beginning however Before I can seriously consider it as an investment however I need to dig a little deeper Consequently now it is time to switch it up a bit and look at the company in more depth Here I plan to focus on its FCF free cash flow performance by passing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>through my five FCF tests These tests form the first steps in my analysis of a company Although far from exhaustive it gives me a good indication of its competitive advantages its FCF health and efficiency as well as the debt and dividend position Fair value based on FCF alone is also calculated These tests merely mark the first step in what may develop into a more thorough analysis of the business in the future So lets get started Very little has to be said about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I am sure It is of course an iconic car brand Globally it continues to command robust market shares with of cars sold globally in coming from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stable Yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does not just make money by directly selling cars to consumers It also makes money from helping those buyers finance their purchases The manufacturing segment may generate of all revenues but the finance segment contributes nearly to company profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit has proven to be a valuable and stable earner for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>during a period when its income record has been erratic to say the least from the automotive segment This doublelayered dimension to the business has important implications on how we assess the company as will become clear later on For now it is enough to say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a series of car brands which have strong market positions across the globe and a highly profitable financial arm First is a simple test All I look for here is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>managed to generate positive FCF in the last five years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gets off to a solid start on this front Despite a somewhat erratic FCF performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has maintained a positive FCF throughout the last five years Therefore it earns a PASS on the first test Now we get to the matter of debt In keeping with many carmakers it has high levels of debt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however does carry more than most Yet as noted in my previous article where you can find more detail most of this debt in holedup in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit part of the business Considering over of the companys revenues are produced by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automotive it may seem strange that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit absorbs over of its debt The reason is quite simple Debt held at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit is for all intents and purposes good debt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>borrows money to lend out to consumers at a higher interest rate Consequently as Fords CFO Bob Shanks noted the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit debt is discounted by credit agencies when assessing the companys financial strength Here I plan to follow the same course Therefore the debt actually under assessment looks like this What really concerns me with this test however is not the absolute value of the debt Instead I want to see a healthy coverage of this debt by FCF My target here is FCF coverage of that debt This would mean that the company could pay off the entire debt in just four years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>therefore pulls together a pretty strong looking FCF coverage of its automotive debt Even in the years when FCF was far weaker and debt far higher and it managed to have FCF cover its entire debt by around by target Outside those years it comfortably surpasses my target Indeed in it covered it by nearly suggesting it would in theory take less than oneandahalf years to repay its entire automotive debt using FCF alone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>offers up another compelling PASS here as well then CROIC Cash Return on Invested Capital Next is a more challenging test CROIC The Cash return on Invested Capital is calculated by dividing the FCF by the sum of the companys debt in this case still only automotive and its shareholders equity The CROIC gives us an indication of the cashgenerating efficiency of the company A CROIC of means that for every of capital invested it produces in FCF That is a very attractive return and indeed serves as my CROIC test target Again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>performs extremely well here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>did dip below my target though hardly substantially in Yet outside of this year it has been comfortably above my threshold with it in fact crossing the mark last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>produces another strong PASS here as well Now to the allimportant dividend Fords recent dividend history has been less than stellar Indeed that is the chief reason I have overlooked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>up to now Sure since the dividend has grown at a remarkably swift pace Yet that was on the back of an absence of dividend since Nonetheless the current ordinary dividend does not look under threat Right here however I want to see a handful of things for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to pass my FCF yield test A FCF yield that is the yield if they paid out all their FCF as a dividend of or more An ordinary dividend FCF payout ratio of or less So how does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>do here Well exceedingly well indeed Not only does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>come out with an epic FCF yield well above my target but it also pays out just of its FCF to supports its current yield It must be said that this remains the strongest performance here across all the FCF tests I have done Another PASS here Finally we come to the valuation point What I want to see here is the current share price to be below my fair value assessed by FCF metrics For this I use the enterprise value to FCF ratio Over the last five years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has had a somewhat erratic EVFCF ratio This would suggest an average EVFCF ratio of Id argue however that and were particularly anomalous years due to their weak FCF performance and therefore should be set aside in ascertaining a fair value ratio Doing so offers us a fresh EVFCF ratio of instead I will use this instead Next I need to predict Fords FCF over the next two years This I achieve by taking the consensus revenue estimates for those years and multiplying them by my target FCFRevenue figure This I calculate by taking the average FCFRevenue figure from the last five years and that of last year specifically These were These are then fed into this simple formula which gives twice the importance to last years FCFRevenue performance to reflect any recent improvement or deterioration Predicted FCF to Revenue Ratio FY LY This produces a predicted ratio of for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The revenue estimates for the next two years are then multiplied by this FCFRevenue figure to produce predicted FCF figures I then average these twoyear FCF predictions and multiply by the fair value EVFCF ratio Doing so gives me a FCF fair value of With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>currently trading at just a little over at the moment this suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is currently over below my FCF fair value Once you have got a firmer handle on the nature of Fords debt situation it becomes clear that this iconic automaker is looking pretty attractive right now Indeed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>managed to pass all of my FCF tests comfortably including unusually at the moment the valuation one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has of course had a fairly rough few years as testified by their recent dividend history Yet it is clear that it is performing extremely strongly at present Yield hunters may well be tempted by the high ordinary yield and potentially lucrative opportunities for further special dividends in the near future Nonetheless it is clear that for those attracted to robust companies that produce strong cash flows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also offers a great deal With it still trading over below what could be considered a fair and far from strenuous FCF valuation it looks a pretty compelling buy right now Sure it operates in a cyclical industry which has struggled in recent years Yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains an impressive and iconic player in this space If you are looking for exposure to the automaker sector Id find it hard to argue against <span
