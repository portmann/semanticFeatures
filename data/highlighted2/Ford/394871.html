</span>posted an outstanding quarter and auto sales have been screaming recently In the background and also at the forefront of this success is a seldomcelebrated aspect of the company The results from this aspect of their business warrant their own look and give great insight into the overall health of the company Investors have called for this area of the company to be spunoff taking a look at the quarterly performance should end that argument Tucked deep in the dark recesses of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F lies a relatively unknown and unappreciated aspect of the Detroitbased auto giant This asset generated billion in pretax profit in and is expected to generate at least that much but likely more in It extends the reach of the company and provides great defense during down times in the market This portion of the company is both selfsustaining and selfliquidating I am of course talking about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit At one point in time not too long ago an inhouse financing arm was viewed unfavorably by investors During the Great Recession they proved to be a huge liability and was a huge contributor to the fall of General Motors NYSE GM When the government stepped in to save GM they forced GMAC and their horrible loan portfolio to be spunoff in and it became Ally Financial NYSE ALLY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>avoided government intervention and as a result was able to retain <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit Many lessons were learned and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has done remarkable things with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit Many investors in the past have called for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to spinoff <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit to unlock some value for shareholders Looking at the contribution that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit makes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor I think that is an incredibly shortsighted and foolish idea The financing capabilities of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit extend the reach of the company and helps ensure dealership success and even protects against down markets The Q earnings release that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>just posted was their best ever In three months they recorded a pretax profit of billion and their operating margins rose to an impressive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit results during this quarter were equally impressive and contributed greatly to the overall success Thankfully for investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>realizes the importance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit and therefore has begun a separate conference call to cover these results The accompanying slideshow is also a wonderful resource and is where all the images in this article originate The below slide shows the performance metrics of some major areas Most encouraging was the increase in pretax profits contributing million to the billion quarterly total That strong growth in managed receivables is also impressive and should drive profits for this division even higher in subsequent quarters There are concerns that warrant additional coverage Investors may take issue with the drop in the average FICO score and the rise in losstoreceivables along with day delinquencies Historically this is typical of the first quarter given the promotions that the company runs at the start of the year These promotions typically financing attract many potential buyers into dealerships Not every customer will qualify for but if they went to a dealership with the intent of buying a car theyre more likely to walk out with a car As a result we get a drop in overall quality Historically a FICO score is typical of the average for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit It just so happens that and were highwater marks for the average going back to coming in at and respectively The highrisk loans are still sticking at which is where the company intends to keep them No concerns here The losstoreceivable also experienced an uptick and unfortunately is at a multiyear high Both the slideshow and the conference call addressed this concern in depth The LTR increase was due to the rising bankruptcies and the rising severities as a result Increasing severities can also be blamed on the auction market Auction prices have been lower due to an increased inventory of used vehicles and an increase in new vehicles sales Repossessions rose slightly to which is still historically low For years repossessions had been dropping and in sat at just To address these issues the company has put additional funds in credit loss reserves which now sits at million So long as losses dont go over million the overall company is not at risk and the balance sheet will remain stable Though concerning Im not overly worried but will be eager to see how they do in the second quarter The one bps increase in day delinquencies is hardly worth mentioning The increase to it may seem alarming compared to especially as the subprime loan fears continue to be peddled about Using as a benchmark provides an unfair comparison but going back to this is actually average The overall consistency with this rate says volumes about the loan portfolio that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has It is clear that year over year the company maintains a favorable balance and they clearly know the auto market that they are selling into Im not too worried about this metric right now The record rates of auto sales has opened the door to a rise in these unsavory statistics as well The company still maintains a very healthy loan portfolio and the highrisk loans are stable at The strong growth in pretax profits indicates a very healthy balance and the average FICO score of is still higher quality than other lenders GM for example has of their loans at a FICO of or lower with in subprime territory As Ive stressed in an earlier article investors need not worry about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>when it comes to subprime loans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>turned in a record quarter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit was an integral part of that success Without <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit they would not be able to easily access attractive financing for their dealerships and customers The over half a billion dollar contribution in the quarter cannot be understated Their loan portfolio remains healthy and management has done a remarkable job ensuring the company is not subject to any unnecessary risk This segment of their business deserves much more recognition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>management has been bringing more awareness to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit by doing a separate conference call and providing more material to investors Of course as a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investor my ultimate hope is that the market begins to appreciate what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit really means to the company and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>begins trading at a
