the board <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold off and many are writing why they are selling the automaker due to Mays results We offer an alternative gameplan instead of crudely dumping shares of what we believe to be a great long term hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F posted terrible May sales as did the rest of the auto industry Many people are arguing that the United States auto market is starting to show signs of running out of steam We have been of the sentiment that the entire US economy is slowing down and that a rising interestrate environment is going to cause trouble in the highyield debt markets Weve said this in basically every article weve written over the last year or two Many people seem to believe that this is going to carry over into the auto sector and nary is there a conversation about the shortterm debt cycle or the economy turning over without somebody bringing up their contention that the United States auto market is heading for a downturn US auto stocks trading at crazy low earnings multiples reflect the sentiment that all hell is about to break loose We have acknowledged this line of thinking but we havent really argued against it We know that the United States auto market is getting frothy but we also know that the average vehicle age on the street is at all time highs over years We also are encouraged by Fords ability to continue to post good operating results throughout the course of the last months As we have said in several other articles we have been keeping a close eye on monthly sales European auto registrations and other metrics that we can follow in between Fords actual earnings reports We have noted in the past that a small aberration in one month of data is not necessarily indicative of longerterm pain for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has had sales hiccups before we think its important to see where the company goes from here We would be foolish to say that Mays sales do not have us keeping a very close eye on what is going on That is the truth we are not just ignoring this bad data But we believe there are several prudent strategies to take with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>going forward and we are going to offer up our take on why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may not be a company to just go out and sell because of Mays auto sales First <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to pay out a attractive dividend The companys dividend is now approaching and this is the same company that offered a billion capital return to shareholders in the form of a special dividend just months ago F Dividend Yield TTM data by YCharts That is the type of equity we like to hold onto and use to reinvest The company has also not slacked on investing in itself Many companies that return capital to shareholders wind up lagging when it comes to research and development for their own business because they are so concerned with returning capital For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this is not the case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has continued to do well in its investment initiatives in many different global geographies which we continue to believe will be at the cornerstone to the company operating profitably over the course of the long term We continue to suggest that if you believe the auto credit markets are going to be the problem that you can go out and short Credit Acceptance CACC and be long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CACC provides automobile dealers financing programs and related products and services It advances money to dealers in exchange for the right to service the underlying consumer loans and buys the consumer loans from the dealers and keeps various amounts collected from the consumers The company also engages in the business of reinsuring coverage under vehicle service contracts sold to consumers by dealers on vehicles financed by the company This gives you the benefits of being able to hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and potentially reinvesting dividends while also having a hedge directly on automobile credit If you are like us and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is one of the companies that you have a multiple year outlook on you do not mind holding it and collecting the dividends as long as youre hedging appropriately If you do not want to hedge by shorting CACC you can also have a broader market hedge or a highyield hedge perhaps by shorting SPY or HYG For us however we just dont think that running away due to some poor May sales metrics right off the bat without a pattern is a prudent capital management strategy for a company that has proven that you can exceed expectations and can be friendly to shareholders We dont think its time to panic in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and well continue to hold our shares long while hedging appropriately I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
