Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europes operational restructuring is starting to yield results with November being a turnaround month VWs emission fiasco has helped other carmakers gain market share with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>being one of the biggest beneficiaries Their strengthening pole position in commercial vehicles and growing passenger segment market share will contribute to stock price increases over the next few quarters Back in when the then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F CEO Alan Mulally outlined his plan to completely overhaul operations across its European facilities it caused waves of anger and resentment rippling across the labor communities spanning Genk Belgium the Transit van plant in Southampton and the Dagenham UK panelstamping facility In October we committed to commence a transformation plan for our Europe operations As part of this plan we closed two manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom in and closed our assembly plant in Genk Belgium at the end of The Genk closure was subject to an information and consultation process with employee representatives which was completed in June The costs related to these closures were recorded beginning in the second quarter of The objectives were clear stem the loss of billion from European operations by cutting back on excess production capacity and optimize existing facilities Although the move alienated locals from the American car manufacturer the decision was one that kept the companys interests at the forefront Today that decision is being justified as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe successfully emerges from the ashes of loss and enters a new era of profitability North America Remains Dominant Market Segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>North America has always been the majority breadwinner for the company and it was this division that almost singlehandedly kept the company profitable with billion in income before taxes in that gave them a grand total of billion Nearly every other unit posted losses South America billion Middle East and Africa million and even Europe at billion It did have a little help from the million coming from the AsiaPacific division How <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe is On Its Way to Profitability In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>US was the only truly profitable segment but I believe Europe will add to that list very soon Lets not forget that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still the number one commercial vehicle seller in Europe with a percent market share YTD their best performance since Their lossmaking days are hopefully behind them and November has been the turning point in a long and disastrous journey that began well before Since Volkswagens OTCPKVLKAY embarrassing involvement in the Dieselgate affair their brand name has taken a bad hit and is already helping other car makers like GM NYSE GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>make inroads into their markets This November <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe registered a handsome sales increase in sales On the other side of the coin Volkswagen saw their marketshare drop from a year earlier to in November It doesnt seem that bad when you consider the extent to which the scandal was covered in the media across Europe and the world but when the industry leader loses any kind of ground the rest of the pack swoops in to scavenge and take advantage of the companys misfortunes Along with the success of newer Transit models in the commercial segment and new Fiesta and Kuga models in the passenger car segment VWs shaken position has been a key driver in helping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>limp back to recovery after several lossmaking years in the European Union This year November marks a major turnaround for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe as the EU market is set to recover with sales for November recording a growth This brings the regions consecutive growth streak to months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe saw a increase YTD until November and the month itself saw a huge upswing of over November Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>only sold k vehicles in November and currently holds a market share of only against VWs they have momentum building up behind them It looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe has been one of the main beneficiaries of Volkswagens drop in market share this year Dont forget that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe is the second largest revenue earner for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>group nearly three times that of the Asia Pacific division and has been bleeding for quite some time Since the restructuring announcement the company has been shuffling its way to normalcy and I believe things are finally coming to a head this quarter Investorspeak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe and F Outlook I believe their best years are still ahead of them Their product pipeline is constantly reinventing itself and they are at the top of commercial vehicle segment while slowly moving up in the passenger car segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be aiming to improve its single digit market share in Europe where the dominant group has its brand names on one out of every four passenger car sold in the EU Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europes parent company itself is one of the giants of the automobile industry I dont expect their stock to do a song and dance and show steep increases just because they showed an increase of cars in Europe YTD However I do expect that the strength of their Europe division will eventually reflect on their income statements and as a result on their earnings and share price Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock has been trading in a relatively tight range with recent lows around Thats where its at right now and I expect it will breakout upwards if North America and Europe can jointly move the numbers up during the coming quarters We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact data
