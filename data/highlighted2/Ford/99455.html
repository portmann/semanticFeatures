class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company Buy For The Dividend Alone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Much of the bullishness on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>centers around undervaluation and growth potential These factors are important but so is Fords hefty dividend Other contributors have done an excellent job explaining the growth and value cases for shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company F but I believe the automakers dividend alone makes it a worthwhile investment With shares now trading just above apiece <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>currently yields nearly making it attractive alongside other income plays With the average SP yield being just under Fords dividend seems out of place at roughly double the yield But unlike some other high yielding companies Fords dividend is backed by earnings and its payout ratio remains reasonable Consider that the SP average PE ratio sits at times while Fords normalized PE sits at times With the market assigning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a lower valuation it allows shares to yield far more even sticking with a payout ratio of or using normalized earnings But earnings growth over the next few years should help the automaker to lower its payout ratio to safer levels Of course the automaker may choose to raise its dividend but current forecasts do not present a threat to the current dividend going forward By no means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the only dividend pick I like today but it is one of my favorites Since the shares are not fixedrate securities like most preferred stocks and bonds they escape much of the interest rate risk and potential negative reactions as the Fed moves to raise rates Dividends from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can also benefit from the qualified dividend tax rate unlike bonds and my favorite REIT picks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also occupies a special position in the dividend value area by carrying value and offering a large dividend As my readers know I am bullish on major North American airlines for the value propositions they offer But unlike Fords yield most of these airlines yield around making <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the clear winner for those seeking income Paying out such a large dividend allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors to make money while they wait in contrast to airline investors who are relying on market performance to see gains For both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and airlines the market is waiting a long time before awarding higher valuations but the difference is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors get paid more for their patience during the wait With such a large dividend yield <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has also become one of the largest income plays in the industry While it runs neckandneck with General Motors NYSE GM for the top spot it handily beats Toyota NYSE TM Honda NYSE HMC and Volkswagen OTCQX VLKAY For those such as myself who are bullish on the automotive industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>represents the way to generate the most income This is not to say the other automotive companies will underperform the market but income investors who like this industry should consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>being an aboveaverage dividend payer Unlike some highyielding companies Fords dividend appears sustainable and its payout ratio based on its current dividend rate should fall significantly over the next few years giving investors reasonable dividend security <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has also shown strong management skills over the past several years giving me confidence in the automaker going forward Perhaps best known as the only major American automaker not to reorganize during the financial crisis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has continued to push ahead of GM by avoiding the issues of recalls the hurt GM last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also has the advantage of having a newly released pickup on the market compared with the older versions of rivals This should help keep demand and pricing strong in a key highmargin area for the company contributing to its ability to grow profits and dividends As with all investments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not without risks I see the primary risk facing the company being an economic downturn Since auto sales are cyclical and can be put off when consumers have less cash Fords sales and profits would take a likely take a hit possibly resulting in a dividend cut During the meltdown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>survived without reorganization although it did mean a drop in its share price and a temporary dividend suspension A slowdown in China could also negatively impact Fords growth going forward However having market share in China compared to GM at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is likely to be less affected than GM in this event Although I certainly see the argument for investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for capital appreciation I see the automaker as a strong income play as well A reasonable forward payout ratio coupled with strong growth and management make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>among my top dividend picks for the next couple years Source
