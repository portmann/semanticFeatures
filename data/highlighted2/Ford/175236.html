F for instance sold more cars trucks and utility vehicles in the month of July compared to last year but if you thought thats the best <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could do think again Earlier this month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor released excellent US sales figures for the month of August and the automaker blew through expectations In August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor said it sold vehicles which was more than a year ago when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor now sold vehicles in the first eight months of the year In the same period last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor sold vehicles The sales numbers were indeed excellent news for Fords shareholders because they attest to the strength of the US auto market and to the disconnect between Fords actual sales performance in its most important market the United States and Fords valuation Fords August performance was driven by growing utilities and truck sales while car sales remained weak In August <span

fundamentals support bullish investment thesis In previous articles about the auto company I contended that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor will most likely see continued momentum on both a volume and price basis for two reasons The labor market is tightening which supports wage gains and boosts consumer spending Full employment and consumer spending growth could fuel demand for pickups even more in the months ahead Pickup demand is already strong especially for Fords F Confidence in the US economy is high Even if the Fed lifts rates this week economic conditions are the best they have been since the Great Recession And Fords earnings are set to profit According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors latest press release the auto maker had the best August performance in nine years and Fords bestselling FSeries continues to exceed expectations In August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor sold more than FSeries trucks while FSeries retail sales shot up While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor produces excellent sales results month after month at least in the United States investors still avoid the company as an investment For one thing auto makers are simply not favorites in the stock market right now Secondly investors are more cautious about stocks after the stock market
