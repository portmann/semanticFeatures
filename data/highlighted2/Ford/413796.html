General Motors Shares Trade Below Fair Value Heres Why General Motors Company NYSEGM Seeking Alpha For most of General Motors shares have been range bound Some investors believe the stock is woefully undervalued others think its a valuetrap This article presents a comprehensive overview and analysis in an attempt to determine GMs fair value estimate I believe good investing revolves around major components The first is determining if a company is wellmanaged has a sound balance sheet owns a strong franchise earns its profits in cash and is shareholderfriendly For a moment lets assume we agree General Motors NYSE GM meets the requirements outlined under the aforementioned first premise Using a single valuation approach is unlikely to provide superior results Typically comparing multiple methodologies help to paint a better overall picture or at least confirm core premises For a capitalintensive business like GM I like to emphasize cash flow or free cash flow valuation metrics versus simply focusing upon straight priceandearnings analysis As goes the old saying Garbage In Garbage Out so goes any fair value analysis Therefore let me recap some of the GM raw data input assumptions by which the proceeding ratios were based Earnings nonGAAP operating earnings were used as provided by General Motors management Cash Flow obtained via actual consolidated net cash provided by operating activities from K filings Free Cash Flow derived by subtracting expenditures for property from cash flow Intentionally Purchases of Leased Vehicles was excluded I gave GM credit for cash flows generated by its General Motors Financial arm Capital expenditures were limited to direct capex consumed by the Automotive GMF and Reclassification segments Enterprise Value EV is calculated by adding market value debt minority interest and preferred equity then subtracting cash and marketable securities on hand When computing General Motors EV I used automotive debt only Including GMF debt distorts the calculation The financial group borrows a lot of money but turns around to arbitrage the cash on collateralized loans for autos We are interested in the valuation of the overall ongoing business enterprise Figures used were yearend for the specified date unless stated otherwise Shares Outstanding The valuation metrics utilize diluted shares outstanding Past years figures are actuals estimates assume the share count will remain flat to actuals FAST graphs offers a chart depicting General Motors total shares outstanding since GM management has stated the Company will repurchase billion in stock this year No share reduction was recognized in the fair value estimates A note on EBITDA While popular in many circles especially among the bankers debtleverage folks I am not a proponent of using EBITDA multiples in a stock valuation analysis None are used in this article Clearly this data illustrates GM is undervalued Over the past years the average normalized PE ratio has been x The current ttm PE is x Based upon current estimates the forward operating PE is only x Since EPS estimates indicate good growth there isnt a compelling reason to premise multiple compression SP IQ analysts forecast General Motors will earn operating earnings per share in This was harmonized by GM management estimates CEO Mary Barra presented the following from the January Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference We see the multiple has expanded modestly over the period The jump in was largely due to lower cash flow resulting from the ignition recall tragedy and associated fines A straight year average PCF ratio is x Removing the figure as an aberration lowers the multiple to x Premising General Motors will generate billion operating cash flow this year thats conservative SP IQ analysts suggest billion CF and the Company realizes no reduction in the share count GM could be expected to make cash per share Note the FCF multiple has contracted over the period Similar to operating cash flow and as may be expected free cash flow dropped markedly in The year average PCF ratio was x Dropping the marker lowers it to x Looking ahead GM management indicates free cash flow could be to billion a year through the to period Its important to recognize this is an adjusted figure Another slide from General Motors as shown at the Deutsche Bank Auto Conference slide deck offers some color Accepting the lower end billion objective but unadjusting the number one may plausibly premise FCF to be billion or a share This is equivalent to a cash flowtofree cash flow conversion rate Thats in line with recent years actual CFFCF conversion rate Placing a x multiple on offers a fair value estimate Compressing the multiple to x still suggests a stock Reviewing EVCF and EVFCF are just other ways of evaluating GM share price Instead of a per share function we check cash as a function of Enterprise Value Conceptually Enterprise Value may be thought of as a theoretical takeover price Generally an acquirer would have to buy up the equity take on the companys debt but could pocket the balance sheet cash for itself On balance EVCF valuation has revolved around an approximate x mark If we exclude from the EVFCF average pointed out earlier to be a bit of an aberration the ratio has averaged about x Looking forward if we stick with our cash flow forecast of billion and utilize the current EV billion the EVCF estimate is x clearly lower than recent multiples We find a similar story when substituting free cash flow the EVFCF forecast is x Therefore on an EVOCF and EVFCF basis GM is undervalued by and respectively One can determine the corresponding fair value estimates are about and The PS ratio can be useful I tend to use it as confirmation ratio versus standalone Proponents of this metric like to state earnings are mosteasily manipulated by slick accounting while sales revenues are harder to fudge I accept that view as reasonable We see the recent sweet spot appears to be x to x The current PS ratio is x For it is reasonable to forecast sales returning to and figures This is based upon continued overseas sales improvement and increasing domestic ATPs offset by reduced US rental fleet sales The bottom line expectation is billion net revenue This represents a uplift versus actual Following is a valuation metric comparison between General Motors and the <span

appreciation This does not include the current dividend yield If one subscribes to the view General Motors can maintain its upward financial momentum as aligned with managements expectations GM common
