discounted cash flow approach we begin with macroeconomic trends affecting Fords value Real GDP growth is slowing around the world but should rebound as emerging markets begin growing at higher rates The discounted cash flows model is the most prevalent and widelyaccepted tool for fundamentally valuing companies It is widely accepted because of the accuracy of its theoretical predictions for companies that are in the mature life cycle of the business This approach can be applied to companies in all stages of the business cycle but because it relies heavily on future predictions it is easy to incorrectly value companies that are experiencing high growth rates For this reason I believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is the perfect company to value using this approach The topdown DCF approach begins with researching and understanding macroeconomic trends throughout the world and directly applying them to the sectorindustry that your corporation belongs to This is what this first article will be about In later articles I will analyze industry trends within the automotive manufacturers industry directly applying these to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Lastly I will present an article or two on analysis of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and what I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should be worth using the discounted cash flow method of valuations Lets begin with the macroeconomic trends throughout the world Real Gross Domestic Product growth is the market value of all goods and services produced in a nation during a specified time period adjusted for inflation This metric is the most common metric used to determine a nations growth and ability to sustain growth within the capital markets Since a healthy growing economy is vital to the automotive industry seeing growth around the world in Real GDP would be a great sign for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and other automotive manufacturers The last few years have seen dismal Real GDP growth around the globe In the United States Real GDP has bounced between growth since the Financial Crisis most recently being closer to the figure In fact in Q Real GDP only grew at and yes that is an already annualized figure It is said that in the long run a corporations revenues can only increase as fast as Real GDP this does not bode well for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>For the last thirty years Chinas Real GDP has been growing at an average rate greater than per year However China reported Real GDP growth at which is why the worlds commodities markets are all near historic lows China was importing tons of commodities when it was growing greater than but with the slow in growth there is no longer a need for all of these commodities and there is a large oversupply in the market What is worse many economists believe that the growth figure for China is actually overstated and could be closer to Although China is the fastestgrowing large country in the world its growth is slowing This is not as bad for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as it is for the rest of the capital markets While Real GDP is slowing the citizens of China are as wealthy as they have ever been and tens of millions of citizens are now able to afford vehicles Chinas slowing growth should not be Fords concern Rather <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to capture a much larger market share in the growing country Even though shortterm Real GDP growth does not look good I believe that the world will exit the current slowing in growth by This will occur because emerging markets such as India parts of Africa Brazil and Russia will see growth at levels we have seen in China for the past years This will create a great macroeconomic demand for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>vehicles as people in these countries will become wealthier and travel greater distances because of infrastructure development that the period of growth has caused The other large market that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is active in is the European Union which has struggled to recover from the European Banking Crisis With Real GDP growth struggling in almost every country in Europe European Central Banks have resorted to negative interest rates in an attempt to stimulate spending Implementing lower or even negative interest rates theoretically will stimulate spending by encouraging banks to make more loans instead of keeping the money deposited in the European Central Bank While this approach has not worked so far many economists believe that it will eventually stimulate spending and allow Real GDP growth to begin When looking at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we should be considering the effects that interest rates have on the ways that consumers spend their money With interest rates at historically low levels it has never been cheaper to finance large purchases such as cars houses and other luxury items This is great news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>because there is no sign of increasing rates in the European Union and Australias Central Bank has said that it will cut interest rates if it needs to This will be a boon to the automotive industry as people can afford more car with less money The United States just saw its first interest rate hike in December and the market has been in turmoil since It is likely that the Fed will avoid raising interest rates at the March meeting Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen has even said that the Fed is willing to cut to negative interest rates if a situation occurs that requires it But I believe that people will be more likely to buy cars over the next year because of the future expectations of higher interest rates Think about it if you knew that interest rates were going to be higher one or two years from now wouldnt that cause you to consider making that car purchase now Effectively I think that the expectation for future rate hikes in the United States will bring future automobile purchases to the present time period While there should be a net zero effect in the longrun over the next two to three years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the automotive industry will benefit Real GDP Interest Rates Effect on Fords Value While global Real GDP growth points to a tough period for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>it is not as dismal as the slowing in world GDP growth may show In the shortrun Real GDP is not a great indicator for automobile sales Look at the United States the US grew at in yet automobile manufacturers sold the most cars ever So while an uptick in growth could definitely help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>longterm Real GDP growth is a more important factor to consider when valuing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>We will talk more specifically how I will use Real GDP growth forecasts to help forecast the growth of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in multiple regions of the world in a later article I think that the current state of interest rates have the largest effect on the shortterm years growth prospects for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company With interest rates at the lowest in history and not much of an expectation for rates to continue their decline consumers will expect higher rates in the future This will cause some consumers to move their future auto purchase to the present This results in more car sales in the shortterm period I think that we will see this expectation effect most in the United States because of the recent ratehike and expectations of higher rates sooner in the future In Europe I think that interest rates will continue to stay low until where the worlds growth will be healthy enough to normalize rates around the world At this point the expectations of higher future interest rates will cause a similar shift in purchases from the future to the present as it has over the last year and will continue to do so over the next year My next article will be about industryspecific items and forecasts Please leave in the comments if there are any macroeconomic or industry trends you would like me to discuss in Valuing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford
