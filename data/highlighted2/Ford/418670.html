<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Said About The Global Economy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>said about the global economy Memorial Day weekend marks the unofficial beginning of summer and summer driving season Lower fuel prices mean more of those hotselling new cars and trucks filling our roads Despite calls for the current cycle top US automakers continue to post great sales numbers Back on April th <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F reported record earnings and beat estimates with record top line growth in both volume and revenue The company also improved margins cash flow and added market share Here are the nonGAAP highlights <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported North American sales were tremendous and Europe fared better than expected Here is a look at the global numbers from Fords Q report The company cites favorable conditions for industry sales in the US moving forward supported by healthy labor conditions Europe is an ongoing recovery and China growth supported by stimulus measures could be bullish for the industry Only Brazil and Russia are expected to experience a decrease in demand Oil prices have recovered but not many on the street expect too much higher from here so lower commodity prices can remain a mixed bag as far as truck sales are concerned Low oil is great for consumers but low oil prices also signal slower economic activity which can especially hurt pickup sales in the long run However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>states that global GDP growth is expected to be in the range Should you believe the company as far as global GDP growth is concerned Tough to answer but it seems that when a large established cyclical company such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>predicts business conditions then some validity and a grain of salt seems the appropriate way to consider the statement Every business operates differently with some levels of success and failure but at the very least it should be noted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is doing well no matter the global conditions and that deserves notice The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F has been an amazing story from sales to reviews The truck is safe powerful and its sales numbers have been off the charts Just in April the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pickup vastly outsold every vehicle model in North America However if you add in the GMC Sierra then the numbers between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GMs pickups are nearly even It should also be noted that the industry posted good numbers for April overall and it seems for some specific vehicles sales momentum looks really strong The truck also has some value according to Kelly Blue Book which named the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F best value winner in the light pickup category back to back for and Consumers have spoken and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to surprise to the upside each quarter despite bearish sentiment concerning cycle tops The company has some new products on the horizon including the new Fusion four allnew SUVs a new Lincoln Continental FordPass and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Smart Mobility system to name a few The success of any of these new vehicles or initiatives depends upon market reception and performance The automotive industry is changing quickly and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has proven itself capable of changing with it It possesses the resources and leadership to improve products through technology and innovation and the company will need to rely upon these assets as the industry dramatically shifts towards maximum efficiency and safety On Wednesday June st <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM are scheduled to report monthly sales for May This preview from Selerity highlights what to expect Automakers are expected to report a million to million seasonally adjusted annual rate SAAR for May sales May sales likely down percent from a year ago are expected to be restrained by one less weekend compared with the same month in On a daily selling rate basis overall sales expanded by percent when adjusting for two fewer sales days versus May In the same report author Craig Bowles summarizes some potential headwinds automakers face moving forward Rising inventories incentives and the health of auto financing are all big concerns for the Street Car loan financing rates are at or near alltime historic lows and average new loan term durations are at or near alltime highs Serious auto loan delinquencies days or more late on payments rose to in the first quarter of this year a increase from the first quarter of SP recently warned of increasing risk from lowrated auto loans Fitch had previously warned that delinquencies in subprime car loans had reached levels not seen since October according to the MarketWatchcom As the above graph illustrates EPS growth is cruising with estimates expected to reach per share at the end of Q Some quick valuation numbers put <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at about x earnings at x at x at and a very bullish x earnings equals a share price of These numbers assume the company will meet estimates and not miss or beat by a significant amount for the second half of the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a cyclical so the low side of valuation must also be explored In the recent past the stock has traded as low as x earnings in it traded as low as per share and in as low as The scenario followed a neardeath event for most US automakers but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>emerged a winner in the long run If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>traded at x earnings today the share price would be around Historic tops in valuation can help investors understand what happens to a cyclical when it flies too high Back in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>peaked and according to SP Capital IQ traded from a low of x earnings to a high of x earnings The stock price has been on a slow decline since that market top In retrospect investors should have seen that as a selling opportunity because as much as we love the F the stock should never be trading at or near x earnings past or present Stellar EPS growth is another reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>traded so high back then as investors piled into growth at a reasonable price after a fiveyear broad market bull run which left most good growth stocks overvalued In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>traded back into a reasonable range from a high of x earnings to a low of x earnings and the stock seems to have stabilized into an investable valuation slash trading range since then The best peer comparison to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is General Motors NYSE GM Both companies have comparable valuation numbers so it just comes down to which car or truck story investors like better Right now only this much Per usual technical analysis can send mixed signals As illustrated in the chart <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sits slightly above the three relative moving averages and has traded in an upward trend since the February lows On Friday May th technical analysis service Market Edge in their Second Opinion Weekly Report downgraded <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to Avoid despite citing improving conditions This quote provides further evidence that technical analysis is indeed confusing business The technical condition of F is improving Some of the indicators have turned positive suggesting that a bottom in the stock price has likely occurred The stock is underperforming the market over the last trading days when compared to the SP The MACDLT an intermediateterm trend indicator is bullish at this time A close above is a number to watch to confirm a trend reversal Momentum as measured by the day RSI is gaining in strength Over the last trading sessions there has been more volume on down days than on up days indicating that F is still under distribution which is a bearish condition The stock is above its day moving average which is pointed down This is supportive that the trend is improving However if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trades below then the stock could experience a breakdown to new multiyear lows A number of risks present a possible downside in the stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>carries a significant amount of debt and does not possess favorable debttoequity ratios DebtEquity LT DebtEquity Technical conditions are neutral but US auto stocks have not traded well since and perhaps Craig Bowles summarizes the sentiment surrounding the sector best From the same Selerity report cited in the previous section US auto stocks are flattolower for more than years despite strong sales Zero Hedge has pointed out the reason for this is that the automotive inventorytosales ratio has been rising since late and has now risen to levels not seen since Goldman has warned demand has plateaued US composite economic indexes are fully inverted with the leading inflation index the strongest index for the first time since early Growth rates Leading Inflation Index Lagging Economic Index Coincident Economic Index Leading Economic Index Bullish sentiment points to the old adage all the bad news is already priced in Remembering that it is a market of stocks rather than a stock market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>deserves a look here for a number of reasons First the company reported a great quarter taking some market share along the way Second <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is trading at a low to fair value and a trap door seems unlikely despite sentiment And third the dividend which is in no danger yields Add the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a lowdollar cost stock and compounding coupled with dollarcost averaging in and out suggests that potentially the stock can build some wealth during this current automotive cycle A cycle top does not signal a top in profitability and sales can continue to be strong on the lovely ride down I wrote this article myself
