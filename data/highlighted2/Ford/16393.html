loves my country I was born here and lived here my entire life So why do I frequently point out Americas warts Because as the Founding Fathers and Supreme Court judges have explained we can only make America better if we honestly examine her shortcomings After all Only when Americans can honestly look at our weaknesses can we become stronger If we fail to do so history will repeat While Americans rightly condemn the Nazis as monstrous people we dont know that America played both sides both fighting and supporting the Nazis Large American banks and George W Bushs grandfather financed the Nazis The fact that Hollerith equipment manufactured by IBMs German unit Dehomag was used by the Nazi administration has long been known and is not new information IBM representative Carol Makovich wrote in an email interview This information was published in in the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing and in in Washington Jewish Week On September The New York Times reports on Page that million Jews are going to be immediately removed from Poland and they appear to be candidates for physical extermination On September the German managers of IBM Berlin send a letter to Thomas Watson with copy to staff in Geneva via phone that due to the situation they need highspeed alphabetizing equipment IBM wanted no paper trail so an oral agreement was made passed from New York to Geneva to Berlin and those alphabetizers were approved by Watson personally before the end of the month That month he also approved the opening of a new Europewide school for Hollerith technicians in Berlin And at the same time he authorized a new Germanbased subsidiary in occupied Poland with a printing plant across the street from the Warsaw Ghetto at Rymarska Street It produced some million punch cards at that location the major client of which was the railroad We have a similar example involving Romania in and The Sunday Times has actually placed the IBM documents up on their Web site When Nazi Germany went into France IBM built two new factories to supply the Nazi war machine This is the era in Vichy France which was technically neutral When Germany invaded Holland in May IBM rushed a brandnew subsidiary into occupied Holland And it even sent million punch cards in mainly from New York to support the Nazi activity there Holland had the highest rate of Jewish extermination in all of Europe percent of Jews were killed in Holland compared to percent in France where the machines did not operate successfully When Hitler came to power in his desire to destroy European Jewry was so ambitious an enterprise it required the resources of a computer But in no computer existed What did exist was the Hollerith punchcard system It was invented by a GermanAmerican in Buffalo New York for the Census Bureau This punchcard system could store all the information about individuals places products inventories schedules in the holes that were punched or not punched in columns and rows The Hollerith system reduced everything to number code Over time the IBM alphabetizers could convert this code to alphabetical information IBM made constant improvements for their Nazi clients Our entry was of course precipitated by the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December Shortly before that with sudden new tradingwiththeenemy regulations in forcethis is October Watson issued a cable to all IBMs European subsidiaries saying in effect Dont tell us what youre doing and dont ask us any questions He didnt say Dont send machines into concentration camps He didnt say Stop organizing the military forces of Nazi Germany He didnt say Dont undertake anything to harm innocent civilians He then bifurcated the management of IBM Europeone manager in Geneva named Werner Lier and the other one in New York in his office named JL Schotte So all communications went from Switzerland to New York Ultimately there was a Hollerith Department called Hollerith AbteilungGerman for departmentin almost every concentration camp Remember the original Auschwitz tattoo was an IBM number IBM put the blitz in blitzkrieg The whole war effort was organized on Hollerith machines from to This is when information technology comes to warfare At the same time IBM was supporting the entire German war machine directly from New York until the fall of IBM did more than just sell equipment Watson and IBM controlled the unique technical magic of Hollerith machines They controlled the monopoly on the cards and the technology And they were the ones that had to customdesign even the paper forms and punch cardsthey were customdesigned for each specific purpose That included everything form counting Jews to confiscating bank accounts to coordinating trains going into death camps to the extermination by labor campaign Thats why even the paper forms in the prisoner camps had Hollerith notations and numbered fields checked They were all punched in For example IBM had to agree with their Nazi counterparts that Code in the concentration camps was extermination Code was released Code was transferred Code was natural death Code was formal execution Code was suicide Code was escape Code was extermination All of the money and all the machines from all these operations was claimed by IBM as legitimate business after the war The company used its connections with the State Department and the Pentagon to recover all the machines and all the bank accounts They never said We do not want this blood money They wanted it all Standard Oil The Nazi air force the Luftwaffe needed tetraethyl lead gas in order to get their planes off the ground Standard Oil sold tetraethyl to the Nazis After WWII began the English became angry about US shipments of strategic materials to Nazi Germany So Standard changed the registration of their entire fleet to Panamanian to avoid British search or seizure These ships continued to carry oil to the Nazis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span

influence on myself and my friends because we saw in Henry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the representative of success and also the representative of a progressive social policy GM The Washington Post reports General Motors was far more important to the Nazi war machine than Switzerland said Bradford Snell who has spent two decades researching a history of the worlds largest automaker Switzerland was just a repository of looted funds GM was an integral part of the German war effort The Nazis could have invaded Poland and Russia without Switzerland They could not have done so without GM Both General Motors and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>insist that they bear little or no responsibility for the operations of their German subsidiaries which controlled percent of the German car market at the outbreak of war in and rapidly retooled themselves to become suppliers of war materiel to the German army But documents discovered in German and American archives show a much more complicated picture In certain instances American managers of both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>went along with the conversion of their German plants to military production at a time when US government documents show they were still resisting calls by the Roosevelt administration to step up military production in their plants at home When American GIs invaded Europe in June they did so in jeeps trucks and tanks manufactured by the Big Three motor companies in one of the largest crash militarization programs ever undertaken It came as an unpleasant surprise to discover that the enemy was also driving trucks manufactured by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Opel a percent GMowned subsidiary and flying Opelbuilt warplanes The relationship of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM to the Nazi regime goes back to the s and s when the American car companies competed against each other for access to the lucrative German market In GM agreed to build a new plant near Berlin to produce the aptly named Blitz truck which would later be used by the German army for its blitzkreig attacks on Poland France and the Soviet Union German <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was the secondlargest producer of trucks for the German army after GMOpel according to US Army reports The importance of the American automakers went beyond making trucks for the German army The Schneider report now available to researchers at the National Archives states that American <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>agreed to a complicated barter deal that gave the Reich increased access to large quantities of strategic raw materials notably rubber Author Snell says that Nazi armaments chief Albert Speer told him in that Hitler would never have considered invading Poland without synthetic fuel technology provided by General Motors As war approached it became increasingly difficult for US corporations like GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to operate in Germany without cooperating closely with the Nazi rearmament effort Under intense pressure from Berlin both companies took pains to make their subsidiaries appear as German as possible In April for example German <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>made a personal present to Hitler of Reichsmarks in honor of his th birthday according to a captured Nazi document Documents show that the parent companies followed a conscious strategy of continuing to do business with the Nazi regime rather than divest themselves of their German assets Less than three weeks after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia in March GM Chairman Alfred P Sloan defended this strategy as sound business practice given the fact that the companys German operations were highly profitable After the outbreak of war in September General Motors and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>became crucial to the German military according to contemporaneous German documents and postwar investigations by the US Army James Mooney the GM director in charge of overseas operations had discussions with Hitler in Berlin two weeks after the German invasion of Poland Typewritten notes by Mooney show that he was involved in the partial conversion of the principal GM automobile plant at Russelsheim to production of engines and other parts for the Junker Wunderbomber a key weapon in the German air force under a governmentbrokered contract between Opel and the Junker airplane company Mooneys notes show that he returned to Germany the following February for further discussions with Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering and a personal inspection of the Russelsheim plant Mooneys involvement in the conversion of the Russelsheim plant undermines claims by General Motors that the American branch of the company had nothing to do with the Nazi rearmament effort In a court submission American <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>acknowledges that Iwanowa and others were forced to endure a sad and terrible experience at its Cologne plant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has backed away from its initial claim that it did not profit in any way from forced labor at its Cologne plant Mel Weiss an American attorney for Iwanowa argues that American <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>received indirect profits from forced labor at its Cologne plant because of the overall increase in the value of German operations during the war He notes that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was eager to demand compensation from the US government after the war for losses due to bomb damage to its German plants and therefore should also be responsible for any benefits derived from forced labor Similar arguments apply to General Motors which was paid million by the US government for damages sustained to its German plants Kodak During World War Two Kodaks German branch also used slave laborers from concentration camps Several of their other European branches did heavy business with the Nazi government And Wilhelm Keppler one of Hitlers top economic advisers had deep ties in Kodak When Nazism began Keppler advised Kodak and several other US companies that theyd benefit by firing all of their Jewish employees Coca Cola Coke made soda for the Nazis Fanta was specifically invented for Naziera Germans Leading American financiers Rockefeller Carnegie and Harriman also funded Nazi eugenics programs The American author Lothrop Stoddard was the source of the concept of underman subhuman adopted by the Nazis in regards to Jews and communists According to the San Francisco Chronicle the idea of killing Jews communists and gypsies in gas chambers originated in the US not Germany And Nazis were also apparently inspired by Americas treatment of Native Americans Specifically retired Major in the US Army Judge Advocate General Corps Todd E Pierce who researched and reviewed the complete records of military commissions held during the Civil War and stored at the National Archives in Washington DC as part of his assignment in the Office of Chief Defense Counsel Office of Military Commissions notes Stories of the American conquest of Native Americans with its solution of placing them on reservations were particularly popular in Germany early in the Twentieth Century including with Adolf Hitler Finally the Nazis copied American propaganda techniques
