earnings were in line with our bull case on the company Long term outlook for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to look positive To refresh everyone on what our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F thesis has been since the beginning of weve stated that we think the only thing that could eventually drive shares higher would be growth on the bottom line Looking at Fords chart you can clearly see that the stock has been unable to make a move past since its recovery after the subprime crisis Unlike competitor GM Fords capital has been tied up in innovating older brands F Lincoln Continental and pushing the company across the globe This has resulted in a short term waiting period for F stockholders but a waiting period that we think will be well worth it when the bottom line begins to move upward After the companys last earnings report out early this week were encouraged that our thesis is correct and that the company is holding up its end of the bargain As part of our research we continue to track and watch auto sales and registration activity in the US and overseas So far things continue to look favorable for the US automaker We plan on continuing our commentary and were grateful for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>longs that have reached out to us and provided encouraging words for our coverage With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>its great hearing from likeminded people although as with any stock its important to lend an ear to critics as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>crushed earnings this past week on both lines but most importantly to us the bottom line We have been making the case that global profitability after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>finally curbs spending internationally will be the next catalyst for the stock price to move higher If last weeks report was any indication we may have been right on target We have said for a while that profitability globally and the effect it will have on the bottom line is going to be the next catalyst to stop Fords stock price from being an immovable object Value investing is about finding companies that have been overlooked by the market or are simply valued at much lower than what theyre potentially worth in coming years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>meets this description for us in so many ways and the missing link that would let the market in on this Fords global profitability could be coming to fruition sooner than the market thinks Literally every part of the companys business that we watch closely showed strength <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F grew pretax profit by to B in Q Operating margin was up bps to North America Revenue B operating margin bps to volume and pricing strong record profit level for the quarter South America Revenue B operating margin bps to strong demand for the Ka model Europe Revenue to B due in part to FX operating margin bps to Middle EastAfrica Revenue B operating margin bps to wholesale volume down Asia Pacific Revenue B operating margin bps to Now lets compare what weve stated on the record that were looking for a strong domestic base coupled with coming global profitability with the points <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>touched on in its last earnings report What did we see from the company We saw the company again lose money in South America and Europe but we also saw record profits in North America Like we discussed in our previous article that talked about the F incentive confusion we also saw a higher average transaction price and continued momentum across the companys full scope of vehicles We saw that the company is meeting its margin target which was support to be between and With the new line of Fs that are going to be made also outlined in a previous article we expect margin to continue to trend higher from the number posted this past quarter Even though money was lost in Europe we saw an improvement there which is all we wanted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was the leading commercial auto name in Europe for the first quarter The company continues to bet on Europe where it will be introducing new models in coming years This bet on innovation and getting a foothold overseas we believe will benefit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shareholder who have an investing horizon of far more than a couple of years China was a tough market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the first The exchange rate was a tailwind for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at the beginning of the year and the number of vehicles sold was consistent with the year prior With Chinas economy in turmoil right now combined with a slowdown across the board were still bullish on China but cautious for the second half of the year Our outlook on being a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investor has always been over the course of the long term and were encouraged by the results that the company provided last week We continue to believe that at todays valuation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains an attractive stock to if not anything else hold and collect the dividends from for the time being F Dividend Yield NYSE TTM data by YCharts While that is taking place the company is continuing to roll out its foothold globally and become an international powerhouse in the automotive market We continue to believe that as investments in these companies top out or start to slow and the operating leverage begins to take hold the narrowing losses and eventual bottom line growth from its international markets backed by strong domestic sales will be the catalyst that drives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares higher
