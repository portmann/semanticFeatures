class='textDiv'>Fords Dividend Payout An Attractive Proposition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Fords stock price has been slammed down out of all proportion to its strong operational performance last year What percentage of their free cash are they using to pay dividends This metric is critical to understanding sustainability of payouts Despite there being several areas where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still needs to rev up its engines theres no denying that it is still an attractive investment While I was researching material for my earlier article on GMs NYSE GM dividends called GM A Solid Dividend Play I realized that I should extend it to their biggest competitor as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F to see how they fared in terms of having the financial strength to keep up their dividends The challenge however is this dividend yield alone cannot be the only determining factor when buying a stock The financial strength current and future prospects of the company their cash flow position sheet strength and current dividend payout are all equally important in evaluating the sustainability of dividends into the future In general companies hate to cut their dividends as it amounts to accepting their weakness to investors They will typically pull out all stops to keep up with their dividend trajectory and only when things turn really bad do they tend to cut back on dividends For automakers that happens only during a recession or if a company makes a mess of its own Take Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY as the perfect example of the latter after the diesel emission scandal and the multibilliondollar fines that came with it the company was forced to make a dividend cut Yet even the beleaguered VW somehow managed to keep its dividend cut to eight cents for the year Volkswagen Dividends Source Gurufocus Though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was not a beneficiary of a bailout at the height of the recession it started paying dividends since a full two years earlier than General Motors Since then it has steadily increased its dividends from in October to the current During the recent quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced a special supplemental cash dividend of billion or cents per share possibly aimed at arresting the slide of its stock Unfortunately that didnt work out as planned Fords current payout ratio is which means the company is paying of its earnings as dividend so it would look like they have a lot more room to keep paying dividends at this level Unfortunately using net income to calculate payout ratio would be a horrible mistake for auto companies since depreciation rates for capitalintensive businesses such as these run in the billions The better metric to gauge the companys ability to keep paying dividends therefore is to find out how much free cash flow it uses to pay these dividends The ideal percentage of free cash flow paid as dividends would be less than which means the company has plenty of room to move things around if needed while keeping its dividend growth intact From the table above its clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been staying within a range since which means dividends arent about to be cut in a hurry Furthermore Fords cash flow from operations has steadily moved upwards since while capex after moving up since is showing some signs of reduction On that I should add that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>intends to electrify up to of its models by and this is backed by an investment of billion What that indicates is that theyre not about to cut back on capital expenditure in any significant way Again as is the case with GM as outlined in my other article the only chance for that to happen is if US auto sales drop sharply something weve already seen is merely a knee jerk reaction to what most assume is a peak in auto sales Investorspeak What is Fords Stand on Dividends As you can see from their current guidance theyre confident that their cash flow from operations will improve in What I think will happen is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will see a way to increasing dividends this year in order to assuage investor fears and instill confidence that the company isnt going down the proverbial tubes So essentially there are several factors that support the view that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will continue to pay dividends at current or higher than current levels over the next year and beyond First their payout ratio from net income is in the safe range Second percentage of free cash flow as dividend is also in the sustainable range of Third cash from operations grow stronger as capex holds steady Put these factors together and what you have is solid financial performance from a company whose stocks make it look like the company is in trouble In a recent article called Fords Looming TriMountain Challenge I outlined three areas that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to look into to stay competitive in the market Some readers misunderstood my intent and suggested that I was telling them what was wrong with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Ill clarify that here I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a great company with solid financials and I stand by my analysis and outlook of the company However having said that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does have to work harder in several areas like China and Europe while keeping its lead in the United States They also have to be prepared for an allout EV war with GM when the time comes whether thats in Europe or back at home These numbers are critical to its bottom line but theyre also vital to the future growth of the company For now Ill say that Fords dividends are safe and its a solid play if you want to get in at this price point and reap the benefits for several years to come If you found
