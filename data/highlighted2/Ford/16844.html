</span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Ultimately I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors intrinsic value is in lowtomid s GMs intrinsic value is approximately lowtomid s Both stocks are overbought into March monthly auto sales due Wednesday Thursday this week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM were two underperformers in client accounts in despite the decent economy and GDP growth and the collapse in crude oil in q which you would think would stimulate demand for the bigger SUVs and trucks in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM lineup In calendar <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was almost exactly flat on the year in terms of the capital appreciation of the stock ending at and then closing on at Investors earned the dividend in or the approximate dividend yield underperforming the SP dramatically given its return on the calendar year GM was actually a little bit worse After never owning the stock for client accounts all through the s and s I bought the first position ever in GM in May after listening to Mary Barras Congressional testimony on the ignition switch scandal I thought Barra was very clear and straightforward in her testimony and if she leads GM like that I think she could have a dramatic impact on the company over the next years in terms of a culture change at the automaker GM closed on at and then closed at on the close of trading on declining on the year excluding the dividend More GM was purchased in the low s in q and if the stock would pull back again Id buy more for client accounts Here is the what I see is the bigger picture on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM and why I still like the shares of both companies The Financial Crisis was a watershed moment for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM as it allowed both companies to offload some of their healthcare costs into the VEBA trusts In addition because financial leverage was such a root cause of what happened in the GMAC now Ally Financial and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit OTCQB FMCC are much more manageable and less risky entities since the US banking and financial system is on a more sound footing has less leverage and is taking less risk <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit is now the only auto finance division still owned by its parent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor as Ally Financial was spunoff and Chryslers finance arm was sold Seriously when you think about both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>prior to and early you could make the case that given the post retirement healthcare liability burden PRHC and the size that the financing arms of each company grew to pre Crisis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM were really healthcare and banking institutions with auto manufacturing businesses attached Fords stock price peaked in April near per share and that was just prior to the Associates spinoff I think so when you think about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the size of Associates and then the size of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit back then to classify <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as a Consumer Discretionary or an Industrial might be laughable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was a giant financial masquerading as an auto manufacturer But to bring us back to today I do think you have two cleaner auto manufacturer operations still with sizable defined benefit plans that are an ongoing drag financially but both companies are producing better products better cars actually that Americans seem more interested in buying today than in previous decades <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>currently has a freecashflow yield of while GMs is The big disparity is the debttocapital ratio Fs is GMs is Intrinsic value estimates My internal estimates for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM are for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM is per share Morningstars discounted cashflow model which takes a longer view of the business cycle and competitive position values <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at and GM at respectively Roughly speaking at current prices that puts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at a discount to intrinsic value and GM at a discount to intrinsic value If you look at the respective earnings growth rates for for both companies this year is expected to be a strong year and after the stock underperformed dramatically in I am expecting both stocks to make up the underperformance in the next months Summary conclusion I do think both auto OEMs are making better products at a better margin and moving away from the disastrous culture of the s and s Both these companies excelled at making truly crap products and I think that is in the process of changing for the better For both companies managing the defined benefit plan is still an influence on the financials but both companies can continue to boost the dividend and buy back stock with GM in my opinion having a little more room to return capital Rising interest rates and a rising stock market have a positive influence on the pension plan from a shareholder perspective Which stock would I buy first Today I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the bigger discount to intrinsic or fair value and more will be bought closer to but GM and Mary Barra have the opportunity to generationally transform GM from a monolithic bureaucracy to a st century auto company More GM would be bought closer to March auto sales are due out Wednesday or Thursday this week so well be watching the F sales to see if the new model continues to get traction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be lapping the Venezuela devaluation in q However South America could continue to be a drag for both companies in What surprised me about recent Consumer Reports surveys was how well Buick was doing in customer satisfaction surveys Personally Ive never owned an American car and my current model has miles I would seriously look at an American car the next time one needs to be bought Here are some of the earlier articles on GM and <span
