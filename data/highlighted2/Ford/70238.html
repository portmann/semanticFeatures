Apple CarPlay And Android Auto Decide Your Next Car Purchase Seeking Alpha May PM ET Includes AAPL BAMXY F FCAU GM GOOG GOOGL HMC HYMLF MMTOF MZDAY NSANY TM TSLA VLKAY VOLVY by Anton Wahlman Some automakers are implementing both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay others only CarPlay and at least one will do neither Will some consumers postpone their car purchases until their favorite car becomes available with the system they want Will some consumers switch brands based on Apple CarPlay or Android Auto compatibility How big of an impact will this have on the auto sales market during the next year or two Will it move market share Will automakers not supporting either or both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay change their minds based on losing market share The first cars with support for Android Auto and Apple NASDAQ AAPL CarPlay are arriving in US dealerships this summer and it could impact which car you buy next If you have an iPhone or Android would this help determine the car you buy or not For those of you who havent used Apple CarPlay or Googles GOOG GOOGL Android Auto yet here is how they work First plug in your phone via your regular USB cable What happens now are three things The smartphone pairs Bluetooth to the car automatically Previously the first time you paired your phone to the car you would have to searchconfirm manually and perhaps enter a code The cars infotainment screen now gets access to a few things on your smartphone such as maps telephone address book music podcasts and so forth The main point of this whole exercise is to take much of the infotainment development cycle out of the hands of the automakers and let the smartphones software drive the upgrades ie Apple and Google As your smartphone changes or gets upgraded so does your cars infotainment experience Most people are probably very happy with their iPhones or Androids maps address book music player podcast library voice recognition and so forth at least in comparison to whats in their car Wouldnt it be nice not having to learn a new but inferior car system to try to replicate all of these existing smartphone apps I think this Android Auto and Apple CarPlay proposition will be one of the biggest winners in all of automotive history It will go down alongside the automatic transmission and rear backup camera as musthaves without which no car can be sold going forward The first instance is to go to the respective web sites for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to see the automaker signups Lets start by simply listing the major automakers and their stated intent for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay This information is taken in part from the lists above but I also reached out to the PR departments of the automakers to get some more color Some automakers responded with color some with no comment and some didnt respond at all Volkswagen Group OTCQXVLKAY includes Audi Porsche and many other brands VW is all in with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and will basically launch it in all models as soon as possible starting this September <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is all in with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as part of its rollout of the Sync infotainment hardware which starts this summer The first two models to appear in US dealerships are Fiesta and Escape in the next few weeks but they will be rapidly be followed by the rest of the lineup Hyundai Group OTCHYMLF includes Kia Hyundai might be the very first in the industry with Android Auto in the Sonata happening right now Rollout of both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay will happen across the lineup in as few months as possible Nissan OTCPKNSANY includes Infiniti Nissan says it will do both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay but I have not been able to obtain any further meaningful detail about the timing and scope of the rollout plans I suspect an announcement in the next handful of months General Motors NYSE GM Chevrolet GMC Buick Opel and Cadillac This one is simple GM will have both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay on all cars starting with Chevrolet models this year as well as some Opel models Look for more announcements soon regarding the Buick and Cadillac In stages over the next two years the support will probably be in over of GMs cars FiatChrysler Automobiles NYSE FCAU includes Dodge Jeep RAM Maserati Alfa Romeo and others Similar to Nissan FCA has committed to both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay but there are no further details I suspect that FCA simply has been slower in executing on its development but that its coming at some point in the next year Honda NYSE HMC includes Acura Subaru is listed as being on board with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay However it did not provide me with any rollout details Volvo launches Apple CarPlay in its flagship SUV model XC in November and Android Auto in the same car a few months later Other models will see the rollout in steps over the next years BMW OTCPKBAMXY includes Mini and Rolls Royce Curiously BMW is listed only as supporting Apple CarPlay not Android Auto If youre an Android user may I interest you in an Audi a Volvo or perhaps a Chevrolet Corvette instead Toyota NYSE TM includes Lexus Same as Mercedes and BMW but with even less information Toyota has not even announced an Apple CarPlay vehicle for retail availability Someone at HyundaiKia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Volkswagen or GM must be planning to make a lot of hay about this On paper similar to BMW Mercedes and Toyota but JLR also seems to be implementing a different variant where the user interface doesnt look like Apples but rather feeds into JLRs own design This will be rolled out first on the allnew Jaguar XF this fall and will spread throughout the JLR portfolio over the next two years To summarize there are basically three camps in the automotive industry for now Support for both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay Some of these companies have announced nearterm rollout plans whereas we are awaiting those specifics from others Support for Apple CarPlay only I find this curious I can see automakers supporting both or perhaps even none but just one of them That seems extremely strange Whats the thinking behind this Perhaps this is only temporary I believe it is Whether BMW Mercedes Toyota or JLR perhaps they will add Android Auto support soon enough We shall see Granted with all of these cars you would still be able to connect your phone via Bluetooth analog AUX jack or perhaps wired USB for some functionality Its not as if a Mercedes BMW Toyota JLR or Tesla wont be able to work with an Android phone Some functionality will still be there as it is today already Automakers will still have to support users of Windows Phones BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY and old flip phones Furthermore automakers also need to have some sort of escape interface in the event Google and Apple turn on them and stop supporting the interfaces The automaker will still need an interface for things it does not give access to Apple and Google such as all kinds of automotive diagnostics including remote start and unlock Well we dont know for sure yet It will depend on consumer preferences The big question is this Will consumers once they become aware of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay do either of these two things Postpone their next car purchase until Android Auto or Apple CarPlay become available on their desired car This could sink nearterm sales for much of the auto industry Switch brand loyalty based on this availability or lack thereof If you have Android will you not buy another Toyota BMW Mercedes or JLR car in favor of something else such as a VWAudi KiaHyundai FordLincoln NissanInfiniti etc On this second point arguments differ wildly I hear two opposing arguments Nobody will switch car brands based on Android Auto or Apple CarPlay availability Its just not that important to people Its all about the car not the smartphone Once people find out about these technologies and availability this becomes a do or die thing in the marketplace The smartphone is simply a very important part of the car Clearly this will not be a or I already hear from people who are holding off on their next car purchase as they await their favorite car to get Apple CarPlay or Android Auto Others are going to switch brands as a result So the impact is clearly not Yet others will clearly not care Or at least at this point they think they wont care Most people dont know anything about these systems so thats no wonder when you think about it Theyve never heard of these systems and have not experienced them In the automotive world market share wars are fought to the right of the decimal point If you can switch market share by even this will have a big impact in the industry What do you think Will availability of Android Auto or Apple CarPlay cause someone you know to postpone their car purchase until its available Will someone you know switch brands as a result Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks
