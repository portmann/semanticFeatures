<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and ConocoPhillips missed so badly this morning close to of reporting companies had beat analyst expectations By Scott Connor of the Trader Education group at TD Ameritrade managing Swim Lessons trader educational programming A big like went out for results from Facebook NASDAQ FB after Wednesdays close with the stock climbing sharply on the news That contrasted with weaker than expected results this morning from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and energy giant ConocoPhillips NYSE COP That mixed earnings picture could unsettle the market Thursday even as investors continue to digest the takeaways from this weeks Fed meeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and ConocoPhillips are just two of companies reporting today making this one of the biggest days of the earnings season After the close come Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG followed by BMY rival Merck NYSE MRK before tomorrows opening bell And not to be overlooked Exxon Mobile NYSE XOM and Chevron NYSE CVX also early Friday But the focus this morning may be on Facebook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and ConocoPhillips On the plus side Facebook came in way above estimates with earnings of cents per share on revenues of billion Analysts had expected cents per share on revenues of billion according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Facebooks ad business took off during the quarter and most of it was mobile ad revenue which analysts saw as a positive sign ConocoPhillips however reported a loss of cents per share or billion Analysts expected a loss of cents a share according to Thomson Reuters The company cited a difficult pricing environment Those less than stellar results put more importance into tomorrows reports from XOM and CVX and raise attention around the energy sector Could things be worse than investors had thought And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported earnings of cents a share below expectations for cents Flat North American sales ganged up with losses in Asia to take a bite out of the companys results Also Fords executives on their earnings call brought up Brexit Britains decision to leave the European Union saying it will cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>about million this year and grow to million to million next year Bloomberg reported In the last few weeks theres been less talk about Brexit but Fords earnings put it back in the spotlight For anyone feeling bewildered by all the earnings reports coming down the pike it may be useful to take a look back at what earnings season has told us to date Before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and ConocoPhillips missed so badly this morning close to of reporting companies had beat analyst expectations a rate thats slightly higher than normal Maybe the mostly strong earnings hint that the Fed was onto something Wednesday when it once again opened the gates to the possibility of a rate hike yet this year noting that nearterm risks to the outlook have diminished The Fed kept rates unchanged which didnt surprise investors but theres more talk now that a rate hike could come before the end of the year Remember though that the election in November looms and sometimes political pressures can factor into the timing of a fall rate hike Keep an eye on Europe tomorrow Its banks get the results of their stress tests back European banks have struggled recently and if they dont pass it could put more pressure on the sector Figure Can Rally Continue The SP SPX plotted here through Wednesday on the TD Ameritrade thinkorswim platform continues to trade near record highs but a mixed earnings picture Thursday is in focus Source Standard Poors For illustrative purposes only Past performance does not guarantee future results Feds George Remains Lone Dissenter on Rates Its lonely for those urging a rate hike these days something Kansas City Fed President Esther George can probably attest to George was the only member of the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC to vote in favor of raising rates at this weeks meeting George who voted in June to keep rates unchanged had hinted publicly earlier this month that shed changed her thinking saying The economy is at or near full employment and yet shortterm interest rates remain at historic lows Keeping rates too low can also create risks But Georges hawkish view didnt resonate with other Fed members this week evidently Although the Feds statement noted that nearterm risks to the economic outlook have diminished it also said inflation remains low and business fixed investment has been soft Could more Fed members come around to Georges point of view at the next meeting in September Its possible but a lot of data and earnings lie between now and then The probability of a September hike stood at soon after the Feds decision Wednesday according to futures prices Strong Dollar Hits MultiNationals Its official Renewed strength in the US dollar is starting to be a factor in the stock market Just take a look at Coca Colas NYSE KO Q results which sent the stock tumbling Wednesday The company in its earnings press release cited foreign exchange headwinds as one of the factors contributing to a decline in reported revenues McDonalds NYSE MCD which reported earlier this week also lost a couple of pennies on its bottom line to the robust greenback Keep an eye on other big multinational companies reporting this week including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and some of the major US pharmaceutical firms to see if this trend continues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cited the strong dollar as a factor in its weak Asian performance in the Q The dollar rose this week to its highest levels vs the euro in a month and the yen retreated against the dollar on Wednesday after reports that the Japanese government would inject new stimulus into the economy A stronger dollar makes it harder for US companies to sell their products overseas On the plus side it can help make imports cheaper for US consumers and its likely one of the reasons for oils sharp recent plunge another factor that could potentially help consumers Opportunity Jobs Lacking Study Finds If theres one thing politicians from both major US parties often agree on its that the economy needs to create more jobs But quality of jobs is a factor the politicians dont delve into as much and right now such jobs are lacking according to a study by job search firm Indeed Quality jobs defined as those with high pay an average salary of higher than and salary growth of or more after inflation over the last years make up less than of the US labor market With such a low percentage of jobs providing a householdsupporting wage with growing purchasing power over time it is hard to dispute that we are living in a highly polarized best versus the rest economy the study notes Inclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy sell or hold
