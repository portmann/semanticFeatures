You Are Wasting Money Investing In Stocks There is a right way and a wrong way to begin investing in stocks But some times new investors have to learn the hard way A coworker recently talked to me about investing in stocks for the first time He was proud of himself for finally taking the plunge into the market to buy a few shares And then I asked him what he had bought He said that he had bought a couple of shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company Stock Symbol F He also bought a few shares of some other wellknown blue chip stocks like General Electric Dow Chemical Walt Disney CocaCola and others These are some great companies and a few that I own myself But the problem comes with how many shares he bought and the price he paid not the companies themselves Investing In Stocks A Few Shares or Many My friend told me that he bought five shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSEF for example This was one of several companies that he bought less than ten shares of when he invested a few thousand dollars I quickly told him that spreading out and buying a just a few shares in a lot of companies may not have been the best use of his limited resources Should you buy a few shares in a lot of companies Or should you buy a lot of shares in just one or two companies Heres an example of why just purchasing a few shares in even a good company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may not be the best idea If you purchased five shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at its current price of per share youd have spent But how much did it cost you to buy those shares Many online discount brokers charge about per trade Thats every time that you buy shares AND sell them for a total of Thats quite a hurdle that you have to overcome if you want to make a profit on your stock trades For my coworkers five shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>he would need the share price to appreciate to or in order to just break even after you factor in the transaction costs Thats quite a hurdle You might have to hold onto your shares for quite a long time to get your money back without taking a loss Are you beginning to see how trading in small blocks of shares may not be the best idea for beginning individual investors But if my friend had bought shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>instead of buying a lot of small positions in multiple companies it would have cost him total And he would have only needed the share price to appreciate to or a little less than in order to recoup his in trading costs That is a lot easier to do Individual stocks shouldnt be your first thought when it comes to investing This is especially true if youre new to investing You may want to consider the benefits of investing in a mutual fund An index fund gives you many advantages With an index fund that mirrors one of the large stock market index like the SP Dow Jones Industrial Average and others you benefit from diversification that is already built in With index funds you can invest just a little bit of money and own shares of the entire index and the huge number of companies that comprise it Another benefit of investing in mutual funds and index funds is that you get the benefit of professional investors who pick and choose which companies to invest in Most of us have day jobs and we dont have enough time in our lives to track stocks like a professional does The transaction costs for mutual funds and especially index funds are incredibly low You can use dollar costs averaging and purchase fractional shares with as little as per month in many cases Is investing in stocks for everyone Of course its not But it can be fun and adventurous too if thats what you are looking for But theres a smart way to invest in individual stocks for the first time Do you invest in shares of individual stocks Or do you just stick to mutual funds How much of a factor do commissions and your trading costs factor into your investment decisions Hank Coleman is the founder of Money QA an Iraq combat veteran a Dr
