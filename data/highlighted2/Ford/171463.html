Technology Growth Negatively Affect Future Earnings Seeking Alpha Advancement in technology on whole has always in the past served to improve living standards Recently advanced information technology and robotics have started to replace traditional service jobs It is possible that future IT robotics and computing power advances will obviate the need for most human labor Machines dont need an income and have no need to buy things There are two quotes attributed to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>family that serve as a preface for this article The first quote is attributed to Henry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>himself In Henry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>doubled the wages of the assembly line workers in his new state of the art automobile assembly plant to day This was about double the prevailing wage for similar jobs at the time When asked why he did this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>supposedly responded The workers we employ to assemble these automobiles should be able to afford to buy one While the exact language of the quote and even whether it was the rationale for the wage raise has been debated but the point of the quote is pertinent to this article The second quote is attributed to both Henry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>II and the then head of the United Auto Workers UAW union Walter Reuther as they were both touring a new robotic assembly line <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>asked Walter how are you going to get those robots to pay your union dues to which Reuther responded Henry how are you going to get them to buy your cars I also need to preface this article by coming out of the closet to borrow an overused phrase I generally hold very conservative views with respect to politics economics labor and most things financial I would not have tumbled to the subject of this article were it not for a book I recently read as many of these issues fit squarely in a liberal progressive playbook The book is titled Rise of the Robots by Martin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The book is a good read and covers a number of possible impacts of continued advances in IT and robotics including the possible negative impacts on continued economic growth In the balance of this article Ill summarize the main points from the book that long term investors may want to consider in selecting companies for long term growth Wages for typical hourly workers in production and nonsupervisory roles peaked at per week in after adjusting for inflation A full years later that same worker group earns an inflation adjusted per week a decline of about This is in stark contrast to the year period prior to where median household income roughly doubled from per year to per year The chart below makes the point in terms of growth in compensation versus productivity growth Source Lawrence Mishel Economic Policy Institute Readers will note that the chart above is more recent than the chart in the book which ends in Despite productivity growth continuing on a fairly constant trend from to hourly compensation has not kept up with productivity growth after about Had wages kept up with productivity the average annual income for a typical production worker would be about yr versus the current yr While this outcome is good for corporations and investors in those corporations it doesnt do much to maintain the purchasing power of those typical production workers Fewer Jobs Created Longer Recoveries and More Long Term Unemployment Over the last years the US economy has created fewer and fewer jobs It is important to understand the definition of jobs created means additional job numbers over last year or last decade The decade of the s created more jobs than existed in the decade of the s The s created more jobs than existed in the s The following chart shows this trend through Job Creation Since click to enlarge This graph might seem surprising given that the US Labor Department reports for the last couple years indicate that the US creates roughly new jobs per month While that statistic is true in order to have a positive bar on the chart we would have to first recover all the jobs that were lost in the recession The chart above only goes out through If the chart included data through st half of we would see a small bar in the decade But the point made by the author is still valid job creation has slowed dramatically in the last years In addition to fewer jobs being created the length of time necessary to recover the jobs lost during recessions has increased significantly The chart below shows the number of months required to recover the losses in subsequent recessions It is taking longer with every recession to replace lost jobs This results in longer periods of unemployment for those who lost jobs makes it more difficult for people entering the job market to find jobs and pushes more people into the ranks of the long term unemployed All of this results in slower economic recovery from recessions and anemic GDP growth during the recovery period In the book Martin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>devotes a lot of pages to the issue of income inequality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>comes down on the side that income inequality is a significant problem now and likely to be in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>attributes the fewer jobs created following recent recessions and the longer periods required to recover lost jobs after recessions in part to automation and advances in IT Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>makes the case that automation and advances in IT have in part contributed to income inequality in the US and other advanced economies The future argument <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>offers is that if income inequality continues to grow the US could end up with a very skewed wealth and income distribution with most income being earned and wealth owned by the top of the population Fords thesis is that continued growth in IT robotics and automation is one of the potential drivers for worsening income inequality Examples that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>provides in the book include the automation of many types of manufacturing including heavy machinery and automobiles mail sorting packaging and shipping harvesting of crops and lumber and even flipping burgers Today most burgers are flipped by people Based on Fords thesis the future of fast food preparation will require very little human input with preparation packaging and sales all performed by machines and computers Fords conclusion is that at some point as automation progresses there will not be sufficient numbers of jobs manufacturing industrial or service for those that want or need one When that happens there will be negative impacts on employment GDP and corporate earnings for many companies Technology Growth Impacts to Earnings It has always been the case that growth in technology IT and automation has in the long run been beneficial Income and living standards have increased steadily since World war II at least up to the recession or if you buy Fords analysis However Fords argument is that because a large percentage of US GDP and corporate earnings are dependent on personal consumption we must have a healthy middle class with growing earnings to support our economy If we get to the point where the vast majority of wealth and income is owned by a very small percentage of the population aggregate corporate earnings will drop and GDP will drop Wealthy people dont spend as much of their income or wealth in percentage terms as do the middle class One could make the argument that because we live in a global economy there will always be a growing middle class somewhere to buy the products and services produced in the US China probably comes easily to mind Today the single largest buyer of automation equipment and manufacturing robotics is China Automation and robotics allow companies to produce better quality products faster and cheaper Machines only require maintenance and repairs they dont take vacations they dont need medicaldental insurance they dont need a retirement plan they dont go on disability and they wont take legal action against the company for being abused or harassed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>makes the case in his book that automation and advances in IT and robotics is a global phenomena not limited to the US or the G nations Everyone is competing on a global basis In the Introduction to this article I said that I would not have thought about the potential negative economic consequences of widespread automation and robotics were it not for reading Rise of the Robots by Martin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>After reading the book thinking about the potential impacts and talking to a few colleagues I think it is worthwhile for every long term investor to consider To be successful as investors I believe one has to have a good understanding of the pros and cons of any major trend that could impact the investments you hold In the future if Fords thesis has any validity consumer discretionary spending could soften and fall Id definitely want to be in front of that type of economic change rather than behind that curve Disclosure Iwe
