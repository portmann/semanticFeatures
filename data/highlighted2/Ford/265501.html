<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will take the share of electric vehicles in its portfolio from the current to by by introducing new models An increase in the EV portfolio will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to command higher revenue and margins as EVs have a higher selling price than regular counterparts Fords billion investment in EVs will allow it to regularly upgrade battery technology and it has already made good progress on this front <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has increased the range of the Focus Electric by while it can be charged to in just minutes an improvement of over the previous version <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however needs to constantly upgrade battery technology as it is still behind the likes of Tesla and Nissan in terms of battery life and range <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has had a rather forgettable year in as a slowdown in the Chinese auto industry has affected the companys growth this year but from a longterm perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is pulling the right strings in a bid to improve its performance This week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced its plans to add new electric vehicles to its portfolio by the end of the decade As a part of this initiative <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will invest an additional billion as compared to the earlier planned amount for the development of electrified vehicle solutions by At present <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has of its vehicle offerings electrified on a global scale and intends to take this share to by Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has lined up an aggressive target for itself in the EV space which is why its latest push into this segment represents its largestever investment in EVs in a fiveyear period In my opinion this concerted push from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>into EVs is a smart move if we consider the prospects of this segment The EV markets prospects are strong With the worsening climate and awareness regarding the effects of using fossil fuels on the environment the world is finally shifting towards zero emission technologies Advancements in the field of clean energy solutions over the past decade are also strong drivers of this change In the case of automobiles too EV technology is being increasingly accepted especially in the developed countries of North America and Europe where the supporting infrastructure is in the advanced stage But despite all the awareness other regions of the word are not yet ready for EVs as a norm And these regions include the most populous countries of AsiaPacific SouthEast Asia South America and Africa Other than these markets only China has the potential to develop as a big market for EVs Chinas potential for EVs is because of its environmental problems and its governments willingness to eradicate them Otherwise the oil and gas driven vehicle numbers have not yet reached to intolerable level in any other country that they feel the urge to incentivize or promote EVs Thus it is North America China and Europe where the EV market has a considerable size and only these markets have something for EVs in at least the next one decade Looking ahead this trend will continue as China has pledged to improve its EV infrastructure drastically in the coming years For instance in September this year China announced that it will build charging stations for EVs along with million charging points in a bid to encourage EV sales in the country The chart given above clearly indicates that the Chinese governments efforts are bearing fruit as EV sales in China have more than tripled in the first months of the year In comparison China had just charging points last year so the country has set an aggressive target to build up its infrastructure Thus the market for EVs is expected to grow at an impressive pace going forward with Navigant Research forecasting that the global light duty EV market will expand from million units last year to million units in under a base case scenario So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has done the right thing by going aggressive in the EV market Lets take a look at the steps that the automaker will adopt to push up its sales in this segment The following graphic gives a snapshot of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>intends to do in a bid to tap the growing EV market As seen above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has lined up a multipronged approach to tap the growth in the global EV market More importantly the company seems to have got the basics right as it is focused on developing cuttingedge technology to tap this segment For instance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expanding its global battery research and development footprint for electrified vehicles this year adding research and engineering capabilities in Europe and Asia to take advantage of new market opportunities In both the regions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking to create a hub and spoke model that will allow the company on a global level to increase the pace of the growth of its battery technology which will allow it to capitalize on opportunities on both a local and a global scale As a part of this plan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has announced that it is building a new battery lab at the University of Michigan with an investment of million and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation as the third partner in the tripartite partnership This lab will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>advance its battery technology by allowing it to make lighter smaller and more costeffective batteries It will also enhance the pace of implementation of the latest battery technologies in future production vehicles by replicating the results of research technologies and battery development thats done at a smaller scale Now constantly upgrading the battery technology is a key part of Fords EV plans as the adoption of its vehicles will depend upon the range that they provide As such the company is doing the right thing by investing in this area More importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be releasing an example of its battery expertise quite soon with the upgraded <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus Electric The Focus Electric will go into production in the second half of next year and is expected to go on sale in the UK later It will be more capable as compared to the existing version as its range on full charge will be miles as compared to miles in case of the current version Further the vehicle will be able to reach charge in just minutes This will be a big leap forward from the current USmarket Focus Electric that can manage the same charge in around hours Apart from these capabilities the new Focus Electric will have a EcoGuide LCD Instrument Cluster with SmartGauge This will allow the driver to witness realtime EV power usage in a bid to increase vehicle efficiency Another smart feature known as the Brake Coach will help the driver learn the utility of the Regenerative Braking System and enhance its efficiency Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is leaving no stone unturned in delivering a complete package into the market and going with the highlypopular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus is a smart move Fords EVs will have to compete with the most advanced EVs in the world from Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and Nissan LEAF in the US and Europe But on comparison we dont find the new Focus to be coming anywhere close to Teslas existing Models Teslas minute charge gives miles of travel while the same charge in the new Focus gives only miles Though the Focus is a highlyimproved model it has reached only a level where it could stand as one of the good choices but still not among the best In China the low cost local manufacturers like BYD BAIC Chery and Changan are the market leaders which is why even Tesla is struggling to make a dent in this market Therefore while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is readying a fleet of EVs it needs to upgrade its battery technology in order to compete with the best <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does not single out how much revenue it gets from EVs but as mentioned at the beginning of the article of its vehicles are electrified Now looking ahead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>intends to take this share to which will allow it to increase its revenue and margins substantially since EVs are priced higher than their regular counterparts For instance the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus Electric has a starting MSRP of which is substantially higher than the starting MSRP of for the regular Focus Thus as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>increases the share of EVs in its overall vehicle lineup it will see an increase in its revenue due to a higher average selling price Given the prospects of the EV market it is not surprising to see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has decided to make an aggressive push into this segment with its latest investment Of course the company is facing competitive challenges from specialized and established players in the EV segment but it has made good progress in its battery technology which will continue improving due to its investments As such Fords latest push into EVs opens up a strong opportunity that will lead to positive growth in its financials in the long run as the EV market matures We only use your contact
