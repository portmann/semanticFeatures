share price any boosts Their robust growth in net income was overshadowed by profits missing estimates I want to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F so badly I would be so psyched to see some signs from the firm that their stock is going to shift a gear Unfortunately its just not happening Awhile back I wrote about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>becoming more of a dividend play than a strong contender for stock price appreciation Understandably I was met with quite a plethora of comments stating my position was wrong and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shareholders would be reaping the benefits of their new aluminum based pickup in the latter part of Well folks were a few days from November and Fords stock price is almost exactly where it was back in June when I first wrote about it When you consider the five year performance of the stock Im not incredibly surprised <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has had a very tough time finding momentum in its stock prices and their latest quarterly results have not added anything to fuel a takeoff The company had a great jump in net income of but missed on profit estimates The fact that this miss has the stock down today tells me that investors arent easily satisfied when it comes to this stock They want to see something big for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>They want something that truly separates the firm from the other automakers before theyll run this stock up Sure you have your stalwarts and loyalists who have kept <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in their portfolio for years and have zero intentions of changing that Truthfully its a good idea considering the great dividend yield that you can get right now Outside of that I still hold strong that there is little upside to this stock Achilles Research has a good article pointing out the lack of enthusiasm the market gave to the good parts of Fords Q moves The carmaker made great strides in terms of improving its operating margins and the stock price was unaffected Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a bad company Not at all I want to buy this stock Id love to own an American carmaker with growth potential but there appears to be a psychology at work where the market is demanding something truly spectacular before the share price has any chance of climbing into the s Over the past years the company has battled hard to improve its lineup and its profits have been great Q and Q earnings per share have been well above last years earnings Alas We havent seen much activity above I understand the tentative nature of the situation Car sales are a fickle business Demand goes up and down and all around If the economy takes a hit people are not going to just go by a new car With a volatile business cycle comes a constant need to have nest eggs in place to protect the company I think everyone reading this saw the utter devastation inflicted on the Big back in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was not very far from joining GM NYSE GM and Chrysler in filing chapter Those kinds of situations are not easily forgotten The steel industry is taking real hits right now in demand and thats usually a sign that manufacturers like the auto industry are slowing down Though its worth noting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>isnt buying as much steel these days as their trucks move to the aluminum body With global economies looking at bit shakier than the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could easily end giving some back next year Im staying away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for now I cant find any clear catalysts that are going to drive this stock price Im still a little nervous about their Aluminum pickup Do I think its going to go down No I do not I think its going to stay right where it is Theyre paying out a lot in dividends which I personally would like to see diminished I think it would aid in getting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>closer to the range Im sure many would disagree with me and thats fine but I want to see price growth and right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>isnt
