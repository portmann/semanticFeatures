US will continue to go down becasue the US CONSUMER refuses to only buy made in the USA The US consumer will buy what he sees as the best value which normally means cheapest but will function as they want US companies either lower wages to compete move jobs overseas to compete or go out of business If the US consumer does only buy made in the US his standard of living will go down becasue he will have to pay more for products having less money to spend on other items A BIG part of the problem is also government regulation Government strangles businesses with unnecessary taxes and regulations in order to keep crony capitalism functioning If the government regulation burden was less companies would be more likely to stay in the US becasue costs would be lower they could compete Mon bmr Hard

who was in charge when the company went public in Also the family members controlled a special class of the stock that always gave them of the voting power a permanent controlling interest in the

paid out of the wage fund this was the amount of money paid to the worker based on the value of their work budgeted into the cost of productionfigured on the credit side of the ledger Remember the dollar was backed by gold Now wages are paid out of the payroll line of credit which is a debt of the company to be repayed This debt has to compete with all of the other forms of debt incurred by a company including Interest Taxes Depriciation Ammortization or EBITDA The companies earning are veiwed on the credit side of the ledger while wages are now a debt disconnected for old man Fords th century wage model Herein lays your wage compression Wages go down in relation to corporate earnings because wages have to compete with the other forms of debt a corporation incurrs Anybody that cannot attach their wage directly to corporate earnings like a bonus paid ahead of EBITDA does not make a first world wage I know my explaination is simplistic and somewhat innacurate but you need to understand this Im a dumb fucking heavy equipment operator working at a gold mine in Arctic Canada So this is hope Im not and economist nor accountant nor Wall Street financier however I DID take a run a federal office in a forgotten part of this countryto no avail I was ignored BUT If a dumb cunt like me can figure this much of the economic problem out for himselfjust maybe there is a chance in

Apolitical Blues Not at all The need to trim costs never ceases FORD is actually to be commended for keeping the jobs in the country Entry level apprenticeship wages are as a labor guy myself

future for pleasure today as in my world ends when I end so Im taking all I can get fuck off Mon Kickaha Your post highlights a structural problem with labor laws in the USA Unions are run by highseniority members Union contracts first and foremost take care of the highseniority workers If a contract contains large wage increases that cause the company to turn increasingly to automation it is the lowseniority workers who suffer the layoffs The Union need not concern itself with those shorttimers who lack much in the way of internal union political clout Nowadays all unions give lip service and nothing more to the concept of solidarity If it takes new and much lower wage levels for new hires to fund wage increases for the highseniority members then piss on the new workers While a lot of the highseniority guys have been promoted into positions requiring a lot of skill and experience many of them are still laborers and they will be working sidebyside with new hires or temps making a third of what the old guys are making Union politics dictate that wages must go up up up for the high seniority members This only works intermediateterm if the company can replace workers with machines and increase productivity enough to fund the higher wages Note that the amount of capital investment to which the company commits itself in the labor contract has become a major issue to be addressed in the collective bargaining agreement Longterm I dont know where this ends Maybe ten guys making yr with full fringes running a fully automated plant I just cant figure out who is going to be buying the robotassembled cars absent a complete reengineering of how our society handles redistribution of income Just as a system designed to manage an agrarian economy needed to be overhauled to manage a manufacturing econony we need another overhaul to manage an economy where robots are doing more and more of the the good jobs that previously existed in manufacturing Even professional segments of the economy like doctors lawyers engineers and accountants are already suffering losses of revenue due to the ready availability of previously guildprivate information on the internet and there already is much talk about utilizing AI programs for routine matters in those professions in the near future The animosity directed to outsourcing of jobs is rational only in the context of seeking to sway public opinion in favor of protectionist legislation to preserve high wages at home on a purely temporary basis Meanwhile overseas even the low cost workers are being replaced by machines Wake up You are living in the Age of Robots The only issue of import is how society will divvy up their production The enrichment of the has happened not only due to the financialization of things and asset bubbles but also because the own most of the capital in an era where the importance of labor diminishes daybyday Mon SillySalesmanQu Mon graneros Mon Skateboarder Instead of wheels

bestselling brands there are F Escape Fusion and a repossession rate lowest in their history and NO GOV BAILOUT Mon TradingTroll NO Welcome to the world of crony capitalism where the workers the people who actually built these damn businesses dont get a cut of the deal when automation or off shoring is brought inI remember high school in the s We were supposed to have shorter work weeks due to computers Instead the politicians sold out the people who elected them This is not capitalism Mon Vlad the Inhaler This is capitalism at its finest Automation outsourcing hiring illegals thats what the companies want Why dont people understand that companies exist to make profit not to provide jobs or build a strong economy Everyone wants to blame the government but as far as the corportions go everything is going according to plan Record profits and executive compensation what more could a company want Unfettered capitalism gives us monopolies and workers who get paid just enough to spend their salary on essentials at the company store The US standard of living will have to drop to adjust to the global standard sorry Auto workers need to feel the pain of a contracting economy just like everyone else does LESS PAY and BENEFITS MUST happen before the idiots wake up and vote for liberty and freedom instead of all this UAWsponsored soft socialism Mon saveUSsavers Mon Dan The Man Mon herkomilchen Maybe that years of stagnant wages and cut benefits is a clue that you are in a line of work declining in value According to the consumers who pay for your services by deciding how many cars they will buy at what prices Rather than indignantly demand others share the pain of your choice to remain in a job declining in value maybe you should choose to change jobs You may not like it but robots can increasingly produce what you produce more efficiently Just as cars produced transportation more efficiently than horses and stablekeepers seeing their wages stagnate for years should have understood why and begun looking for new lines of work rather than demanding others share their pain Youve already enjoyed the benefits of one taxpayer bailout that artificially subsidized your job keeping it from disappearing entirely And you continue to enjoy having a job only because auto loans are being artificially subsidized via money supply inflation paid for by all of us How many more signals do you need that what you do is no longer sufficiently productive in its own right to fund the salary and benefits you want Mon Kickaha Outside of the government sector outside of the financial sector millions of people have suffered maybe a pay cut on average and maybe more if you factor in all those people who cant find jobs Thank your Union for the degree that collective bargaining laws have insulated you from the general overall economic carnage out of work on food stamps Foreclosures and bankruptcies running at historical highs Lots of people used to have good jobs like yours Lots of them got laid off and if there are part of the lucky few they replaced their full fringes job with a no fringes one Your pain so far has been insignificant when measured against the pain suffered by tens of millions of people in the USA Mon silverer Some are waiting for an opening in your plant to make more than they make in their present jobs Many havent had raises either Mon
