Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event on the day several states held presidential primaries including California at the Trump National Golf Club Westchester in Briarcliff Manor New York US June As the White House race took off last summer food giant Mondelez International found itself in an unusual position Republican candidate Donald Trump began delivering broadsides against one of its iconic products Oreo cookies Nabisco is closing a factory in Chicago and theyre moving to Mexico No more Oreos I dont like Oreos anymore Trump told a crowd in New Hampshire on Aug reacting to reports that Mondelez was shutting down some production lines at its Nabisco subsidiary in Chicago while boosting output in Mexico Trumps statement that Mondelez was closing a Chicago factory was erroneous as the company quickly pointed out but that didnt stop him from repeating it Its unusual for a top presidential candidate especially a representative of the businessfriendly Republican Party to attack major US corporations by name But over the course of his unconventional campaign Trump has aimed his fire at a range of companies mostly for shifting jobs abroad <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Co United Technologies Corp unit Carrier Corp but also for building products in foreign markets Apple and for what he said were violations of antitrust laws Amazon Trump has threatened the companies with boycotts tariffs taxes and other punishments The Trump campaign declined to comment for this story Some of the companies saw their share prices dip in the wake of Trumps criticism while others experienced a small boost But all of them were presented with a dilemma thats familiar to the presumptive nominees many vanquished Republican rivals Should they engage with a possible future president known for holding a grudge possibly inviting more wrath or should they lie low and risk allowing Trump to define them and to push policies they deem harmful Most have sought to stay out of the fray even as Trump has kept up the drumbeat of criticism I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States Many companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>General Motors Nabisco Carrier are moving production to Mexico Trump said this week This was bad for all Americans he said It was the first time Trump included GM in his roster of corporate wrongdoers though the Trump campaign later removed GM from the statement and declined to say why GM declined comment Mondelez previously known as Kraft Foods took a different tack After Trump vowed to boycott Oreos Mondelez fielded numerous media inquiries and contacted reporters when the company deemed press coverage of his remarks off base said Laurie Guzzinati who oversees governmental affairs in North America for Mondelez The company didnt engage in any Trumpbashing though Guzzinati said Trumps comments were grounded in inaccuracies She said she told reporters that Mondelez would continue to make Oreos in three locations in the United States countering the impression Trump may have left that Oreos would no longer be made in the United States Mondelezs response tracks closely what crisis management experts recommend for Trumptargeted companies Hilary Rosen a managing director for Washington DC communications firm SKD Knickerbocker said her firm was representing corporate clients who have been singled out by Trump though she declined to name them Rosens advice to clients she said is dont depend on educating Donald Trump on the truth People have tried and failed Rosen a Democrat recommends instead that companies make their case to the journalists who cover Trump so Donald Trump does not define you None of the companies targeted by Trump acknowledged hiring outside consultants to deal with his criticism Many declined to comment for this story Youre not going to win in a oneonone confrontation with Donald Trump Youre just going to get mired in the mud said Juda Engelmayer senior vice president for crisis management at W Public Relations in New York Those who have been willing to engage including <span

style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the greatgrandson of the automakers founder Henry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>called Trumps critique distorted and said the company instead should be held up as a real success story We didnt take the government bailout during the recession <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>told reporters at a conference in Detroit on May contrasting his company with GM and Chrysler We paid back our debts We pulled ourselves up by our boot straps We are investing in America Crisis management experts said companies targeted by Trump need to be thinking more about the policy implications of his presidency That means for example shoring up support in the US Congress for the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA which Trump has said he wants to renegotiate A trade lobbyist who asked not to be named because he has worked with one of the companies Trump has called out said Trumps attacks do not particularly hurt companies reputations in Washington because policymakers understand presidential campaigns are the political silly season But he said they can impact broader efforts on trade and other policies I think what this suggests he said is that there needs to be a concentrated effort by the business community to talk about the benefits of trade Additional reporting by David Shepardson
