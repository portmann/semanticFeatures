Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hosted a media event in its new Silicon Valley RD office located walking distance from Teslas headquarters The presentations included one on powertrain technology but mysteriously did not mention anything about electric cars of any kind The experience of hearing a powertrain discussion almost next door to Tesla without a detailed debate about electric was surreal Does this mean that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>despite outselling Tesla by in the US in has given up on plugin cars going forward I assume <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>simply isnt ready to talk about its nextgen plugin cars and that they will compete with Teslas Model when they get announced no later than I think it was around January when I first noticed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F had opened a small RD office in Silicon Valley From what I observed the office contained only two people although it may have grown a little in and Fast forward three years and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced in January that it has effectively reopened the office a few miles away now walking distance from Teslas NASDAQ TSLA headquarters and headed by a person hired from Apple NASDAQ AAPL Earlier this week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hosted an event for the media at this new venue which now has employees going to by yearend The presentations were led by an impressive cast of Fords top executives starting with CEO Mark Fields The RD teams presented on three areas Lightweighting Just like all the other automakers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is seeking to take out significant amounts of weight from its vehicles This isnt fundamentally any different than presentations I have seen from companies such as BMW GM and all the rest As always lightweighting is a multidimensional set of tradeoffs including cost and repairability Cabin technology From infotainment systems to safety the cockpit is becoming filled with more technology All car companies are researching the right balance between information and distraction and what technologies will be most effective Thats right Theres a pink elephant right in the middle of the room Think about it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hosted a presentation about powertrain technology located walking distance from Teslas headquarters Unless I missed something there was not one word about electric Not pure batteryelectric not plugin hybrid Not even plain vanilla hybrid Nothing The presentation was strictly about gasoline engines From liter cylinder gasoline engines to liter V gasoline engines used in F trucks and horsepower supercars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GT One can have a lot of fun speculating around this omission There are two basic possibilities Obviously this isnt true seeing as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been offering one pure electric car and two plugin hybrids for over two years already In the US in those three cars sold approximately units more than Teslas But despite outselling Tesla by on a unit basis perhaps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has realized that these electrified cars are simply red ink boat anchors detracting from the far more profitable gasolineonly cars Why should someone who buys a Fiesta Taurus Mustang or F have to fund taxpayer subsidycollecting leeches living in Californias richest three coastal ZIP codes So perhaps because of a theory along these lines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has simply gotten tired of wasting money on an idea whose time has not come and isnt about to arrive anytime soon Gasoline is at per gallon today and the incentive to complicate your life by going electric is effectively nil unless youre part of a technological or environmentalist cult For whatever reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>isnt ready to yet unveil its Teslakiller It might do so later in or in and be in mass production by or Thats certainly one theory and based on this recent interview with Fords electric car infrastructure boss one might conclude that this new car will have LG batteries and be paired by a massive investment in infrastructure can you spell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Gigachargers with kW chargers installed around the country and beyond This latter theory would have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>coming to market with a new range of plugin cars BEVs as well as PHEVs and they would be much better than the current three <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>offerings One of them would be a direct competitor to Teslas upcoming Model which may be in mass production at some point in the range depending on whose theory you prefer I clearly subscribe to the second interpretation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is working on a new family of plugin cars PHEVs and BEVs but it just doesnt want to talk about them yet But thats not the point right now right here The point was the surreal experience of listening to a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>powertrain presentation held within walking distance from Teslas headquarters and not hearing one faintest peep about anything electric It was one of the oddest avoiding the big pink elephant in the middle of the room
