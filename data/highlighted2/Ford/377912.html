positioned to succeed in New models will continue to increase profits and drive buyers to dealerships Lincolns progress should continue with the unveiling of the Continental In several articles of late automotive journalists have penned something to the effect of was a great year to be an auto enthusiast Newly revised models with historic bloodlines like Mustang Camaro and Challenger made the rounds on the international auto show circuit Throughout much of last year however I wondered whether this year will be a good year to be an auto investor The Big Three US automakers <span

Recession GM entered bankruptcy protection emerging with an IPO in Chrysler became owned by a combination of the UAW pension fund the US and Canadian governments and ultimately Italian automaker Fiat Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>avoided government ownership though it did receive a loan through the governments Troubled Asset Relief Program TARP In this article I will address some of the challenges faced by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company while highlighting its various strengths However to avoid beating a dead horse Ill refrain from discussing Fords PE ratio which remains a contentious issue Whether you agree with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>longs or not the stocks dividend and apparent upside potential make it a compelling investment Under the stewardship of Alan Mulally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>weathered the Great Recession emerging wellpositioned to succeed in the long term The company reorganized with a governmentbacked line of credit secured through the TARP program and worked to streamline its operations by selling off several of its various brands Today the company is much stronger than it was prior to the recession In the wake of the financial crisis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>worked to improve its smallcar offerings which faced and continue to face strong competition from foreign competitors Focus and Fusion models popular abroad have gained a following in the United States Halo models like the Fiesta ST Focus ST and Focus RS have achieved critical acclaim Fords reworked Mustang according to Bloomberg is now the muscle car to beat The car is Fords first global Mustang it is now being sold in countries introducing the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>brand to buyers the world over The biggest news from Dearborn as of late has been the success of the F widely seen as Fords most important model Most estimates suggest that the F and its derivatives provide the bulk of Fords profits both at home and abroad The automaker has published encouraging sales numbers for the new truck whose aluminumintensive body is a segment first Average transaction prices are on the rise as is an increase in profit generated by each vehicle according to various reports Rumor has it that GM is looking to develop an aluminumbodied Silverado and Sierra to compete Fords Expedition and Navigator models are likely to receive the same aluminum treatment in their next generation goosing gas mileage and ATPs Brand loyalty remains strong in the pickup segment though generous incentives from GM and Ram could cause some <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>fans to jump ship As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>worked to bring a second plant online the trucks availability remained spotty However Fords Kansas City Assembly Plant came online nearly a year ago and the trucks updates for aim to keep it competitive At the Detroit Auto Show <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>debuted its new GT This halo car in concert with the redesigned Raptor will continue to stir interest in the brand increasing traffic into dealerships around the world The companys resurrected Lincoln Continental not only looks great but should encourage luxury buyers from markets including North America and China to consider the brand The company continues to face currency challenges in Venezuela and slow growth in Brazil an important foreign market The success of Lincolns introduction and continued growth in China remains to be seen but initial signs appear positive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>faces strong domestic competition from Chevys Silverado and recently redesigned Camaro Unfortunately for the companys bottom line Lincolns models do not command the margins achieved by offerings from BMW Porsche Lexus and Audi In this case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>might actually regret selling off its European luxury brands Volvo Jaguar Land Rover Aston Martin in the midst of the financial crisis Though Lincoln certainly has name recognition especially in places like China it appears that perhaps it does not possess the panache Fords management might have believed it did The bottom line however is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to have a low valuation and it pays a great dividend The companys stock remains highly cyclical with high costs and slim margins Unfortunately the company no longer benefits from an ultra luxury brand to drive profits after it sold off Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin but it is a solid investment today I wrote this article
