class='textDiv'>Bakken Update Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Hedges Could Provide ShortTerm Resistance To Oil Prices Around bbl The United States Oil ETF LP NYSEARCAUSO Seeking Alpha Permian operators began hedging oil prices at bbl and continue at bbl with additional hedging from Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>names Increased volumes of hedging provide a short term ceiling to oil prices at least until operators have enough revenues guaranteed to satisfy banks Given the large number of barrels unhedged through and into this could continue for a couple of months but could take longer if oil prices pullback There are significant discrepancies among analyst oil price estimates There were more bears than bulls through the recent run that saw the price of WTI almost double since its low in February This has created some fairly impressive gains in the US Oil ETF NYSEARCA USO Contango has dampened some of these gains but it still was a healthy move We are currently well over the day moving average If we use this as our guide it is possible to see a considerable pull back If the price retraces we could touch the low s Be prepared as a pullback could translate to a move to the downside There are a host of reasons to be bearish but we mainly focus on world inventories It could take a while before we see more normal levels but supply disruptions have been positive Nigeria and Canada have seen production decrease significantly Goldman NYSE GS believes we moved to a supply deficit in May This isnt surprising given the decreases in the US OPEC and Brazil The main questions surround the transient nature of disruptions and a refinery maintenance season the could cause inventories to increase substantially It looks like Nigerian production could take a while to bring back on line but Canada is already beginning to recover from its wildfires Demand for refined product has been much better than expectations and we continue to believe current estimates are still below reality It is important to watch crack spreads Refiners are already talking about a tightening This could continue as refineries have been very active in this low oil price environment bbl could be significant for other reasons as it is a level that incentivizes operators to lock in revenues Dont get me wrong operators without core acreage cannot breakeven at these levels EPs with better economics will be more aggressive Many operators do not have decent volumes hedged this year and in some cases close to nothing in Operators know the markets will be volatile So operators will purchase swaps collars and threeway collars to provide short term security The possibility of a pullback later this year could motivate around bbl This depends on geology as breakeven can differ significantly from one section to the next It wouldnt be unheard of as some operators began hedging around bbl Geology may be one of the most important factors influencing whether an EP will survive the downturn Some operators have a better well design but for the most part there isnt a large difference in results if geology were constant This is why valuations are fairly close when looking at operators with similar acreage Acreage in the Permian Basin seems to offer the quickest payback times With lower breakeven prices many operators began hedging at to bbl We expect that hedging for core players in differing basins will occur at varying levels While the Permian and SCOOP operators began to hedge first as prices go up we will start to see Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Bakken players enter as well This could mean we see a more staggered entry with emphasis on but additional names getting in at and bbl The above slide provides estimated breakeven prices for major US plays We dont generally like these types of slide because one never knows what data is used to create it This is why there are several slides out there at any one time from different analysts and none are identical This isnt to say the analysts arent doing a good job there is just so much data to crunch Although the Delaware and Midland basins seemed in the right place on this list the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to have a much lower breakeven than expected The SCOOP and STACK seemed to have a higher breakeven Like I said there are going to be differing opinions on play economics The main play is so important in a low price environment Operators generally move rigs and completion crews to its best areas A company like Matador NYSE MTDR has switched activity the Delaware Basin from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Halcon NYSE HK moved dollars from the Eaglebine to the Bakken core This has been the case for most names that had the ability to push activity to better areas Some operators like Emerald NYSEMKT EOX didnt have the ability and filed for bankruptcy Anadarko NYSE APC has acreage in several major plays The majority of its US onshore capital is spent on the Delaware and DJ basins It represents billion of the billion total In it will spend to billion if international and the Gulf of Mexico is included The majority of its DJ Basin acreage is located in the core of Wattenberg Field Although these wells arent huge producers it has some very low well costs In APC estimates it is at million per well Its best acreage is probably in the Delaware Basin Loving County may be the core of the play Its acreage has higher well costs but several intervals have shown promise APC currently has K bblsd hedged this year All are threeway collars The average ceiling is bbl The floor is and subfloor Threeway collars are a very interesting way to hedge barrels APC cannot assume more than bbl In exchange for selling upside it added protection for oil prices below bbl If this was a standard collar it would be pretty straight forward but the subfloor in this threeway collar allows for downside below the floor price The difference between the floor and subfloor adds bbl to the realized oil price when below the floor price This means if we retest the lows in oil of approximately bbl APC will still receive bbl This seems appropriate as APCs DJ Basin new drills have a BTAX PV breakeven of bbl WTI In the Delaware Basin the average is bbl APCs cap ex move out of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to the Delaware and DJ Basin seems to show breakeven is higher there Keep in mind APC has been in the DJ Basin for a while now and has much of the infrastructure already in place This is part of the reason its breakeven is lower Marathon NYSE MRO has acreage in three main plays This includes the Bakken Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>SCOOP and STACK The purchase of its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>leasehold was a landmark deal At the time it was thought to be some of the best geology in the country Things have changed as the Permian and Oklahoma resource plays have emerged This is why it acquired acreage in the SCOOPSTACK It is now MROs best acreage but it spends a little over of its cap ex in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>It has rigs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the SCOOP and shares a rig in the Bakken The SCOOP has provided some of the best EURs in MROs inventory XL locations have modeled over MBoe This has provided an excellent alternative to its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>leasehold In Q MRO has K bblsd hedged Company production was K Boed in Q K Boe were from US plays It estimates Q oil production will be K to K Bod from North American resource plays Marathon seems to need at least to cover its cap ex obligations This is a fairly low level for a swap position and could have been a fear trade given the price environment in February Its threeway collars are the most telling MRO thinks oil prices will not exceed this quarter but settled at for H The floor and subfloor have a difference of bbl this quarter This changes to in H Since most believe the bottom is in there is a good chance MRO believes it can hang on somewhere between and bbl Carrizo NASDAQ CRZO is a low cost Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>focused producer It has done a very good job of created very good economics in is specific areas CRZO has been able to decrease well costs in a low cost area of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CRZO claims to have an average Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>breakeven cost of bbl Keep in mind breakeven costs provide a bottom of the barrel number Oil investors arent interested in breaking even but does provide an idea of upside as prices normalize CRZOs hedge position is interesting as it backs the assertion operators will hedge at bbl More importantly hedge positions provide an operators idea of possible prices going forward It may also conceptualize the oil producers fear For the remainder of CRZO has an average weighted floor price of and bbl In this number moves to and This most definitely shows CRZO has worries oil prices could fall below next year At BOd it represents roughly half of production More than likely CRZO is positioning for a worst case scenario and lends little to its estimated average oil price for next year Sanchez NYSE SN is in a little better position than many Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>names More than of production is currently hedged Approximately of production is hedged at bbl The remainder of its derivative positions range between and bbl Sanchez was able to get positions in early and did an excellent job of planning for a lower price environment Although Clayton Williams NYSE CWEI isnt located in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I did add here for Eaglebine exposure It also has Delaware Basin assets which is probably the main reason it has swaps between and bbl In this increased to bbl CWEIs costless collars have an average floor of and average ceiling of bbl Cabot NYSE COG has used collars to hedge its oil production The average floor is and average ceiling It is focused on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but also a player in the Marcellus Although oil revenues are important so are its northeastern assets which produce significant volumes of natural gas Earthstone NYSEMKT ESTE has leasehold in several major US plays This includes the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Bakken and Permian Its Permian acreage is on the fringe and Bakken is nonop The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is currently its core and located in some of the deepest of the oil window It has targeted swaps for its derivative positions In these range from to bbl In the average is swaps average bbl Murphy Oil NYSE MUR has hedged bblsd of crude in Last year it was able to add swaps at This year an additional bblsd were added at In summary operators continue to hedge production at low oil prices Although short term it could resist higher oil prices We have seen many operators hedge in the low s and continued participation as prices have risen Although plays differ significantly from core to fringe areas core areas are in focus Operators continue to dump the bulk of cap ex on core plays in hopes of waiting out this low price environment Hedges are also focused on the economics of these areas EPs must hedge production in order to keep banks happy As oil prices rise we will continue to see hedges added Although many began hedging in the low s it is motivated to add as opportunities arise We think this will continue through Not everyone is in this camp Since many analysts have oil prices higher in Q it is possible EPs will hold off Although we see higher oil prices this year it is possible the fear of volatility will coerce hedging We continue to see an enormous overhang in world oil inventories This is another point of contention but we see this as a continued issue this year The upcoming Brexit may not dent demand in any significant way but could cause the dollar to move higher The upcoming refinery maintenance season is always problematic and this year could be more so We are seeing crack margins tighten which could motivate refiners to decrease throughput We may see the Fed tighten in July Brexit probably has taken June off the table I am not saying all or any of this will occur but it is important to note there are a large number of variables that can move this market in a big way Although we think oil prices will be higher in Q the route in which we get there may be a mystery The current supplydemand situation isnt dire but we have spent a long period of time filling inventories Operators will look at all of these opportunities and issues and may decide to take a more conservative approach Sometimes survival is more important than trying to make what looks to be the obvious more productive trade Disclosure I amwe are long MTDR CRZO I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
