Europe And South America Hinder Fords Growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Fords stock has been trading near the same levels for two years Europe and South America have been troubled regions for the company for the last few years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Co NYSE F is at a very interesting point in the companys history Having been around since the early s <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has established itself as a major automobile manufacturer domestically with its blue oval being a recognizable emblem abroad as well The last years have been unique and impactful in several ways for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>its fair to say the company will never be the same F refused to accept a government bailout during the Great Recession setting itself apart from domestic counterparts General Motors NYSE GM and Chrysler NYSE FCAU Fords ingenuity didnt stop there as legendary former CEO Alan Mulally pioneered the ONE <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>strategy in order to lift the stock from its lows barely over share in the midst of the recession Fords stock has several tailwinds in the coming years but has been rangebound unable to breach its week high of Shares are currently hovering around right now the same price they were trading at in July of Initially there were many critics of Fords initiative claiming ONE <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wouldnt work for a variety of reasons Doubts included the chance new models did not appeal to consumers the inability to turn a profit in Europe and South America difficulty of maintaining market share domestically and the inevitable departure of Mulally Since July of all of those concerns have been alleviated with the exception of those regarding Europe and South America The sentiment toward the company is becoming more positive with the average consensus of Buy among analysts according to NASDAQ Except for one analyst each professional covering the stock believes it is at least worth holding Of the headwinds facing the company its performance in the two markets mentioned above is the most predominant It has contributed to shares remaining around the level for the last two years but the crucial factor is whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to make those regions profitable in the coming years Europe has been a talking point for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors for years Performance in the continent has served as a measure of Fords recovery <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had been targeting as the year the company earns a profit in Europe but that guidance was cut late last year as the new target for European profit was pushed back Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>slashed its long term profit forecast for the region from share to share by the stock fell about in the following weeks Many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors are focused on the future so this news was very discouraging to the market Fs First Quarter Earnings Report revealed that wont be the year the company completely turns things around in Europe either In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>increased the projected loss upwards of the previously forecasted million the company added that the loss will be less than the billion loss in Russia is a major contributor to the negative performance in Europe with sales down YTD Initially Europe was viewed by many as a region that will take time to turn around but will be a significant contributor to Fs bottom line As time passes it seems more like a venture where something always goes wrong limiting upside potential Fords European operations have reached the point where investors need to decide whether believing in the turnaround is an exercise of shrewd patience or misguided confidence with a hint of naivet To find an answer to that question one needs to define what believing in the turnaround entails Expecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe to be a major profit driver anytime in the next five years would certainly fall under the naive category Given the company guided for a share profit five years from now its reasonable to consider the turnaround complete when the company breaks even in the region While this may be underwhelming criteria for a turnaround it needs to be remembered that were talking about a region that has never added that much profit to Fords earnings With recordsetting sales in North America and Asia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shareholders should be satisfied with breaking even in Europe As long as the troubled region isnt taking from earnings it should be viewed as a win Any profit in Europe is an added bonus To put it simply yes Europe will hinder Fords growth but only if youre expecting large profits in the future For those with a more pessimistic view on Europe like myself its not viewed as a hindrance because there is little expectation Currency headwinds along with economic instability have cursed Fords earnings in South America for the last few quarters and the outlook is uncertain The strengthening US Dollar has increased the impact of already existent foreign exchange expenses Full year profit loss in South America was million in then fell to million in While no company wants to see a drop in profit the decline from to is nothing compared to massive loss of billion South America brought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in Similarly to Europe there are two major areas of concern for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in South America companyspecific operationsrisks and broader economybased risk The following slide from Fords Fiscal Year Investor Presentation contains information relevant to both categories The decline in the SAAR for the region is troubling from a macro perspective as it hints vehicle purchases are declining IMO the more significant data is the market share statistics Vehicle sales will pick up with the broader economy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>increased its market share for the entire region by bps and bps in the continents largest market Brazil The Brazilian auto market comprised just under of all vehicle sales in South America last quarter While the SAAR fell Fords revenue only dropped These statistics indicate that Fords operational risk in South America is relatively low since F products are resonating well with consumers The new product offerings will continue to prove successful and increase the companys market share in years to come Still the massive loss incurred in South America in needs to be addressed especially given the massive acceleration in losses yoy A large detractor from Fs bottom line has been foreign exchange charges In the second half of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>lost million purely due to currency exchanges in South America These charges will most likely continue in the region but at a much lower level The massive loss seen in the third and fourth quarter directly coincide with the US Dollars surge in value Overall I see South America being a strong profit driver for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>long term Management also guided to be substantial improvement over in South America Europe and South America often get mentioned in the same breath with regard to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but are actually two entirely different scenarios for the company Europe is a perpetually troubled region for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that investors shouldnt be focusing too much on Europe will return to the breakeven point by at the latest and will then add small profits to Fs bottom line South America will be similar to Europes profitloss in the next few years then add significant profit in later years Once economic stability or at least some is achieved in the region the profits will flow in for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I dont see Europe adding much value for the company but contrary to popular opinion I think South America will be a very profitable region for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>going forward Source Will Europe And
