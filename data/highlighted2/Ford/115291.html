style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>fell along with the rest of the market during last weeks selloff <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still has a low valuation and strong dividend The recent drop makes both more attractive Shares of major automakers fell hard last week largely due to concerns over the Chinese market and the crisis in Greece But there is a bright side to these developments Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F are now available at cheaper levels and with a higher dividend yield Although I tend to focus on fundamental rather than technical analysis I see the value in longterm trading ranges on the psychology of market participants In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the automakers have been trapped in a longterm range between and per share Since mid shares only fell below for part of October and only edged above a few times With shares currently trading at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is now available near the low end of its range which positions investors well if shares continue to move within the range In a previous article I asked investors to consider buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for its dividend alone But with shares lower today the dividend yield has become even more attractive now yielding For income investors this yield is highly attractive producing more than twice the income of the SP average dividend yield of The dividend also helps to keep investors money growing even if shares remain trapped in the to trading range Much of the selloff in major automakers last week came from concerns over slowing growth in China While these concerns have existed for a long time the recent drop in Chinese stocks helped magnify the concerns by threatening to curtail the economys wealth effect China has long been billed as a major growth outlet to drive earnings of the Detroit Three automakers But while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would still be hurt by a drop in Chinese demand it is not as dependent on the country as rivals In the case of General Motors NYSE GM the automaker is a major player in China with a market share compared to Fords Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NYSE FCAU only has a market share in China however the automotive group needs significant growth in the country to achieve its fiveyear plan Towards the end of last week the Chinese stock markets started to rebound but only time will tell whether or not this is the end of the dip Overall I consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the best positioned of the Detroit Three to weather a downturn in Chinese auto demand With the recent drop in Fords shares they now trade at rockbottom valuations based on forward earnings At times est earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares trade at roughly half of the SP average Additionally the automaker trades at only times est earnings and times est earnings While I dont expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to match the SP valuation due to the capitalintensive and cyclical natures of the industry I do see some room for the gap to narrow For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trade at the top end its range it would only need a valuation of times est earnings and times est earnings Attaining this level would provide a gain to shareholders buying in at and I see such a gain as reasonable over the next months if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to perform fundamentally Again it would not even require shares to break out of their longterm range The slide in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares puts them near the low end of their longterm trading range while providing a higher dividend yield For risktolerant investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is now providing an attractive entry point with capital appreciation upside and a large dividend to collect while you wait Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Is Attractive Below
