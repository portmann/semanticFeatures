style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported a blowout Q but investors have sold the bounce once again Shares are now trading for just times forward earnings incredible for a company that just reported record profits I think investors will wake up at some point and own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but for now I think holding is still more than warranted Ive been a long time bull on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F as I think the companys new product offerings as well as its valuation make a compelling case for long term value Most recently I outlined why I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the better choice against Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU as the latter trades at an enormous premium to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for reasons that are unclear to me The company reported a very strong Q at the end of July and although investors originally bought the results that buying pressure was quickly squashed and we find the stock down again In light of Fords seemingly constant starts and stops Ill take a fresh look at the companys valuation following its huge Q to see if we may see a sustained rally at some point in the near future To do this Ill use a DCFtype model you can read more about here The model uses several inputs including earnings estimates which Ive borrowed from Yahoo dividends which Ive set to grow at annually and a discount rate which Ive set at the year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of Ive changed things up here with my model instead of finding the current fair value based upon the usual inputs Ive instead changed the out years earnings growth estimates to make the model return the current stock price In other words Ive worked backwards to understand what the market is pricing in so that we may evaluate the reasonableness of current expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported a blowout quarter in Q beating EPS and revenue by wide margins The company showed broad strength with its new products and investors couldnt have asked for more In addition to very strong revenue the companys margins rose sharply as well Operating margins were up bps and on a base of bps thats an enormous increase That powered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to a record profit in Q as strong volume and pricing paved the way for an outstanding quarter Much of my bullishness on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stems from the companys new product offerings and namely the F Series This model has long been the backbone of Fords operating profits and the new F Series was a huge step forward and risk for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The aluminum body was something that hasnt been tried before and while the fuel savings are measurable with low gas prices I was concerned some truck buyers wouldnt see the value Fortunately buyers have seen the value in the redesigned F Series and are buying it in droves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold more than F Series trucks in July as pricing remains strong boosting margins In fact it is selling them so quickly it has hired a second supplier to build frames for the truck because it cannot currently keep up with demand If that isnt a sign of strong demand Im not sure what is And given that margins are great on the F Series the fact that the company is selling so many is great not only for revenue but profits as well We saw this in Q and if July is any indication Q will be similar And for those that thought aluminum bodied trucks werent as safe as their steel counterparts recent testing put that concern to bed Hopefully this will assuage some of the unfounded fears consumers had regarding the aluminum bodied truck and could be a catalyst for incrementally higher sales in the near term Back to the model according to my calculations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares are pricing in earnings growth in and beyond of negative In other words I believe the stock is currently pricing in lower EPS in than this year and if that sounds crazy to you perhaps a long position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sounds more palatable Given the momentum <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has exhibited and the simple fact that its new product offerings are leading to record profit levels I simply cant understand why someone would think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is worth so little The stock is priced currently as though the F Series was a huge failure which in light of strong evidence is obviously far from the truth The stock is now trading for times forward earnings an incredible number that is normally assigned to companies that are deteriorating towards bankruptcy To the contrary <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is posting record numbers and yet receives no love from investors I have to think this situation will be resolved at some point as disbelievers are proven wrong over and over again and that is why Im sticking to my bullish position here there is simply too much evidence that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to continue to make lots of money for me to sell And if value stocks arent for you at least consider the companys yield That level gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>one of the best yields among large caps in the entire market and with the business producing very strong results the payout will almost certainly continue to grow Im perplexed by the perpetual undervaluation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but I am confident investors will see the light at some point The business is simply too strong to ignore and I find currently priced expectations to be ludicrous Im long Disclosure I amwe are long F MoreI wrote this article myself
