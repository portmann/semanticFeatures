#A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should by the end of this year be far lower than it is today if current trends persist Unfortunately though fresh data out by the EIA requires me to make some revisions that make this picture seem less appealing Although output in the region should still plummet yearoveryear if my forecast is correct the decline will be smaller than I had hoped for Last month I published a piece regarding oil production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>one of the seven largest oil and natural gas producing regions within the US In it I concluded that theres a high probability that oil production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will have materially this year if current trends persist something that should be bullish for longterm oil investors in the United States Oil ETF NYSEARCA USO as well as in other oil ETFs and oilrelated companies Now that fresh data is out courtesy of the EIA Energy Information Administration Ive decided to dig in and update my analysis to determine what the future of production should look like throughout the rest of In my last piece on the issue I had to rely on three core assumptions for the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>These involved rig count changes improvements in rig productivity and monthly decline rates In my article I looked at this historical change in rig counts to determine that if trends dont change investors should expect the total operational rig count in the area to fall by units per month starting in March and that we would see units in operation during February I was off on the number of units we would see with the actual number hitting just units but the historical drop in rig count over time still supports in my mind a drop of units each month On top of that I had to look at changes in rig productivity over time Last month I figured that we would see the monthtomonth rig productivity numbers improve by about moving forward down from a previous forecast of a month before that However in the revised data provided by the EIA which you can see in the graph below I believe this calls for a further revision For now Im making the assumption that the actual increase in rig productivity each month should be about each month but this may change if new data warrants it Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report Finally I had to figure out what makes sense from a decline rate perspective In my last article I used historical data dating back to January of to figure out that the monthly decline rate in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for oil production should be split into three separate categories conservative moderate and liberal Under the conservative model I assumed monthly decline rates of while moderate decline rates the most realistic in my opinion came out to Meanwhile the liberal forecast called for a rate of each month In the graph below you can see that this picture is still showing around for decline rates each month so Ive elected to stick with this prior setup for the time being Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report After plugging in my older assumptions I was able to create the table below which shows that production should fall hard this year Under the conservative forecast investors should expect output in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to drop to barrels per day while the moderate forecast calls for output of around barrels per day The liberal forecast the least likely in my opinion should see production plummet to just barrels per day All of these are a massive improvement over the revised December output data for the region of million barrels each day and are extremely bullish in nature After incorporating the new EIA data into my model I created the following table below What you can see is that the initially higher rig count in February combined with the higher rig productivity data makes things look a bit less favorable Under the conservative scenario we should now see oil production come out to about barrels per day This moves down to barrels per day for the moderate scenario and drops even further to just barrels per day under the liberal one Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report Ultimately these drops are very significant in nature because they peg a yearoveryear decline at between barrels per day and barrels per day By itself this would be enough to more or less absorb Irans projected increase in production barrels per day during the first half of this year and another barrels per day in the second half if it were even across the entire year which is sadly not the case However while this data is very positive in nature its not as positive as I previously hoped it would be Because of the changes I had to make to my model namely the increase in productivity oil production should now be between barrels per day and barrels per day above what I thought it would be last month Based on the data provided the picture in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is look extremely bullish for longterm investors but isnt as bullish as I previously expected it to be This is for the most part bittersweet in nature because I had been hoping to see the opposite situation play out but theres still no denying that despite the lessbullish outlook things are still very much looking up Of course this could change based on a number of factors a big increase in rig count would harm my forecast tremendously but absent new data the overall picture is still quite positive Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
