class='textDiv'>Hyundai And Kia Challenge Toyota And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>With New Hybrid Cars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Hyundai and Kia are launching two new dedicated gasolineelectric hybrid cars to compete with Toyota Prius and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CMax These two cars have strong selling points against Toyota Prius especially when it comes to interiorcockpit design Android Auto and Apple CarPlay Plugin hybrid versions of these two cars will also be available but not until well into also competing with Toyota and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>dedicated models It remains to be seen whether HyundaiKia will be able to compete with GM and Tesla for a dedicated pure electric car with over miles of range for This challenge of competing with GM Tesla and Nissan on a mile range electric car at the price point is not unique to HyundaiKia When hybrid cars first hit the scene approximately fifteen years ago the two first players were Honda NYSE HMC and Toyota NYSE TM Those first models Insight and Prius were dedicated hybrid cars as opposed to variants of existing cars Of those two models Prius became almost synonymous with hybrid cars and the Honda Insight quickly faded away In early Honda made a return to the dedicated hybrid car market with another entirely new car also called Insight but it looked almost like a copy of the Prius It was a flop and was subsequently canceled Almost all other hybrid gasolineelectric cars launched since then have been adaptations of existing gasoline cars Many automakers from Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY to Audi OTCPKAUDVF Mercedes BMW OTCPKBAMXY GM NYSE GM Nissan OTCPKNSANY and Subaru have offered those over the last halfdecade Only one company has had at least some success in challenging Toyota in the dedicated hybrid game in the US and thats <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F with the CMax model Its not even so much as a dedicated hybrid model from an engineering standpoint as its sold as hybridonly in the US market unlike in Europe where it is also available as nonhybrid Even so both Toyota and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw sales declines in their US sales of Prius and CMax in Toyota Prius declined to units <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CMax declined to Despite this shrinking market for dedicated hybrid models HyundaiKia is now launching a new family of dedicated hybrid cars geared to compete with Toyota Prius and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CMax in the US These are the Hyundai Ioniq and the Kia Niro The Hyundai Ioniq looks much like the basic body style of the Prius optimized for aerodynamics and sitting lower to the ground The Kia Niro is a slightly taller vehicle sitting more upright having slightly higher ground clearance and a higher socalled hip point in which people sit higher making it easier to get in and out of the car Kia announced that it is targeting MPG fuel economy but the Hyundai version will naturally do better than that given its more aerodynamic body The Hyundai Ioniq hybrid goes on sale in the US in the fourth quarter of and the Kia Niro in January It looks like the Kia Niro will be able to achieve fuel economy slightly below the new Toyota Prius at MPG and the Hyundai Ioniq will be able to approximately match the Prius fuel economy with an MPG number above MPG With all that said why would anyone buy the Hyundai or Kia hybrids instead of the Prius For starters not everyone may like the styling of the new Prius Months after I saw it for the first time I continue to be on the fence about it even if I like it more now than at first sight back in September Many people with whom I have spoken do not like it as much as I do My advice Dont make up your mind until youve seen it in person in real traffic It looks better than in that picture you saw In that context the Hyundai and Kia hybrids are more conventional designs I especially find the Kia Niro to be more attractive as a one box design that reminds me of the Mercedes BClass and Kias own Soul model The front of the car is Kias new trademark similar to the new Sportage which is extremely attractive The interior differences may be greater than the exteriors While the new Prius represents an infinite improvement over the outgoing Prius I am not a big fan of the new interior either especially as it compares to the Hyundai and Kia interiors No matter the model these days Hyundai and Kia deliver the industrys best cockpit ergonomics and their interior style is very pleasing as well Toyota is also missing key cockpit features most notably Android Auto NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL CarPlay both of which are Hyundai and Kia selling points on their newest models I think most people who compare a Prius interior with either of these Hyundai and Kia models side by side will agree that Hyundai and Kia are ahead of the game Journalists have not yet driven the new Hyundai Ioniq or Kia Niro hybrids The new Prius drives extremely well with outstanding handling and steering a giant leap ahead of its predecessor and will be difficult for Hyundai and Kia to match let alone exceed We will just have to see in the coming months as they are tested against each other Even if HyundaiKia end up matching or even exceeding the new Prius in terms of driving dynamics going up against the Prius with its iconic name recognition is like getting involved with a land war in Asia It will be a struggle to say the least or at least that is what conventional wisdom suggests Beyond the basic hybrid model Hyundai and Kia will launch plugin versions of these two new cars but only well into By that time Toyota may also have launched its plugin version of the Prius In the meantime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to offer a plugin version of the CMax It sold of those in the US in down slightly from in Hyundai will also launch a pure EV version of the Ioniq in the US in the fourth quarter of It has not yet said what kind of range this pure electric car will have Kia already offers a pure EV in this size and price class the Soul EV It has miles of range Therefore it is not clear to me whether Kia will continue to build on the Soul for its EV future or switch to the Niro for this purpose The challenge for both Hyundai and Kia in terms of pure EVs is the same as for most other automakers GM and Tesla NASDAQ TSLA will deliver cars in the range that will have more than miles of range This leaves all these other companies Kia Hyundai <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Nissan Volkswagen Fiat BMW Mercedes and some others with this challenge If you are going to launch a new EV in this entry level EV class and it doesnt have miles of range or anything close to it at what discount will you have to sell it GM will deliver the Chevrolet Bolt at the end of with miles of range Tesla will deliver its Model with miles of range potentially as early as the end of Nissan will deliver its LEAF probably around the middle of with potentially around miles of range as well If you are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Kia or Hyundai and you are trying to sell an EV with only miles of range in how much less will you need to charge for this car than the that Tesla and GM are targeting Will you need to go down to only What will the market be willing to pay for a mile EV instead of an otherwise equivalent mile range car These are the critical questions Toyota is now facing its toughest competition in the dedicated hybrid market yet HyundaiKia In Hyundai was the worlds fifth largest automaker larger than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and not all the far behind industry leader Toyota with approximately million cars sold compared to Toyotas million and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>under million These new Hyundai and Kia hybrids appear to stack up very well against Toyota especially for those of us who are addicted to either Android Auto or Apple CarPlay as well as for those who prefer the HyundaiKia cockpit interiors That said HyundaiKia has another tougher challenge in turn and thats to compete with mile range EVs from GM Tesla perhaps Nissan and others starting very soon I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation
