Year End Earnings Call During the presentation all participants will be in a listenonly mode Afterwards we will conduct a questionandanswer session As a reminder this conference is being recorded Tuesday February I would like to now turn the conference over to Mr Chip Johnson President and CEO Please go ahead Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Thank you operator and thank you all for calling in Despite the challenging commodity price environment our management team is pleased to report another outstanding quarter for the company Our net oil production of Bopd was up sequentially and represents a record level of oil production for the company Our team has also done an outstanding job managing our expenses as our unit operating costs declined by approximately versus the third quarter We expect some of our cost reduction initiatives to bear further fruit this year which David Pitts will discuss For the year we delivered a reserve replacement at an attractive finding cost of per Boe This brought our yearend proved reserves to approximately million Boe up versus despite negative pricerelated revisions of million Boe as a result of the significant drop in the SEC Commodity Price deck Excluding the impact of this price drop we would have reported reserve replacement at a finding cost of per Boe The fact that we were able to grow our proved reserves in this environment is a testament to the quality of our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>position which accounts for the vast majority of our proved reserves That Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>position is why RS a respected thirdparty research analyst gave us the number one ranking of breakeven costs compared with other EP companies in North America Our primary focus in the current commodity price environment is protecting our balance sheet As a result our initial drilling and completion CapEx plan of million to million represents a decrease of nearly versus the level Our initial land CapEx plan for the year is million The total CapEx program is focused on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>allowing us to run one rig to two rigs during the year but also provides us with the flexibility to continue testing our Delaware Basin acreage and allocate a small amount of capital to our other regions Based on this level of activity our initial crude oil production guidance is Bopd to Bopd or roughly flat with the fourth quarter level Additionally we expect fourth quarter oil production to be higher than fourth quarter of oil production We believe this program optimizes our cash flow liquidity and leverage metrics in the current environment while also providing us with the flexibility to increase or further decrease activity in response to changes in the commodity price outlook Now Ill turn it over to David to talk about the quarter David L Pitts Chief Financial Officer Vice President Thanks Chip and good morning everyone As Chip mentioned oil production for the quarter was a record barrels per day higher than third quarter of and higher than the fourth quarter of Gas production for the quarter was MMcf per day and NGL production was barrels per day Fourth quarter production exceeded the highend of guidance primarily due to the continued strong performance of our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>assets and lower than expected levels of voluntary curtailments in the Marcellus Fourth quarter included revenues of approximately million of which million was attributable to crude oil During the quarter we realized of NYMEX for oil slightly below the range of our guided realization due to higher than expected differentials in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>We realized of NYMEX for gas above the range of our guided realization due to better than expected differentials in the Marcellus and of NYMEX for NGLs also above the range of our guided realization Last quarter I mentioned the implementation of several cost reduction initiatives While higher than expected gas production in the Marcellus contributed to lower per Boe operating costs we continue to see the positive impact of these initiatives with total cost and expenses for the quarter of million or per Boe below our guidance and down from per BOE in the prior quarter In we expect our overhead expense reduction initiatives will reduce our annual cash GA by compared to DDA for the quarter was per Boe which is below the range of guidance largely due to higher than expected reserve additions in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and lower than expected future development costs For the quarter our adjusted net income was million or per diluted share exceeding consensus earnings estimates of per diluted share Drilling and completion capital expenditures for the quarter were million more than of which was in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Included in the press release is the first quarter and full year guidance For the first quarter of we expect to realize to of NYMEX for oil to of NYMEX for gas and to of NYMEX for NGLs DDA guidance for the first quarter is per Boe to per Boe The decrease relative to the fourth quarter is primarily due to the ceiling test impairment recorded during the fourth quarter We currently have hedges in place for barrels per day or of our estimated crude oil production for These hedges consist of barrels per day of swaps at per barrel and barrels per day of collars with floors and ceilings Additionally we will receive million in cash for those during related to the offsetting hedge transactions we entered into during the first quarter of Based on crude oil strip prices as of yesterday we expect to receive million to million from derivative settlements during the first quarter of Given our strong hedge book for weve recently turned our focus to adding hedges for to protect our cash flows Since the beginning of the year weve added barrels per day of swaps for the first half of at per barrel Were planning to be opportunistic about adding additional hedges for Additional details regarding our derivative contracts are included in the press release At year end we had total debt of billion million in cash and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of times Our revolver is undrawn with a borrowing base of million Based on the latest bank price deck which we received late yesterday we expect our spring redetermination to result in a borrowing base of approximately million to million However this to reduction in our borrowing base is not expected to have an impact on our planned capital program This borrowing base estimate is higher than that disclosed in the K we filed yesterday afternoon This is because the latest price deck was received after we filed the K Now Ill turn it back over to Chip for an operations update Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Thanks David In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>were producing from gross wells or net wells with two drilling rigs running and one frac crew During the fourth quarter we drilled gross wells or net operated wells and completed gross wells or net wells Crude oil production from the play was more than barrels a day for the quarter an increase of approximately versus the prior quarter At the end of the quarter we had gross wells or net operated Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale wells waiting on completion equating to net crude oil production potential of more than barrels a day We currently expect to drill approximately gross wells or net operated wells and frac gross wells or net wells in the play during Our drilling inventory in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is currently based on a combination of foot and foot spacing and we continue to test multiple initiatives aimed at significantly increasing our drilling inventory We remain encouraged by the results from the remaining foot tests and now have three months to four months of production data from three staggerstack pads testing effective lateral spacing ranging from feet to feet Todate we havent seen any data that would indicate a staggerstack development is not feasible If successful a staggerstack development could add from to more than additional net locations to our drilling inventory Our initial Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well has been on line for almost four months and the data indicates that the formation is acting independently of the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which adds another layer of potential to our future development options In the Delaware Basin we have drilled five wells to test the Wolfcamp and completed three of them Our drilling efficiency increased significantly over the period and we expect to be able to drill future wells in days to days at a completed cost of approximately million Our plans currently include completing at least one of the remaining wells Two of the completed wells were brought online late last year but one of them had to be shutin during December due to a fire at a thirdparty operated midstream facility The first well the Mustang State H had a peak day rate of Boe per day for the entire well bore prior to the plant fire We later isolated to of the lateral which treated more effectively after which the well produced Boe per day over an eightday test period While this was only a limited period of time were encouraged as it does imply outperformance relative to the nearest industry offset well on a lateralnormalized basis And thats important because this offset well is what we use for initial economic evaluation of the area Our second well the Avenger State H was drilled in a riskier location as it was drilled near a geological fault While the well was still cleaning up and production was still increasing when we had to shut it in we do believe that performance was adversely affected by the fault as the water cut was higher than weve seen in the area Our third well the Liberator State H recently began flowback While its too early to discuss conclusive results we are encouraged by the early information as the well did appear to treat effectively over feet of lateral We got oil production sooner than the Mustang well producing oil at about twice the early rate of the Mustang well and the oil is about of hydrocarbons In the Niobrara we are producing from gross wells or net wells with nine gross wells or net wells waiting on completion at the end of the quarter representing about net Bopd of potential initial production Given that our acreage in play is primarily held by production were likely to limit spending in the Niobrara during Our current plan calls for the completion of several drilled but uncompleted wells later in the year as well as some minor lease management activity For the first quarter total company oil production is expected to range between net barrels per day and net barrels per day For gas and NGLs first quarter production should range between roughly net million cubic feet per day to net million cubic feet per day and net barrels per day and net barrels per day respectively So to summarize the nearterm catalysts have Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>downspacing both going to feet for the rest of our acreage and determining the right staggerstack spacing is close to being completed and the Liberator State well which we just brought on last week should have more results that we can talk about in the next month or two months Thank you The first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust Please go ahead Neal D Dingmann SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc Morning guys Say Chip just one Del and one Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for you give you sort of the guys thoughts now on after these three wells youve seen so far in the Delaware has your thoughts changed I know on that slide youve got sort of the outline of what you all designate as that Carrizo focus area with the Wolfcamp Shale A bench I guess my two questions are is that focused area changed at all And is the target still primarily that A bench Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I think the target area is okay I think the complexity of the faulting is something we have to be careful of We were worried about that and we had D over some of it and it was kind of like when we started in Barnett Shale we had to figure out how close to the faults we can drill without having a problem with water and it looks like on the Avenger we got too close But that will help us figure out going forward exactly how to put the wells in those areas and also help us avoid leasing or farmin into acreage that has faults on it because weve been offered acreage like that and with these results now weve been able to stay away from them Neal D Dingmann SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc And the target is still the same there Chip then for the zones Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director In that area the Wolfcamp A is the best zone Were in some Wolfcamp B wells with Conoco and actually Energen has an excellent Wolfcamp B well right next to us But at this point were still going to keep testing the Wolfcamp A Neal D Dingmann SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc Okay And then just lastly moving to the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>obviously the reserve report and everything you stated not only the new wells continue to improve but obviously your existing wells Certainly it must be flowing quite well Any thoughts I know youve got that slide out that shows the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well economics and kind of your type curve behind that Are you still comfortable with that are there chance thoughts about boosting that any time soon you know the one where you kind of show your economics at different oil prices and then just the one where you show your type curve given obviously the improved performance youve seen there Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I think weve got all the yearend Ryder Scott data now so we might be tweaking those numbers Were thinking about also splitting them to highlight the oilier acreage And if you remember the slide we have that shows how many wells have a breakeven cost lower than which is the majority of our acreage were probably going to separate those two streams so that instead of an average you can kind of see the better wells and the worse wells Weve also had some improvements in costs with some reductions in fracking cost drilling efficiency so well be able to put those lower costs into those economics going forward Brad Carpenter Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hey Good morning guys And congrats on the great quarter Chip I was hoping you could provide us with some color around portfolio management You have some assets that some might view as noncore and I think your actions in and budget for largely support that view So I was curious if you could update us with how youre thinking about potential divestitures Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Weve talked in the past about selling some of the assets were not spending any capital on and weve put data rooms together but we havent pulled the trigger to go off and launch the process as yet The bankers have basically told us lets just watch the market for another month or two months and see what the market is valuing assets for in terms of how much price you get for the upside in an asset and what PDP strip pricing people are using And then well just make the decision when we need to launch one of those processes The ones weve looked at are a Marcellus process and a Niobrara process and then weve also looked at a DrillCo in the Utica where we use private equity money to start drilling so that we can get the midstream built out in that area Brad Carpenter Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay All right Great I appreciate that And then I apologize I missed in the prepared remarks just your comments on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the number of DUCs you have currently I know its been to But could you walk us through that map on how many youre drilling and how many youre completing in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>based on the budget that youve provided and how that sets you up for your DUC inventory heading into Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Hey Brad Its Jeff Yeah I think we actually have a little typo there The completion is correct in the press release Its gross wells net wells that well complete this year Sorry those numbers that we mentioned that I can only pull the completion counts Brad Carpenter Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Gotcha Gotcha Okay So you just plan on drawing down the DUC inventory slightly and maintaining I guess what youd consider a healthy balance going into next year Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Brad Carpenter Cantor Fitzgerald Securities The next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo Please go ahead David R Tameron Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning Chip staggerstack when can you declare it conclusive And like when do you start rolling that out on a I guess more of a widespread scale than what youre doing right now Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Were still hoping to do that in the second quarter At that point we ought to have six months data on all the different tests Theres also some competitor data we think we can look at and make the decision on exactly which one of those options were going to go with David R Tameron Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay So youre saying at some point like in theory if you continue to see what youre seeing and you like what you see the second half of the year youll be going primarily staggerstack Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Thats what it would appear like at this point David R Tameron Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay And then second question and Ill let somebody else jump in How should we think about or how do you think about better question how do you think about Like if the strip holds here and I know were in theres going to be a lot of moving parts But the strip kind of holds where its at whats philosophically topdown How do you think about managing the balance sheet How do you think about capital spend How do you think about cash flow like any broad strokes around that Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Well weve been modeling that and looking at a bunch of different scenarios And in a strip case the first thing we look at is just hold production flat It turns out that if we let production drop the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>payback is so fast that that almost hurts your leverage metrics So weve just been running everything at flat production at this point in modeling how that would go forward We havent put any more CapEx savings in and cost reductions but were on the strip case I think those will happen later this year and thatll probably cut CapEx even more David R Tameron Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay Just one followup there so in theory though if you exit fourth quarter I think in the press release you said Q is going to be higher than Q So you should be on at least on the crude side so you should be on an upward trajectory headed into And then thats the number youre trying to keep flattish at strip pricing Thats the right way to think about that Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Well wed probably just say yeartoyear it would be flat so Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I mean were not giving guidance on but thats the easiest case for us to model David R Tameron Wells Fargo Securities LLC I wonder if you guys could help on the GA savings to thats going to be down how much of that is already kind of at a full run rate Were we already seeing a full run rate of that entering Q or should we expect that Q to Q is actually may be greater than How to think about that David L Pitts Chief Financial Officer Vice President This is David Pitts Will Our GA is not incurred ratably throughout the year So the savings some of the savings we started to realize in the fourth quarter but most of them are not going to occur until calendar and theyll occur throughout the year Okay So steady improvement is the way we should think about that And then on the Avenger well can you guys maybe give us a little bit more detail on the water cut there How much additional water cut did you guys see versus say surrounding offsets or any other wells youve seen in that area Any kind of color there would be helpful Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director No were just saying it was higher Its probably Id say its too high We basically have to drill back off farther from these strikeslip faults that we were testing the spacing to So you just make enough water that especially at low commodity prices its going to hurt your economics And can you just remind us how much D you guys have over your acreage position and how much you may have over other prospective acreage position to help you guys lease Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director We probably have to of our position And weve got some sort of seismic on every well we drill And then we bought more seismic as weve tried to form into other peoples acreage And some of it is almost free and some of its a square mile So it just depends on where we are whether were being really picky or weve got some big blanket sheets Kyle Rhodes RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey guys Just a quick one on your production guidance You guys now have several pads online testing tighter effective lateral spacing Are you risking any of that production from those pads versus your foot wells Just kind of curious how you baked that into guidance Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Hey Kyle its Jeff I mean were not going to get that much into the weeds in terms of how we give guidance Kyle Rhodes RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay Thats fair I guess just moving over to the MA front weve seen a few Permian operators announce some bolton type acreage acquisitions and then kind of overequitize these deals as a way to bolster the balance sheet Is that something that Carrizo could look to do And if so what size opportunities are out there right now Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Weve looked at most of the big deals that have transacted And I dont think were in that market yet We dont have enough confidence in the Basin and in the economics to pay per acre for undrilled acreage in the Basin So those big deals well keep looking at and well get more and more comfortable with time But I dont think thats something were going to do on a big scale Kyle Rhodes RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay And then can you just remind me your JV partners right of participation in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and any future transactions there Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Our partner weve got a couple of partners GAIL the Gas Authority of India is a partner in some of our acreage and they have a right to buy anything we acquire in a halo around the leases theyre in And I dont know the details of that And then CNOOC then Nexen then OOGC is our partner for about a third in some of the acreage that we bought from Chesapeake And I think we just have a joint operating agreement with them I dont think there are ropers or anything like that The next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo Please go ahead David R Tameron Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hey Chip Im back Just a quick question MA David R Tameron Wells Fargo Securities LLC I dont know Im in now so its too late Hey Chip can you just give me obviously the bidask spread everything you hear from your side of the table is bidask spread is too wide Is that I assume youre still saying that but is that a is it like how far apart would you view the market right now Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Its closer than it was four months ago I think in some cases its getting real close It depends on whether youre in the right basin Global Hunter has put some data together to show how outside of about three basins nobodys paying much for upside But if youre in those basins then you might get you know as weve seen in the Delaware Basin up to per acre I think the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Niobrara some of the Bakken still commands those kind of prices obviously the staggerstacked But outside of those the bidask have started to get pretty close because its narrowing down to just PDP PV Brian Michael Corales Scotia Howard Weil Hey guys Just on the staggerstack can you comment I guess is there any degradation you have seen on those wells versus the foot or foot spaced wells Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development Yeah This is Andy Agosto Again as Chip talked about in his operational comments were not at a point where were going to give a lot of detail here But we have seen some encouragement And certainly were forging ahead Weve got a couple additional pads that are going to be fracked here in the next couple of months Again were optimistic but were not really in a position to give a lot of details on that at this point Brian Michael Corales Scotia Howard Weil Okay Fair enough And then just to follow on the MA I mean in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have you all seen I guess more willing sellers than youve seen in the past based on a lot of the current commodity situation or balance sheet issues Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I guess weve seen some of the gassier assets transact and be put up for sale And there was one nonopposition in the DeWitt Karnes area that got put up for sale But they havent been large packages so there havent been a lot of transactions Kim Marie Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC Yeah good morning Im curious why you all decided to drill a highrisk well near known faulting early on in the Permian program Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director We had to figure it out I mean the Permian as anybody in the Permian will say is probably in the second inning or third inning of understanding everything And we knew there were faults on the acreage and we wanted to know how close we could drill We did this in the Barnett and figured it out pretty accurately and had some algorithms for exactly what kind of fault and what kind of throw we could get exactly how close to And that worked very well for us and were trying to figure that out before we waste a lot of money out here chasing acreage that might have faults in it to dim the whole acreage plot because were seeing deals like that Kim Marie Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC Okay Makes sense And then on the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can you just give us some cost data on that Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well and what youre thinking on the EUR Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Its too early on the EUR on the cost side its only about feet shallower than or feet shallower than some of the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells So really not much of a cost savings Kim Marie Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC Okay Great And then last question on the FD you said that youre excluding revisions youre at for the year and you have a cost in your last slide deck What was responsible for that improvement over what you just showed in the January deck Is it that the perwell reserves came in so much higher with the engineering David L Pitts Chief Financial Officer Vice President David L Pitts Chief Financial Officer Vice President Kim Marie Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC I know that no I know its a single well versus everything that youve done for the year So maybe then what you can do is talk about how that number will change as you move into Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development Well I dont think this is Andy Agosto again I dont think were going to see and I think Chip alluded to this a big change in reserves We are going to continue to see some lower capital costs so the number could get lower based on the capital costs going forward The next question comes from the line of Chris Stevens with KeyBanc Please go ahead Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Hey morning guys I know there is some other operators out there in the Delaware Basin that have stressed the importance of picking the correct landing zone within a reservoir Can you just provide maybe some color on how you landed your first two wells within the Wolfcamp A bench And maybe how that impacted the well performance And maybe anything you might change on some of the future wells Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director All well say is that we have tried at least three different techniques of landing and sometimes in the same well So were experimenting with that also Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Okay I know you also earlier mentioned the B bench looks good on some of your acreage and I guess Bone Springs sands is wet any thoughts on the Bone Springs Shale around your acreage Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I dont think weve seen much potential above the A There are a couple places where weve had shows in the zones above the A but there is not any good competitor data around us that would make that a target So were basically at least on that ReevesCulberson line were looking at the top of the A down Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Okay And just one follow up on an earlier question regarding Any thoughts on whether that maintenance CapEx level might actually go a little bit lower in relative to this year and do you think there might be a little bit more of a focus on working down some of the DUCs to kind of improve the capital efficiency Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Hey Chris its Jeff I would just say its too early for us to start talking about right now We would have a lot of flexibility as we enter thats part of how we designed the program to kind of maximize that flexibility So working down DUCs could be an option but as of right now we dont have to decide thats exactly what were going to do All right Good morning folks My first question was on the Delaware Basin I saw your acreage position is down to acres it was acres Can you explain was that just kind of a farmin that you decided not to do I mean I guess kind of is that a solid number like can we see that acreage position decrease at any point Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Thats a combination of some acres were letting expire at the same time were adding acres So some of the deals weve done weve gotten some really good acres with some really bad acres and so well just let those drop off and well keep trying to bolton around the good acres So that number will be in flux Okay Okay Okay And then I had a question on kind of the DDA guidance that you gave Q came in sharply lower Youre guiding continued reductions I know David talked about kind of the reserves and development costs driving that lower Is there anything else because it is a really big reduction or was it just those two items David L Pitts Chief Financial Officer Vice President Its just those two items Its about of the beat versus guidance was attributable to higher than expected reserve adds in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And the other was lower than expected future lower costs Okay Okay Thanks And then one last quick one more efficiencies from your Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>rigs just going from I guess wells a month to wells on the margin Is that pushing your well costs down a little bit or is that kind of how impactful is that to the cost that latest improvement John Bradley Fisher Chief Operating Officer Vice President Tim this is Brad Fisher Really were just talking about the spread rate including and our spread rate runs probably a day So if we cut a day or two days off its per well to per well Jeff S Grampp Northland Capital Markets Good morning guys Wanted to go back to the initial Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well and maybe ask the question a little differently And understanding its still early and hard to project an EUR with any confidence But comparatively kind of based on how the wells trending right now how do you think the economics are going to compare to your Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>If say for example you were to plot it on that bar chart where you guys kind of lay out your breakeven economics by your lease area Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development This is Andy Agosto again It is still too early The comments that Chip made about it behaving independently from the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>thats really been the only conclusive data we can glean And thats a combination of just kind of the trajectory on the oil production what the water production looks like some of these things like that So the comments that Chip made so far are those that we feel really confident And the economics its not going to be as good as our best Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I think thats clear from the numbers but beyond that we need some more time Jeff S Grampp Northland Capital Markets Okay Fair enough And then maybe hoping to get maybe a little bit of an update on Biovert I know I think last quarter you guys had said that given that you guys choked the wells back it was impossible to really indicate any meaningful production uplift There was a few more months of production data here Has there been anything else you guys have been able to glean on these Bioverts early on here John Bradley Fisher Chief Operating Officer Vice President Jeff this is Brad Fisher I think were going to stick with what we said last time I mean were seeing a definite increase in the overall energy that the reservoirs delivering But once again I think were pretty consistent and not releasing a lot of data until we have a strong production decline support behind that I mean the results have been positive The energy is a function is a driver of how many reserves we get out But wed like to see a little bit more data before we comment anything beyond an increase in energy Jeff S Grampp Northland Capital Markets Okay And then last one for me just on that second Wolfcamp well you guys did around the faulting Have you guys been able to identify maybe how much of your net acreage position is kind of at risk or maybe too close to that fault where youre going to see that higher water cut Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director We havent disclosed it but I think in one nine section area we thought that there was one section we wouldnt be able to drill Comes from the line of Michael Rowe with TPH Please go ahead Michael J Rowe Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Good morning I was just wondering if you can make a comment about the Mustang State well and what it was about that foot of lateral in the heel that makes you think it was treated more effectively Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I guess the results are why we think it was more effective We got more oil and gas and less water And we pumped the jobs on both ends of the well But this obviously was more effective We made more oil out of feet than out of the entire well Michael J Rowe Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Okay I was more just trying to understand if theres something with the completion design that you all feel like you can change to try to improve on results or how do you all sit with the completion design as it sits today Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I think that we would say that on the Liberator well that were testing now we basically used what we learned on the Mustang on that foot section Michael J Rowe Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Okay And then thats helpful Just one question on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Can you just talk a little bit about how the I guess if youre running a one rig to two rig program this year how spreadout that is across the acreage And if you roll into do you think that thered be any material shift in terms of where you would target development I know thats in the weeds but just kind of curious your thoughts on where youll spread out across the acreage position Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development This is Andy Agosto again Were in a to price world Obviously if you look at our breakeven chart were going to push the activity to the lower breakeven areas That said we do have lease obligations you know theyre modest but we do have some in those areas where were going to be required to either grow wells or buy some extensions So I dont think we have a detailed schedule through the entire year But your perception that yeah we may shift more to the lower breakeven inventory is correct John Bradley Fisher Chief Operating Officer Vice President And Michael Id then just kind of echo something Chip mentioned over of our inventory is in those lower breakeven areas So we have a lot of running room even if that was the only thing we elected to drill The next question comes from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets Please go ahead Daniel Eugene McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Thank you and good morning Just to clarify or followup on that last question how much of the companys Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>drilling inventory is economical at per barrel or lower I know you quantified it based on per barrel in the press release Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I cant even remember whats on the slide probably David L Pitts Chief Financial Officer Vice President Yeah Id refer you back to the presentation on that Dan I mean I think the truth of the matter is very little in this industry is economical below a barrel I mean if were really counting all the costs Daniel Eugene McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Right I concur Great And maybe a followup here just broadly here an another MArelated question Is Carrizo more likely to come out of the downturn a bigger company acreagewise or one thats maybe the same size or even smaller considering asset divestitures David L Pitts Chief Financial Officer Vice President I think we would like to come out at about the same size with the highest possible quality acreage Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah I think were going to be in a situation because of our balance sheet that were going to be able to rearrange our portfolio and make it better But were not just trying to get smaller to raise money I think if were going to sell something were basically still thinking were going to use those proceeds to buy something Daniel Eugene McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Okay And just following up on that on your answer then Chip where is the greatest opportunity to add leasehold thats accretive in quality and maybe would lower the economic limit of the overall asset portfolio Is that South Texas or West Texas Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Id say its about the same but were just still so early in West Texas that were not willing to make a huge bet out there I think our West Texas strategy will be the farmin approach That seems to be working The majors still seem to be interested in doling out little pieces of acreage that we can drill to hold bigger things for them And thats a better way for us to invest until we know exactly what were doing out there The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>where we are is pretty well understood I think we know the economics of just about every part of the play now so thats a little easier for us to evaluate and possibly make bigger bets on Daniel Eugene McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Great And lastly here just appreciating liquidity is still abundant and leverage relatively low can you rank capitalraising options maybe from most likely to least likely absent an acquisition talking about equity talking about outright asset divestures to JVs Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director No what we always say is that we have a lot of tools in our toolbox here We can sell assets We could sell equity We can hedge Well look at all of those Were flexible But right now were in really good shape for and I think were starting to get the hedges in place for We have a huge amount of liquidity great capital efficiency with our drilling So were in a good spot and we really dont have to do anything Daniel Eugene McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Very good Thanks again Have a great day The next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice Company Please go ahead Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Morning Chip A quick question on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the spacing If you look at the staggerstack tests in your testing from feet to feet if you break down your acreage are there particular areas that you think are more likely to be more apt to be on a foot versus foot And what are some of those factors that make it such Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development Hi This is Andy Agosto Those are exactly the kind of things were trying to figure out right now and it is why weve been pretty consistent in saying we need some more time But I think youre absolutely right in saying that one size may not fit all depending upon where you are across our acreage position But those are the kinds of questions were trying to answer right now Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC And are the staggerstacks spread across your acreage in a position to test Are there three staggerstack tests designed on the three the foot foot and foot spacing or is there still more testing or are they more centered around one particular staggerstack pattern Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development Were in I think if your question was geographically are they all in the same spot No And then weve got as I mentioned a couple of other staggers well bring online here in the next few months that are also in a different geographic location across the acreage Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Ron asking about the spacing the two pads we have on the longest we have those production history on them right now Were testing three different orientations of lateral spacing So were trying to test from the feet to feet I dont think you can say theyre focused on one of those specific spacings Right now were really just trying to understand whats the right way to move forward Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC That was a part of my question Thanks Jeff And then just to follow up on I think it was one of Michaels questions earlier about the Mustang well You look at the remaining plus feet of lateral behind the packer and the relative contribution of the lateral near the heel From a completion design standpoint was there something potentially about what happened in terms of the lateral placement in the back half of the lateral or do you think youve got greater frac height in the back half of the lateral or is it just too early to tell Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I think in general its too early to tell but we fracked into water somehow So we think we know why But we need to put the Mustang well back on production once the gas plants in place and produce it longer to see what kind of well we really have Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Michael Kelly Seaport Global Securities LLC Hey guys Good morning Ill fire two at you here Any lingering gas takeaway issues in the Delaware post this plant blow up is number one And then number two just curious if its logistically impossible or at least impractical to in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to hand back the rigs and just blow down the DUC inventory count from to zero in an effort to boost capital efficiency Thanks Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I guess first on the gas side the plant that caught fire will be back in business as long as you have the right kind of gas which we do So that should happen I think the last time we talked to them it was April Theres also another gathering system going into our Southeast and there is a Regency system already in place So there are three options or will be pretty shortly But we dont see that as being a longterm issue If we can do that well be able to get those wells back online Well have to flare the Liberator for a while because we cant put that online I dont think until April But well flare that until we have some good tests As far as the DUCs we have longterm contracts on those drilling rigs so we cant walk away from them Were going to be spending that capital anyway I guess if prices kept dropping at some point we might consider that but right now were not except for short periods of time this year Good morning Just a couple of housekeeping questions for me First what should we be using for capitalized costs for Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Hey John We dont provide guidance on cap interest and cap GA if thats what youre asking for But if you circle up with me after the close I can kind of tell you what theyve been running and you can just sort of use that going forward Okay Fair enough And then second the K I think shows or indicates I think about net acres to net acres of Delaware Basin leasehold expires by yearend How should we be thinking about either the drilling or capital requirements to retain that acreage Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director A lot of that weve already starting talking about extensions with the landowners Well probably let some of it expire A part of it had to do with the farmout we did last year and were evaluating whether were going to drill more wells on that farmout or not but we probably will So thats why we said we might shift some capital from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to the Permian as long as we think the metrics for the capital efficiency are just as good With regards to the extensions any sort of bucket how we should think about what that capital number would be Number of wells that would be needed Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah weve for instance on the Utica we started doing that too and weve seen pretty good response from the landowners for dropping their price quite a bit as long as we go to shorter leases And that might be what we do in the Delaware also Fair enough And then just checking on your last comment about the Liberator well so should we be anticipating Liberator results on the Q call or is there still the potential for is that still up in the air as to kind of when you would have results for that well Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Hey John Its Jeff The Delaware Basin is kind of a different beast And you typically dont get your peak day rates in the first days of production So when we have a peak day rate on that well likely disclose it Eli Kantor IBERIA Capital Partners LLC Hey Good morning guys What quantity of Marcellus volumes were curtailed in the fourth quarter And what quantity of volumes of curtailments you have modeled into guidance Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Eli I mean we dont typically give guidance on the quantity of volumes we have curtailed I would just say that we think we could produce at a materially higher rate than what we produced in the fourth quarter And I think if you look at the guidance for it implies more curtailments than what we had in the fourth quarter of a year And if you want to think about it throughout the year were probably assuming that gas prices will be worse in the second and third quarters than they are in the first quarter and fourth quarter So wed probably have a larger curtailment built into the guidance in those two quarters than we do in the winter quarters Eli Kantor IBERIA Capital Partners LLC Okay Fair enough It looks like you guys added some oil hedges in the first half of Just trying to get a sense of your highlevel outlook for the price of oil Maybe a better question at what point do you kind of hit the brakes and wait for rebound in crude prices Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director I think we need to be fully hedged a year out So thats why we started putting those on in the first half Well probably put some more on in the first half As we get further into this half well start looking at third quarter and fourth quarter But there have been some positive announcements out of OPEC and Russia that gets the market all excited But it has been positive at least people are talking So I dont think we want to hedge too far out too fast And weve been able to be opportunistic on hedging and catch some of these upticks and add a little bit in and a little bit more And that way were able to manage what were going to do next year Eli Kantor IBERIA Capital Partners LLC And that goal to be totally hedged a year out thats price agnostic Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director Well its price agnostic on whats the best we can do right now So if were at crude in the second half of this year well be hedging the second half of hopefully at hedges So we generally like to be to hedged And our banks like us to be to hedged We do have a followup question coming from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice Company Please go ahead Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Just a quick followup on that hedging question In terms of hedging strategy if you look at the first half of as you said a little bit over were those straight swaps or how did you achieve that kind of price David L Pitts Chief Financial Officer Vice President Ron this is David Pitts Those were enhanced swaps Youll see in the detail of our derivative contracts included in the press release We sold some natural gas call options in order to achieve those enhanced swap prices of per barrel Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Okay Ill look at the details Thank you David Sylvester P Chip Johnson IV President Chief Executive Officer Director All right Thanks again for calling in We thought we had an extremely good quarter at the end of an outstanding year where we kind of nimbly adjusted to the commodity prices and changed what we were doing and put some hedges in place and put ourselves in a good position this year So it helps that were in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with the lowest breakeven cost that some thirdparty analysts think exist And were in the right part of that play So with that we should have some news going into the second quarter on staggerstacking and possibly on the Liberator well in the Delaware Basin So well be back in days Thanks for calling in Ladies and gentlemen
