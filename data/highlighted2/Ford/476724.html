Automakers Suggesting It Is About To Get Real First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index ETF NASDAQCARZ Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F issued a stark warning last week when reporting secondquarter earnings On its conference call CFO Bob Shanks used the word plateau in relation to the possible trajectory of Fords sales later in the year The company remained committed to its profit targets despite what it says are now increased risks that extend beyond Fordspecific conditions Fords results reflected some Fordspecific problems like the Super Duty launch But its warnings about US sales could dampen the whole industry Fords Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said after an unprecedented growth streak the US market is starting to plateau Pretax results in the region fell percent to billion Indeed the word plateau apparently struck a chord with auto commentary It has been used repeatedly this week as sales numbers for the month of July once again underwhelm GMs NYSE GM total July sales were down nearly Toyota NYSE TM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Offsetting the new Big were Honda NYSE HMC Hyundai OTCHYMPY and Mercedes OTCPKDDAIY so that overall total unit sales were slightly positive year over year in July It isnt just the one month however as this extends a trend that has been building all year As the Wall Street Journal notes Sales for the top three auto makers selling in the US slipped in July as the strong growth rate that defined the past six years slows to a crawl another indication the industry is entering its first sustained plateau since the decade leading to the financial crisis For the seven months yeartodate through and including the tepid pace in July total auto units sold in were only more than the first seven months of This is not just a problem for automakers which suggests why the more benignsounding plateau has been suddenly attached in a widespread fashion The auto industrys recovery has been a bright spot for the US economy with high factory utilization spurring new jobs investment in American facilities and wage growth for Detroits auto workers Car buyers spent billion on light vehicles in July according to TrueCar Inc up amid longer loan terms and a boom in subsidized auto leasestrends that keep monthly payments on par with a decade ago even as sticker prices go up Overall retail sales are a trouble spot as purchases made by individual customers in showrooms have stalled this year down slightly for the first seven months according to JD Power Auto makers are betting sales to government agencies rentalcar firms and commercial fleets will continue to grow Fleet sales are far less profitable but more importantly the narrative about the strong consumer can only be discarded if consumers have suddenly become less interested in auto purchases mainly leases in We must imagine then what effect the introduction of auto problems might have upon the already sustained manufacturing recession In other words until this year manufacturing sales and factory orders have been regularly contracting even though auto sales and production remained robust as WSJ points out as the lone bright spot for the US economy According to the Feds industrial production estimates through June motor vehicle assemblies the IP proxy for domestic auto production regardless of manufacturer have to this point been just slightly pushed off trend So far the slowdown in assemblies has been rather muted but still noticeable The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimate for total vehicle sales fell sharply to million in June mostly due to the unfolding disaster in heavy trucks manufacturing recession simply means fewer goods moving around and fewer new trucks needed to move them The plateau especially in retail consumerdriven autos and perhaps light trucks suggests that this trend will only get worse And this is all beginning to hit as last years surge in especially wholesale inventory of autos not in the retail showroom stock remains at levels only seen during the Great Recession Because the current overall economic conditions are unique economic data series require a greater level of scrutiny and thus corroboration in order to provide a basis for sound judgment and analysis Unlike certain data points provided by government agencies that are more statistic than data Fords GMs and Toyotas figures and outlooks are actual physical results and dollars If this plateau is actually materializing and it does look that way it adds greater weight and emphasis to those struggles many times revealed by revision we do find in the more statistical statistics In other words the pile up of inventory is quite likely real and to the degree to which it is already suggested and due in some major part to sales not just hugely optimistic overproduction In macroeconomic terms it further erodes the mainstream idea of the strong consumer particularly in comparison to last year which left the economy in a very precarious state despite the far more robust actual consumer demand for autos and I should point out auto financing For future considerations the plateau plus a real inventory problem would suggest further that the manufacturing recession may be about to get real Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade
