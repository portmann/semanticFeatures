</span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor released US November sales on Tuesday Fords sales release was defined by growing average transaction prices and strong SUV demand What a year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F The auto company has had one of the best sales years in a decade and saw its new F aluminumbodied truck fly off the lots yet investors still refuse to reward the company for its performance with a higher share price Sometimes the stock market is weirdFords stock has done nothing for investors this year Shares are down yeartodate Even when factoring in the companys dividend investors didnt make it into the black this year Fords disappointing performance in terms of stock performance that is has led me to reduce my return expectations for Fords stock in November I have a month price target of on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock and have now restructured my investment in the auto company While I previously held a warrant position with a strike price of and an expiry date of January I have now swapped the warrants for the common stock Why Simple Because I have to consider the options time value and because investors dont have much love for the auto company right now As a result it made sense for me to derisk my portfolio and buy the common stock in order to be able to pocket at least a dividend Does anybody really care about Fords November sales I dont think so My longterm outlook on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is bullish though simply because the company continues to grow sales At the end of the day thats all that matters If customers like your products they will buy them and will also come back later for followup purchases Fords November sales for instance which the company released on Tuesday showed that the auto maker is on the right track While total US November sales were up only YY Fords management nonetheless could present sales figures with its head held high In November <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor sold vehicles as compared to vehicles

lower incentive spending and strong model series mix in November boosted average transaction prices versus yearago levels the largest gain among any major automaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cars SUVs and trucks all delivered higher transaction prices Though Fords investors have every reason to be optimistic I expect the stock to chug along with the market with neither significant upside or downside With the common stock replacing the warrants in my portfolio however the dividend is nothing to scoff at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is in a good position to continue to grow sales in the United States Customers clearly love Fords cars otherwise FSeries retail sales wouldnt continue to surge and selling higherpriced cars will translate into margin improvements and hence higher earnings in Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock affords investors with a high margin of safety since it sells for less than eight times earnings It is probably best to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor for what it really is A growing auto behemoth whose stock produces a
