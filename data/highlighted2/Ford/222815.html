campaigns have yielded better results than traditional photo campaigns We expect to see continued growth in global Internet penetration driven by urbanization and smartphone adoption in developing economies and this will ensure continued MAU growth especially in APAC Throwing a x multiple on our E nonGAAP EPS of gets us a oneyear price target of Our year DCF with unlevered free cash flows and a WACC discount rate yields a fair value of and we believe shares will trend toward that price postearnings We are going long Facebook NASDAQ FB into earnings The options market is pricing in a move in shares in either direction following earnings and our sentiment sides with a significant move upward We think the fair value of shares is so we believe that offers good value for investors on the longside despite shares being up more than this year We also believe Instagram plus video ads will propel a strong Q ER Throwing a x multiple on our E nonGAAP EPS of gets us a oneyear price target of The valuation isnt absurd against the backdrop of other highgrowth tech stocks like Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and we believe the stock has healthy upside potential into and after earnings We have previously discussed why Instagram equips Facebook with a potential billionplus revenue business by At the time of our previous report on Instagram Piper Jaffrays Spring Taking Stock with Teens Survey showed of US teens rated Instagram as the most important social media platform good enough to make it the most popular social media platform among teens in the US Piper Jaffrays Fall Taking Stock with Teens Survey showed that Instagram has slightly gained mind share since then with of US teens rating Instagram the most important This is percentage points better than the second most popular social media app Twitter NYSE TWTR Concurrently Facebook although in a sputter since the fall of did gain mind share from the Spring to the Fall of Although Snapchat is the fastest growing social media platform according to Piper Jaffray Instagram was the fastest growing social media platform from to among online adults roughly doubling adult audience penetration in that time frame In response to ceding the fastestgrowing title to Snapchat Instagram recently debuted its own momentcapturing video feature which bears a high resemblance to Snapchat While the new feature isnt a doitall Snapchat replacement it does lessen the necessity for Instagram users to use Snapchat Several analysts expect video ads to energize Facebook Q earnings In the quarter Facebook boosted its video ad platforms creating new ad formats and ad buying options Facebook also enhanced its video ads targeting capabilities We see targeted video ads as being a strong driver of ARPU growth over the next years as we feel there is a great deal of content that still needs to shift to digital ad spend Video campaigns are proving more successful than traditional photo campaigns and we believe a good deal of digital ad spend growth will be driven by video ads Because of the more successful results we believe Facebook will be able to continue to hike prices for targeted video ad campaigns propelling ARPU growth On Facebooks Success Stories page one can view all the companies that have run successful video ad campaigns Heineken teamed up with Neil Patrick Harris on a Facebook video ad campaign which only cost the company per view and reached of its target audience while growing brand awareness in only three days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F ran a soccerthemed mobile video ad campaign through Facebook targeting a Hispanic audience during the summer of The ad reached of all US Hispanics aged or older had a x higher clickthroughrate than the average Facebook automotive campaign and a video completion rate Las Vegas tourism videos garnered million total views on Instagram and Facebook while startup financial services company Acorns acquired of its investors through a Facebook video ads campaign Ludia Games ran a Facebook video ad campaign for Jurassic World The Game and the campaign resulted in higher yield for video ads than photo ads with a lower CPM From billiondollar automotive firms to startups to niche mobile gaming companies Facebook video ad campaigns have greater value and yield better results for advertisers than traditional advertising campaigns We believe Facebook can energize advertiser enthusiasm through these video ads capitalizing of a digital ad spend shift while charging a premium for targeted video ad optionality Because of this we see video ads propelling strong ARPU growth over the next years Facebook has a clean balance sheet that has a lot of strength and actually eases high valuation concerns The company has billion in current assets on billion in current liabilities giving the company healthy liquidity and working capital of billion The company has total liabilities of billion giving Facebook a NCAV of billion Cash and marketable securities totaled billion MRQ while debt totaled million giving the company net cash MRQ of billion Stockholders equity totaled billion MRQ Using a billion marketcap Facebook is trading at x WC x NCAV x net cash and x book value While these multiples are higher than normal we believe they are actually attractive multiples for a stock with highgrowth potential like FB When actually considering Facebooks valuation we are not deterred by it relative to other highgrowth comps For our analysis we take the FANG group to understand Facebooks multiples Facebook is more cheaply priced than Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and NFLX Netflix from a PE standpoint both forward and trailing while its more expensive than Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL from both metrics On a PFCF basis Facebook is trading at only a slightly richer valuation than Amazon a company that is inconsistently profitable and whose valuation is driven by a negative cash conversion cycle which fuels strong cash flow Facebook has a profit margin that rivals Alphabets profit margin and is much higher than Netflix and Amazons profit margins Moreover Facebook has had the fastest growing revenues in the FANG group for the past two years FB Profit Margin TTM data by YCharts All things considered we actually do not believe Facebooks valuation is a deterrent at these levels We believe that if anything Facebooks fundamentals and growth support a much higher valuation We believe longterm MAU growth will be driven by higher global internet penetration Higher global internet penetration will in turn be fueled by urbanization and increased smartphone adoption A growing percentage of the global population has access to the Internet Whereas the world population is growing at just over a CAGR since the global Internet population has grown at a CAGR in that same time frame In global Internet penetration was merely By that number had more than doubled to and now stands at representing about a basis point increase per year since We expect to see continued growth in global Internet penetration driven by urbanization and smartphone adoption in developing economies Adoption of the iPhone s and Plus has been surprisingly strong and urbanization is rapidly occurring on a global basis In roughly of the worlds population lived in urban areas and the global urban mix is expected to increase to by Studies show that urbanization coupled with global population growth will mean an extra billion people living in urban areas by Roughly of that growth will be attributed to Asia and Africa This urbanization of formerly rural areas will bolster the global Internet penetration rate as many formerly nonInternet users will now have access to the Internet For these reasons we expect to see continued strong Facebook MAU growth in Europe APAC and the rest of the world Due to falling off popularity of Facebook among US millennials per the Piper Jaffray survey we do not see Facebook drastically growing mind share in the US We believe our worldwide MAU projections fall inline with our qualitative sentiment that Facebook should continue to garner more market share In roughly of the worlds Internet population used Facebook By Facebooks global Internet market share had grown to We believe global Internet penetration can grow to basis points per year into down from basis points per year from to and we see the global Internet penetration rate being in and in Using UN population estimates this equates to roughly billion Internet users in and billion Internet users in Our worldwide MAU estimates put Facebooks market share at and in and respectively We believe this is consistent with Facebooks current growing market share trend As discussed earlier we believe targeted video ad campaigns will enable Facebook to charge more for advertising space and drive healthy ARPU growth especially in Europe and APAC where ARPU is still markedly lower We see US and Canada ARPU growing healthily into driven by high demand for Facebook video ads but believe ARPU growth will slow as price saturation occurs We see the same slowing happening in Europe and APAC into but believe those growth rates will be higher as ARPU is dramatically lower in those geographies than domestically Facebook defines ARPU as the total revenue during the period divided by the average of MAUs at the end of the period and MAUs at the beginning of the period Using our ARPU and MAU forecasts above we can create a full year Facebook revenue forecast model This model can be seen below We see the Facebook platform alone netting billion in worldwide revenues by with US and Canada Europe and APAC contributing roughly billion each and the rest of the world contributing billion Considering the global mobile advertising market will be just under billion in and the global ad market is set to top billion this year we believe our target for billion in revenues by is reasonable Facebook platform only As previously discussed we believe Instagram will add billions of dollars in revenue to the Facebook business We see Instagram adding billion in revenues and billion in revenues We believe Instagram will grow quickly into a billion revenue business by many analysts are looking for billion and then grow more or less inline with Facebook ad revenues We see Instagram netting billion in revenues by This is driven by strong millennial adoption user scale and a shift to digital ad spend For our model we assume no other forms of monetization ie no revenue from WhatsApp Under these assumptions we believe net revenue for will be billion above the consensus for billion but below the high estimate of billion We expect net revenues to be billion by and billion by Higher GAAP expenses this year are being driven by stockbased compensation and amortization expenses related to WhatsApp and other acquisitions and considering the terms of the billion WhatsApp deal included million shares of Class A common stock at a quote that is roughly billion we do not see stockbased comp easing on margins in the near future Management is guiding for to billion in stock comp with roughly half of that from the WhatsApp deal At billion per year in stock comp toward the WhatsApp deal Facebooks stock compensation will likely not ease until after Margins also are being weakened by FX headwinds and we believe these are nonterminal headwinds As these ease in the coming years we believe operating margins should expand back to a rate We model for a taxrate FB Operating Margin TTM data by YCharts Because Facebook reports and trades off of nonGAAP EPS we reconcile our net income to nonGAAP using the following reconciliation which is driven largely by stock comp and amortization Our model calls for nonGAAP E EPS of This is markedly higher than the consensus outlook for but shy of the high estimate for We believe nonGAAP EPS will grow at a CAGR into We apply a x multiple to our nonGAAP E EPS of to arrive at a price target for shares of FB FBs current trailing PE multiple of x is a premium to the markets x PE multiple but FB is trading at x forward earnings We believe that if Facebook can beat estimates and ramp up Instagram revenue the way we expect them to then the market will reward FB with a higher multiple We believe a x multiple is fair for a stock that has monetization potential beyond the billion we expect by To arrive at a fair value for shares of FB we use a year DCF with unlevered free cash flows and a WACC discount rate Many of our assumptions for this model have already been explained in our earnings model but herein we expect depreciation and amortization to be around of a capex that we expect to be roughly billion per year which will support a more complex data center network and server infrastructure We believe shares of FB are worth today Using CAPM as a guide we arrive at a cost equity of The company has only million debt vs a diluted market cap of billion so the WACC is byandlarge the cost of equity We assume a neutral sentiment FCFF perpetuity rate to arrive at an enterprise value of billion Adding in MRQ net cash of billion we arrive at a fair value billion On a diluted share count of billion this equates to fair value just shy of per share We believe increased digital ad spend a boosted video ads platform and Instagram monetization will fuel a strong Q ER Given our fair value analysis and the action in the options market we believe shares of Facebook are ready to trend toward postearnings We see shares trending toward in a oneyear window Our model importantly does not include potential revenues from WhatsApp but does include GAAP expenses such as amortization and stock comp from the WhatsApp deal Therefore if Facebook monetizes WhatsApp successfully the fair value of FB shares will be north of For now though we feel it appropriate to model as we have it and affirm a fair value We only use your contact details to reply to your request
