Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in F over the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article The major US automaker stocks continue to fall as investors are panicked about peak car sales I believe the overwhelming pessimism has gone too far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still growing sales in the US and future growth potential is alive and well in the international markets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors will receive a dividend this year thereafter and the stock trades for a PE <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock is a tantalizing investment for value and income To say that was a frustrating for the US automaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM would be putting it mildly Over the past year both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM stocks have not performed well They are each in the red and both badly lagged behind the broader market Their underperformance is even more confusing when you consider the fundamental tailwinds each company had coming into And in truth they dideach company posted strong sales and earnings last year Still investors couldnt care less about their success Instead investors are focusing on the troubles that may come to pass up ahead The market is deeply discounting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM on fears that peak auto sales have passed and that a looming global recession will cause their earnings to significantly deteriorate But thats simply not rational Both automakers and particularly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are very attractive picks for both value and income If and when the market comes to its senses their valuations should be much higher than where they are today Automakers Have the Wind at Their Backs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM were supposed to benefit from low gas prices low interest rates and the gradual US economic recovery Oil is at per barrel and AAA reports US gas prices recently fell below a gallon on average for the first time since In addition while the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month interest rates remain extremely low in the US and are likely to only rise from here at a very gradual pace Lastly two of the biggest indicators of car salesthe housing and labor marketscontinue to improve These are all very positive data points for automakers As a result Fords fundamentals are improving as well Total car sales in the US rose by last year In particular the FSeries pickup truck continues to dominate its peer group In December the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>FSeries sold more than vehicles for the first time in a decade The FSeries has been Americas bestselling vehicle for the past years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also seeing success in sport utility vehicles due largely to low gas prices Fords SUV sales rose last month led by the Escape Edge and Explorer models making it the best December for SUV sales since This has all had a great effect on Fords earnings Over the first nine months of earnings per share grew from the same period the year before For the full year pretax profit is expected to come in at the top end of the billion billion range That would set a new record for the company For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects pretax profit operating earnings per share and revenue to be comparable with or higher than levels so its hard to see what all the negativity is about While investors are panicking about the slowdown in the emerging markets I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still has a fantastic future growth catalyst to support earnings going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is just scratching the surface on growth potential in emerging markets like China Last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>earned a million pretax profit in the AsiaPacific region And its profitability in mature markets like Europe is rapidly improving Fords European vehicle sales rose in far better than the industry average of growth in Europe Fords stock has punished investors over the past year Going forward the good news is that investors have a great buying opportunity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock trades for just times earnings and offers a regular common stock dividend These are very attractive levels on a historical basis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is cheaper than it has been and offers a higher dividend yield than at any point in the past five yearsand by a wide margin Fords dividend is a manageable of trailing earnings so absent another worldwide financial crisis I think the dividend is sustainable and can actually rise in future years as Fords earnings grow Even better Fords recently declared per share special dividend takes its effective dividend yield up to this year and thereafter Even when assuming no further dividend growth from here investors can generate a high yield on cost simply from reinvesting those dividends Of course if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>manages to increase its dividend at any point in that time which I view as highly likely then the yield on cost will be even higher Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM are interesting value and income plays for their low PE ratios and high dividend yields Of the two I prefer Fordit continues to hold the bestselling vehicle in the US for nearly three decades and GMs consumer image took a big hit from the recall scandal that still lingers today I also see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as the stronger company across several models including both pickups and SUVs two of the major beneficiaries of low gas prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock is at a point of maximum negativity Some may avoid the stock because of this out of fear of further declines but value and income investors should see this as a buying opportunity Disclaimer This article represents the opinion of the author who is not a
