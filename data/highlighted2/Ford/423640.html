sales fell a notsosurprising in May The headline for those unprepared may have been a shock but when you factor in the loss of an entire calendar weekend the numbers are not so bad Due to calendar shifts the May included full weekends with Memorial day falling on the th weekend In May had only weekends with Memorial Day falling on the last Considering that weekends are the top selling days for the entire auto industry and that the final weekend of a month the strongest of all it makes sense that sales data would be affected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F sales in May also fell in line with the broader industry due to slowing sales in passenger vehicles A shift in mix however resulted in a jump in May truck sales YTD the best May for Van sales in years a

#A9E2F3'>Ford </span>execs stated that labor trends are supporting auto sales Byan Bezold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Senior Economist From the conference call transcript US economic conditions particularly the household sector remained broadly supportive of industry sales at the current run rate Todate the labor market continues its gradual recovery producing both job and income gains for households The May NFP numbers may call that into question but really that number is extremely flawed and does not quite jibe with ALL the other data For one the NFP margin of error is This means the average number of new jobs over the past year roughly could be anywhere from to That being said job creation is important but not the only thing driving labor markets Additionally there is talk that an increase in productivity during the quarter could be hampering new hires if productivity increases new laborers are not needed for growth As for the other labor data job openings and hires are trending at all time highs total claims for unemployment are trending near historic lows average hourly earnings are up over the past year the quits rate is running at historic highs led by construction workers and together equal a positively trending KCF Labor Market Conditions Index For those of you unfamiliar with the KCF LMCI it is an aggregate of labor market indicators used by the Fed to judge the labor market It has moved above in recent months the first time since before the housing crisis and is indicating economic boom on the horizon The analysts see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>earnings and revenue on the rise as well Since the last earnings release estimates for the current quarter the full year and next year have risen The only negative I can see is that next quarter estimates have fallen but not enough to hurt Current quarter estimates have risen over the past days full year estimates are up Next year estimates are up On a year over year basis these estimates equal a increase over and another in Looking to fullyear estimates the low of analysts is still a gain over with the high of a increase over Analyst price targets are also promising The median estimate of is a increase over current share prices The mean estimate of is a gain Based on PE the stock is also undervalued The stock tends to trade in a range between X and X earnings and at current levels is about X last years earnings and about X next years earnings Simply bringing share price up so that forward PE matches trailing we could get a of gain if the stock moves up to the high end of the range forward or trailing PE could add or more to current prices Even with the rosy picture that sales and labor data paint there are some risks for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the entire industry One is the ridesharing economy Companies like Uber and Lyft are feared to cut into sales of new and used cars but studies have shown that more and more Millennials the primary users of these services want to own their own cars and that the majority of Americans will choose to own their own vehicle It is estimated that the number of Millennials who want their own vehicles has risen by over the past years from of demographic to about The expected impact of ridesharing is only about of sales per year Discounts are a growing concern for the entire industry Automakers are relying more and more on discounts and other incentives to drive sales and posted a increase in May alone Leases and fleet rentals are part and parcel to this issue March data shows that leases were about of all sales and are expected to have an impact on future sales as a glut of used cars hits the market Another is recalls <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has recently issued another recall due to brakemaster cylinder issues with the Fs but it is not likely to become a major problem This issue has been going on for many years and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>unlike GM has long recognized the value in addressing these problems as the potential costs of accidents are far greater than merely correcting troublesome parts Yet another and one that may be the most pressing is the record levels of consumer auto loans on the market According to Experian the total amount of auto debt in the market has topped trillion a record high Fueling this is a new high average loan above with record high payments above The average length of loans is months nearly years meaning a car bought today will not be paid off until mid The most alarming thing is that subprime is on the rise making the nature of the loans more risky for automakers as well as more expensive for consumers Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan NYSE JPM says the market is a little stretched and that someone is going to get hurt That someone will likely be the consumers as well as the automakers ifwhen the bubble bursts and debt shuts down the market Fords inventory may also be a concern especially if you are in the camp that sees economic slowdown on the horizon Inventory fell from April to May by but is up year over year by There are mitigating factors ramped up production with the new Aluminum bodied Fs is one and management expects to see sales volume increase into the second half of the year which will alleviate the issue The risk is that the economy will slow and sales will not pick up which would increase the need for incentives mark downs and other revenueeroding practices May sales figures were a bit of a disappointment if only on the headline but the year to date numbers and the forward outlook negate them If you believe in the strength of the US labor market prospects for economic growth and the positioning of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as I do the company is set to have another record breaking year and another one after that With that in mind valuation is low perhaps very low and leaves quite a bit of room for the stock to move higher Add in the dividend about at todays share prices and the chance of another special dividend at the end of this year owning this stock becomes a nobrainer Risks exist but when do they not when it comes to investing the risks with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are manageable and do not raise significant concern at this time I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company
