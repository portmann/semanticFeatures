Expect A Galactic Bump For Disneys Stock Price Upon Star Wars Release The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha Previous Star Wars films hardly if at all affected the stock price Disneys recent blockbusters did not move the needle for its stock price Episode VII could break every box office record but not do much for Disneys stock Star Wars is one of the biggest film franchises of all time The seventh film in the franchise is due to debut in December of this year This will be a blockbuster and the new owner of the franchise Disney NYSE DIS is taking full advantage of its name recognition by expanding the universe There are plans to debut an amusement park similar to that done for Harry Potter Episode VII will be Disneys first Star Wars film and the first not directed by creator George Lucas Disney has chosen director JJ Abrams for the project Abrams has been a box office success in directing a different longstanding science fiction franchise in Star Trek This comparison is especially effective due to them being the same genre and having a large builtin fan base Disney has an i ncreased gross profit margin for the current fiscal years fourth quarter compared to last years It has grown sales and net income faster than its competitors Over the past few years the company has maintained a solid stock price performance enjoyed a pattern of growth in earnings per share and good return on equity Low profit margins are concerning but DISs strengths are very strong Disney has more Star Wars films planned It plans to use the franchise to its full worth DIS has made two successful acquisitions recently in Pixar and Star Wars Already Pixar has begun paying off with the hit Inside Out When the Star Wars theme park debuts one should expect a large payoff However there is no timetable for completion The closest comparison we have is the Harry Potter theme park Theme parks have high operating costs and are subject to the economy but when the economy is strong it really pays off Harry Potters owner NBCUniversal NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK recorded million in operating cash flow last year a percent increase In a study it was shown that the variables most responsible for the success or failure of stock price are the script actors director advertising production budget competition and genre Episode VII is bringing back many of the important actors from the original trilogy Mark Hamill Harrison <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Carrie Fisher and Peter Mayhew It is also bringing in Academy Award nominated talent in Oscar Isaac Andy Serkis and Lupita Nyongo Weve already touched on the success of director JJ Abrams The two trailers that have been released have broken records for the most watched within hours DIS is using a strategy similar to that of Abrams Super in that the promosare notable for what they tease not what they give away The Guardian The film will not have any direct competition in December as the other blockbuster being released is Hateful Eight an Rrated Quentin Tarantino film The genre of science fiction has the highest grossing film of all time in its cap with Avatar so the genre will not hinder anything Star Wars Star Trek and Abrams Box Office History As you can see in Figure the biggest film was Episode I This was the first Star Wars film released in years and the first of the prequels Its fair to assume that Episode VII the first Star Wars film in years will receive a new show bump Despite being a sequel this is the beginning of yet another trilogy There is great anticipation for this film for many reasons Abrams success being one and the return to practical props rather than CGI being another Another reason to expect a big box office number is to compare the Star Trek box office numbers Abrams filmed the two most recent installments to the series They have both more than double the next closest box office results numbers The same jump should not necessarily be expected as the previous Star Trek films were neither heavily marketed nor financed but a major jump should be expected Abrams Star Trek films also received better critical acclaim than the previous Next Generation films After Star Wars released its second teaser trailer it started selling tickets for the release two months away It shattered the previous record held by Hunger Games eight times over These big box office numbers are promising until you look at the stock prices of th Century Fox NASDAQ FOX NASDAQ FOXA slightly before and slightly after the release of the past three Star Wars films There has not been a trend either way when reviewing Its surprising to see how the box office numbers do not positively affect the stock price We will examine Avengers Age of Ultron Inside Out and Ant Man Each film produced a slight gain in stock price after their release but they could also be attributed to Disneys stock trend The companys stock price has been gaining steadily over the past five years Buy Disney stock A big reason for the recent struggles in the stock is due to ESPNs membership drop The three previous Star Wars installments did not make much impact on the parent companys stock price Despite being the most anticipated film of the year there are not many reasons to believe it will be all that different with Disney at the helm Although the lack of a big Star Wars bump does not take away from Disney being a good buy We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to
