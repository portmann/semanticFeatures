Seeking Alpha Chevy Silverados sales have been very impressive in recent times thanks to rival Fs production issues Silverados market share has expanded in the past months at the expense of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>General Motors NYSE GM Chevrolet Silverado is the automakers topselling vehicle In the company sold units of the Silverado in the US which accounted for of total vehicles sold in the country The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F was occupied in retooling its key facilities for the F production in has been an important factor pushing Silverados sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>dealers werent sufficiently stocked with the FSeries giving Silverado room to grow Silverado sales volume is up in the first three months of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects to increase F supply in line with demand by late summer Can Silverado maintain its momentum going forward Will it too come up with an aluminum avatar Lets find out Chevy Silverados sales rose in compared with The year may be bifurcated into two halves Sales volume declined in the first half of compared with the same period previous year But the latter half was extremely impressive with volumes up over There are two reasons to it First GM took advantage of Fords FSeries production issue The temporary shutdown of Fords Dearborn and Kansas City plants held up the pickups production with an estimated loss of units The shutdown was necessary to reconfigure the manufacturing process for the new aluminumbodied F Silverado gained massively and its clearly reflected in sales numbers Second after keeping a strong pricing strategy all through GM made attractive offers to boost truck sales and expand market share before the launch of F As a result September sales jumped a stunning to units hitting its best number for the month since and gaining market share December was another blockbuster month for the pickup with sales surging to units In the pickups got off to an encouraging start registering sales of units in the JanuaryMarch period an increase of GMs not offered any incentives in this period Autoblog took spy shots of the next version of Silverado and believes many of the pickups parts such as the hood and front fenders could shift to aluminum The model is expected to be revealed later this year GM executives said a move toward aluminum surfaced in but the company abandoned the idea owing to cost issues amid market depression These discussions resurfaced in but company executives again raised cost concerns and focused on other facelift techniques But once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>revealed the aluminum pickup GM had to take a final call Early last year GM entered into a contract with Alcoa NYSE AA and Novelis for aluminum sheets to be used in nextgeneration pickups The demand for aluminum to make automotive bodies is so high that carmakers have to place orders years ahead All new aluminumbodied F Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fords F has received rave reviews and the demand is outstanding says company executive VP Joe Hinrichs The Blue Oval is ramping up production to keep up with the robust demand Hinrichs expects sales to be much stronger in the second half of after fleet production picks up Theres no doubt that Fords got a great head start but GM looks prepared too GMs tieup for aluminum and autoblog spy shots hint that the automakers heading toward an aluminumbodied Silverado With the allnew F the pickup market is heating up and GM is rebuilding strategies An aluminum body will also help it adhere to Federal fuel economy standards The F has shed around pounds thats boosted its fuel economy When it comes to pickups the FSeries Chevy Silverado and Dodge Ram are the dominant ones in the market The FSeries has been the topselling truck for almost four decades now and enjoyed a strong lead of more than over the next bestselling pickup the Silverado in However it should be noted that the Silverado and GMC Sierra together give a close battle to the FSeries and have even outsold the latter before January to March sales Note Units sold in the US only Data from wwwgoodcarbadcarnet Its difficult to say whether GM would be able to sustain the Silverados growth pace once the F rolls out in full force and dealers are properly stocked Conversely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may also face challenge in regaining the market share it lost during the transition period It might so happen that buyers that turned to the Silverado would like to continue with it in the future If Silverados upgrade later in the year is in aluminum it would make the pickup battle even more intense Results would be crucial as pickups carry high margins and are key profit generators for both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Even a slight change in market share would impact the automakers bottom lines Source Can GM Sustain Chevy Silverados Sales Momentum Once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fs Production Falls In
