Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter Comstock Resources Earnings Conference Call My name is Derek and Ill be your operator for today At this time all participants are in a listenonly mode We shall facilitate a questionandanswer session at the end of the conference As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer Mr Jay Allison You may proceed M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer Derek thank you Welcome to the Comstock Resources first quarter financial and operating results conference call everyone You can view a slide presentation during or after this call by going to our website at wwwcomstockresourcescom and downloading the quarterly results presentation There you will find a presentation titled First Quarter Results The highlight of this call really will not be the numbers we report today youve seen those but really the return of Mack Good as our Chief Operating Officer and his overview of the company and our position After year break Mack has returned to help us navigate through these difficult times with low commodity prices I am Jay Allison Chief Executive Officer of Comstock And with me this morning in addition to Mack is Rowland Burns our President and Chief Financial Officer During this call we will discuss our first quarter operating and financial results and our plan for the rest of this year If you go to slide two please turn to slide two in our presentation and note that our discussions today will include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of securities laws While we believe the expectations and such statements to be reasonable there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct Slide three is a quick overview of the first quarter where we saw the rapid fall of both oil and gas prices Without hedges in place we felt the full brunt of the rapid decline in oil and gas prices in the first quarter as our realized oil price fell by and our average realized natural gas price declined by The increase in oil production was not enough to overcome the low prices of our oil and gas sales fell by to million EBITDAX came in at million and cash flow from operations million or per share Our operations in the first quarter were focused on ramping up our oil drilling program and restarting our Haynesville shale program with improved completion designs Our first two extended lateral wells in Haynesville were very successful as both had IP rates in excess of million cubic feet per day as Mack will go over in detail in a few minutes Our first rig frac in a producing Haynesville Shale well was also successful and was featured in Schlumbergers earning call We expect to start growing our gas production again in the second quarter of this year In March we completed a million bond offering which paid off our bank credit facility and added liquidity to our balance sheet Our goal was to establish a fortress balance sheet to weather this down cycle We now have no debt maturities until and we have total liquidity of million at the end of the first quarter In order to safeguard our liquidity we have significantly reduced our drilling expenditures for the remainder of Ill have Roland review the financial results with you in more detail Roland Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP Thanks Jay On slide four we recap our oil production growth Our oil production averaged barrels per day in the first quarter an increase over the first quarter of last year With the rapid fall in oil prices we shut down our oil drilling program in late December We experienced some delays in completions planned for our East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>property in the first quarter and we had excessive downtime for offset fracs and artificial lift installation in the quarter which caused our oil production to decline from the fourth quarter rate of barrels per day With little drilling activity this year planned for our oil projects we expect oil production to decline further For all of were expecting oil production to average between to barrels per day Slide five shows our natural gas production which continued to decline in the first quarter of and was down from s first quarter Gas production in the first quarter averaged million cubic feet per day Our Haynesville production was down a little more than expected due to the delay in completing our first extended lateral well In addition we had to shut in some production in March while we completed our first two extended lateral Haynesville wells We expect the Haynesville to start drilling again in the second quarter For all of we expect our gas production will average million to million cubic feet per day On slide six we summarize the first quarter financial results The increase in oil production was not enough to offset the decrease in our gas production in the quarter This combined with lower oil prices and lower gas prices caused our revenues cash flow and EBITDAX to decline Revenues this quarter were down to million EBITDAX was down to million and cash flow from operations declined to million or per share Our lifting costs in the quarter were down with the lower sales However our DDA was up due to an increase in our DDA rate in the quarter Starting next quarter well see some benefit from our new Haynesville program which will help lower the DDA rate Our GA cost in the quarter were down to about million and we also had two significant accounting charges in the quarter We recorded a million impairment on our unevaluated properties for our southern Burleson County acreage due to poor drilling results We also had a charge of million included in exploration expense for payments made to release one of our operated rigs and a charge of million for the early retirement of our bank credit facility which was offset in part by a million gain on the repurchase of million of our unsecured bonds Including these charges we had a million loss or per share Excluding these items we would have a net loss of per share On slide seven we detail our capital expenditures in the first quarter We spent million on development and exploration activities not including the million we spent on acreage We also spent an additional million to release the operated rig before its contract term expired In the quarter we drilled five horizontal oil wells or four net to our interest two horizontal natural gas wells or two net to our interest We also put four South Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells and four East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells on production in the quarter In March we announced our plans to release another drilling rig and reduce our capital budgets to million which is detailed on slide eight We estimate that well spend million this year for drilling and completion activities million of that will be spent to drill Haynesville shale extended lateral wells and another million will be spent to refrac of our producing Haynesville wells We also budgeted million to finish drilling four wells on our East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale acreage that were in process at yearend and we budgeted million for completion cost of eight Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale wells that were drilled in but will be completed this year and million on facilities recompletions capital projects The spending was heavily weighted to the first quarter with almost half of the budget being spent in the first quarter Slide nine recaps our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter which includes the million bond offering we completed in March We have million of cash on hand and about billion of total debt outstanding Net debt represents of our total book capitalization We no longer have a bank facility that is limited to a borrowing base We do have a new million fouryear bank commitment that is not subject to reduction based on a borrowing base redetermination So our total liquidity at March was million We chose to do a larger bond offering due to definitions in our existing bond indentures which made a second lien facility in a borrowingbased bank credit facility for us This new structure removes any concerns over future reductions in borrowing capability for the company Our first debt maturities do not come until giving us a long runway to survive this down cycle Ill now hand it over to Mack Good who were very happy to have back at the helm of our operations during these difficult times Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Thanks a lot Roland Its good to be back And Ill tell you what if you work in the oil and gas business youre never bored Thats for sure Whats made my return a lot easier is the opportunity to work with all of the many talented people here at Comstock and we have a great team here and Im really proud pardon me Im really proud to be part of it Since coming back to the company diving into the things the first thing that hit me was all the economic opportunities we have within our East Texas and North Louisiana region And as everyone can see on slide we have net acres prospective for natural gas in both the Haynesville and Bossier shales This slide also shows that the acreage has Tcfe of total resource potential and that every bit of it is operated by Comstock Maybe some of you have seen this slide before Slide demonstrates the magnitude of the resource I think this was a good slide the first time we showed it and its even better now and Ill tell you why Its better now because we are very confident that given our current drilling and completion strategies we can take real advantage of economies of scale at the completion level By doing this we become much more efficient and costeffective in gaining production from our shale gas assets I know that in this first quarter we have proved this to be true to ourselves and our partners And in addition weve also identified numerous Haynesville wells that are excellent candidates for refrac So during the first quarter we implemented a refrac program that could add additional production and reserves from our producing Haynesville and Bossier wells going forward I know that many of you might wonder why we would go back to the Haynesville in this low price environment The reason is pretty simple Last year our technical team became convinced that the return profile of our typical Haynesville wells could be greatly improved by applying the newest drilling and completion technologies specifically extended laterals and larger stimulation treatments pumps across more stages and within certain pumping guidelines are very common in all the active shale plays today And using this approach our new Haynesville wells have to rate of returns at natural gas prices varying between to per Mcf Refracs of our existing wells have a rate of return that vary between to and natural gas price deck to So the Haynesville makes sense for us because we have an extensive inventory of drilling and recompletion opportunities that we can execute with positive economic benefit within a low price environment As evidence of these opportunities weve mapped over Haynesville locations on our acreage including with extended laterals And in addition we have plus Bossier locations including with extended laterals And last but not least our refrac program has identified approximately refrac candidates within our Haynesville and Bossier assets And we consider it a real benefit that our Haynesville gas is located within the premium gas market close to the Henry Hub Comstock unlike many of the other Haynesville operators is not burdened by expensive transportation obligations So because of this we can take advantage of a market with excess capacity Moving on to slide youll see the results of our first three Haynesville projects of this year All three are in our Logansport field area in DeSoto Parish Louisiana near the state line of Texas And let me give you some of the numbers We began the year by executing our first refrac of the Haynesville shale well during the first quarter of Following the refrac the Pace well in DeSoto Parish Louisiana had an initial production rate of million cubic feet per day which was an eightfold increase from its million per day production rate before the refrac Were currently producing this well at a stable rate of million cubic feet per day We also recently completed our first two new extended lateral wells using our new completion strategies and design The Pyle was drilled to a total vertical depth of feet with a foot lateral This well was tested with an initial production rate of million cubic feet per day which is a new company record for us The second well the Shahan was drilled to a total vertical depth of feet with a foot lateral and this well was tested at an initial rate of million cubic feet per day We have our third lateral well thats currently being completed A fourth well waiting on completion and were currently drilling our fifth extended lateral Haynesville well and all of these wells are in DeSoto Parish On slide we have a comparison of how our new extended lateral well design compares to the most common design that we and everyone else was using about five years ago And as with any business theres nothing that improves results like the development of better technology coming together with more and better evaluated information So based on current service costs our new design cost us between million to million to drill and complete Given all of our work and the results of our new wells we expect that our extended lateral wells will have ultimate recoveries approaching between Bcf to Bcf This compares to the Bcf to Bcf range that we previously obtained drilling and completing the shorter laterals with very similar DC costs So we expect an initial rate from our new wells in the Haynesville to average around million cubic feet per day with the new design that were fracking the wells with Slide shows the expected economics of the new Haynesville approach and the sensitivity to capital cost and gas price The program should generate a rate of return at an initial well cost of million and a NYMEX gas price As well as the well cost is reduced around million the program economics improve significantly delivering a rate of return at the same gas price And our goal is to do these jobs these new Haynesville wells at a million DC price Now move on from the Haynesville to our South Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>acreage Slide shows this acreage We currently have about net acres in the South Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>where we have drilled wells In the first quarter of we completed four wells net That were drilled last year and these wells had an average production rate per well approaching barrels of oil equivalent per day of this was oil These will be the last wells we will drill and complete in this play until prices improve but well be ready when they do Our technical team has mapped an additional locations left to drill and we also think that many of our earlier wells are excellent candidates to be refracked and we are working on a plan to execute some of these refracs starting in the second quarter of this year Slide shows the acreage weve accumulated in Burleson County targeting the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale We have net acres in this play Recent drilling results that include the Lewis wells show higher than expected GORs and this has caused us to remap the oil window in our southern Burleson County acreage As a result we now feel that or acres are prospective for oil development Weve written off the cost of the gassy southern acreage this quarter The northern acreage looks very good where we drilled the William and Henry well and we consider the William well one of the best wells drilled todate within the play And we believe that our oil window acreage is prospective for about future drilling locations Slide shows recent activity on our East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>acreage We completed four wells net in the first quarter Three of these wells the Henry A A and A wells had an average per well initial production rate of barrels of oil equivalent per day of it was oil Our Lewis A had an initial rate of barrels of oil and million cubic feet of gas There are four additional wells our Henry B wells that are cleaning up after the respective frac treatments Moving on to the TMS on slide we outlined our current lease position there Our ownership is now up to about net acres and our technical staff has mapped most of it as highly prospective A significant portion of our leasehold is offset by some of the best wells drilled in the play todate Obviously with the drop in oil prices we suspended our leasing and drilling activity in this play But we do intend to retain most of our acreage position for future development once oil prices improve Importantly I also want to point out that we are preparing to reenter the play by continuing to actively participate in the TMS Consortium Group that was formed to exchange drilling and completion information between operators in this play Our goal is to be technically ready and up to date so we can reenter the play when the time is right So thats it from the Haynesville through the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and on to the TMS And now going full circle Ill hand the baton back to Jay M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer All right Again thank you Mack If everyone would please turn to slide Ill summarize our plan for the rest of the year With the rapid fall in oil prices we decided to refocus on our largest assets as Mack said the Haynesville shale where improved completion technology has potentially improved the economics of the play We have a vast resource there with over Tcf of reserve potential and over mapped drilling locations The play is near the Gulf Coast market which offers premium price realizations compared to other regions in the country The Haynesville program will deliver strong natural gas production growth in while our oil program is on hold in this low oil price environment With the oil prices improving and well cost declining we have a good inventory of projects to pursue including future operated Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale locations and in addition to that future operated TMS shale locations Well continue to maintain our lowcost structures We have one of the lowest overall cost structures in the industry And most importantly well safeguard our balance sheet in with oil and gas price uncertainty and our lack of hedges We entered the quarter with million of liquidity and we have significantly reduced drilling activities to conserve this liquidity So for the rest of this call well take questions only from the research analysts who follow the company So Derek Ill turn it back to you Kim M Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC Kim M Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC If you look at the vertical results around your Haynesville acreage and your previous mapping what percent of the extended lateral locations do you think would be as high of quality as the two wells that you just drilled Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Well thats a great question A considerable percentage I dont have an exact number for you Kim I mean were the or so laterals that extended laterals that we mentioned is just targeting a specific part of the Haynesville acreage that we own We have significant assets as you know to the South We would like to see a little higher gas price before we start drilling an extended lateral in those areas But we have absolutely really good confidence that we can extend these concepts throughout our entire acreage Kim M Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer dozens and dozens in increments of to per Mcf higher stable gas price that we can go for at that time Kim M Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC Got it Okay And then on the refracs versus the new drills obviously the rate of return on the refracs is much higher How do you look at weighting refracs versus new drills Is the weighting more heavily here toward new drills because theres spottiness with the refracs or because of logistical issues Because it takes a lot more refracs to equal the same tick up in production as a virgin well How do you look at that Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Well Kim You just identified all of the reasons why we target the new wells preferentially to execute the refracs its a more laborintensive workintensive setup to get these wells ready to refrac to get partner approvals et cetera We have numerous candidates We have AFE circulating We also have the same identified candidate list in terms of numbers in our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>play So I think the important thing here is to keep our options open Were going to do several refracs in Haynesville this year And as you know weve budgeted several in the Haynesville and we also have a handful that we like in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as well Kim M Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Well the Bossier is extensive throughout our acreage and it really develops more strongly on our Southern side of the acreage that we operate We have drilled several using older completion techniques with laterals less than feet feet I think is our longest lateral in the Bossier play that has extensive opportunities for us going forward M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer Kim when you drill the Haynesville remember you drill to the Bossier and if you look at DeSoto Parish its extended laterals again you mentioned the in the Haynesville and as we come up with extended laterals in the Bossier thats your several hundred extended lateral wells right there Kim M Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer I mean we have again we dont have a percentage I dont have the map in front of us Your next question will be from the line of Ron Mills Johnson Rice Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Hey Mack just a clarification on one of Kims last questions the Haynesville and extended laterals in the Bossier thats not limited by I guess let me ask it better Is that limited by unitization rules or is that just identified in I guess the better part of the area Whats the limiting factor there I suppose the total is Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer So the limiting factor sure Ron The limiting factor is basically how we set up the units so far We have a number of additional units that can set up that we havent done so yet for extended lateral development especially on our southern acreage M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer And remember Ron the return on we think the laterals that you drilled per section now I think EP is doing that Chesapeake is doing that Its probably less than the return we get on the extended laterals Thats what our guess looks like So if you get a rate of return for million well thats extended lateral You maybe get a rate of return of just the section well M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer Its not what were looking at And as far as the answer the say the locations we have right now thats really based just upon acreage Its not quality Its just based upon acreage because its kind of hard to get contiguous acreage back to back to give the right to have extended laterals Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Okay All right And then also on the refracs in the Haynesville I know you I think you had talked in the past about million to million and you just today you gave us an idea of economics But one is that what your refrac cost you Two you have more refracs planned this year When are they going to occur And then three any commentary on EUR uplift versus the production uplift that youve highlighted so far Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Yes So our increment EUR Ill answer the last question first the EUR uplift is over Bcf between Bcf to Bcf We feel like the cost structure on these refracs we can get it down to between million to million And in terms of timing we have two that are on our togo list right now Were prioritizing for obvious reasons the use of our money We have several other AFEs that are circulating to partners Im waiting for another couple of weeks here Ron to see if some of these other AFEs are approved And if so well be doing another refrac this month Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Okay Great And then on the Henry well anything the batch of Henry wells that you mentioned in the release today the BOE per day compared to the original the rate on the original well of BOE per day was there any differences in the way they were completed or flow back managed or any comments on that Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer They were not completed appreciably different We did manage the flow backs differently We went very gradually to the average IP rate Were a little more aggressive on the Henry A with the flow back I think these wells the other Henry wells would have done a BEO per day if we wanted to open them up much but we decided not to do that Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Great And then one last one any I know youve had legacy acreage in North Louisiana and you used to have a lot of Cotton Valley activity way back when Any thoughts on prospectivity as the horizontal Cotton Valley in coming from East Texas to North Louisiana heats up Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Absolutely Weve got and Im glad you asked that question because weve got a significant position as you know in the Cotton Valley As a matter of fact the production in the Cotton Valley is what held Haynesville and a lot of our acreage So we have it throughout the East Texas region and the West Louisiana weve mapped numerous opportunities for horizontal drilling in the Cotton Valley but its HBP Ron so were proceeding with the Haynesville program because of the high rate potential Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Your next question comes from the line of David Amoss IBERIA Capital David Meagher Amoss IBERIA Capital Partners LLC Im just trying to get a feel for the trajectory in LOE as you switch back to the Haynesville through this year Can you just kind of give us your general thoughts about when thats going to dip and how much potentially Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Well Im looking at a nice little decrease in LOE not only because of the Haynesville rates As you know David Im sure you do LOE per unit of production in natural gas play dry gas play it doesnt really need significant treatment to get it to market its pretty darn low So as we increase the rates well be able to take advantage of economy of scales I think our LOE will go down by or so at a minimum The other aspect of that is these are highpressure highrate wells theyre not going to require compression So thats another big advantage that we can take get the benefit of of course Unlike some other situations where the wells fall off fairly quickly in terms of pressure and you need compression these are totally different beasts Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP And a couple of other cost factors on the Haynesville the new wells are exempt from severance taxes for their first couple of years so that will be a plus And then our transportation rates to market as a lot of our commitments are coming some of them are expiring this year Were going to were renegotiating some of them and we have a lot of uncommitted gas now So the transport rates are about a third of what they used to be So lots of positives as the new Haynesville gas comes in the numbers Remember none of it was in the first quarter not one molecule Those new wells came on in April So well see LOE improve and DDA improve So those are kind of the side effects from the Hayneville program M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer And we should be able to book some good reserves by yearend with all these wells being drilled David Meagher Amoss IBERIA Capital Partners LLC Got it Thanks And then Mack another question on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>refrac It sounds like youre going to have something planned for the second quarter Does that mean youre actually going to go in and refrac a well in the second quarter And then how many of those do you think you need before you get comfortable enough to add that to the program Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Well David thats second quarter is our goal Thats for sure Wed like to perform more than one Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>refrac in this quarter In terms of the uplift itll we have a number of models here rate of return as you know our hurdle rate for going forward with any project in this environment And I always say for todays conversation that the preliminary economics that weve run significantly exceeds our hurdle rate So were excited about the opportunity to go in refrac some of our older wells to get that uplift David Meagher Amoss IBERIA Capital Partners LLC Got it And then one last one Jay If you dont mind just kind of relay out the decision matrix as youve seen the oil price come up what are the commodity prices that would lead you to add rigs in various plays or move them around a little bit this year M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer I think theres two answers to that One you have to tell me the commodity price for gas And if we got a price right now nearterm gas is right at So gas price million drill and complete If we get that down to million then youre looking at a rate of return on gas and youre going to add a lot of reserves So if you look at that prospect and you say well what comparable oil price do I need to be competitive like that then you got to start out with oil and really go to plus oil Because we have again in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>weve got were thinking about locations and another so we have locations Thats probably three years four years worth of drilling I mean particularly in the world that we live in today So we think weve a got a great inventory of Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>locations and then at the same time we do think Goodrich is derisking the TMS So we know were right in the heart of the TMS If they can continue to derisk that for several years we got another plus locations there And then you add that in to the locations in the Haynesville particularly the extended laterals and weve got a really good kind of entre of things that we can spend money on And at the same time we almost have million of liquidity And like Roland said our CapEx budget this year we almost spent half of that in the first days which is just not a good thing but its a fact and its over and now were going to try to live within our cash flow So to answer that question I have to Ive got no idea on the commodity prices I like our oil upside I like our gas upside I like our realizations I like our locations and I like the fact that we havent bought a big acreage position where you have to have four rigs or five rigs drilling to keep the acreage intact In fact the Haynesville HBP South Texas HBP we got to pay million I think to keep our East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>totally intact and I think million to the TMS and weve budgeted that in our CapEx So I like our position I dont like the fact that we have zero hedges Thats not a good thing its a bad thing It showed up in the first quarter But the one thing that did show up in the first quarter at the side of Mack is that what we thought we could do in the Haynesville work to mean you can take a concept that the Chesapeake and others have said theyve been participating in then all of a sudden we have our own wells and like Mack said that probably one of the two best wells weve ever drilled for gas wells ever And usually your first well or two wells are not your best So I think the future is pretty good for Comstock Hope that answers it David Meagher Amoss IBERIA Capital Partners LLC Brian M Corales Scotia Howard Weil Question on the refracking in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Can you maybe talk about what the current production rates are of what you plan to refrac and what do think it can ultimately go to Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Sure The wells that were currently targeting are wells that make anywhere from barrels of oil per day to barrels of oil per day We think we can get to to times uplift on those rates Those wells that were targeting are on artificial lift Theyre older wells So of course we would get the artificial lift on the side of the road and prep the well for refrac and the well would be flowing after refrac for a significant period of time Typically its about six months or so and then reinstall the artificial lift that weve set on the side Brian M Corales Scotia Howard Weil Brian M Corales Scotia Howard Weil Okay And then one on the Haynesville I think if I remember correctly you all used to restrict the chokes and kind of have a flatter production profile Can you talk about I think those were just test rigs Do you have anything longer term at the extended laterals and how do you plan to produce the wells Are you going to kind of go back to the restricted choke And I cant remember if its million or million a day flat for a while Whats the thoughts there Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Were looking at and we monitor this very closely We dont want to exceed a certain level of pressure drawdown across the completion So that drawdown is what dictates the flow rate Now these wells that we brought on and Im glad you asked the question because the flowing pressures are so significantly higher than we anticipated that were able to flow these wells at a significant rate without violating our pressure drawdown window So right now these wells IPd at one IPd at the other and were flowing them at around at an million to million a day rate And staying within our pressure drawdown window So these the results are more than just about the rates Its about how can you flow the wells without putting excessive pressure drawdown across the completion and across the network of fractures that youve created thereby increasing if you did violate your window and the reason why the window is important is that you dont want to risk damaging the completion by putting too much pressure drawdown across it So were pretty conservative right now about how were approaching it So were and we plan to remain so going forward with the wells that were going to complete Were going to let the pressure drawdown dictate the rate that we flow the wells M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer And Brian I think Mack said earlier that our third well is halfway completed and were waiting to complete the fourth and were drilling the fifth So the problem seems to be really really really working Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey guys Just to followup on the Haynesville here Trying to get a sense of what the well cost were on those first couple wells And you guys indicated getting these well costs down to million to million Just wanted to get a sense if that included some service cost reductions to get down to those levels Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Sure Yeah Were taking advantage of the service cost reductions If you look at this time last year the same wells would have cost us million to million and now were talking million and were going to million Obviously the real benefit of getting the foot laterals in terms of cost is the economies of scale The cheapest part of the well is that last feet on the lateral that we drill So thats a fairly minor cost adder but youre getting a huge cost savings in terms of just the DC cost Leo when you look at the fracs The fracs now are onethird to of what they were costing just a few months ago So we think we can get the cost down into the million million range As far as the first two we were very very conservative going forward with our estimates and the first two averaged one was million and the other one was million So thats where we came up with million Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay Thats helpful And I guess in terms of those first two wells can you just let us know when did those come on line Did those make the first quarter at all It sounds like maybe they didnt were those kind of early second quarter Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer No They were fully second quarter We brought them on in midApril I think the beginning of the second week of April was well and then well was the third week of April Back to your original question on cost the other thing thats amazing is that the drilling times are coming down and were talking with a foot lateral So if you go back to our foot lateral wells one of the wells that we drilled of the three that we have now or four pardon me one of them we set a record for drill time and despite the fact that it added another feet lateral line So thats a big plus as well in terms of the DC cost Leo Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay Thats helpful And I guess getting back to your acreage position of net acres I wanted to get a sense if you had any breakdown of that acreage position by the different parishes Im trying to get a sense of how much of that is in DeSoto Parish Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer We can get that to you later I dont have those numbers in front of me But we have a significant acreage position at DeSoto Thats for sure Your next question will be coming from the line of Jeffrey Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc Ill start out with a couple of Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>question and then Ill return to the refracs which have been a pretty popular subject today I was just wondering did you have any day rates from either the South or the East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>completions in the first quarter of and if numbers arent handy can you qualify if the results are meeting your expectations Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer day IP rates are probably in the range of barrels a day to barrels a day And yes they are meeting our expectations Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc Okay great With regard to the Lewis well did that well have any mechanical issues or was it just not a strong well Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer We drilled it in a high GOR area and that was one of the wells that further defined the gassy window in the play Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc Okay So that actually provide us some of the data that informed the impairments that you discussed earlier on the call Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc Okay great Thank you And finally with regard to the refracs are you initiating any new perforations in these or is this entirely about repumping existing perfs and fractures and Id like to add to that will refracking in the Haynesville differ technically from refracking in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer The answer to your first question is yes and yes I mean were going to we have refrac candidates that dont require additional perforations and then we have some others that do Im talking specifically about the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>So we have candidates teed up on both sides of the aisle with regard to that The Haynesville refracs is that was that your other question on Haynesville refracs Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc I was just asking the second one was just is there anything that will really meaningfully differ technically because the Haynesville is dry gas and Im assuming some of these wells youre going to refrac in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are wet right Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Yes One of the differences is the proppant selection The other is the use of mesh and Im talking about the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The proppant selection for the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is different from the proppant that we pump in the Haynesville In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we use and In the Haynesville we do not Its all The frac fluid in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a gel hybrid system and whereas the frac fluid in the Haynesville is slick no gel whatsoever in order to carry the proppant So there are some significant technical differences and the pumping schedules vary as well But the trick is to get as high a proppant placement per cluster arrangement and per stage in both plays in order to improve the fracture network so that you get the uplift that youre really looking for Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc Your next question will be from the line of Dan McSpirit BMO Capital Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Good morning If I could revisit a few with a few more questions on the refracs in the Haynesville shale First of all I just want to confirm that you stated you get as much as a Bcf uplift for a drill and complete cost of anywhere from million to million Is that correct Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Okay And so if I consider that I come up with an implied FD cost of somewhere in the neighborhood of about an Mcfe versus something closer to say on a new well do you look at it the same way Im just trying to reconcile how capital should be going or why capital should be going to a refrac versus a new well Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Well just a real quick response I mean were talking about numbers that varied by on a per unit basis So weve done one refrac and that was the result of our refrac We were quite pleased with it It compares favorably to other successes on refracs in the Haynesville We certainly know that as we do more of these jobs Dan were going to get better and better at it We think the metrics are going improve right along with it In terms of comparing it to a new well with the refrac obviously youre pumping a job across the completion thats already received a frac And so youre using diverters in order to ensure that you open up the clusters the stages that have been previously fracked You know all of this Im sure in your coverage of this whole business So the diverter placement and the pumping schedule is something that is evolving And weve met with all of the service companies and going through the databases that they have and looking at different ways to improve the efficiencies of the refrac So the bottom line for me is if for million to million or so I can get a Bcf uplift incremental and thats on just our first well its worth considering doing a few more in order to really identify how we can improve the process and get even better economics Our new wells speak for themselves I think Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Great Thats helpful very helpful I appreciate that And if I could followup on the same subject of refracs appreciating that you have limited number of wells here and with very limited production history but do you see the shape of the decline curve or the first year decline rate being much different than that observed on a new well Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Well its a little early to tell Give me about three months Dan and Ill be able to give you a much better answer But right now they seem very similar Obviously the rates on the refracs are much lower so its hard to compare a million a day well to a million a day well but in terms of decline that weve got less than days of history on But right now I can tell you that our type curve and all the modeling thats been done on both of those type of projects were right on type curves So no issues here Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Okay Great And what is the base decline rate of the company today and where do you see it say at the end of this year or even the end of based on how capital is being allocated today Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP Hey Dan This is Roland Yeah the base decline in our oil is steeper because of the new so many new oils and the transition to artificial lift for many of the oil wells happens this year And so when we make that transition and finish it itd be a lower decline So I think weve always said that overall decline based on kind of a yearonyear basis is somewhere in the to And gas is probably kind of without the new Haynesville program But as we add the new wells I guess that will change That decline rate will probably increase as these big new wells kind of take over a large percentage of the gas production Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Okay Great And a couple more if I could squeeze them in What is the cost to retain the net acres in the TMS and could you sketch for us the lease expiry schedule on that leasehold Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP This year the cost for extensions is about million million which weve budgeted in our budget The rest of our budget is to do some extensions in our Burleson area So that would retain the acreage Theres a few if we can operate a unit in the TMS I dont think were going to make any great attempt to keep that acreage Theres a lot of units that we can operate in the TMS So a lot of them have extensions that can over the next two years to three years that can kick in And so mostly thats how were doing is using automatic extenders Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Okay Great Last one from me And then beyond preserving liquidity what do you see to be the way out in this low commodity price environment For example should an acquisition be contemplated where the balance sheet is maybe overequitized in the process or is it just best to wait it out for higher prices M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer Well we think weve got good assets I mean we need it to change the economic valuation in Haynesville which I think the and thats a key objective for this year but I think the best answer for Comstock is to wait it out I mean theres we got we dont need new assets and we need a little bit higher commodity prices and theres a lot of other options the company can look at if we want to bring in partners as we proved up the quality of the assets And but with that we put enough liquidity we have it in place to wait it out I think thats the best answer versus doing something thats very not going to get an instant fix in this environment And if we got one itd be very painful to the existing holders so we would rather wait it out and then look to continue to improve the cost structure improve the economics of the wells build reserves in the Haynesville our biggest asset and look for opportunities to bring in capital maybe do some noncore project assets sales So just a variety of things but an instant fix would be more commodity prices coming back up and putting in some protective hedges for next year Those are our goals for next year Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Got it Thanks again for taking my questions Your next question will be from the line of Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch Just some questions on the bond buyback So it was bought back a small amount just million Whats is there a strategy to that that we should think about going forward Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP Gregg theres not a specific strategy I mean theyre an incredible investment opportunity but we have to weigh that against preserving liquidity And so as we look at I think that this we would like to be able to do more of that but only have kind of a modest amounts that were budgeted for that without bringing in some new sources of capital without using our existing liquidity But again maybe a strategy might if we have some noncore assets we can get a really good price for that could provide some capital to that would let us to retire that debt at a big discount like those are its obviously a compelling opportunity that we look at ways to take advantage of the best we can Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch Do you have anything that youre actively marketing right now that you could sell that would help you to generate proceeds or something like that Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP Were not actively marketing any properties because of the commodity price outlook We dont know if its the ideal time But we are dealing with quite a bit of inquiries from inbound inquiries on different properties and obviously looking at potential to the extent they throw out a number that we think is good So I think its a possibility but were not actively pursuing an aggressive strategy until we kind of see some transactions clear the market and kind of get a good idea of what they can Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch Whats your understanding of your limitation as to what you can buy back in terms of bonds with respect to the new Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP Yeah Theres a limited amount especially under the new credit facility we have I think that number is like million Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it And then you mentioned living within cash flows your goal Could you tell us what your current production is today and if you are in fact living within cash flow Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP I dont we dont have the current production rate right now with all the new stuff coming on But its obviously big uplift to gas since none of those new gas projects were on in the first quarter from where we were in the where we were earlier in the first quarter As far as cash flow I dont want I think were still slightly not within cash flow yet not at the current commodity prices I think that is a key since our shift to gas I think getting gas up to over then we get pretty close Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch And your realizations were a little bit different than historical Is what you had last quarter what we should think about for the rest of the year or is there something Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP No I think they have improved a lot I think last first quarter was one the timing of production was given there were such rapid changes of prices in the quarter its a very strange quarter as far as realizations because production was at level throughout the quarter for either oil or gas And you had a rapid change in prices But as I think well see in crude realizations especially in the Haynesville where were going to have better marketing arrangements with the new gas Again none of that was in the first quarter Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you So is it the sort of so to go back to historical levels of sort of of NYMEX makes sense and then take it back to pretty much of crude oil WTI is the right way to think about it Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP Yeah I think when you look at differentials and this is for the whole industry not just us I mean using percentages is not the best way because a lot of embedded transportation cost and differentials are fixed So when you have low prices it tends to those become a bigger percentage So I think thats also just kind of the relative nature of where we are at low prices But those very few I mean very few of our transportation marketing arrangements are percentagebased Theyre just actual deducts for hauling oil or transporting gas that are fixed in nature So the percentages Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch But the improvement in oil prices youre seeing some improvement Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer The best way to look at it is to take a number historically and then I think youll be a lot closer not a percentage Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch And just two quick ones for you You mentioned lack of hedging Are there any thoughts to maybe lock in some hedges on crude here with the move in oil prices Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Yeah Obviously the moves are getting us close to our targets for oil I mean its probably going to be I think our for this year the horse is probably out of the barn as far as getting good hedges in But definitely were very weve got targets that we like on both the oil and gas and wed like to have a hedge position that works for us for next year but patient in putting it in place because often very low prices arent going to be helpful at all But definitely crude has made the biggest move to getting to the targets Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch And then one last clarification You laid out very nicely the opportunity in the Haynesville and the Bossier but your the Bossier opportunity the wells is there a chance you get to that this year at all And maybe just one other just the refrac opportunity It sounds like you have secondhalfweighted is there a split between Haynesville and Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that we should think about Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer I think on the Bossier yeah I think given a limited amount of projects that we have in the budget I dont see the Bossier trying to do a Bossier well this year If we do it it might be late in the year And on refracs the mix is kind of I think a lot of it will be up to logistics partner approval And then the first kind of seeing how the first Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>refrac comes together The one factor in refrac is if we do have a partner it takes a approval because its an existing producing well And then weve got other considerations If were doing a refrac of a Haynesville well we have a one well holding the section and thats the only well thats still in the section We may kind of be very cautious about wanting to refrac it just and say to not to have to create a drilling obligation So theres a lot of so its really a theres a lot of potential candidates but theres a lot of considerations to when you pull the trigger And their timing is less predictable than the new wells But again things were getting a little ahead of schedule on the new wells and theyre the biggest driver of our production numbers Gregg Brody Bank of America Merrill Lynch We have a followup question from the line of Ron Mills Johnson Rice Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Just real quick Mack on the producing wells in the Haynesville you said you have potential refrac Is that I mean all your producing wells there were there any potential limitations on some producing wells And I guess the same question on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Yeah Ron that basically suggest that every well that we have in the play is deserving of an evaluation so for refrac so it is a candidate And I think I mentioned earlier in the call that were prioritizing and were well into that whole process of which wells are immediate candidates for project execution part of the criteria is obviously partner approval but there are many other criteria that we use well how understimulated was the original completion on a Haynesville well et cetera And the same criteria is applicable to the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as well with one exception that we feel like getting partner approval in our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>opportunities would be far less cumbersome a process So I think the question earlier was whats the split between our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Haynesville refrac candidate list Were starting to build a robust candidate list on both sides of that question And so I like having the option of being able to execute eitheror But it right now it appears that our executable Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>refrac list is ahead of where I thought it would be at this point So thats why Im pretty optimistic that we can get some of these jobs executed in the second quarter Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Okay Good And then secondly Roland for you just project production trajectory here It sounds like at least between now and yearend oil should continue to decline should it can decline pretty ratably over the remainder of the year And then on gas I know you obviously expect it to average almost higher than it did for the first quarter I guess the same question there or how does that trajectory build Because at some point is it more of a second half growth or does that growth on the gas side start here in the second quarter Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP No it starts in the second quarter luckily with the big with the as long as Mack keeps producing those wells at the good rates And there we and we do have interest in those two first wells so thats good The on the oil I think the theres a little bit steeper decline that really starts in the third quarter We do have some new staff coming on to soften the second quarter but definitely some decline will start there so there maybe be a little bit higher decline rate going from second to third And then a lot depends on how the artificial lift program goes as we put a lot of that work gets finished in the third quarter Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC And then when you do the refracs particularly when you start thinking about you have the offset frac activity Was the offset frac activity more in the Haynesville or was it the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that impacted the first quarter Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Yeah We shut in some of our wells to accommodate the refrac or the frac scheduling and as well as the refrac that we did we shut in a couple of wells there but primarily the shutins were due to the new well fracs that we were conducting Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP and the disruptive they are to production Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Kim M Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC Yeah Hey again Im just wondering when those Haynesville wells came back on line if you saw any uplift from those wells like Chesapeake has been talking about Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Yeah Kim we did and thats a great question Im glad you asked that one too We had offset wells to each of our first two that we shut in and they were shut in approximately weeks And when we brought them back on the production levels were times to times higher than they were prior to shut in So there was very little doubt that we did get some repressurization due to the frac on the new wells So that was an added benefit for sure Now were evaluating the durability of that uplift And so we cant really make a prediction in terms of incremental EUR benefit that sort of thing But right now its been about weeks weeks and theyre still producing an elevated rate So thats definitely a benefit Kim M Pacanovsky Imperial Capital LLC Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Sure Before one well was million a day and now its million a day Another well was a day and its about million a day now Those are the two that I remember The next question will be from the line of Chris Stevens KeyBanc Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Hey guys Good morning Just a quick followup on the refracs how long do you guys expect the well your first refrac to kind of stick around the million a day and what are the modeling assumptions for first year cumulative production on the Bcf to Bcf EUR Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer Well right now its million a day and the pressure is staying up there around pounds pounds So we feel like line pressures goes into a high line pressure system around pounds So we feel like this high rate is going to stay with us for a significant period of time The percentage of EUR in the first year is probably around to So weve got at least million million in the first year So the benefit of the refrac is pretty significant And we like the contribution for relatively low cost the economics as weve mentioned are definitely positive Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc All right Okay And can you just remind us how much proppant did you guys use in your first two enhanced completion design in the Haynesville and are you guys going to test maybe anything else out there to try to further optimize the wells Are you going to stick with this current design right now Mack D Good Chief Operating Officer I think in the design approach that were taking Chris its more is better in terms of proppant placement To answer your question we pumped about million pounds of total proppant in each well sand along with mesh So were looking at the and the first thats we pumped stages stages stages went at below gradient So in other words we feel like we could place more proppant And so were looking at probably the fourth well will try placing a little more proppant per stage The proppant loading is about pounds per stage We may bump that a little bit pounds or so perhaps pounds per stage So thats the kind of parameters were looking at Certainly the whole goal here as everybody knows is to create the most complex interconnected fracture system along that foot lateral that we can so the more proppantfluid that we pump per stage the better Your next question will be from the line of Dan Guffey Stifel Daniel D Guffey Stifel Nicolaus Co Inc Thanks guys Appreciate all the color today Just a quick one on hedges you guys had talked about having targets for oil and gas prices for layering in some hedges in care to share what prices those are Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP No we dont really want to share that publicly Daniel D Guffey Stifel Nicolaus Co Inc Okay Yeah Makes sense And then secondly you guys mentioned youre not actively marketing any assets but you have had some inquiries Im wondering if any of those inquiries are from financial partners on future Haynesville development like what youve had from KKR in South Texas Roland O Burns President CFO Secretary Director Senior VP Primarily theyve weve been there with other operators that have been interested in specific properties And some of them we said no were not sellers but some of them we said well you can give us a number if we could especially where we saw those properties being noncore to see what the market would be So but I think as the year progresses and weve had some dialog in the past about private equity or other type passive kind of participants in a joint venture with some of the properties And I think that as we establish the economics especially of the HaynesvilleBossier program and we have a vast resource there that may be something we entertain toward the second half of the year especially if we see stronger gas price curve M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer Dan I would say that weve not been calling anyone to find a partner but weve had both private equity and other companies call us to ask if we would partner on some of the properties And so weve received those phone calls Same thing weve had incoming calls on some of the oilfields that we own and we said well maybe you can take a look at them We dont really think that in the market were in somebody is going to pay fair value So I dont think you should get your expectations up But again weve received a lot of incoming calls which probably is an indication that they like our South Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>because we havent infield drilled any wells there Weve got acre and acre spacing Weve got we think an exemplary refracking program same thing with our East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Weve written off maybe of that So we have completely decided that the Southern part is too gassy Weve got better gas which is the Haynesville but we like our position in our northern acreage And then I think the Haynesville kind of speaks for itself So its a good position and I think we can hold on to our liquidity And in the second quarter gas prices and oil prices are a lot better than they were in the first quarter Daniel D Guffey Stifel Nicolaus Co Inc M Jay Allison Chairman Chief Executive Officer All right Derek again thank you for hosting the conference call And some quarters are better than others and this was not a good one not only for us but its a hard time to be in the EP business And our goal in the first quarter was to give you some results be clear about that and then also guide you to what we think we can do in the second quarter third quarter and fourth quarter of with the market is as it is I thought one of the really good questions was where will you allocate your money and the answer to that was it depends upon where the commodity price is because we do have a really good inventory of oil and gas projects in the future And again Im very pleased that Mack is back as the COO to help guide the company as he did from to Ladies and gentlemen that concludes todays conference We thank you for your participation You may now disconnect Have a great day Copyright policy All transcripts on this
