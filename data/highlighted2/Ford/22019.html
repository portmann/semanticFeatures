Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw a decline in US auto sales in March compared to March as the new F aluminumbodied model increased production levels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has sold K more Mustangs in the US than the Chevrolet Camaro has so far in in an effort to be the best selling US muscle car <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains well positioned to take advantage of the booming US auto industry going forward and is a strong longterm investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F announced March US vehicle sales of down from the same month in This approximately decline came in slightly better than the decline expected by analysts Of the major automakers Hondas NYSE HMC decline of and Volkswagens OTCQX VLKAY decline of were the only auto companies to have larger declines in US sales when comparing March with March <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trailed behind other US automakers with General Motors NYSE GM decreasing and Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU increasing With the frigid February weather behind us <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continued to stagger behind competition despite the industrys expectations to sell approximately million new automobiles in Even with the slow start to Im remaining patient on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>going forward and believe there were a lot of positives to take away from the March US sales conference call The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F production is ramping up as the Kansas City assembly plant is expected to reach full production levels in quarter The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company has not utilized heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors This conservative pricing allowed the company to increase the FSeries transaction price by in March compared to March After talking with an individual that recently was shopping for a new pickup truck he confirmed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was holding to their sticker price while GM and Toyota NYSE TM were offering significant discounts Given the excitement over the new aluminum bodied model and loyalty to the FSeries I believe a lot of customers are holding off purchasing the new model and are waiting for future price incentives Despite the inventory issues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>truck sales still saw an increase of With only of the new F sales in March being the new model I believe the company will rebound as the newer model inventory issues are resolved This will allow the company to start being more aggressive with their incentives and the customers waiting for the new models price to be reduced will start buying The excitement over the new aluminumbodied model is evident in the average turn time of days which continues to show that the new design is being accepted by new consumers Consistent with my view of Fords February US sales announcement I think it is important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to get this product launch right as they are taking the Fseries brand in a new direction designed for better fuel mileage With optimal inventory levels expected later this year I think its important to look at the average turn time of the model and the overall health of the US economy Both of these indicators are indicative of a positive second half of for the F and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as a whole In March the US auto consumer continued the shift back to less fuel efficient vehicles in response to the falling fuel prices This shift in consumer sentiment will boost sales for the companys higher profit margin vehicles such as the F Explorer and Expedition Consistent with February results the Mustang saw impressive gains in March Mustang sales were up yearoveryear after taking advantage of the growth in the sports car segment The Mustang was responsible for of that growth as it continues to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in This is a title the company has not held since before the Chevrolet Camaro was introduced Through the first quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has sold an impressive Mustangs compared to only new Camaros I believe the sports car segment will continue to see rapid growth as the weather warms and the US economy improves Given my longterm approach with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Im not worried about the yearoveryear decrease reported in March <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still reported the second highest US sales figure in March slightly behind GM and there are opportunities to grow I continue to be excited about the companys future as the new aluminum bodied F ramps up production the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles and the return of the Mustang With the consumer purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to report stronger top line and bottom line growth I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market I will continue to enjoy the near dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the long term Note The following table was used to populate the graphs Sources Audi BMW and Others Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Still
