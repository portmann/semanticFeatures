style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pulled themselves out of the recession and innovated their way back to success A testament to their forward thinking is todays PR acknowledging million Ecoboost Fs sold We revisit our bull case and reiterate why even though down from our original F purchases we remain long It was just two days ago that we came out and suggested buying the dip in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F shares We suggested that those with a longterm investment horizon on the company like us could benefit from locking in a yield that was pressing and take advantage of getting a spot to own a company for the long term that we know will be around for many years to come In the following one and a half trading days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>like the rest of the market has recovered Equities are up for the second day in a row which would give buyers two days ago a leg up already on their investment The FTSE overseas has almost recovered all of its postBrexit losses and US markets look ready to follow suit and potentially gain back nearly all of their losses We have been advocating for a longterm position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the last year now We stated from the very beginning that we have a multiple year outlook on the company and that our plan was to reinvest dividends going forward for many years to come That is a plan we have stuck to and will continue to stick to as we added shares recently and will continue to add if the stock moves lower <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is celebrating the success of its F with its Ecoboost engine this morning as it announced million of these models have been sold The press release stated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Americas truck leader has set a new benchmark in truck capability and efficiency More than million F pickups with segmentexclusive EcoBoost engines have now been sold in the United States We are proving that with advanced technologies like EcoBoost and highstrength militarygrade aluminumalloy construction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to outperform the competition by virtually every metric says Doug Scott <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>truck group marketing manager EcoBoost is delivering the value capability and performance F customers insist upon while helping improve their No demand better fuel economy We thought this would be a great opportunity to revisit the last year of our advocating for a long position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and why the company has been so immensely successful and profitable since the recession of and So much of what drew us to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was the reinvention of the company after When General Motors had to recapitalize itself US automakers were in the doldrums like they had never been in before They were regarded as failures and the products were regarded as inferior to competition from overseas The entire attitude on the United States auto market changed in and General Motors NYSE GM is doing well after the recapitalization but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a company that made it through these doldrums without needing assistance or restructuring and they have continued to flourish from this point forward Although some would argue that we hopped on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>train late seeing as how we started buying around and per share we would argue that we are buying for the next large cyclical move to the upside which may be in a year or may be in several years What we do believe is important is that we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is capable of making the leap and theyre capable of doing it through increased execution and profitability overseas Domestic support was never really an issue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Its nice that the company was able to move out of the recession in tact but it is even more appealing to us that the company has made a plan to expand internationally and is following through with it The key domestically was that the company was not afraid to innovate and make a big leap incorporating aluminum and engineering the Ecoboost engine into its production of the F This was the first major innovative step that the company took after the recession and it was one that now we know has paid fantastic dividends literally for the company It is this type of investment and innovation that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is undertaking both domestically and internationally that we think puts them at the forefront of the two American automakers General Motors and Dodge stated after the fact that they were also considering incorporating aluminum into their vehicles but only after the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>litmus test had taken place <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gets to own the rights of being the first to incorporate aluminum into their trucks for fuel efficiency and today they get recognition for reading those reports We still continue to think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a great place to allocate some capital given the companys strong operating history and recent success over the last few quarters We have talked about incorporating a short position in CACC to potentially offset the effects of an auto financing bubble burst but more importantly we have talked about and employed our strategy of simply adding slightly more allocation to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>each time it moves lower We made the case why Brexit wouldnt effect the company and now the valuation simply says it all for us We stated earlier this week Not only does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generate a majority of its profits from North America but the international locations that the company is looking to expand to and do business in dont really have too much to do with the United Kingdom exiting the European Union While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking to increase its footprint in Europe the largest investments it has made over the last two years have been in Mexico and China It has invested in both of these geographies in order to build infrastructure and create product for distribution all over North America and Asia at a cost efficient rate The United Kingdoms exit from the European Union will have very little effect on Fords two biggest investments Trading at x next years estimates with a pricesale ratio of x <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains dirt cheap at these levels It has been a year or perhaps a year and a few months now and our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>predictions for per share have hardly come to fruition However this is one case where we continue to have confidence in our investment due to Fords underlying operating performance holding up and we see more of a reason to add shares here than we do to take some off the table We are long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and will continue to add on dips as long as operating performance continues to impress I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation
