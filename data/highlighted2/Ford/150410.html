India will become the thirdlargest auto market in the world in the next years driven by growth in the SUV segment that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is now targeting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has already tasted success in Indias SUV market with the EcoSport and it is now looking to step up its game with a luxury SUV the Endeavour <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will price the Endeavour competitively as compared to the Toyota Fortuner the market leader which will help it attract more buyers as it is a newergeneration model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has included several new features in the Endeavour as compared to rivals while its engine carries superior torque and power figures indicating that it has got the right product Car sales in India which is the worlds fifthlargest car market have increased for nine consecutive months until July Sales in India rose from units last year to units this July according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers Total passenger vehicle sales including cars utility vehicles and vans also increased to vehicles in July This clearly indicates that Indias car market is growing at an impressive pace but American automaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has been unable to make the most of this opportunity In July Fords sales in India dropped almost on a yearoveryear basis as its market share slipped just under Overall India is a small market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as the company sold only vehicles over here last year while its global sales were million units Thus it is evident that India contributes a very small share to Fords overall sales Now you might be thinking why Im worried about the companys weak performance in the relatively small market Well this is because India is on track to become the thirdbiggest auto market after the US and China hitting million units in annual sales by Additionally by auto sales in India are slated to hit a run rate of million units annually as shown below The fast pace of growth in this particular market is the reason why I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to step up its game in this market or it might miss out on a key growth opportunity More specifically in order to improve its share in India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to focus on certain growth hotspots such as the SUV market The SUV segment in particular is showing robust growth in India India is now one of the fastest growing markets for SUVs As a percentage of sales SUVs now command over of total luxury vehicles sold in India Since roads in India are usually not up to the mark as compared to international standards demand for SUVs is rising as they are equipped with allwheeldrive capabilities while offering comfort at the same time This is the reason why Fords EcoSport compact SUV became a rage in the country when it was launched two years ago This is because in the last years the compact SUV segment in India has grown at a rate of as compared to the growth of the overall UV market Fords EcoSport has been the trendsetter in this segment selling units in just two years Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has hit the ground running in the SUV segment in India but now it is looking to step up its game with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Endeavour In a bid to increase its market share in India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has lined up multiple launches in the country As a part of this plan the company will bring in the newgeneration model of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Endeavour SUV in India The new Endeavour is expected to be more upmarket than its predecessor and is expected to fall in the price bracket of INR lakhs around in India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has started production of the new Endeavour in Thailand at its AutoAllianceThailand AAT manufacturing unit in Rayong The outgoing Endeavour is also manufactured from the same facility and exported to other countries as completelyknockeddown kits This means that the production cost of the new generation model should not be much higher as compared to the outgoing model as they share the same manufacturing platform As a result it is likely that this model will have a positive impact on Fords margins in the country since the outgoing Endeavour is priced at around in India at the midpoint <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been able to increase the premium on this car by giving it a new look along with some other major changes to improve the ride and handling package For instance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has now included a new independent coilspring suspension layout at the rear as compared to a leaf spring setup in the outgoing car Additionally the company has included a new terrain management system TMS which will allow the driver to choose from preadjusted settings to enhance safety and performance in any driving scenario As a result Fords new fullsize SUV for India is more comfortable and capable as compared to the outgoing generation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however will face stiff competition from the likes of the Toyota NYSE TM Fortuner the Honda NYSE HMC CRV the Isuzu OTCPKISUZY MU the Mitsubishi OTCPKMMTOF Pajero and the Ssangyong Rexton in the SUV segment However an advantage that the Endeavour has as compared to its biggest rival the Fortuner is in terms of power The Endeavours liter engine will help the car generate BHP of power which is greater than the Fortuners BHP Additionally the current generation Fortuner in India costs the same as the Endeavour and this puts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at an advantage Im saying this because the Fortuner is an older generation model as compared to the Endeavour generates less power and comes loaded with a lot of technologies Thus I wont be surprised if the Endeavour outpaces the Fortuner in the Indian SUV market once it is launched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is accelerating its product development for India After launching the Figo Aspire to tap the fastgrowing compact sedan segment the company is now looking to tap the premium segment as well with the Endeavour SUV Given the features that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has included in the Endeavour it should be able to strike a chord with SUV buyers in India Since the overall Indian car market is growing at a good pace driven by increasing demand for SUVs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is focusing in the right direction to improve its share in this market This is a smart move from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>since Indias car market is expected to grow in leaps and bounds in the future as the disposable income of people increases As India is on track to become the thirdbiggest car market globally Fords moves to tap growth in this particular market will allow it to improve its overall financial performance in the long run Disclosure Iwe have no positions in
