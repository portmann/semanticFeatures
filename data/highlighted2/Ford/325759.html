style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is producing results results not appreciated by the broad market Cost savings streamlining and auto sales trends point to better than expected earnings In a previous article I hypothesized that shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F could go to in Needless to say that event has not yet occurred but the prediction is as valid today as it was a few months ago The company is producing results results not appreciated by the broad market and will drive share prices higher in the foreseeable future Here are reasons why I think this stock could see gains of or more over the next months Earnings are only one reason to like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The recently released th quarter report showed a jump in profits on strong sales Reported th quarter EPS was a full or better than expected with a nearly increase in operating margins For the full year pretax profits hit another new record resulting in a increase in aftertax profits available to shareholders As for guidance the company is expecting operating profits automotive revenues and operating margins to be at least equal to or greater than in Based on the strength of the US auto market strong sales in China and Europe and initiatives to cut costs I think this guidance is conservative The US market is strong and not showing any signs of slowing down Full year sales hit a record full year sales are expected to hit another new high above million and this is expected to continue into at least with estimated sales above million Sales are led by trucks and SUVs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>of course owning the top selling brand the FSeries along with another vehicles among the top most popular in America <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been able to maintain market share throughout the year above for with Januarys share reported at by Edmundscom The European auto market is strong and gaining strength Recently released data shows that EU sales were up in January after gaining in December This makes January the third consecutive monthly increase and above the average monthly sales level for all of On a yearoveryear basis January sales were up more than from January marks the third consecutive year of increasing sales in the EU economic arena up from the previous year Strength was led by SUVs and trucks with a strong showing from commercial vehicles as well Market share in the region jumped to not the highest the company has boasted for the region but consistent with the fouryear average Data from China is also promising January sales figures show that Fords sales increased in January following a increase in December despite financial market turmoil in the worlds rd largest and fastest growing economy The partner in the region Changan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw sales rise more than in January following a

increase of for the Chinese market and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is sure to benefit from this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has announced several measures in recent months that will help the company to streamline operations and cut costs One is the expansion of operations in Mexico with the addition of a new plant The plant will allow the company to shift some of its jobs to Mexico avoiding a costly new labor deal and allowing the US factories to focus on the more profitable FSeries and SUVs demanded by the market Another is a move in Europe to cut several less than popular models from the line up This will allow for a smaller work force and is estimated by the company to save up to millio n in annual costs Yet another is the decision to cease production and sales in Japan and Indonesia These two regions have long been a thorn in the companys side as they are not profitable due to intense competition from Takata OTCPKTKTDY and Toyota NYSE TM Karen Hampton Fords AsiaPacific spokesperson said this in an emailed statement It has become clear that there is no path to sustained profitability nor will there be an acceptable return over time from our investments in Japan or Indonesia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is committed to restructuring parts of its business that have no reasonable path to achieve sales growth Relative to the broad market all this performance is grossly undervalued The SP is only expected to see earnings growth in the range of for all of and is trading at nearly X forward earnings while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is stuck at only forward earnings In terms of analyst estimates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has seen a marked increase in earnings estimates for the current quarter next quarter and full year over the past days while the broad market has seen a greater than decline in earnings expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also undervalued relative to itself The company has traded in a range of to times forward earnings over the past years with an average of While the valuation is not as low as it was post it is at the low end of the historic range and half that of the average Based on valuation and expected strength over the next two years shares of the stock could easily double if not more The company has paid a steady stable and rising distribution since the board reinstated the dividend in Each year as the company improves performance and earnings the distribution increases It doubled from to it increased from to and gained another in So far in regular distributions have remained steady from the level but a special dividend of ups the annual payment by Based on company guidance for I think it not unlikely we see an increase in regular distributions andor another special <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is performing better than expected and showing steady growth on a yeartoyear basis The largest markets the company operates in are at record sales level and expected to increase these levels over the next two years The company is taking steps to control costs and streamline operations The dividend is stable healthy and growing And all this while the stock is trading at a deep discount relative to the broad market and at the low end of its valuation range Basically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a strong buy in my opinion at these levels and could easily see a gain in share prices
