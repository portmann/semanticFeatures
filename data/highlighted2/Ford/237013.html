Auto Show in Detroit Michigan in this file photo taken January Factory employees are seen working in the plant of General Motors in the city of Silao in the state of Guanajuato Mexico in this November file photo DETROIT Detroits Big Three automakers are accelerating plans to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico as they seek to reduce labor costs while using higherpaid US workers to build their very profitable trucks sport utility vehicles and luxury cars New versions of several of their popular US compact cars are expected to be made in Mexico people familiar with the companies plans said They include General Motors Cos new Chevrolet Cruze hatchback a successor to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Cos Focus compact and a replacement for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NVs Jeep Compass compact SUV The decisions are prompting three major automotive research firms who are often used by the automakers and their suppliers for industry forecasting to project a big increase in Mexican output of small cars by the three companies AutoForecast Solutions estimates that GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Fiat Chrysler will collectively produce percent of their small cars for the North American market in Mexico by up from percent in LMC Automotive sees the figure at percent also against percent last year while IHS Automotive projects the Mexican percentage going to percent in five years time though it calculates the level at a higher level than the others at percent In response to questions from Reuters the three automakers declined to discuss their specific plans GM said that the vast majority of its small cars sold in the US are produced domestically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>said it is committed to continuing to improve competitiveness and to invest where it makes the best sense for our business Fiat Chrysler said it has made no official announcements regarding the companys future production plans The Detroit automakers plans to build more small cars in Mexico are likely to be highly controversial ahead of the November US presidential election Businessman Donald Trump who is seeking to win the nomination to be the Republican presidential candidate has repeatedly blasted US companies including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for any moves to shift jobs to Mexico from the US and says he would support government incentives to keep auto production in the United States if he gets into the White House The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment It is also a huge issue for the US labor unions who have been highly critical of the impact of free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA with Mexico and Canada reached when Bill Clinton was US President in His wife Hillary Clinton is the leading contender to be the Democrats presidential candidate The Clinton campaign declined to comment United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams has faced criticism from union members that he has acquiesced to jobs going south For someone to suggest that we endorse products going to Mexico is just nonsense he wrote to UAW members last month The UAW declined a request for a comment for this story For the automakers it is largely a question of cost and margin They are determined to reduce costs in production of compact and midsize cars which already suffer from small profit margins or are losing money Overall US sales have been very strong in the past couple of years but larger vehicles such as SUVs and pickup trucks are the big beneficiaries because the plunge in gasoline prices means that fuel economy isnt as much of an issue for consumers as it was a few years back The larger vehicles typically generate profits of and more each The Big Three are also feeling the heat from foreign rivals including Nissan Motor Co and Volkswagen AG VOWG_pDE who have been adding production capacity in Mexico The margins on small cars may erode further if production remains in the US because new labor agreements negotiated by GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Chrysler grant the first raises in a decade to veteran workers and give recent hires a path to earn an hour after eight years on the job At the same time the Detroit automakers need to continue building and selling small cars to meet evertightening US fuel economy regulations because big pickups and SUVs have much lower mileage Mexican labor rates which averaged about an hour in are about a fifth of the wages auto workers earn in the United States according to the Center for Automotive Research CAR Sean McAlinden chief economist at CAR said GMs Orion Township assembly plant in Michigan which builds Chevrolet and Buick subcompacts has the lowest labor costs of any US plant thanks to a favorable agreement with the UAW negotiated as part of the US governments bailout of GM in And yet the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fiesta plant in Cuautitlan near Mexico City has a labor cost advantage per car over GMs Orion plant he said With small car sales waning GM recently announced layoffs at Orion According to sources at suppliers it is also expected to drop production of the Buick Verano next year Mexico is an increasingly attractive production base for a variety of reasons Its infrastructure supply base and productivity all have improved in recent years according to McAlinden A plunge in the Mexican peso against the dollar to almost to the Greenback from just over a year ago has also made the country more appealing for US manufacturers at least in the short term by reducing its relative costs On the downside shipping costs from Mexico remain high and energy sources can be unreliable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>confirmed last week in its tentative contract with the United Auto Workers union that it will stop building Focus compact cars at a factory in Wayne Michigan in UAW officials have said the replacement for the current Focus will be made in Mexico while the Michigan assembly plant is expected to start assembling a pickup truck and an SUV according to people familiar with Fords plans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has declined to say what vehicles it plans to build in Wayne Supplier sources also said that GM plans to build the Cruze hatchback in Mexico while the Cruze sedan will continue to be built in Ohio and that Fiat Chrysler has long planned to produce the Compass replacement in Mexico rather than in Illinois GM and Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on where the vehicles will be made Moving production of massmarket fuelefficient sedans to Mexico is a challenge to a goal the Obama administration stressed when it drove governmentfunded restructurings of GM and the former Chrysler in Gas prices had soared to a gallon or more during the financial crisis killing sales of Detroits trucks GM and Fiat Chrysler agreed to build small cars in the US as part of their governmentfunded bankruptcies Now profitable and free of government ownership their CEOs no longer must answer to the White House <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which restructured without federal help shifted US production toward more fuelefficient vehicles when truck sales swooned but now is ramping up US production of SUVs and pickups to meet robust demand Steven Rattner the investor who was the first head of the White House auto task force said the threat to US jobs was a concern then and now We were well aware of the situation with Mexico and the possibility that jobs would continue to migrate there he told Reuters Whats Next Tomorrows Digital Life Thomson Reuters is
