GMs Strength Point To An Earnings Beat For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha With less than a week to go before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reports earnings the company is gaining momentum If GM is any example we can expect to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>easily beat market expectations Some recent developments may affect forward outlook Average analyst estimates are low and have not been significantly revised following a wave of positive sales news There are clear signs the US automakers are gaining momentum Less than a month ago the industry reported recordbreaking sales well above expectations with positive forward outlook Sales in September let me remind you topped million on an annualized basis and were better than higher than last year at this time Today GM NYSE GM reported earnings far beyond analysts expectations and may be foreshadowing similar strength in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F GM just reported and reported strong as indicated by sales figures The surprise is in just how strong the company reported Despite a net loss attributable to shareholders of billion per share due to recalls and civil actions stemming from recallignition switch issues the company reported adjusted earnings of This beats consensus estimates by and better than last years Q earnings bringing the yeartodate total to over GMs performance is mostly due to strength in the US US EBIT topped billion offset by small losses in Europe and South America In terms of foreign exchange the company did report a negative impact Total revenues were negatively impacted by billion enough to cause concern but not enough to keep the stock from popping more than on the news breaking above resistance and hitting a fourmonth high The company execs had some good thing to say about the results the state of the turnaround and their expectations into the future GM CEO Mary Barra These results reflect our work to capitalize on our strengths in the US and China while taking decisive proactive steps to mitigate challenges elsewhere GM is a vastly different company today than just five years ago Were building a strong foundation driving earnings growth in our core business and executing a plan to lead the future of personal mobility all with the aim of creating shareholder value for years to come Chuck Stevens GM executive vice president and chief financial officer went on to add We expect our earnings to accelerate in the next several years with doubledigit earnings per share growth All of this is a preamble to Fords scheduled earnings release on I have already gone over my expectations for Fords earnings in my article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Is Going To so I wont rehash that here Let it suffice to say that sales trends and earnings projections are not in sink Data shows the company is performing much better than expected as is the broader auto market and on track to beat consensus estimates and report at or above the high end of the range And the analysts say consensus estimate is near per share for the current quarter Lowend estimates are closer to while the high end is Outlook for next quarter is good consensus estimate jumps a nickel to although the range of estimates widens Low estimate is with high estimate Over the last week in the face of all this great news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>no analyst has raised their forecast for the current quarter Only one has raised their forecast for next quarter In the last thirty days two have raised forecast for the current quarter and five have raised for the next quarter a little better but offset by downward revisions for both quarters Four analysts have lowered their estimates for the currentquarter earnings while three have lowered their forecast for the next quarter altogether providing plenty of opportunity for upward revisions andor upside earnings surprises this quarter and next A couple of new news items and company developments have occurred over the last week that may impact earnings estimates and forward outlook First a new report from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association shows that auto registrations are up in September and for the yeartodate period yet another sign of increasing momentum in the EU automobile market Fords YTD registrations are up The caveat is that market share slipped by a tenth to However despite the slip in market share it is clear that the company is performing well in Europe and progressing in its longterm plan to turn around operations in that region Just last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported that sales in the EU were up in September led by commercial vehicles increase Overall the registrations data is a major plus for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and raises the chance for earnings to be beat expectations Another development is a recall in China The joint venture Changan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automobiles recalled K vehicles over concern the fuel tanks may leak after use The recall is a concern but its cost will be a drop in the bucket compared to the billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>plans to spend on RD in China Perhaps of more immediate concern are some changes in management The first a change in legal counsel is not material to the companys performance Two others VPs of manufacturing in Asia and the EU may be of more concern Linda Cash replaces Jeff Wood who is retiring in the EU Bill Russo will replace Gary Johnson in Asia who is being recalled to head up a special project Both changes are inhouse promotions and expected to help with the integration of new technologies and costsaving measures into their respective programs So some new developments and two things to be wary of declining market share in the EU and the recall in China However the two negatives are minor worries compared to the aggregate positive impact of increasing momentum in the EU marketplace investment in RD and new management with the experience to extend Fords global turnaround Net impact of new developments is definitely positive in my book I thought my previous estimate was low but recent developments have made me rethink it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is more of a buy than ever The company is undervalued relative to its earnings potential and riding a strong wave of growth with positive outlook for continued growth into the next months On a PE basis alone we could expect to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gain as much as Trailing PE is near times earnings low compared to broader market but high compared to forward PE On a forward basis PE is closer to times earnings giving a target near If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>beats earnings as I suspect and is able to carry momentum into next year as projected it could easily go higher Average analyst price target is just with a high estimate of providing a window of opportunity for investors over the next year Oh and I forgot to mention the companys dividend yield is near at todays
