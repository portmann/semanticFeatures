auto demand will test US automakers General Motors Co and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Co as they try to funnel more cash to shareholders while still investing adequately in new vehicles and technology At a conference on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show the rivals outlined their strategies for an era of slower growth and rapid shifts in technology and consumer behavior As of Wednesday GM GMN was winning the referendum among investors with its shares up slightly while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>FN shares sank about percent Yet with investors concerned about the challenges facing the automakers shares of both companies remained well below the highs they hit during the past weeks Some of these issues such as the ups and downs of the sales cycle and pressure to make cars safer are as old as the car industry itself Others are still not clearly understood for instance the transformation of cars into digital devices and selling to consumers who want to buy rides instead of cars Automakers face a challenging future where per cent of the value of a car is software and content said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas who has a sell rating on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and is restricted from covering GM With Chinas market uncertain and US vehicle sales at a peak more investors will say its a pretty good time to sell automaker shares he said GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and two of her top executives outlined plans to return to shareholders a total of billion for the period of through In March GM agreed to return a total of billion in share repurchases and increased dividends through the end of If GM carries out the plan the oncebankrupt automaker will have returned to shareholders about billion between and the end of or about percent of free cash flow Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said Top <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>executives announced a special dividend of billion but cautioned that margins in its North American auto market could plateau at about percent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM executives faced questions from analysts about how they will juggle investments needed to keep global product lines competitive while forging into new and riskier ventures involving ride sharing and autonomous vehicles In addition to giving investors more cash GM President Dan Ammann said the company plans by late this decade to reduce capital spending as a share of revenue below the current rate of percent to percent In the past such buybacks and capital spending cuts would have hurt GMs efforts to develop competitive new models But Barra and Ammann said now the company can do more with less For instance Ammann cited GMs plan to invest billion to work with its Chinese partner to engineer a lowcost vehicle architecture for developing markets This will replace a hodgepodge of vehicles currently produced with different tools and dies and components Once new vehicle architectures such as the emerging markets car are engineered we will be able to run those assets for a long time Ammann said adding basic architectures could used for the next decadeplus In the short run though the strain will show as automakers work to keep vehicles fresh comply with new regulatory demands for cleaner cars and fend off challenges from Silicon Valley disruptors such as the Uber ride sharing service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>executives cautioned Tuesday that margins in the

drivers and car makers Fields said new technologyenabled service businesses could provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with sources of revenue that are less cyclical than auto sales Investors however are watching a flattening sales cycle Industry veterans say a slide in sales is inevitable China and the United States the worlds No and auto markets have hit plateaus after six years of robust growth Industry executives are forecasting slower expansion this year in both markets albeit from record levels We still are very strong on China said Barra Long term she said the Chinese auto market could grow to million vehicles from about million currently For now she said Its going to be very volatile Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and David Gregorio General Motors Chairman and
