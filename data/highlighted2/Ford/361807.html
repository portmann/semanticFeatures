<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company Sorry I Misunderstood Your Debt For So Long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is an iconic car brand which I have overlooked as an investment for many years Originally concerns over its dividend kept me at arms length then it shifted to concerns over debt levels Fs debt is however more complicated than most of its automotive peers Dig a little deeper and the companys debt load is actually far more attractive you just need to understand it better <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F has not really featured on my investing watchlist Part of this is due to my personal circumstances My relationship with car brands is not generally a strong one I have not nor plan to any time soon owned a car myself I hire cars frequently Yet as a result I can find myself as likely to be sitting behind a Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY General Motors NYSE GM Toyota NYSE TM Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU or indeed any number of other brands as much as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Nonetheless this is not the major reason it has failed to make my watchlist Prior to the last few years the chief reason for this absence has been quite simply a matter of dividends Fords recent record has hardly been stellar Recent growth has seen it at least catching my eye again Yet I have remained turnedoff by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still Why Well chiefly because each time I have taken the time to look at the business the debt levels have warned me off Yet recently I have had cause to question my historic overlooking of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>due to its debt Let me explain why First lets take a look at why Fords debt has previously pushed me away from it Quite frankly from a superficial glance its total debt is not a pretty sight Mammoth debt levels combined with pretty rapid growth in recent years are not something I like to see What is more set against equity levels it looks even less pretty A debttoequity ratio of over is high on an absolute basis On a relative basis it hardly looks any more moderate Between them General Motors Toyota and Fiat Chrysler average a debttoequity ratio around the mark High again but tiny in comparison to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Yet there is more to Fords debt story that needs to be clarified I need to take the companys advice and Go Further with my focus on Fords debt Recently there was a catalyst for a new appreciation of Fords debt position A short time ago my car hire company provided me with a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the first in about three years and it reminded me I had not looked into the company at all for some time With Fords Q results freshly out I sat down and read through the earnings transcript In it Fords CFO Bob Shanks commented that A number of articles continue to be written about the very high leverage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company and generally that point of view is because people are taking this automotive debt theyre adding it to the financial services debt But thats not the way that investors should look at Its also not the way that the credit rating agencies look at it The key one in terms of the leverage of the company and the one that the credit rating agencies look at is the billion automotive debt and this is the lowest its been since and its representative of a very good leverage position by the company along with where we stand on pensions and other things that the credit rating agencies look at This got me interested It is easy to forget that in reality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is pretty much two companies wrapped into one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automotive and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automotive is the iconic car manufacturer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit in contrast is a financial services company which helps provide auto loans to buy the cars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>managed to hold onto its credit business during the nasty auto crisis from to The other main US automakers were forced to spinoff their auto loans arms General Motors finance arm eventually became Ally NYSE ALLY Fiat Chrysler in contrast sold its arm eventually becoming TD Auto Finance after TorontoDominion Bank NYSE TD purchased it Needless to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit provides people with loans to help buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit builds up debt levels This debt is used to loan out to customers at a higher interest rate They then repay their debt as do <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit keeping the additional interest as profit And quite some profit Whilst Automotive pulled in billion in income in Credit pulled in a further billion Yet should we really worry too unduly about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credits debt After all is this not good debt in that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gets back in interest more than it pays on that debt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>certainly thinks so As Shanks added If you think about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit is selffunding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit also selfliquidates in a downturn at lower volume The selfliquidating comment is particularly interesting In downturns people buy fewer cars Fewer people buying means fewer people taking out auto loans Yet those already taken out continue to be repaid except some defaulters Consequently new debt provided by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit slows yet outstanding debt will continue to decline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credits debt therefore winds down Naturally the opposite occurs during strong markets for car sales More sales more auto loans higher debt taken at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit Consequently we should expect to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit growing debt in strong markets and shrinking debt in weaker ones Whilst debt may be a bloodsucking presence for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automotive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit it is a necessary bloodflowing presence This all has important implications for assessing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>from a debt perspective To understand the companys debt health we need to first separate the debt it holds So how much of Fords debt is held by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit Well increasingly the Automotive element of the debt has been shrinking as a proportion of total company debt Partly this has been due to growing debt at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automotive debt has also been declining noticeably over the same period Automotive debt which as Shanks highlighted is the measure credit agencies focus upon is therefore tracking the exact trend I like to see for debt down Taken by itself the debttoequity ratio for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automotive is down to under after being at just shy of in This incidentally is much more in line with its carmaking peers Clearly there is a great deal of nuance hidden in Fords hefty debt load Unlike most of its peers which were forced to offload their loan businesses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which managed just to avoid bankruptcy was able to hold onto it Yet this has made it a peculiar business in its own sector Debt matters really bring that to the fore What is clear is that I have been wrong to overlook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>based on its debt position Had I taken the time to get passed the superficial figures and ascertain the composition of the debt I would have no doubt investigated further Would I invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>right now As yet I am not entirely sure I would have to take the time to do a more indepth analysis of its performance recently Yet this analysis has at least allowed me to see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>certainly deserves a more detailed look Instinctively I still dislike debt at this level The companys specific debt situation however at least requires me to give this iconic car brand a little more of my research time It may
