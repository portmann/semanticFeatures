Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has edged from sales record to sales record over the last months Nonetheless shares are down percent over the same time The Barrons publication is out with a bullish piece on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>arguing that the auto company has percent upside potential I agree with Barrons in terms of Fords low valuation but think a lack of positive catalysts and poor investor sentiment are serious obstacles for capital appreciation Over the last twentyfour months I have covered no other company more extensively on Seeking Alpha than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F Mr Market has not had much love for automakers during this time even though I have had high hopes for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor for obvious reasons <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has edged from one sales record to the next over the last two years with strong sales gains on the back of growing SUV and pickup demand extending into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor crushed sales expectations in February with YY vehicle sales growth in the United States exceeding percent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor also sold percent more vehicles in March than a year ago but the auto maker missed the consensus sales growth estimate of percent While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor was edging from sales record to sales record an investment in the auto company did very little for shareholders other than throwing off a dividend over the last twentyfour months As a matter of fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares crashed percent in the last two years In fairness <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has paid a growing dividend during this time and even declared a special dividend of billion or share in the first quarter As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors dividend yield jumped to percent at the beginning of the year Though Fords sales have risen to decadehighs Fords valuation has not risen in lockstep This is because Mr Market expected for quite a while now that automakers are approaching a cyclical falloff in vehicle sales thereby pricing lower sales and earnings rates into Fords shares The result is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares sell for x e earnings thereby implying a significant margin of safety While I have made my peace with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor likely going sideways this year my month price target for Fords shares is Barrons is out with a new piece on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor thats worth reading Essentially Barrons says that automakers including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor and General Motors NYSE GM can climb higher because of efficiency gains and because of their low valuations As a result so Barrons both automakers have percent upside or more Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor sells for just x e earnings there surely is a point to be made for capital appreciation On the other hand others have beat that drum including me for years with very little to show for it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor and General Motors are unlikely IMO to trade significantly higher in because of a lack of positive catalysts that could ignite a shift in investor sentiment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is worth buying for the dividend as far as I am concerned but buying purely for capital growth might yield unsatisfying results moving forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a very appealing dividend but one cant ignore the decline in Fords total investment value over the last two years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is cheap for a reason expected cyclical sales and earnings contraction A lack of catalysts and absence of fundamental reasons for a change in investor sentiment will remain formidable obstacles for price appreciation While I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is worth buying for its nearterm potential for price appreciation Barrons is right about Fords low valuation and shares are surely worth buying for the handsome percent dividend Buy for income I wrote this article myself and it expresses my
