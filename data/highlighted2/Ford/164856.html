lot of money but Disney should find ways to maximize the gross Attaching a premium to ticket prices for the opening weekend might be a consideration perhaps people might be willing to spend over for a ticket Disney shareholders as well as theater owners would stand to benefit from considering the opening weekend of this highlyanticipated film a special product all its own We all know that Star Wars The Force Awakens is going to be a big hit It will bring in a huge amount of boxoffice dollars but at some point its simply going to do whatever its going to do Theres no way to know exactly how much advertising is necessary to ensure the best return on investment Yet Disney NYSE DIS management in consultation with the major exhibition chains should still attempt to figure out ways to maximize the potential of the seventh episode in the Star Wars saga Its a rather special product considering the fact that Carrie Fisher Harrison <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Mark Hamill are coming back to the big screen to play the roles that made them not only famous but also helped to usher in a new era of blockbuster cinematic entertainment Heres one way to do it charge a higher price for tickets for the first weekend of the films release Nevertheless I stick by the suggestion Why not People will be gathering in long lines many hours before the first showings begin They will be spending a premium already to see the movie just by using their time to wait to me this displays a willingness to pay a premium for firstweekend tickets Considering how much the core fan base is willing to spend on some of the merchandise out there eg that BB thing I think it makes sense that those same fans would be willing to pay more for the ultimate merchandise the experience of seeing Awakens very early in its release What should the ticket prices cost then Its an interesting question to me because as a Disney shareholder I would love to know what the company could reasonably charge for those first three days Im thinking somewhere around for nonDIMAX showings and between and for the DIMAX screens The price elasticity would be a concern Its probable that less people would show up during the first weekend it would be challenging to hit a record opening Its also possible that a negative effect on concession sales might occur This wouldnt be so bad because studios would not mind getting a percentage of that revenue Essentially a high ticket price might transfer some of the popcorncandy sales over to the studios on the theory that consumers only have so many dollars to spend and are giving Awakens a lofty valuation It also might cannibalize retail merchandise sales something Disney would not be so happy about However it might also effectively turn people seeing the film into repeat viewers The goal of any blockbuster is to have the same consumer see the film multiple times Charging a lot for tickets helps to ensure that this goal is met even if many of the people who do show a willingness to allocate more money for the openingweekend privilege only see Awakens once Lets think further about this Lets say a lot of people decide to wait until the next weekend to see the film or maybe the theaters start to become really full once the cheaper tickets go on sale the Monday after the first weekend Perhaps that first weekend really becomes Weekend Zero a very expensive preview showing Theres been a lot of talk about releasing movies at theaters and on home video at the same time or dating the video release a few weeks after the theatrical debut If you go with the former approach then you would have to deal with not only cannibalization concerns but also with theater companies who are against the idea However charging higher ticket prices allows theater owners to get more revenue as well and avoids competition with a home video release The simultaneousrelease approach and the highticketprice approach have the same goals collect more money more quickly The highticketprice approach might be a viable solution The point is that Awakens is only going to debut once in the marketplace and it would seem obligatory on the part of Disney and theater owners to do something unique with the release to maximize the gross Would consumers loudly angrily balk at the idea of paying for a ticket to Awakens Most likely Would they still go and see the film no matter what they say Presumably it might simply concentrate the younger demos who tend to patronize the multiplex on opening weekends these younger demos might be less pricesensitive and thus would be the more valuable consumer base for the experiment Disney and theater owners should attempt to do something though so as not to leave too much money on the table At the very least there should be no matinee prices or other forms of discounting for the first weekend Disney owes its shareholders that much Disclosure I amwe are long DIS MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses
