class='textDiv'>Scanning The SA Family For Alpha Ubsb Seeking Alpha Jun AM ET Includes AAPL COP CVX ED F GE HCP JNJ KO ORI PG STWD T XOM by Regarded Solutions I wrote an article on why I was selling my Apple shares and it sparked a debate that still lingers Is Apple a growth stock an income stock or is it destined to become a dividend aristocrat As a DGI approach I made my case as to why I was selling AAPL in favor of ATT This is the second article of this series which will highlight one or two comments from around all of Seeking Alpha that will help everyone engage together in the process OF Seeking Alpha Here is last weeks article to review in case you missed it The goal of the authors here is to present an opinion that is backed up by supportive facts or some evidence and create a thesis to explain an actionable idea for themselves and perhaps for many other investors to consider as they seek alpha This is the second article in my collaboration with Seeking Alpha to engage with all readers and commenters and tap the entire community to help everyone become better investors In April I wrote this article that quickly became a lightning rod for all sorts of investors on why I was selling my small amount of shares of Apple NASDAQ AAPL to purchase more shares of ATT NYSE T Not only did the article receive tens of thousands of page views but it also drew over comments from the SA community and all were of various opinions of course and some even told me how dumb I was I wont argue that point because I can be as dumb as the next guy but let me tell you what I did The Frothy Market Beginners Portfolio consists of the following stocks as of today Exxon Mobil NYSE XOM Johnson Johnson JNJ CocaCola NYSE KO Procter Gamble NYSE PG ATT Chevron NYSE CVX Con Edison NYSE ED Apple and General Electric NYSE GE HCP Inc NYSE HCP <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F ConocoPhillips NYSE COP Old Republic International NYSE ORI and Starwood Property Trust NYSE STWD I jettisoned CVX but replaced it with more shares of XOM after it was revealed that CVX would be freezing its dividend for who knows how long To me that is the antithesis of dividend growth Overall the move was supported by the SA community On the heels of that I reduced my overall energy exposure by selling COP and opening a new position in Realty Income NYSE O Again this was supported by the SA community via the comment thread and I wound up with more overall annual income after making these moves which is the goal of this portfolio AAPL is the largest company in the world and its staggering growth has been the envy of the markets for over a decade now It also began paying a dividend nearly years ago placing it in a position to become a dividend champion contender When an investor digs beneath the surface they can see that even with glowing marks on all fronts the DGIer would be hardpressed to make a sufficient case for holding Apple as an immediate income provider for retirees or those nearing retirement who are seeking as much income as possible as quickly as possible to fund a more secure retirement With its most recent increase the shares I held paid me a grand total of for I had made money on the shares and was able to redeploy the money from that stock directly into more shares of T which immediately paid me more income as I reduced my T cost basis at the same time and increased my cash reserves The response via the comment thread was deafening to say the least and I found two comments that encapsulated the debate with fewer words and far better input than many of the longer comments that said the same thing As a matter of fact this readercommenter should become an author as one of the best qualities is to say what you mean in an understandable way as possible in as few words as necessary to drive home your point Ive sold apple shares in the past and regretted it months later I believe you are making a mistake Total return is more important than income If you need cash just sell some shares Simple and direct even though I disagree with it Just my own opinion but I believe the yield on Apple shares is low because of the great performance of the shares I wouldnt say thats something to complain about Id rather have a company that has a better ability to pay dividends than one who doesnt yet still gives out dividends Apple is by far the best company that has the ability to pay dividends and issue buy backs I actually agree with this comment even if it did not persuade me to change my actions Truth be told this commenter was more right than I was being wrong about selling my shares Why Well as this commenter points out the performance of the shares has everything to do with the yield being low He is obviously correct When Apple shares split it was selling for share which at todays dividend rate of share would have translated to a yield of nailbitingly close to If it had backed off from that price the yield would be in my sweet spot of OVER but the company performance was such that the share price moved over from that point and thus it has a yield right now The other point was the ability for Apple to continue paying and presumably increase dividends as well as buy back its own shares This is another completely accurate fact that supports this bright young mans comment Apple is sitting on about billion in cash and equivalents which can buy up more of its own shares than anyone or any other company anywhere and that is powerful The company has a current payout ratio of just which is ridiculously low and a signal to most DGIers that this company can sustain its dividend and increase it for many years to come These are very accurate facts that support this commenters opinion and should be weighed by everyone when making a decision such as mine At the time of the sale before it raised its dividend Apple was paying me to hold the stock and I had already made a decent profit on it I believe I sold it for about where it trades today and purchased more shares of T at a bargain price ish in my opinion with a dividend of per share annually Based on the goals of this portfolio it made more sense to me to increase my income immediately from to annually reduce my cost basis on T while taking some gains in AAPL and even increasing my cash reserves The input from this one reader is essential for investors to make an informed decision as to whether my actions make sense or not for their individual needs Not everyone has the same goals or strategies and while I disagreed the power of the SA family especially its readerscommenters should be weighed just as much if not more than a single authors opinion The question for the community is do you think Apple is Still a rapid growth company suited for a retirement portfolio An income stock that will produce strong enough dividends to make an impact within a retirement portfolio of a DGI A company that is now worth per share based on Carl Icahns open letter to Time Cook and should ramp up its share buyback plans or immediately increase the dividend significantly as well as pay a special dividend much like Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT did about years ago per share Your input is valuable to the community and investors of all types We look forward to your thoughts about this particular issue Source Scanning The SA Family For Alpha Ubsb
