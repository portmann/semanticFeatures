financial results before we open the call up for QA Thanks Brendan and thanks everyone for joining us this morning Our second quarter results reflect important progress in the execution of our strategy After significant portfolio high grading last year we are now driving organic growth Following seven consecutive quarters of liquids growth since launching our strategy we continue to improve well performance lower cost and increased well inventory in our four strategic assets the Permian Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Duvernay and Montney We exited the second quarter with significant operational momentum and we expect to accelerate liquids growth through the second half of this year We are on track to achieve million of operating and capital cost efficiencies by yearend and we believe that about twothirds of these savings will be sustainable in a higher price environment During the quarter we used the net proceeds from our March equity issuance along with cash on hand to retire approximately billion of longterm debt This brings our total debt redemption since the launch of our strategy in November of to about billion We are proactively managing the business through the current environment and we continue to drive efficiency through innovation and capture opportunities to further reduce costs improve cash flow and strengthen the balance sheet Like others we did see some impact in the quarter from adverse weather and flooding in Texas and third party facility constraints and pipeline outages impacted our Montney operations These issues are largely behind us as we are well on our way to ramping up production in the Permian and Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>where we expect to bring on approximately wells in July and an additional wells over the balance of the third quarter We remain on track to meet our fourth quarter production target of barrels of oil equivalent per day from our four strategic assets We expect that liquids production from these assets will be up more than when compared to the fourth quarter of Consistent with our strategy to transition the portfolio towards higher margin production we expect our four strategic assets will contribute about of total production in the fourth quarter These four assets are located in the core of four of the highest margin and return basins in North America and they continue to deliver competitive returns through the current commodity price environment For the year we expect the Permian Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Duvernay to deliver a weighted average operating margin of about per barrel of oil equivalent with the Montney delivering an operating margin of around per Mcfe These assets are also generating strong returns at current prices Across the four assets we expect to deliver rates of return greater than using a WTI oil price and a per MMBtu NYMEX gas price Through our relentless focus on innovation we continue to seize opportunities to enhance our performance We plan to continue to focus our remaining capital to these four assets I will now turn the call over to Mike McAllister who will talk about some of our very encouraging operating results we delivered during the quarter You will also find additional assets specific information in our updated corporate presentation that will be at our Web site shortly Mike Thank you Doug Lets start with the Permian We are very pleased with the progress todate We have moved from being an early adapter to a lead innovator from above ground and below ground For example in Q our fracs were larger than the average from other Midland basin operators We are evaluating the impact of these completions on well performance and returns We are also piloting managed pressure flowbacks to test the impact on oil IP and oil EUR and therefore returns Also we have discussed on our last call we had introduced simultaneous drilling and completion operations on our horizontal pads This has reduced our spud to initial production times by approximately days This lowers cost and speeds the time to positive cash flow therefore improving returns Weve done this while overcoming the challenges associated with the new asset and unusual weather conditions in January and May In Q we ran six horizontal and six vertical rigs placing Encana as the most active operator in the Midland basin We rig released net horizontal and net vertical wells The horizontals are targeted at the Wolfcamp and Spraberry zones in Martin Midland Upton Glasscock and Howard counties Vertical ph wells include TXL and Davidson wells which are on production at Boe per day and Boe per day respectively We are very focused on efficiencies Our horizontal rig fleet has now been fully converted to fitforpurpose rigs The multiwell pads have dropped well cost by Our pacesetter well is now a day drill We are targeting million drilling and completion costs This includes approximately of incremental costs associated with higher intensity completions As we learn more on how these wells perform we will refine the completions to deliver better returns We have recently entered into an oil gathering agreement and we expect that about half of our production will be tighten by yearend By enhancing the reliability of our production and significantly reducing trucking our operating margins will improve by up to per barrel Production growth will accelerate in the second half of starting with wells coming on production in Q July month todate we now have horizontal wells on production This years drilling program is evaluating our well inventory across all five countries where we hold indiscernible and Midland basin Results todate support our type curve assumption We currently have four horizontal and five vertical rigs working in the Permian We plan to keep drilling activity Technical Difficulty for the rest of the year As I mentioned previously we have been managing the flowing pressure of our wells Our objective is to maintain flowing pressure above bubble point by restricting production rates We are evaluating the impact of this pressure management on our oil EUR and our oil IP rigs to maximize value Generally speaking we are drawing our wells down half as fast as it was being done by our previous operator With another net wells expected to come on production in the second half we expect Permian production to average over Boe per day in Q Its now been one year since we acquired our position in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and we are very excited about how our team is drilling the value of the asset For example by making significant improvements to our artificial lift systems the decline rate on our base production has been reduced by about half of what we expected at the time of the acquisition We also made great progress in reducing our DC costs by almost When we acquired the position DC costs were million per well In Q we averaged million Costs are expected to fall further to million in the second half of this year In fact we have just recently completed indiscernible A well at a cost of just million Although this was a little shorter lateral at feet we are very pleased with this result We are currently running two rigs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and expect to continue at this level through the second half of this year In the Kenedy area we have just brought on stream a Patton Trust South facility which increases our processing capacity in the area by about Boe per day With our PTS facility now ramping up we expect our total Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production will be exceeding Boe a day shortly This represents a increase I should say from when we began indiscernible program in Q Weve also been doing a lot of work to expand our well inventory in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>A year ago we pegged our well inventory at about wells Since then weve drilled over horizontal wells Today with our new understanding of the Graben and assuming average well spacing of to acres our undrilled well inventory stands at over locations This is a increase since we acquired the asset We expect our well inventory to further increase once we get a better working knowledge of the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In the first quarter conference call we indicated that Graben had improvement in day production rates with a corresponding doubling of EURs to about Boe per well Results from our Graben wells have continued to impress with the best wells so far peaking at over Boe per day We continue to dramatically reduce our costs in Duvernay For the first time our DC costs are now below million per well We are now targeting below million per well on our next pad We are very excited about the impressive well performance weve seen from our multiwell pads Our well is on production at barrels per day of condensate and million a day of rich gas after days of production Our first four wells from our latest pads have been brought on stream at an average of Boe per day which is made up of barrels a day of condensate and million a day of rich gas There are seven more wells to bring on from these two pads We should also note that these production rates are producing at over PSI flowing pressure These two wells are over and above the results that were featured in a recent independent research report that pegged our Duvernay supply cost at a barrel Weve successfully repeated our dualfrac spread program By operating two frac spreads on the same multiwell pad were able to maximize run time and pump nearly x Technical Difficulty per day than we can with a single spread This innovation has resulted in approximately of savings per well Furthermore we were able to reduce our spud to initial production time by about a month The startup of a water infrastructure has also enabled us to reduce well costs by over million per well and improve our operating margin by about per Boe We have now identified about locations in Simonette alone Our drilling program this year focused on very rich condensate window These wells have condensate gas ratios between to barrels per million and represent of our total inventory Similar to other areas we are working hard to improve well performance and were seeing outstanding results The graph on the lower left shows the average performance of eight wells that came on production in Q For these eight wells production rates ramped up to an average of barrels per day of condensate and million a day of rich gas In addition we have four recent wells from the and to pads that have higher intensity completions These wells are outperforming type curve expectations The well is included in this group and as I mentioned earlier is producing at Boe per day after almost days The condensate rates for the other three wells in the group are barrels per day barrels per day and barrels per day Each of these wells is flowing at greater than PSI In the current oil and gas price environment were frequently asked if our Duvernay operations are commercial These results prove they clearly are The unlevered return on the well at todays prices is With improvement on cost and well performance combined with the favorable royalty rate in Duvernay we are excited about the returns we have generated In addition to the strong unlevered economics we would expect to see joint venture carry continue through the end of Were pleased to report on a new condensate rich area on the Montney in an area we call Dawson South Here we are seeing Montney wells in the heart of our Cutbank lands producing to barrels a day of condensate and million a day of gas One of the first wells we drilled in Dawson South has produced at a restricted rate of barrels a day of condensate and million a day of gas for over days As a reminder prices for both Montney and Duvernay condensate enjoy Technical Difficulty prices Between Dawson South and our condensate rich lands in Tower area we now have greater than condensate rich locations in Cutbank When combined with our Alberta condensate rich inventory we now have more than undrilled condensate rich locations in the Montney Our current DC target is million In Q our average base ph costs have been reduced by compared to Q We have continued to see efficiencies and set a new record this quarter in our Tower area with the spud to release of just nine days All five wells in the pad were days or less spudtorig release As youll see on the next slide we continue to optimize our completion designs and we are seeing uplift in IP and EUR The compressor station came on production ahead of schedule and under budget This station which we operate is part of our midstream arrangement with Veresen is designed to handle million a day of gas and barrels a day of condensate As Doug alluded to we have experienced some curtailment and restrictions on the TCPL system Currently we are experiencing no curtailments For the remainder of the year we anticipate there may be intermittent disruptions We commonly hear our Montney position describes a dry gas asset In reality we have built a large exposure to condensate in the asset and now have about condensate rich locations of these locations are wells with greater than barrels per million of free condensate At million a day this equates to barrels a day of condensate Our total undrilled well inventory in Montney now stands at locations The significant increase in liquids rich wells in the Montney inventory gives us a new option in our portfolio for condensate growth from Tower Dawson and Pipestone Various reports published by investment banks indicate we have drilled some of the best condensaterich and gas wells in Canada this year In we reduced our cluster spacing to feet and realized a uplift in well productivity compared to our original slickwater design This year the team is focused on doubling proppant concentration from to pounds per foot By doubling the tonnage we expect an additional increase in overall well productivity Our latest completions have resulted in a restricted gas rate flat at million a day for over days Our target is to increase the capability of our well sites to flow million a day These well results are generating very competitive returns on an unlevered basis In addition we expect the joint venture partnership carry to continue through In Pipestone we drilled two oil wells that came on production in the quarter at over barrels per day As well we have notable results in our carry ph program at San Juan We had six transverse wells come on production at barrels a day which is improvement over our original oblique well design Thanks Mike and good morning everyone As Mike illustrated we delivered solid results in the second quarter We continue to build momentum in our operations and expect to accelerate liquids production growth through the second half of the year We have delivered significant yearoveryear growth in oil and NGL volumes with average production of about barrels per day during the quarter an increase of compared to the second quarter of and about higher than our Q volumes Natural gas volumes were down about yearoveryear largely due to the impact of our seasonal operating strategy at Deep Panuke as well as divestitures the TCPL outages third party facility turnaround and natural declines Q cash flow of million decline by about million compared to the first quarter of this year Approximately half of that decline can be attributed to our seasonal operating strategy at Deep Panuke The other half can be attributed to our million cash outlay associated with the early debt redemption This is expected to save us about million in future interest expense During the quarter we received million from net divestitures which brings our yeartodate net divestiture proceeds to million This further simplifies our business and the assets sold had very little impact on both production and cash flow We updated our hedging program during the quarter layering on oil hedges So now we have roughly barrels per day at about per barrel and slightly increasing our oil hedges to roughly barrels per day at about per barrel Our natural gas hedge position remains unchanged Similar to Q we recorded a billion aftertax impairment charge that impacted our second quarter net earnings The ceiling test impairment primarily resulted from the decline in months average trailing commodity prices This is noncash charge It does not reflect the fair value of the assets We remain on track to achieve our guidance and expect cash flow to come in at the mid to high end of the billion to billion range When we combined our expected cash flow with the net divestiture proceeds we have already received this year we expect cash inflows to exceed our planned capital expenditures and dividends by about million As we indicated last quarter our plan was to invest roughly twothirds of our capital budget in the first half of the year Our Q yeartodate spending of almost billion was in line with our expectations We remain very disciplined and focused to approach capital allocation Maintaining financial flexibility is very important to us If we have additional finance capacity in the second half of the year strengthening our balance sheet would be our first priority We would then consider accelerating activity in our four strategic assets depending on market conditions The only change to our guidance this quarter is the reduction of our DDA rates reflecting the impact of the impairment charge incurred during the quarter If any additional impairment charges are incurred throughout the remaining remainder of the year we expect our DDA rate to be further reduced Our focus on efficiency is a key part of building a highperforming and cost efficient company that is resilient through the price cycle We are delivering on the efficiency in costs reduction targets that are build into our guidance This includes a improvement or about million of capital cost efficiencies plus million of direct operating cost savings We expect that twothirds of the capital savings are sustainable going forward even if commodity prices rise These sustainable savings rise from the changes to how we drill complete and tie in our wells For example across the Permian Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Duvernay we will be selfsourcing proppant chemicals and managing the logistics inhouse Our work with bits motors and casing design continues to drop days from our drilling programs Our completion engineers continue to reduce maintenance times to drop days from our competition programs In the Permian and Duvernay our simultaneous operations reduced the number of days on location We have also recently completed a corporate restructuring to continue to align our structure with our more focused portfolio and disciplined capital investment program Since we launched our strategy in November of we have reduced our staff count by people and our overhead costs have been reduced by a third or million per year Going forward we expect that our clean GA excluding items such as restructuring costs and longterm incentive costs will average around million per quarter Since our average interest expense is down by basis points due to our net repayments and implementation of our billion US commercial paper program As a result we have reduced our interest expense on debt by a third or million per year Based on current debt levels we expect that our interest expense on debt will average about million per quarter Our commitment to maximize the efficiencies has set us up well as we begin to plan for next year When we combine durable cost reductions with the increased focus in capital allocation and a leaner workforce the dollars we spend in should generate higher returns Our debt position improved significantly during the quarter with the repayment of billion of longterm debt We also recently amended and extended our revolving bank credit facility of billion which are committed until July of We remain and expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenant in our credit agreements which requires our debt to adjusted capitalization to be less than As of June this ratio came in well below that requirement at Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important aspect of our strategy We have been very proactive in our efforts to increase liquidity and financial flexibility and we believe that we are well positioned for and beyond Our actions have strengthened our balance sheet enhanced our credit metrics and provided greater flexibility for the execution of our strategy Thanks Sherri As we look forward to the rest of the year we remain intensely focused on operational execution and on capturing further efficiencies We continue to drill better wells capture sustainable cost reductions and increase the well inventory in our four strategic assets Our Montney is a lowcost prolific play with growing liquids volumes Our Duvernay is combining dramatic cost reductions and impressive well performance Our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>inventory has almost doubled as we improve efficiency And our Permian is demonstrating strong well performance as cost drop and production growth accelerates Our frontend loaded capital program has positioned us to significantly accelerate liquids growth in the second half of and we remain on track to deliver our fourth quarter production target of Boe per day from the Permian Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Duvernay and Montney combined The quality of these four assets along with our proven technical expertise is generating strong margins and robust returns This makes us competitive at all points in the commodity price cycle We continue to successfully execute and enhance our strategy Our second quarter results highlight the quality of our portfolio the discipline of our capital program and our commitment to maintaining a solid balance sheet Thanks Good morning I guess a couple of questions The first one is just in terms of your targeted DC costs that youre outlining in your slide deck Is your expectation that you would be there by yearend or before Yes Greg Ill just make a couple of comments and hand it over to Mike I think first in some cases were already delivering if you will our pacesetter wells are already hitting our target cost but in all cases we expect to be delivering average cost in those range by the time we reach the end of the year Yes absolutely Doug Hi Greg I mean every one of our plays we actually is have an example pacesetter well thats actually already hit those target costs and the teams are working on an idea in terms of how to drive those costs down further We have a track record of performance on driving our drilling and completion costs down and feel really confident about that Okay Thanks for that I guess the second question is the big four plays as you mentioned about Boe a day It is substantially higher obviously than where you were in Q Can you just walk us through what needs to happen I guess particularly in the third quarter to put you in good stead to meet those numbers Yes Greg If you look at the shape of our program this year we had a very heavily frontend loaded capital program and thats very obvious now that you see our first two quarters of capital That was really driven by two factors One is is we actually closed down our capital program and all of our assets other than those four And that capital represented about of our total capital and largely those programs are now stopped with very few exceptions The second is is the Permian a great example I think we entered the year running about six horizontal rigs and I think as Mike already mentioned were running four and anticipate running that through the end of the year So thats the shape of the capital program The production ramp up particularly in the Permian and the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is second half loaded largely because of two things One is is weve gone to multiwell pads in the Permian and because of that obviously it takes a little longer to bring the wells on production because in general were drilling four well pads We have to drill the four wells and complete them We have gone to this simultaneous operation to speed that process up The second thing weve done is I think Mike mentioned this as well in his comments were pumping lot larger fracs even than we originally planned when we bought the asset in November of last year And those wells take about days to clean up to days to get the peak grade But as Mike mentioned weve got a big ramp up in well count underway right now So the wells he talked about we drilled in the quarter are largely just now coming on production And then in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we had to expand one of our batteries quite significantly Mike mentioned this Patton Trust South That actually started up on the th of July and thats a massive facility Boe a day and I think Mike maybe you can clarify I think were over half that full rate now in that new facility Yes you bet Yes we have new wells wells in total We have of those wells on production and ramping up So were in pretty good shape In fact in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>right now on the total were just under Boe per day in production Currently okay And you wouldnt have a current production number like the cost to the big four would you At the top of my head I think the Permian is running around Boe a day just now and I would have to we can try and follow up the other two the Duvernay and the Montney But I think as Mike mentioned Q in the Montney was impacted by a third party gas plant Turner and they took longer than they thought and then the TCPL NEB program The good news is there those curtailments have recently been lifted and were optimistic well have less impact in the second half of the year Good morning everyone A couple questions on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and forgive me if theyre a little bit ignorant but the Graben area is there multistack potential there I dont think theres Austin Chalk in that area but is that just lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>potential in that area And then maybe just talk about what youve included if any for Austin Chalk wells in the I guess over well inventory total in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Thanks Yes Mike I think that when we refer to the Graben area its in the oil window For instance this Patton Trust South that weve been doing a lot of work is in the gas condensate window But in the Graben area we actually when were talking about our current inventory increase thats really just driven by one indiscernible leaving that Graben and those Graben wells are going to be economic into tighter spacing Were planning to test the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the fourth quarter of this year but we actually are counting our inventory doesnt count that and we have no Austin Chalk wells in that inventory So both the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the Austin Chalk are both upside Okay And then in the gas condensate window Doug Im assuming its sort of on trend with what other guys have in drilling Austin Chalk wells Is that fair to say Yes and Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells Some of our offset operators as youve seen have been testing both the Austin Chalk and the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in that area Not right now not this year Right now our plans are to test the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this year Were evaluating the Austin Chalk and well see about whether we include that next year Hi guys Just maybe a quick one on the Permian I wondering if you guys still think youre on track to meet the low end of guidance there Obviously we have the first two quarters in hand and youve talked about before at Its difficult to get the low end if I do the math there Yes Mike I think where were at is for the full year right were a little behind what we thought we were going to be largely because of doing the multiwell pads and the bigger fracs But we still think if you recall we still believe well hit our Boe a day number Just as a reminder when we bought the asset it was producing Boe a day and weve now got it at and we think our Q average will be at least And this is tricky space here Were trying to do this stuff right Were actually doing managed pressure flow backs on our wells so were not trying to get the biggest number on the wall Were trying to get the best return from the well And that means how do we make sure we get the maximum AUR and the best rate over the first six months and not only the first or days The other thing Ill just tell you is when we inherited that asset a number of basic processing systems werent in place And weve had to put those in place and those have taken a bit more time than we anticipated a bit more of our management time These are little things like invoice management and production accounting and basic field operations were quite a bit of improvement probably more so than we thought when we originally purchased it Yes we do One of these things when we took it over obviously it was about six months after making our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>purchase we probably went into the Permian one thinking what we could jump in straightaway is is optimizing development plans and we had a bit more blocking and tackling to put in place in the existing production operations That said Ive been really impressed with Mike and the team on I think were already at the frontend of innovation out there Weve already tested pounds per foot fracs Were trying to see where the optimum is Clearly in some parts of our portfolio bigger is better Here we need to find out as Mike mentioned were gathering the data Were doing these multiwell pads Mike mentioned this You guys shouldnt overlook at this oil gathering system Weve now put a contract in place too Well add about a barrel to our margin and it will mean things like the weather impacts we saw in January and May should have much less impact in the future because instead of fracing oil well be gathering it by pipe So I think were trying to do this right We see this as a critically important asset to the company in the future and its early days But I think were on track to hit our barrel target Great Thanks very much And then just quickly on potential asset sales obviously four to seven core assets I count Fair to say youre still actively exploring a few options there Yes Mike you know my standard answer here but weve been pretty clear I think all year that we think a tighter portfolio is the more efficient portfolio We clearly have made massive change in it Were really pleased with these four strategic assets We also at the time we launched the strategy held some optionality in our portfolio You cant hold that forever So I think directionally tighter is the right thing to do but we actually never think its wise to announce these things either specific targets or asset sales Clearly if we do something well announce it at the time we do it And I think Sherri indicated if we did make a significant investment how we would look at these to the proceeds Excellent Thanks And then last one from me you talk about a base level of capital spending of about billion required within the company As we look forward to next year should we think about something similar do you think you can bring that down Well I think its a great question Mike because what we said is is the core to the value creation were trying to deliver here is what was barrels a day equivalent in the fourth quarter of last year from our four strategic assets going to is to keep that growing And what we said is wed like to if you will defend a minimum billion capital program We dont have to do that but would like to because that keeps that number growing Were starting to look pretty hard at and one of the things thats encouraging us is we think were going to end Q very strong particularly on liquids production which means well enter strong The second thing is as Mike went through all the wells our costs are down substantially and typically more than which means our capital will be more productive And then the third thing is that or so of our capital we spent outside this year I would be surprised if its anywhere near that large next year So all of those things should allow us to generate a capital program next year even in a commodity price similar to today if we keep those four Thanks Can you provide some color of where you think the Permian will exit this year and maybe comment on the momentum that you guys are expecting on the play into Yes Benny as we mentioned our Q average production were saying we should achieve Boe a day or greater in the fourth quarter Thats our exit rate were anticipating And largely as Mike mentioned that ramp up is happening right now as were bringing on new wells A little bit early to say exactly how well distribute capital in even though I suspect the Permian will get of the four the largest component next year Thanks And just in the Permian just want to get a sense of how many lower Spraberry wells youve drilled It is just at two thats in your presentation And even if it is can you give us some initial thoughts on horizon how it compares to your expectation and to other formations as well Yes its just the two lower Spraberry that weve drilled so far although were very encouraged by the results were seeing into Martin County So well continue to focus on that I dont have the number in terms of the numbers were planning on drilling here between now and the end of the year But yes really encouraging results on the lower Spraberry Hi Doug I was wondering if I could just go back to the question about capital I appreciate the service cost is down quite a bit Can you continue as you wound down the rest of the portfolio outside of the big four in terms of capital do we just assume that you continue to starve the rest of the portfolio of capital into in a to world Is that really the right assumption or is there some point where capital needs to come back Steve I think that whats really changed after US Thanksgiving Day last fall and the reset on oil price was when we look at our portfolio clearly we have a massive inventory of what we think are very high quality options in the four In fact I think our inventories now are wells in those four assets so its a pretty significant number So when you combine that with our strong belief that a tighter portfolio we dont want to be a singleplay company We dont believe that creates the best value for our shareholders but we also think a limited one is more efficient And as Sherri outlined in our cost piece since we started in the fall of weve reduced our workforce by over people by almost a third while maintaining similar levels of activity and largely thats being through a tighter portfolio So clearly what we have to decide is where those assets fit and what point they compete That said weve had some really interesting results before we brought our San Juan program to a close we made some changes to how we were drilling those wells and we coupled the IPs out there So we have to consider those things as we think about the portfolio going forward But right now in a low commodity price environment we got our capital very focused on the four We think that capital allocation is core and as weve talked about we do it centrally and we do it with what I think is incredible discipline I appreciate that And so I guess the other question was if I look at what is obviously a pretty challenged environment for dry natural gas assets and negative netbacks across a lot of the legacy gas portfolio and I appreciate Sherris comments about potential for further TCPL disruption for the rest of the year Do we see the potential for beyond ph shutins in the second half of the program At this point I dont think so not at todays gas prices We have our operating margins are all positive across our gas portfolio And I should say our gas production is dominated by the Montney and at a NYMEX price which roughly translates to about AECO price our margins per Mcfe And by the way if you roll in what Mike talked about with the higher liquids yields were getting and as we bring those wells in that margin we think can grow by more by more than with no increase in gas price And we see that as very competitive And I think if you model out whats in our deck with the EURs the flow rates were seeing indiscernible youll see those returns at this AECO price actually quite attractive Good morning First question in the last quarter it looked like the Permian CapEx rose about and the other big three saw a declining investment quarteroverquarter Can you expand on the drivers behind these decisions and what this spend might look in the second half Yes Jeff good question Right now as we literally sit here today were actually expending capital in three assets right now the Permian the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the Duvernay Weve largely completed our Montney program for the year We have a bit more work to do in the Duvernay But largely through the balance of the year most of the capital is being spent in the Permian and the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Just as an example I think at the moment all of our rigs that were running are currently in the Permian and the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>today Later in the year we anticipate bringing back several more rigs in the Duvernay Great Second question was going back to the managed price regime that youre doing are you doing that in all your Permian counties and the EUR enhancements that that may bring are those already baked into the EUR guidance that you have on Slide Yes Ill let Mike pick up the detail in there but this is one of these weve done this in some of our plays The DJ is probably the one weve had the most experience with And we actually do believe that staying above bubble point pressure should improve the most important part of that EUR is the oil and thats what were focused in on Its how do we maximize the oil EUR not just the Boe and we think that drives it But Mike can probably fill you in across the five counties we operate in Yes were using the same operating practice across all five counties Actually we look at this across all of our plays making sure that were taking managing our drawdown pressures to not go below bubble point too early and thus changing the relative permeability in the new wellbore The point of this the reason were doing this is to maximize our oil production and not break through to gas too early And were in the evaluation phase right now in the Permian and were going to see how that works out and make it basically to drive the maximum value for the asset Jeff I think the impact on the EURs we just need to wait and see In some of our plays weve seen it improve but in some and make sure you recover what you forecasted Its a little early but were clearly watching that And as Mike indicated weve talked about this for several quarters We actually think one of the core measures to look at on all of our wells is kind of IP We have to be real careful I know IP sort of grab a headline but what really drives the economics and returns is whats the maximum rate you conceive in that first one or two years when you really dominate your returns And if I understood what you were just saying correctly it might end up being that the results of the managed program is perhaps a better mix not necessarily a better absolute EUR It could be that and it could be just a larger EUR it could be both But clearly what we want to make sure of is a little over in the Permian a little over of our EUR is actually liquids and thats the part we want to make sure we optimize And last question that I wanted to ask was could you just provide some further color on Pipestone whats the oil gravity whats the goforward drilling plan based on the two recent successes I know youre not running rigs up there now but does this encourage you to do more in the future and kind of what does that look like Yes were really encouraged what weve seen in Pipestone We have to locations that weve identified in the oil window there as well as theres IPing ph at barrels per day The gravities are in kind of the mids API gravity And were actually constrained right now with respect to facilities so were basically drilling to fill as we look at our program going forward and also looking at optimization of facilities with respect to it Thanks guys Two quick questions from me First on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>how many of your well inventory is in the Graben And the second question was about the Montney and the intermittent disruptions that youre expecting going forward In the event that this does carry on in the issues arent fixed yet how is this going to affect your development plans there Yes let me touch on the takeaway the TCPL interruptions and while Mike grabs the rough number I will see if we have it there on the Graben But right now were hopeful that the recent release of the curtailments holds for the full year Theres always a chance that could come in And I know TransCanada has been talking a lot about this program as theyve been implementing it But at this point were not anticipating big disruptions in Were hopeful that largely were through the worst of that I think it impacted us in the second quarter about million cubic feet a day was the impact in Q What were signaling is theres some chance in the second half of the year but we hope its minimal and we hope its minimal Hi You bet Nick With respect to gross inventory we have in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>of the wells are in the Graben Youve spoken on the cost decreases on the capital side I wanted to see if you can spend some time on operating costs on a preunit basis production plus transport looked like it was up substantially even quarteronquarter both in the US and Canada and I wanted to see if this was just the result of production mix and asset sales if there were oneoffs in your outlook going forward Yes I think the big driver I think looking forward and where weve kind of indicated our guidance we still feel confident Theres a bit of lumpiness in the shape of our operating costs just now largely because of some stuff in the Permian and actually getting our arms around some of the basic processes and systems we had in place We actually think those are going to drop in the third or fourth quarter and will still end up where we expect it for the full year I dont know Mike if you have anything else youd want to add there on operating costs For sure In the Permian we had nonreoccurring costs that hit us as well as really trying to address the processes and the systems that we had to kind of get up to Encana standard here But very confident well be on a commercial competitive level with respect to our cost going forward Great Thanks And then youve also spoken on some of the techniques on improving the EURs in the Permian but I think you made a comment that your base decline rate in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale has fallen by about and I wanted to see if you can comment on whether that improves your EURs on a going forward basis if thats just for the legacy production and what the drivers are Yes Brian its a good inside here because we really dont think that this dramatically shifts EURs What we think it does is just basically making sure youre optimizing your production We thought there were a lot of opportunities in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to improve how we were managing things downhaul so with artificial lift and basic production operations And what weve done is delivered that It really hasnt shifted what the EUR is Its making sure were staying on it and not deferring production later in the life This is kind of basic blocking and tackling but its been a nice upside since we bought it But at this point I wouldnt add it on to the EUR Good morning Thanks for taking my questions I appreciate the detail on current production but just given the immediate growth in the quarteroverquarter could you speak more to quantify the impact of weather in the affected areas Okay weather Yes I would say it was relatively modest It actually hit us in three places It hit us in the Permian in West Texas Largely though we did do some pretty good planning around this but it largely just delayed a little bit of the completions and drilling activity just moving things around In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>it actually had a little bit of impact on our construction of our Patent Trust South We had some flooding which called a little bit of delay And then surprisingly enough it impacted gas production into Haynesville because the big rains in North Texas and Oklahoma the rivers actually flow through Louisiana and we had actually flooding in our Haynesville which requires to shut some production in But I dont want to overemphasize this This is a minor impact in the quarter I know a number of other people were hit by it But most of the impact was a slight delay to bringing on new production Great Thats helpful And then on the CapEx can you provide a range for Q just given the focus proactively through year end that you mentioned in the reduction of noncore spending going forward Just trying to better understand the trajectory on a quarterly basis going forward into end of this year Yes I think Sherri indicated were still on track to be within our guidance I think Q will be slightly larger than Q but not by a lot I mean what we as we mentioned earlier were largely most of our activity now is just in three of our assets for the remainder of the year the Permian the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the Duvernay with the Permian being the biggest piece of that So I think you can look at the remaining balance to our guidance and say well spend slightly more of that in the third quarter and a little less of that in the fourth quarter Okay Thanks And last question from me specifically on the Permian just looking at the blended type curve coming in at the high end of your previous range could you provide some additional color outside of the highlighted wells just on leading edge completions and how productivity looks in those wells that youre drilling now versus the type curve at this point Yes were still kind of in a learning mode What weve done is to really cast ph the boundaries with respect to completion size going from what was sort of a pound per foot weve tested all the way up to pounds per foot So what were finding is that as I think Doug mentioned earlier our cleanup timeframes are going anyway shortest would be days They were actually going all the way up to days before we hit those peak rates But we are getting to our type curves Its taking a little bit of time to ramp up to that point One of the benefits and this is a benefit if we actually saw in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>when we went to larger fracs has actually shallowed our declines and giving us stronger EURs So thats one of the reasons were doing that So its still work in progress We want to find that optimum design to get the optimum return Jeoff how this is actually showing up and weve seen it in a couple of our plays is when you combine that with managing the pressure what it means is we actually dont have much decline in the first few months of production So instead of sort of really large IPs what you see is is flat or no decline for the first several months before you go into declining that Thats what gives you potentially higher EURs and higher IP So its not that the IPs maybe it will jump up to barrels a day its actually that wells will come on in and stay there for quite some time A quick question whats the level of confidence you have in that guidance number the barrel oil equivalent for the Q assets Is that a coin test flip is it certain is it in the bag Bob its a lot is what it is We obviously give this stuff were paying a lot of attention to it Weve been saying this for a while that it would hit the And our best estimates are well do that We have line of sight to what it takes to get there in terms of activity levels and programs Theres always the chance if something doesnt turn out like you expect but our best view at the moment is well hit that number by and thats a fourtier average number is what that is It obviously represents big growth yearoveryear which is what were targeting Yes And a follow up on the selfsourced proppant can you talk a little about that Is it mines youve acquired Do you ship it yourself Yes what we do there Bob is we dont own mines we dont own rigs and frac fleets We dont think thats the best way to maximize value But we do think in our completion activities having the relationship with the sand mines ourselves and then managing the logistics of getting it all the way to our job sites maximizes the value And thats what we do Weve had this in place for a while and as weve made the changes to our portfolio we moved those relationships around So for instance some of the sand that late last year we were delivering into the DJ is now being delivered into the Permian and into the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>So we dont own sand mines but we do contract directly with sand mines Thanks Good morning I believe I heard in your prepared remarks that if you were to get any increments capital for instance from an asset sale then the first priority would be to take care of the balance sheet and then some acceleration in the four core plays So I guess my question is what would it take to allocate capital to the San Juan the TMS and the DJ at this point Yes its one of the things were looking at very carefully as we start Sherri mentioned as we start to look towards and beyond I think with respect to the San Juan as Mike mentioned really strong recent well results Were actually doing what we call a deep dive on the asset and say whats our current view and has it shifted with this recent improvement in well performance and where would it sit and compete for capital With the others at the moment what we think is we need to take a pause because the four what we call our four most strategic assets are the ones that we think really drive the value The DJ is a very solid asset with good returns in todays environment Weve got a great track record there In fact I think one of the consulting houses not too long ago actually issued a report saying we had the most economic wells in the play But when were looking at the future we say whats most important strategically to the company particularly in this part of the price cycle And we think those four strategic assets are the place to put capital and were evaluating them where do our other assets fit both compete for capital and fit in the long term Okay And you mentioned in your news release the credit facility thats being updated and increased until Is that guaranteed until or is it subject to redetermination in the interim No thats guaranteed until We can basically look at rolling over indiscernible each year and like I say its a nice thing to have in place given the uncertainty and making sure that we have adequate liquidity Why dont I let Renee Zemljak here with us runs our Midstream Marketing and Fundamentals team Ill let her describe what we put in place We run a very competitive RFP process which is something that Encana typically does and so we have contracted with Medallion and were very encouraged with the terms that we were able to achieve in that contract and were really looking forward to a longterm relationship with them Great Regarding the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>decline rates Doug what is the base decline rate now You said you dropped it by Whats the base Im going to look to Mike to see if he can help me with that If we cant grab it here quickly we can follow up with you after the call Mike do you Weve done a tremendous job here I dont have the decline rate at my fingertips but weve done a tremendous job focusing on the base looking at our official lift systems and were shallowing that base decline I just dont have the number Me and Mike can what well do is follow up with you on that but across the portfolio this year weve actually cut about two points off that I think is Yes actually on a budget basis we have a base decline across all of our assets and weve shallow that down to so from to Okay great Last one from me is on your gas gathering so if you look at the US youre running about for gathering and processing How much of that is fixed And is there any way youll renegotiate since its kind of high Its actually placebyplace and it all depends on where the market is and where capacity constraints do or dont exists Clearly in some parts of our system the worlds moved on and things like the Marcellus showed up and moved the market to a different place where some of those contracts today unfortunately you would call them out at the market so you cant renegotiate them and in other places you might be able to do so But largely I would assume where we can make a difference we have The big thing we can do and Renee and her team does is in a number of those places we have excess capacity and we trade around that capacity to claw back a bit of those fees And we do that as an ongoing basis Thanks for letting me back in for one more I just want to ask a quick question and that is are you planning to use the Duvernay dualfrac spread approach elsewhere in the portfolio I think one of the things we have to you have to look at where you can I think you guys know we use what we call our resource play hub or RPH model And one of the elements of that model is how you integrate your systems like your water system your production systems and these things and what allows us to do that in the Duvernay is the combination of things One is we have piped water to pads You can actually haul that water in a day And the second thing is you have to be able to store large amounts of sand on location which is something we do in a lot of places But clearly what were looking at and we actually had designed into our organization indiscernible So the real question is is can we do we have the system in place in other places to be able to deliver the water and the sand I think Mike we were pumping over barrels of water a day and I think close to million pounds of sand a day in that So you actually have to have the systems in place to do that You cant run that many trucks Thanks very much I apologize if this has been covered but its a question around the TCPL outages If you could just speak to the volumes that were offline in Q due to those outages and also whether your price was affected And what sort of volumes youre budgeting for Q and Q that might be impacted And I guess importantly how predictable is that maintenance on TCPL and what level of confidence do you have for the second half that you might now get affected again Yes Barb we did briefly cover this but happy to repeat it In Q between the TCPL issues and an issue with a spectra ph operated gas plant we had about million a day offline Right now were not being curtailed at all in the TransCanada system We dont anticipate large volumes the remainder of the year All weve done is flagged its a risk but we dont anticipate that will be significant going forward As far as price the only real impact on price is if you decided to try to move your gas into different markets and therefore received a different price for the gas But it wasnt a significant issue its more a volume item Yes So before we wrap up I just want to mention a couple of things We made a delivered shift this quarter to disclose a lot more detail on technical information Weve had that request from many of you I think youll see in our presentation today we gave a lot more operating results And in addition when you look at our corporate deck at our Web site which I think is just about to be loaded it has a significant increase in the amount of technical information on each of our four most strategic plays Id encourage you to take a look at that I just want to close by saying thanks to everyone for being very generous with your time this morning and look forward to
