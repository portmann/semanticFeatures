You said you dropped it by 50%.What’s the base?I’m going to look to Mike to see if he can help me with that.If we can’t grab it here quickly, we can follow up with you after the call.Mike, do you -- We’ve done a tremendous job here – I don’t have the decline rate at my fingertips but we’ve done a tremendous job focusing on the base looking at our official lift systems and we’re shallowing that base decline.I just don’t have the number.Me and Mike can – what we’ll do is follow up with you on that, but across the portfolio this year we’ve actually cut about two points off that I think is 31.Yes, actually on a budget basis we have a 31% base decline across all of our assets and we’ve shallow that down to 28%, so from 31% to 28%.Okay, great.Last one from me is on your gas gathering, so if you look at the U.S., you’re running about $2.30 for gathering and processing.How much of that is fixed?And is there any way you’ll renegotiate since it’s kind of high?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>It’s actually place-by-place and it all depends on where the market is and where capacity constraints do or don’t exists. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Clearly in some parts of our system, the world’s moved on and things like the Marcellus showed up and moved the market to a different place where some of those contracts today unfortunately you would call them out at the market, so you can’t renegotiate them, and in other places you might be able to do so. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But largely I would assume where we can make a difference, we have. (Uncertainty) </span>The big thing we can do and Renee and her team does is in a number of those places we have excess capacity and we trade around that capacity to claw back a bit of those fees.And we do that as an ongoing basis.Thanks for letting me back in for one more.I just want to ask a quick question and that is, are you planning to use the Duvernay dual-frac spread approach elsewhere in the portfolio?I think one of the things we have to – you have to look at where you can.I think you guys know we use what we call our resource play hub or RPH model.And one of the elements of that model is how you integrate your systems like your water system, your production systems and these things, and what allows us to do that in the Duvernay is the combination of things.One is we have piped water to pads.You can actually haul that water in a day.And the second thing is you have to be able to store large amounts of sand on location, which is something we do in a lot of places.But clearly what we’re looking at and we actually had designed into our organization [indiscernible].So the real question is, is can we – do we have the system in place in other places to be able to deliver the water and the sand.I think Mike we were pumping over 100,000 barrels of water a day and I think close to 1 million pounds of sand a day in that.So you actually have to have the systems in place to do that.You can’t run that many trucks.Thanks very much.I apologize if this has been covered but it’s a question around the TCPL outages.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you could just speak to the volumes that were offline in Q2 due to those outages and also whether your price was affected? (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And what sort of volumes you’re budgeting for Q3 and Q4 that might be impacted? (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And I guess importantly how predictable is that maintenance on TCPL and what level of confidence do you have for the second half that you might now get affected again? (Uncertainty) </span>Yes, Barb, we did briefly cover this but happy to repeat it.In Q2 between the TCPL issues and an issue with a spectra [ph] operated gas plant, we had about 33 million a day offline.Right now we’re not being curtailed at all in the TransCanada system.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We don’t anticipate large volumes the remainder of the year. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>All we’ve done is flagged it’s a risk, but we don’t anticipate that will be significant going forward. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As far as price, the only real impact on price is if you decided to try to move your gas into different markets and therefore received a different price for the gas. (Uncertainty) </span>But it wasn’t a significant issue, it’s more a volume item.Yes.So before we wrap up, I just want to mention a couple of things.We made a delivered shift this quarter to disclose a lot more detail on technical information.We’ve had that request from many of you.I think you’ll see in our presentation today we gave a lot more operating results.And in addition when you look at our corporate deck at our Web site, which I think is just about to be loaded, it has a significant increase in the amount of technical information on each of our four most strategic plays.I’d encourage you to take a look at that.I just want to close by saying thanks to everyone for being very generous with your time this morning and look forward to talking about some very strong results in the third quarter.Thank you very much folks.Our conference call is now complete.Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.However, we view them as an important resource for bloggers and journalists, and are excited to contribute to the democratization of financial information on the Internet.(Until now investors have had to pay thousands of dollars in subscription fees for transcripts.)<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www.SeekingAlpha.com.
