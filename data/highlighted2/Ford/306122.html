plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article In my previous piece on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I highlighted that investors should expect output in the region to continue falling by a great deal this year This is of course contingent on the rig count not rising something that is unlikely to happen unless oil prices move much higher Based on the data provided investors should be feeling very positive about the oil market situation since this will only help the supplydemand imbalance Earlier this month I decided to dig into data associated with the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>one of the largest oil plays in the US and see what the future holds for the region in the current energy price environment What I found is that unlike earlier pieces Ive written on the Permian the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is in a state of significant decline Now with newer production data out from the EIA Energy Information Administration I decided to dig back in and see what the outlook for the region is moving forward In my previous piece on the region I conducted a sensitivity analysis that makes various assumptions regarding oil output in the region In that piece I provided the following table which projects what I believe the output of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be by the end of this year under a scenario where rig counts continue to fall by units per month a number Im still using moving forward given that rig productivity continues to rise by per month and if the decline rate in the region hits one of three categories conservative monthly decline rate moderate rate and liberal rate Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report The assumptions I made were based on a very rational mindset As an example in the graph below I charted out the historical and most uptodate decline rate for wells in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>ranging from January of through what has been estimated for February of this year What we see is a world where decline rates soared through the roof in recent months averaging about However because the future is very much uncertain I elected to look at an outcome involving not only a decline rate moving forward but also ones at the range the historic average before the energy downturn and what could happen if this trend continues Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report Regarding rig productivity I previously assumed a rate moving forward of per month Although this is more conservative I decided today to change this to a rate You see while it is possible that rigs could become more efficient in the months to come the general monthtomonth trend for oil rig productivity has been toward weaker improvements If the EIA is correct for instance oil rigs will see a rise of just in the month of February this year the worst improvement seen since November of Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report Given these various assumptions oil output for the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this December would have been between barrels per day and barrels under my previous analysis This is far removed from the barrels per day the EIA estimated the region produced during this past December and is largely reflective of the huge decline rates drillers have to contend with However I now believe these numbers were not entirely accurate In the table below you can see an updated version of my analysis for the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Although the decline rates Im using are the same as in my previous piece and the productivity of rigs is a tad bit lower I dont think my rig numbers are as correct as they could be You see for the January rig count I had used data provided by Baker Hughes NYSE BHI a source used by the EIA and applied the difference there to my work Unfortunately though the EIAs final rig counts differ somewhat when it comes to the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and indicate that the number or rigs in December were about units higher than what Baker Hughes forecasted For the sake of conservatism I am using the EIAs data after accounting for a drop of units for the month of January for the region Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report On the low end this implies that the amount of oil being produced in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for December of this year should actually come out to roughly barrels per day Although this is higher than what I previously forecasted its still barrels per day lower than what we saw in December of In the moderate scenario where decline rates average this year oil production by the end of the year should hit just barrels per day a drop of yearoveryear Meanwhile the liberal forecast one I dont think investors should hope for too much suggests that the amount of oil being produced in the region should hit about barrels per day a drop of compared to what was seen last year As of right now it seems as though investors in the oil patch are very bearish regarding crude but I think the market is overreacting at this moment Even under the revised conditions which assume a higher rig count for it appears as though oil output in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will plummet compared to where it was last year Of course there are some things that could make this forecast invalid like a rise in oil prices that pushes production higher again but that doesnt appear to be in the cards at this point in time Absent this longterm investors should be feeling quite bullish right now </div></body></html>
