cratered this year Shares of Tata Motors NYSE TTM have dropped by over this year leaving shares unloved but not unforgotten Ive been watching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F as a potential investment which led me to stumble upon the Indian automaker and owner of JaguarLand Rover At a quick superficial glance Tata appears to have a solid margin of safety baked into its shares Now Id like to analyze it and see if the discount is there for a reason or if shares truly are a bargain Tata Motors boasts ROE nearly double that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors NYSE GM Below Ive constructed a Dupont analysis to gain some more clarity as to what exactly is driving its ROE We can see that ROE has been trending downward dragged down by lower margins weaker utilization of assets and less financial leverage GMs operating margins have been a little lumpy so its hard to compare but margin seems normal for the auto industry Fords operating margin is usually in that ball park as well Tata Motors is arguably more complex than GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and while it is primarily an automaker at heart it also deals in industrial and marine engines spare parts such as axles and transmissions ATVs and even construction equipment just to name a few of its other lines of business Due to its international sprawl its also been hit with negative currency impacts which drained Rs in millions from the company Thats about in millions when measured in dollars With China appearing to show a possible slowdown economically this could dent Tatas results going forward as well Europe also accounts for a quarter of sales Tatas capital structure looks healthy at an initial glance with adequate working capital as indicated by its current ratio a tad over Looking at its efficiency in managing its cash it also looks solid TTM Days Sales Outstanding Annual data by YCharts We can see that the company maintains a negative cash conversion cycle DSO DIO DPO largely because it takes a long time to pay suppliers The companys optimal CCC makes me think that the current ratio is just about right for the company and efficiency is very good Turning to solvency ratios we can see that despite a high debt to equity ratio the companys overall capital structure looks solid and is on par with GMs and maybe even slightly better than Fords TTM Debt to Equity Ratio Annual data by YCharts It should also be noted that most automakers have higherthannormal debt to equity ratios because of financing activities In this way they are similar to banks when looking at some solvency ratios Allinall the companys financial condition looks healthy Tata Motors is beaten down but the company itself looks healthy I think shares offer lots of value but also contain lots of risk and probably lots of volatility as well Morningstar seems to agree giving the stock a coveted star rating explaining that its underlying results were better than the market realizes The companys crown jewel JaguarLand Rover is firing on all cylinders JLR is growing revenues at a compound annual rate and accounts for almost half of overall vehicle sales Morningstar also noted its impressive ROIC of It also does a lot of business in China and with Europe looking a little shaky as well it definitely has some geographical sales risks The stronger dollar may continue to throw water on results too but on the flip side emerging markets are expected to grow faster over the longterm As an investment Tata gives you a ticket to the growing middle classes of these countries So if youre bargain hunting in the auto sector consider Tata Motors at times forward earnings Its cheaper than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>times forward earnings and on par with GM times forward earnings It should also be noted that GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pay substantial dividends around so they may be a better option for more conservative investors For more aggressive investors more risk usually brings the potential for more reward however and JLR should continue to drive growth at a solid clip for the overall company going forward Just know what youre getting into and dont buy it for the tiny dividend Its a speculative valuebased capital appreciation play Its also a third option to consider if youre already looking into GM andor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Source Consider Tata Motors While Everyone Else Is
