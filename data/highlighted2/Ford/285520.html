<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors Stock Regain Its Mojo In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long F MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor ends with a strong sales month In December <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor sold more vehicles in the United States than a year ago Sales momentum will likely extend into Strong cash flow generation and global market share gains demonstrate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is in a good position to continue to grow sales What a heartbreaking story <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F has been for investors who bought into the growth story last year The auto maker edged from one sales record to the next in selling millions of cars but Mr Market would have none of it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock was and continues to be a major disappointment for shareholders It is down over the last year Not taking into account the market selloff on August from which stocks quickly recovered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor closed at the lowest level in a year on Friday at Ouch Granted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor slid as part of a wider market slump that dragged down stocks in all sectors but the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor story is one of a kind Rarely have I seen a company that executes so well launces so many new products yet the stock performance has totally decoupled from the companys financial results So the question here is Will be any different Strong December US sales close a fantastic year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor If you follow my articles you know that I have pointed out two dynamic trends in that I thought would lift the auto makers stock higher Robust sales growth in Fords core market the United States and Growing average transactions prices As to the first point Fords monthly sales updates have been nothing but a display of strength and success all throughout the year Hence it doesnt come as a surprise that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has closed the year on a very strong note too In December <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor sold vehicles in the United States which was more vehicles than the auto manufacturer sold in December of last year On a yearly basis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors US sales increased to vehicles In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor sold just cars SUVs and trucks According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors press release see here was the most successful year in terms of sales since Strong operating cash flows and increasing global market share If anything needs to change when it comes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor it needs to be investor sentiment The company itself is cheap and sells for x sales x forward earnings So valuation is hardly a concern here And dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is having any cash problems either The company rakes in mountains of cash In the third quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor pulled in billion in adjusted automotive operating cash flow On a runrate basis this translates into adjusted annual OCF of billion in Fords automotive division which is a significant stack of cash available for reinvestment or shareholder disbursements One of the reasons why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is able to rake in such a large amount of cash obviously is that its products resonate with consumers and thats why Fords sales results have been through the roof in But just as important <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is not only increasing sales but also growing market share those are two very different things The auto industry is notoriously difficult and sales are often driven by significant discounts and promotions However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has managed to increase its global market share from in to in which attests to the acceptance and competitiveness of Fords vehicles was a challenging year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but more so on the stock market front than in the real economy The best approach to dealing with a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investment right now is to see the company first and foremost as an income and yield play Fords dividend yield is now converging on which makes it an excellent choice for income investors betting on continued dividend growth Nobody can predict with certainty how Fords stock will fare in or whether investors rediscover their love for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor In any case a near dividend yield sweetens the waiting for higher share prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is in a good position to grow vehicle sales in the US and abroad in Top sales in the US and a bigger slice of the global auto market pie underscore Fords ability to compete and win Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors December sales end a successful year chances are that will be a good year too I only hope that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor will regain its mojo in in terms of sentiment and that it can lure more investors back into the stock A stock buyback and continued dividend growth may do just that Tagged
