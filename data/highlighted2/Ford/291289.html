are long F MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor announced a share special dividend on Tuesday Fords cash flow yield spiked to as a result yet investors would have none of it I discuss three reasons why I think investors avoid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor My <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F articles in have centered around two themes really Theme number one related to Fords reports of inspiring sales growth in the United States theme number two dished on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors objective undervaluation on a pricetoearnings and pricetosales basis But those things didnt really matter in Fords valuation wouldnt move up no matter how good results were In fact quite the opposite was true Fords stock slipped all throughout the year Watching the show unfold was as frustrating as it could be is not shaping up to be a better year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>either Why would I make such a statement just two weeks into the new year Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>declared a billion special dividend or per share on Tuesday and guess what happened to the stock Yes it went down By a lot On Wednesday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor slipped and ended the day at Whats going on here Why would a stock go down in value and by that much when MORE cash is coming shareholders way Granted the market was weak oil continues to fall which is actually a positive factor for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor since it spurs sales of SUVs and pickups because lower gas prices encourage the purchase of bigger vehicles and China is not getting back into shape either Even with the stock market heading south though youd expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock to at least hold its ground in light of such a positive announcement right Wrong Investors seem to take every opportunity to clobber <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>even though the auto company just gave investors a healthy raise How many investment graderated SP companies do you know that yield Not many I suppose Because there arent any As we all know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is doing well in the US But dont make the mistake and think the United States is the only place thats doing great for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>China is also seeing some robust sales growth Just last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>said that it has sold more than million vehicles in a new annual sales record in the worlds second largest economy and it finished the year strong with a YY sales growth in December Europe Fords new vehicle sales in Europe increased in outpacing industry growth of So whats the issue here If Fords business is objectively in good shape nearly everywhere and the company guided for profits that are expected to be at least as high as they were in why do investors not want to own the stock There are no clearcut answers of course but I can share my suspicions as to why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is so cheap Since stocks have been going up with a few minor corrections here and there The economy has also gained ground steadily and unemployment is now back down to But every bull market will come to an end at some point I feel that a lot of investors are concerned over how long auto companies can continue their awesome run before they run out of steam Any economic slowdown will first and foremost hit cyclical companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor the hardest Another reason I can see why investors shy away from buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is that General Motors NYSE GM is even cheaper than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and has been a hedge fund darling thereby deflecting attention and capital away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Further yet concerns over the depth of the economic slowdown in China where volume and market share gains for Western auto companies have been significant as of late have sort of hurt the bullish thesis for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor But even when taking such factors into consideration the risks of a recession are priced into Fords shares Therefore the point remains that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is nothing but a bargain at if you are an income investor and are in it for the long haul There are reasons to like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor and there are arguments to be made against buying cyclical auto companies when economic growth has reached maturity Nonetheless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is a compelling dividend playand even more so when shares are heading lower since investors get more bang for their buck The special dividend might not entice investors expecting an economic slowdown to buy the stock but dividend investors have a lot to look forward to as long as the economy remains vibrant Tagged Dividends Income Consumer Goods </div></body></html>
