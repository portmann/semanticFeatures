presence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will invest million in an RD center in Chennai to bring down costs by reducing dependency on imports and improving localisation levels The Indian car market holds tremendous potential due to the countrys robust GDP growth rate In India accounted for just of the worlds GDP but this number is anticipated to increase to by overtaking the likes of the European Union and Japan according to a Booz Co report The increase in the GDP will increase the discretionary spending power of Indian customers and positively affect car sales In fact it is expected that the Indian car market will clock sales of as much as million units by the end of the decade and could generate revenue between billion billion as shown below Given the strong potential of this market it makes sense to take a closer look at how American automaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F plans to take advantage of India to improve its financial performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Indias overall performance in has been better than last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>India has sold a total of units this year up to May up from units sold in the same period last year But this is largely due to higher export volumes which are higher as compared to last years units In fact domestic sales this year stand at only units as against units up to May in a decline of This is clearly explained in the following charts Source Data collected from different news sources As can be seen in the above charts although the total sales volume in is better than the domestic performance has been poor Also the monthonmonth domestic sales have also depleted Hence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hasnt performed well in the domestic Indian market in the first half if we take exports out of the equation In fact in April <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had a market share of only in the Indian car market But the good thing is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has decided to step on the gas in order to improve its performance in the domestic Indian market by working on a threepoint strategy as discussed below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to launch new cars this year starting from mid The first one to be launched will be the Aspire subcompact sedan followed by the new improved Figo hatchback the Endeavour SUV and the Mustang These four models will be catering to different segments of customers ranging from the budget segment to the premium segment The Aspire subcompact will be addressing the C segment which accounts for of the Indian car market and is anticipated to grow at a robust pace due to excise duty benefits and ease of driving in congested city conditions As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is currently engaged in a week long road show known as What Drives You to showcase the Aspire at locations in cities across India and has bought on board a wellknown celebrity to promote it This should increase the visibility of Fords upcoming product in the market and set the stage for more launches going forward Anurag Mehrotra executive director Marketing Sales and Service at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>India says We expect the demand to improve towards last quarter of and are geared to make the most of this improvement with plans to introduce three new products in the next months Each of these vehicles will delight our customers and set new benchmarks in their segments with their headturning looks clever convenience and outstanding fuel efficiency In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is bringing its new models into India at an opportune time as the Reserve Bank of India recently announced a bps cut in the Repo Rate This will eventually bring down the interest rate on loans and help customers avail more credit Additionally a good monsoon season will be another favorable factor since it will keep inflation in check and leave more disposable income with consumers as prices of essential commodities will be kept in check But apart from introducing new models <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also needs to bolster its dealer and service network As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is strengthening its sales and service network by investing in new facility setups in unexplored territories For instance the company has started new sales and service facilities recently one in Mizoram and one in Punjab In fact the sales and service center in Mizoram is its first in the northeastern region of the country At present the company has sales and service facilities in India covering cities More importantly it has been opening new centers at a fast clip and this will help the company shore up its domestic performance in the long run New RD hub at Chennai will act as a cornerstone for upcoming products On the lines of its major competitors viz Maruti Suzuki Hyundai Motor India RenaultNissan etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has decided to invest in a development hub in India It will be a project worth INR to crore around million at the midpoint Using this RD hub <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is planning to develop a new project known as B a midsize segment sedan to compete with the Honda City in around Hence this particular center will yield results in the long run Moreover this center will play a key role in bringing down the cost by reducing dependency on imports and improving localisation levels According to Gaurav Vangaal senior analyst at IHS Automotive Product development cost in India is almost half if not onethird when compared to some of the evolved markets Hence using this RD center <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to reduce costs at not only its India operations but on a global basis as well Fords performance in the Indian market excluding exports isnt that great as the company holds a very small market share But with new launches lined up an expansion of the dealer network in the cards and a development hub in Chennai expected to come online <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is moving in the right direction to tap the longterm growth of the Indian auto market Since this market is expected to exceed million units in annual sales going forward as explained at the beginning of the article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could see a substantial improvement in its overall financial performance
