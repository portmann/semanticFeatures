Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha The Indian auto market is expected to hit sales of billion billion in the coming years but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been unable to make a dent in this market Fords sales in India in the first half of have taken a massive hit as compared to last year due to lack of new models <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however is set to introduce the Figo Aspire subcompact sedan in India to tap a segment that accounts for of the Indian auto market currently The Aspire is a better car than the competition in safety technology and power and if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>prices it right its struggles in India could come to an end For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F India is not a very big market In fact the company holds a market share of just over in India while from an overall perspective it sold just vehicles in the country last year as compared to global sales of over million units Thus India is a speck in Fords global operations but it is one market that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is desperately trying to tap Looking ahead Indias auto market is expected to hit million units in annual sales by Additionally by the end of the Indian car market is anticipated to sell over million units annually generating revenue of billion billion In fact India will be among the top auto markets going forward as shown below As such it is evident that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to pull up its socks in this market or else it might miss out on rapid growth in India However the company has not done well so far in India this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>delivered another terrible performance in the month of June Fords sales in India have dropped in each month of the year so far At the end of June its domestic sales figure stood at units down down from last years units Alarmingly the rate of decline has consistently increased month over month as shown below One of the main reasons behind Fords declining sales in India is the absence of new cars in its portfolio Almost all important <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>products including the Figo hatchback and the Endeavour SUV are now outdated and need to be replaced with new models The company had tried to generate interest in these two models by launching midlife facelifts but they did not appeal much to the buyers In fact its been long since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>launched a new model in India However over the last couple of months the company has been trying to bring in some excitement among the Indian public <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>India had already announced its plans to launch new cars over the year starting from mid The company is showcasing first of its tobeintroduced three products the Figo Aspire to customers in cities across the country as part of a panIndia road show The other cars that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is making ready for India for the months to come are the newgen Figo the Endeavour SUV and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang However in this article we will take a closer look at the Figo Aspire This will turn out to be a key model for the company as it marks it foray into the sub meter sedan segment an area thats growing at a consistent pace and accounts for almost of total car sales in the country Like the SUV and crossover segments in the US the subcompact sedan segment is growing at a fast pace in India As a result Fords soon to be launched Aspire can be expected to reverse its pathetic show in the country The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Figo Aspire will be rolled out just before this years festive season with the following specs The model will carry certain firstinsegment features such as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>My Key which will enable the owner to program the key to ensure that the driver of the car drives responsibly It will have two options in petrol engines and one diesel option The liter petrol engine option will offer a speed Powershift dualclutch automatic gearbox which is also a first in class feature More importantly the initial reviews about the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Aspire are positive as reviewers are of the opinion that it is different from its competitors in several ways The attractive design and easy to handle features come along as legacy features with any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>model Unlike many of its rivals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has not chosen to just add a boot to a hatchback and make it a sedan Its a design that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has developed from the groundup The mileage that its engine is going to offer is also one of the highest in the segment In the diesel variant after detuning the mileage can be expected to reach up to kmlt Moreover since the car is less than meters in length it is eligible for excise duty benefits This will help the company in pricing it competitively in this highly pricesensitive market As far as the competition is concerned the Aspire will go up against the likes of established players such as the Suzuki OTCPKSZKMY Swift Dzire and Honda NYSE HMC Amaze along with the Tata Zest NYSE TTM and the Hyundai OTCHYMPY Xcent Compared to the industry pioneer Maruti OTCMRZUY Swift Dzire Fords compact sedan will definitely have an upper hand The Aspire is a smartly designed car from inside the cabin Certain advanced features like SYNC with AppLink Fords advanced incar connectivity system and Emergency Assistance will give it an edge over the Dzire Against the other major rivals Hyundai Xcent and Tata Zest the Aspire has an advantage in terms of power and safety along with better power and torque figures If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>prices this product right it might have a winner on its hand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to target different segments of the Indian market by offering variety This strategy will help it bring its sales back on track in this fastgrowing auto market But to compete here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to price its products well apart from offering something new to the Indian buyer With the Aspire the company is trying to do just that as it is now targeting a segment that accounts for of the Indian market and is still growing Thus driven by such initiatives I wont be surprised if the company is able to crack this fastgrowing market in the long run and ultimately improve its overall financial performance given the expected size of the Indian car market going forward Source <span
