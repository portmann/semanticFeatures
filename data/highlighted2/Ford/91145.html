asset class performance yield and more check out the ETF Hub ETF Hub <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been building toward the second half of the year and now is the right time to buy the stock Its F sales will pick up much faster than anticipated during the rest of as increased capacity will meet pent up demand European sales will also continue to improve and beat expectations as it has done well there before introducing its new fleet of cars With the AsiaPacific region driving revenue growth in the future the stocks longterm outlook is strong and I Know First is bullish on this stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Co NYSE F has had a rough few months with the stock price falling roughly Traders of this stock complain about how it trades sideways even when the company gets good news like improved sales or profits This is largely true as the stock has mostly traded in a range of to for more than two years now The stock could now be set up to break through this range to the upside during the second half of the year Many of Fords initiatives that will drive the stock price are finally set to take place and the recent fall of the stock price makes it an attractive option for investors Efforts with the F and Europe will cause the stock price to climb upwards during the next year and an increased presence in growth markets make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a solid longterm investment After remodeling its F model to use an aluminum body <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been working to ramp up its production to meet the demand for the extremely popular truck Fords plant in Dearborn Michigan was upgraded to be able to produce these trucks earlier this year and its plant in Kansas City has now been upgraded as well The upgrade met Fords predicted timeline of being completed before the end of June The fact that both plants have been upgraded and are now at full production of the new aluminumbodies trucks will improve sales during the second half of the year The companys sales of Americas most popular vehicle have fallen so far this year but this is not due to a lack of demand Now that the production rampup has been completed the company has faced some issues with suppliers mainly with having enough frames to complete production This is a common problem when ramping up operations and should be solved quickly This will pave the way for increased production and as a result increased sales Sales of the F fell in May compared to a year earlier and sales for the year so far are down With a second plant running at capacity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to fully meet demand during the second half of the year when demand will be pent up This will increase sales and improve the companys performance during the coming quarters The poor performance of the F so far this year explains the poor performance of the stock The fact that the stock hasnt fallen further is a bullish sign for the future outlook as the improved performance of the second year will act as a strong bullish catalyst The presence of demand for these vehicles is made clear by Fords decision to shorten its break in production this summer from two weeks to one The new trucks are also demanding higher prices which will improve the companys bottom line The price of F trucks has been raised compared to last year even as of current sales are made up of old models By meeting demand Fords revenues and profits will jump during the second half of the year and this will cause huge yearoveryear improvements in the companys financials Watch for F sales to lead to the stock price making a significant jump Another reason the stock price could be set to jump during the second half of the year is the companys performance in Europe The economy has recovered faster than expected in Europe a bullish sign for automakers In the month of May Fords sales in the region increased from a year ago This continues the trend for the year so far as sales have increased in the first five months compared to a year ago compared to growth of for the industry as a whole These numbers are quite spectacular considering they will only improve during the second half of the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is introducing a number of new vehicles into the market during the rest of year starting in the beginning of July The new vehicles are highlighted by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang which are expected to be in European dealerships in the first week of July The company is also releasing new models that are popular in Europe including the Mondeo Vingale a highend sedan similar to the Fords Lincoln offerings in the US The success of the new vehicles is a big part of the companys strategy as it works to increase its market share in the region So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has increased its sales in the region through its commercial vehicles which have picked up as a result of an improving economy However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cant solely rely on this market and introducing its new vehicles including the iconic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang should help the companys results With improved sales that should outpace the larger market European results should further boost the stock price during the second half of the year China Strategy Will Improve Future Outlook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also planning on how to drive further future growth beyond the second half of the year increasing its emphasis on emerging car markets in China and India The company will release new vehicles in China this year and will have six assembly plants in the country by next year This comes even as the countrys economy is slowing While GDP growth might be falling the companys middle class continues to expand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>management believes it can drive its revenue growth in this market as seen by its rapid expansion in the area China had auto sales of million in but this number is expected to hit million vehicles in Even with the slowing economy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has continued to invest heavily in the area to build up its capacity A big step for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the market is increasing the popularity of its luxury brand Lincoln <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is increasing the amount of Lincoln dealerships in the market from to this year and will further expand to dealers next year In all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects for as much as of its revenue growth to come from the AsiaPacific region which also includes India This market will also grow during that time period While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to increase its presence in the Chinese market it has stated that it will not lower prices in this market Instead it will slow production as it does not want to sacrifice its margins In the long run Fords increased presence in these markets will offer plenty of growth to help the companys sales improve A number of analysts have offered their opinions on Fords stock recently and the mean price estimate for the stock offers substantial upside potential to investors According to Yahoo Finance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a mean target price of offering a return to investors UBS analyst Colin Langan recently offered an update on this stock maintaining his recommendation of buy He set a target price of for the stock In general analysts have maintained their ratings for this stock but with better performance coming during second half of the year look for analysts to raise their target prices Fords stock price has had a rough go of it during the first half of the year but that is all set to turn around now Its efforts to ramp up production of the F have finally come to fruition and will improve the companys performance during the second half of the year With the introduction of new vehicles in Europe the companys performance during the second half of the year should easily beat expectations and will overwhelm investors The stock price will jump and the future growth outlook for the company looks strong because of its investments in the AsiaPacific region I Know First is bullish on this stock as a longterm investment with support of our algorithmic analysis and believe the companys financial performance during the second half of the year will act as a catalyst for this stock Source Time To Consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Is Now Real Gains On The Way Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and
