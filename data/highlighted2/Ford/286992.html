myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article With energy prices trading around year lows I asked myself how much longer this downtrend can continue Absent a demand shock of some sort the market will have to wait for production to fall enough in order to balance and the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is extremely important here I dug into data which indicated that output in the region is falling like a rock and the high decline rates combined falling rig counts should have a major impact Based on the results of my data investors shouldnt be shocked to see output fall by as much as million barrels per day in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this year Last year was incredibly volatile for the oil industry As prices plummeted by from per barrel to some companies entered into bankruptcy while others like Linn Energy NASDAQ LINE LinnCo NASDAQ LNCO Breitburn Energy Partners NASDAQ BBEP and Approach Resources NASDAQ AREX received a royal beatdown This continued downturn prompted me to look deeper into production data associated with the domestic oil industry In a previous piece I looked at the problem of the rising production stemming from the Permian Basin but this only provides one piece of the puzzle In what follows I will take a look at the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale and discuss why investors should probably expect a continued massive decline in output moving forward if energy prices continue to be as low as theyve been Of the seven major oil and natural gas drilling locations regularly covered by the EIA Energy Information Administration the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the closest in terms of proximity to the Permian Basin located along the Southern and Southeastern portions of Texas but the economics of the site are much different than its neighbor Whereas the Permian Basin has decline rates generally ranging from between and per month or to per year the decline rate in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>appears to hover between upper and nearly per month to per year at least in recent years Because of this disparity the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has actually reported a much larger decline in oil production over the past few months than not only the Permian Basin but also when stacked up against the other five locations the EIA examines Using data from November we can see that the region produced million barrels of oil per day in November of but that number declined over the ensuing year by barrels to million per day If you exclude data from the Permian and Utica the only two regions that saw any uptick in output during this timeframe the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>accounted for a whopping of the total drop in production across the five declining drilling regions Even after reporting such a massive drawdown however the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still accounted for of all oil produced placing it only behind the Permian Basin in terms of output and slightly ahead of the Bakken Since October of when the energy industry really started taking a dive the number of oil rigs in the region fell by from units in operation to just in operation today Much of this decline in rig count took place between December of and April of The decline did seem to moderate quite a bit after that but as energy prices have taken another leg lower the rig count has resumed its decline Looking at periods of one month two months three months four months five months and six months the average monthly decline in rigs has been about As Ive already mentioned the decline rates of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are quite significant In the graph below you can see what these monthly rates have been between January of the furthest back the EIAs data goes and what has been estimated for January of this year Whats interesting about this is that while the decline rates hovered between around and or so for years the number has since soared My hypothesis regarding this is that the swift downturn in the energy environment forced companies to cut their rigs and to focus largely on sites that have high decline rates so that they could extract as much oil as possible in an attempt to avoid liquidity concerns Whats the future look like for Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Ultimately I believe the future for oil looks bright absent a meaningful economic downturn at home or abroad but theres a difference between hoping and basing your stance off data In what follows Ive looked at what I believe is likely to transpire for the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in terms of production but its important to keep in mind that this is based on a variety of assumptions that could change depending on a number of unforeseeable factors In my analysis I figured that the low energy price environment will force rig counts down by units per month in perpetuity and I assumed that decline rates average either the old decline rate before the crash just a hair over the most recent estimates available and what the picture could look like if the decline rates continue to grow I also had to look at the efficiency of oil rigs since that is a major determinant of oil output In the graph above you can see that the amount of oil generated per rig on a per day basis has continued to improve with the monthovermonth improvement being positive for each period over the past year As a result of this rig efficiency has pushed average production up from barrels of oil per day to barrels but according to the EIA that trend should be slowing In fact if their estimates are correct for January the amount of oil produced for the month on a per rig basis will flatline For my base case I will use a increase in rig efficiency but Id be surprised if the rate is above on average over the next year since most of the easy money from a costcutting perspective has likely been made already Using all of this data I was able to conduct a sensitivity analysis that shows what the trend of oil production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should look like if my assumptions turn out to be accurate Based on the data provided a decline rate in the region should result in oil production falling by barrels per day throughout this year from the million barrels per day that were estimated in November of last year to just barrels by this next December In a more liberal but very realistic given the recent decline rates scenario where decline rates average moving forward we should see production fall by up to barrels per day to only barrels daily by the end of this year If decline rates continue to rise and eventually hit per month for an average for the year we could see production drop by barrels per day to a paltry barrels I would find this outcome quite unlikely unless energy prices fall further Right now many investors seem to be bearish regarding oil but I have a hard time understanding why Yes we do have a large global oil glut though its small as a percent of overall inventories but production should continue declining throughout most regions during if prices dont rise materially The key player in determining how much we produce over the next months is undeniably the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but even fairly conservative assumptions seem to indicate that production will likely drop much lower than where it is today If thats not bullish I dont know what is Tagged Macro View Basic Materials
