style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor June sales rose versus a forecast for a increase Weve been sounding the BUY alarm on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>all week with one article suggesting buying on the Brexit pullback and another commemorating the companys millionth EcoBoost FSeries sold Strong customer demand has helped us continue growing our truck leadership position further widening the gap with our nearest competitor versus last year Consumer demand for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>SUVs also continues to surge to alltime highs allowing us to introduce new levels of capability versatility and technology to a whole new generation of SUV fans We spent the last two weeks writing two separate articles about why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F should be bought on the Brexit panic and also commemorating the company with its success stemming from its innovation that it began after the recession We wrote two articles over the last two weeks talking about why we are long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with a multiyear outlook on the company We acknowledged that there are some worries in the automobile credit markets and that there is a legitimate concern that the automobile industry may be getting ready to have a bit of a financing bubble burst None of this as we pointed out last week changes the fact that the average age of a vehicle on the road is now almost years old and alltime high None of this also addresses the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been able to continue operating with fantastic results without assistance Specifically we said in our last article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the one company that survived the crash without assistance and we think a small burst in the automobile financial market would not phase the company for long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is larger and more diversified globally and economically now as it has ever been This morning we got the news that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sales in June exceeded expectations led by strong performance in highmargin trucks and SUVs The company has been forecasting high margin vehicles leading the way for them since November of Here are some of the key statements that stood out at us from the November call Taking a look at trucks We sold over FSeries thats a strong number for November At that number FSeries retail sales were up and it was our best November ever for F specifically Those numbers boosted overall FSeries volume to a increase for the month This comes against a backdrop of average transaction pricing that was higher than October so sequentially monthtomonth up and higher than a year ago with overall FSeries transaction pricing totaling for trucks So we remain very pleased with the strength of our FSeries business as we close out this year and head into We have been pointing out that this segment of the companys business has been and will continue to be a driver for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>moving forward Granted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had a bad sales month in May of this year However we know that one month does not make a pattern and we stated the following For us however we just dont think that running away due to some poor May sales metrics right off the bat without a pattern is a prudent capital management strategy for a company that has proven that you can exceed expectations and can be friendly to shareholders We dont think its time to panic in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and well continue to hold our shares long while hedging appropriately And here we are today with great results from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>while other automakers like Toyota have had a poor month We pointed out in one of our past articles that one item <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bears cant contend with is the companys ability to continue to post strong numbers The company has posted the following EPS and revenue numbers over the last quarters Applying a conservative x multiple to the average of the years and an annualized number based on Q would give you a target stock price of which is about upside from here Just applying a x multiple to Qs annualized results would give you a stock price just above This potential multiple expansion and the dividend is what keeps us invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Is clear that operationally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to fire on all cylinders The market does not want to assign a serious multiple to the stock because of its worries about the auto financing bubble Our suggestion was to go long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>taking advantage of the companys nearly yield and short CACC or another company with credit exposure to the automobile credit markets For people with a longterm view on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this might be your best way to collect the yield while insuring yourself One thing is for sure month after month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>numbers continue to impress We continue to stay long and will continue to reinvest dividends with a focus on the companys fundamental financial operations
