style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to make an impact dominated by Asian competitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is now following a time tested plan of lower cost engineering to make compact vehicles specifically for India With our long term long position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F were not betting on the company having a great year this year were betting on the companys meticulous selection of capital allocation into select investments to fuel its growth globally over the long term Weve called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a winwin before because we have a very long term time frame in holding the company and in the meantime collecting the companys yield of almost Weve been covering all of the news that comes out of the auto maker to see how it stacks up with our bull case on the company The latest report we wrote was about continued demand for the companys F domestically a sign that the companys backbone of sales remains firm Expanding from firm sales here in the US were mostly betting on Fords ability to move itself globally and position itself to major populous countries like India and China Our argument is that the companys investments in these areas would help out in the future in the form of bottom line improvement For those with a short term view asking when or why Fords stock is going to finally move higher we believe that a tick up on the bottom line will finally be the fuel that does that The company has employed different strategies for different locales which weve pointed out in the types of vehicles theyre manufacturing as well as the way they are advertising This week its being reported that the company is going to continue making geographicalspecific changes to fine tune its international business The company announced that its going to launch a smaller car specifically for India The car is called the Figo Aspire and

how much the Aspire would cost ahead of its launch but executives said that percent of the car had been made locally to keep the price low As the same article noted its going to be tough to compete against Asian competitors making compact cars but at least <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should be able to tap into the vein in India a little further with compact cars designed specifically for the locale While not a major development in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>long case we view this as a sign that the company continues on the right track overseas and that theyre committed to getting their global business on track and efficiently operational As we said in our last article and we continue to say the company is continuing to roll out its foothold globally and become an international powerhouse in the automotive market We continue to believe that as investments in these companies top out or start to slow and the operating leverage begins to take hold the narrowing losses and eventual bottom line growth from its international markets backed by strong domestic sales will be the catalyst that drives <span style='background-color:
