Energys SM CEO Javan Ottoson on Q Results Earnings Call Transcript Seeking Alpha Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the SM Energy Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call At this time all participants are in a listenonly mode Later well conduct a questionandanswer session and instructions will follow at that time Operator Instructions I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for todays call David Copeland General Counselor Sir you may begin Thank you Marcus Good morning to all joining us by phone and online for SM Energy Companys second quarter earnings conference call and operations update Before we start Id like to advise you that we will be making forwardlooking statements during this call about our plans expectations and assumptions regarding our future performance These statements involve risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements For a discussion of these risks you should refer to the cautionary information about forwardlooking statements in our press release from yesterday afternoon the presentation posted on our website for this call and the Risk Factors section of our Form K that was filed earlier this year and our Form Q filed earlier this morning We will discuss certain nonGAAP financial measures that we believe are useful in evaluating our performance Reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other information about these nonGAAP metrics are described in our earnings press release from yesterday Other company officials on the call this morning are Jay Ottoson President and Chief Executive Officer Wade Pursell Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jennifer Samuels Senior Director Investor Relations Well good morning Thanks to all of you for joining Man we have a great quarter and our results yeartodate provide more evidence of our continuing toptier performance Im on slide Weve got a strong balance sheet ample liquidity and a solid operating plan which will help us avoid shareholder dilution We have decades of production at our current levels of production in economic drilling inventory and we have a clear and credible path to replacing and adding substantially to that inventory without the need for acquisitions Our entire focus is on creating longterm differential shareholder value Im going to turn the call over in a minute and let Wade walk you through the quarter and our revised guidance But let me just point out a couple of highlights on slide First weve experienced improving well performance in both the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the Williston Basin which is translating into higherthanprojected production This outperformance is a result of our increasing success in improving lateral placement and completion techniques Second weve seen encouraging new well results in our core development areas which we believe will translate into material growth in our economic drilling inventory Im going to cover those results in more detail later in the call Third our costs are way down with substantial progress in reducing both capital and operating costs Fourth our current financial position is excellent especially compared to our more levered peers Our debt to trailing month EBITDAX is at times and we have very little drawn on our revolver And lastly were positioned to perform differentially we believe in Our current projections indicate that our portfolio can delivery production growth during investing only our EBITDAX even assuming todays depressed strip pricing Thanks Jay Good morning So starting on slide as Jay said it was an outstanding quarter Operational execution was the key factor Well performance in associated higher production combined with achieving sizable cost savings and LOE went to EBITDAX and earnings to beat our projections I believe much of the detail you all need is in the release and the Q but let me give you a little color on a few topics Production for the quarter was million BOE which was ahead of our guidance Wed indicated the production would go down about from the first quarter due to plant maintenance and simultaneous operations that would require Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>indiscernible The plant downtime was completed on schedule and well performance continues to exceed earlier type curves as reflected in the production Obviously better wells means better production Going forward weve raised our annual production guidance from a midpoint of just under million BOE to just under million BOE This implies state ahead production of about to million BOE which will reflect first of all the stepdown associated with the second quarter asset sales of just under million BOE per quarter which was all gas and then an expected decline of about to per quarter as the result of the reduced activity LOE for the quarter at per BOE is really a demonstration of the hard work our team is putting in to efficiencies and cost savings First we are rebidding and negotiating the best possible cost at all levels of the company and were seeing real savings across the board Secondly our Williston team has driven cost efficiencies in our acquired property significantly below the previous operator on which our cost forecast was based Primarily savings and reduced water hauling costs As a result weve made a sizable reduction in our overall LOE guidance for the year from a midpoint of per BOE down to per BOE Clearly the combination of strong production and low cost drove favorable EBITDAX and adjusted earnings for the quarter of million and per share respectively both well above the consensus estimates GA expense before noncash compensation of million includes about million in charges related to the closing of our Tulsa office and we expect to record another million or million in the third quarter We slightly lowered GA guidance to range on average to per BOE for the full year DDA came in within guidance for the quarter We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the impact of lower commodity prices on PDP reserves Moving to slide capital expenditure activity is on schedule at operated properties with second quarter capital at million and thats down from the first quarter CapEx activity was heavily weighted to the first half of the year with roughly twothirds of the program now completed Expenditures totaled million yeartodate We started the year with rigs and a higher cost structure Were now down to nine rigs and expect to release two more rigs in the fall Currently drilling and completion costs are down about in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>compared with similar wells drilled last year In the first half we exceeded budget by about million related to higher facilities cost at nonoperated properties and for higher partner nonconsents Partially offsetting this we are drilling wells faster and gaining efficiencies Netnet we raised our capital guidance by about million to reflect nonop and nonconsents that were charged in the first half of the year Capital expenditures in the third and fourth quarters are expected to be about million stepping down in the third quarter and then stepping down further in the fourth quarter for a total year budget of now billion Lets move on to the balance sheet on slide As Jay mentioned and this is probably one of my most important points this morning DebttoEBITDAX remained at times and we have ample liquidity with a borrowing base of billion and only million drawn Net proceeds from the MidCon asset sale which closed in the quarter were million and reflected the revolver Also during the quarter we have a few timely bond transactions We redeemed all of our outstanding million senior notes that were due and issued million senior notes due in These actions termed out our unsecured debt with the nearest maturity now in and it reduced our average coupon rate to Lastly from me on slide regarding hedges We added NGL hedges in the quarter specifically relating to propane and butane Theres a schedule with details of all of our hedges in the appendix to the slides In general for the second half of we have hedges in place for about of oil of natural and of NGL or gas to production at the midpoint of our guidance Also to note we unwound certain natural gas hedges tied to MidCon production that was sold in the quarter This effectively accelerated hedged revenue and added million of second quarter realized hedges So now Ill turn the call back to Jay to discuss more details on our operations and our growing inventory Jay Thank you Wade Well I mentioned earlier that I wanted to spend time talking about some new well results in our core development areas Those results are some early steps in what is a clear path we believe toward a doubling of economic drilling inventory in all three of our major development projects the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the BakkenThree Forks and the Permian without the need for acquisitions While we have been deferring activity temporarily on our held by production in Permian acreage while weve been adjusting our capital investment pace We have been actively drilling inventory test wells in both the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the BakkenThree Forks play areas Im now on slide Generally our inventory add efforts in those two regions can be put into one of three buckets First testing the opportunity to put more wells than we have previously envisioned in each section of our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>acreage by optimizing spacing and landing zones in the thick Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pay on that acreage Second testing the Bakken interval on our Divide County acreage in North Dakota And third employing enhanced completion techniques in both areas to improve recoveries and enhance economics Im going to start with our operated Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>testing program Slide shows the number and geographic spread of the pilot test we have currently planned The economic inventory count we have previously disclosed for our operated acreage is generally based on developing the field at simple foot or foot plan view spacing in the Southern and Northern portions of the acreage respectively Those spacing assumptions were based on our interpretation of results from wells drilled and completed several years ago which were landed in a single landing zone target essentially in the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and which indicated likely interwell interference at lower spacing using the frac designs we had at that time Now as weve shown with well test and discussed in previous calls and conferences we now know that the upper portion of the to storeyhigh Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale in our area is a much more productive reservoir than we originally believed And our pilot testing is designed to prove that up broadly across our acreage In order to fully understand the pilot test were now performing however its also important to understand how far weve come in the last several years in improving our completion designs As we discussed in our completion Lunch Learn in May we can Audio Gap and model the amount of ph prop fracture surface area we generate with our fracs And weve established that there is a strong correlation between surface area created and well performance Our newest designs are more effective in creating surface area in complex fracture networks that are nearby and connected to the wellbore Weve increased sand volumes in our frac jobs to up to more than pounds per foot of lateral length and weve optimized completion fluids More recently weve been testing smaller sand sizes reduced stage spacing and interstage diversion in our standard stage spacing completions All of these completion improvements are driving better well performance and we know that it contributed to our production outperformance in the second quarter So our pilot test program is intended to progressively prove up additional inventory by employing our high surface area closed to the wellbore frac designs and targeting multiple landing zones within our thick pay section to increase well density on our undeveloped acreage and also infill previouslydrilled wells Were making good progress on getting wells completed and well have a progression of results to share over the next few months and quarters Our first test which results we can discuss is labeled as Pilot and is a well test of tighter wells spacing in Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>landing zones A depiction of Pilot is shown on slide This test is in the center of the second row from the north of our development of the East area what we sometimes referred to as Galvan Ranch I should note that out northern row wells in this area were generally drilled at foot and foot spacing And we will be testing infilling those wells later this year in the pilot test labeled number Our assumed spacing for our current inventory count in a pilot number area is foot plan view lateral spacing And in this test were comparing wells drilled at that spacing with some drilled at foot plan view spacing The lateral length in these wells were dictated by our mowingthegrasstype development pattern in this area and vary in length from to feet in length with an average lateral length of right at about feet Slide shows early production results per thousand foot of lateral from a foot and foot spaced wells There are nine foot space wells in the average foot curve and five foot spaced wells in the foot curve As you can see the rates so far for the foot wells lay essentially right on top of the foot results and all the wells are outperforming our area type curve Now were not showing flowing pressure data on this plot which is probably some of the most important data you can look at But so far were seeing flowing pressures as high or higher on the foot wells as on the s So no indication of increased interwell interference yet with down spacing Now obviously these early results were very encouraging We are attributing much of the good performance on the foot spaced wells in this pilot to our most recent round of completion optimizations As I said earlier weve been optimizing our landing zone targeting within the various portions of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>specifically here within the Lower And these foot wells were pumped with foot stage basing completions which is half our standard foot stage basing So what should investors be thinking about the results of these tests so far Well simple math is that a move to foot planned new spacing versus our current assumptions across the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>not including infill potential between existing widerspaced wells would increase our previouslystated operated Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>drilling inventory by about However its probably more appropriate to say at this time that the early results of this test combined with solid results we already have for Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells simply points to a much higher likelihood of success in higherdensity drilling on our acreage leaving us to that doubling that were talking about Now there will be some skeptics out there who will say yes but what about those other guys who tightened up spacing a few years ago drilled a bunch of wells and now wish they hadnt To be clear what were talking about doing with our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>development is an entirely different thing Our plan is to stagger well completions between different landing zones in the Lower and Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which should reduce the potential for interwell interference In Pilot No were currently completing a well test in a development pattern with some wells that are literally stacked on top of one another in the Upper and Lower portions of the pay And theres just lots of exciting news still to come here Before I leave the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>story I want to note that our operating partner to the North Anadarko is testing additional inventory in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as well We have the opportunity to see that results and I should just convey that they are very encouraging as well Now Im going turn to slide This is our work in Divide County North Dakota where we have a massive and very contiguous position and where weve been improving completions and testing Bakken wells in addition to our normal Three Forks interval development I want to just remind you again that the center of Divide County is a geological sweet spot and that wells here are shallower and cost much lower than southern portions of the BakkenThree Forks play area On slide were showing average results on nine total wells now drilled and completed on our acreage in Divide County in the Bakken horizon As a reminder todate all of our previously stated economic inventory in this area is in the Three Forks As the slide depicts our Bakken wells drilled todate on average are outperforming our Three Forks type curve for the area Also interesting to note Bakken wells are slightly shallower than Three Forks wells and the Bakken shale is easier to drill In fact we just set what we think is a North Dakota state record drilling more than feet of horizontal lateral in one day On a less than nine days spudtorigrelease foot lateral Bakken well We are obviously very encouraged by those results and believe were well underway to doubling our current inventory of gross economic locations in this area The last piece I want update I want to show you today is specifically on improvements and completions and what were seeing there in our Bakken and Three Forks wells And here weve been moving from sliding sleeve open hole completions to plugandperf cemented liner jobs In order to show this on slide we graphed our recent plugandperf results in Divide Country Three Forks wells versus our current type curve which is based on sliding sleeve completions Although plugandperf jobs are a little more expensive about million more per well than sliding sleeves the increasing productivity of our wells is yielding economic wells at even lower prices Were generally seeing this kind of production uplift across our operated assets in the BakkenThree Forks play area And our good stuff just keeps getting bigger and better Turning to slide Id just like to reiterate a couple of key points in closing Our great performance this quarter is a result of our continuing intensive focus on our core assets great operational execution and improving well productivity in our development project areas Our balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity Were seeing the kind of early results we had hoped for in our inventory test pilots And were driving costs down to the point where we can grow profitably within our EBITDAX during SM Energy has consistently been in the top quartile of our peer group for generating debt adjusted per share growth and production reserves and cash flow And our entire focus is on delivering that kind of differential performance for our shareholders going forward Well be happy to take your questions at this point Operator Instructions Our first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond from Simmons Company Please proceed with your question Jay if the current forward strip holds do you think CapEx will be down yearoveryear in And if so what do you think is a rough percentage Yeah Pearce this is Javan and we do think itll be down and roughly to level of our EBITDAX thats right about where we think itll be When we bought those assets in North Dakota last year Those assets werent set up quite like ours And frankly their operating cost were very high And we were unsure how long it was going to take us to really get them in shape to where we could drive those costs down to anywhere near the level that we were operating at So we were pretty conservative in the way we budgeted for that As it turns out our guys have just done a terrific job and in a lot of ways up there and have driven those numbers a lot lower than we expected a lot sooner than we thought A lot of those cost savings had been on optimizing the trucking and water out of those assets and just where we drilled wells and how we handled that has really saved a lot of money Plus generally our LOE is just down significantly across the board We have an internal goal this year of just really driving down total cash cost per barrel and our people have really stepped up to the plate and driven that number down Were well below our budget numbers in every area on cash cost So just really going in a really positive direction And were really happy that we can lower our guidance as a result So Jay just to make sure so when youre talking about your staggered test are you doing kind of one indiscernible Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and then one in the upper part of the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is that the right way to think about it kind of like a Chevrontype pattern or can you give me a little more Just to refresh my memory on that Well David yeah This is Javan That is probably the easiest way to think of it There are several different landing zones in the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In a particular case these wells here we didnt stagger much There was a little bit of different variation between the landing zones I think whats really driving the well performance the lack of interference were seeing earlier on here is that our completion designs are just so much better than it were a couple of years ago Look I know that there was a lot of there were some guys who went out three years ago two three years ago with all their frac designs and went to a very tight spacing and were very aggressive in their pace of development And Im sure a lot of those guys wished they had a doover today that they could go back and respace or widen their spacing change their landing That clearly if you had a small position and you were being really aggressive in your pace and development you could get to that point We are not in that position We have a much larger acreage position Weve got a lot thicker pay than a lot of people Weve got a lot of undeveloped very thick pay and quite frankly we are a learning machine And we are going to put the very best job very best completions we can at the very best landing zones staggered across this acreage And I firmly believe that thats going to result in a lot more inventory than we are currently getting credit for Okay And I know Im getting way ahead of myself but when you start thinking about how much data do you need to see how many pilot tests I mean if you if these pilot tests work this year I mean youre talking about doing these across the basin at what point do you feel comfortable saying its Thats exactly the same kind of question were asking ourselves how much do we have to have to you dont want to ever claim victory prematurely or I will say that in a sense a bit of a downturn that weve had in activity levels certainly our cash flows have come down too Were slowing pace a little bit So it gives us time to incorporate all these learnings into our development planning And as we move into were going to be looking very hard at what are the impacts of this on our infrastructure planning And well be working with our infrastructure partner there to think about okay if we go to really intensive development per section what does that mean So I think is going to be a really key year for us in terms of really turning the boat a little bit away from the sort of a very simple singlelanding zone planned Utype spacing to more D ph chest if youll say that way in our development But man really exciting a lot of opportunity And what I think is really important here is that as we develop more and more inventory what that gives you the ability to do is high grade more and more even within your portfolio helps you maintain the kind of high returns that weve had historically And I think thats a part that we really are looking forward to as well Okay And just a final question just as I think about the I guess the upper part of the lower and realize that Im generalizing here but whats the if these were not to work I mean obviously the initial results reflect the ph workin but whats the geologic risk I mean is it fracking into that I dont know what that frac barriers right above the upper part of the lower between that and the upper but is that could there be something in there that youre fracking into or why looking six months down the road would this not work I think the biggest risk of the program is always that you make a judgment based on data too early frankly and are overaggressive The big mistakes people make in oil and gas development are generally over drilling So you want to make sure that you dont go nuts here and go to a rapidpace downspaced development too quickly I think a lot of those risks are mitigated for us because were not talking about a single landing zone development anymore here Were talking about staggering We know that the Upper is productive One point I want to make here as we went back as weve gone back and really looked at how weve landed a lot of our Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells we did land a number of them toe up Wed come in and then start drilling up dip In a number of our Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells a good portion of that wellbore is actually above the LowerUpper interface And weve had some really terrific wells among those wells that we toe up So we know that the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is very productive just above the interface So I dont think theres a lot of risk from that standpoint of if we stagger these wells some and were just careful not to down space too far I think we can manage that risk Again a little bit of slower activity period we have here gives us the chance to do thorough testing and to make sure that were not getting ahead or too far over our skis But I think its something that we can clearly manage Frankly weve always been more conservative on spacing than other people anyway Thats just part of our nature And were going to do the right work to get this right Yeah Thanks Yeah Jay again nice job Your D ph chess nice analogy there Could you remind me if you have or plan to do sort of a largescale micro seismic survey in monitoring the results Yeah Subash weve done a lot of micro seismic out there and have done and have tracked a lot of it At this point we dont have a lot of micro seismic to do associated with this Were really more focused on just getting wells landed and completed in the various areas and focusing very hard on this surface area what we call ph AC Route K in generating these complex fractures We really think that the measurements we can do using pressure and volume relationships can tell us a lot about frac about where a fracture is going and how thats going without having to spend a lot more money on micro seismic at this point Okay And so in reference to slide just want to confirm so the s versus the wider space the completion recipe on the infills were actually less stimulated than the offset Is that what you Yeah The wells were generally completed at foot stage basin We did have some in there that were done at foot stage basin So its sort of a mix The s were essentially all done at the foot stage basin So some of them were done with exactly the same sand loading per foot Some of them were done with a little bit higher sand loading per foot So theres a couple of different tests going on We didnt show all that data yet because a lot of it is just not conclusive yet between various wells These are averages But in general the s had were drilled at tighter stage spacing Now one of the most interesting things were doing right now is and weve done some work already I mentioned it I think was that were doing some work looking at wider stage spacing but using interstage diversion using various materials that several of the frac companies have And weve seen some really good initial results on that And in fact the well pilot were going to be doing up in the northern area were going to be using foot stage spacing with interstage diversion on all those wells based on the results weve seen so far And that would be a less expensive way to basically accomplish this same kind of lower stage spacing So again were just going to keep driving on innovating on improving these completions And theres more stuff to come on that Oh okay At Divide County the water handling I imagine youve gone from perhaps trucking all of it to maybe a better way of disposing of it and if thats correct and if thats an ongoing project or if its largely done Well actually a lot of what we did in reducing costs was just figured out ways to reduce the distance we were trucking We were able to acquire develop some more water Audio Gap such that we didnt have to haul the water so far We still have some and were not going to do this in the short term But we still have some capital we would like to spend over the next few years in developing a water pipeline system on a lot of the acquired acreage We already have that on our previouslyoperated acreage So I think theres actually room to reduce costs even further as we go down the road But wed have to spend a little more capital to do it Got it Okay And thanks for taking all the questions Just a couple more if I could Just one on the I think the per barrel or something like that transport cost in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>properties When do you shake that Is there a time when you shake that and can you get something more competitive Well Ill take a little bit of issue with your comment competitive The reason it is what it is because we didnt pay any capital for this process and so our costs are higher because we didnt pick capital costs So I think it is actually a very competitive contract based on the fact that we didnt have to put up the money Second when you get out of that five years there is a significant drop in our gathering fees Basically we get to the point where we help the midstream folks pay for their system and we do see a drop back in like the timeframe where we see a pretty significant drop in gathering fees Okay Yeah Thats a very good thats a very fair point True And then finally do you have Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>nonop production breakdown this quarter or Just two quick questions on guidance into the back half of the year I think previously on production you had mentioned kind of an expectation coming into the third and fourth quarter that volumes would be down to and I think kind of implied it as you mentioned in the guidance youve provided now that volumes could be down to per quarter So just wanted to get a sense of kind of whats driving the change there especially given the well outperformance and kind of how you guys think about that Yeah This is Wade I mean we first of all obviously the second quarter is a significantly higher number than we were talking about back in the first quarter We did have a great quarter And before we were I think last time we were talking we werent we didnt had not completed the MidCon divestiture yet And for now were just thats the activity is reduced and were reflecting that in our guidance So thats kind of it is what it is Okay Perfect And then I guess secondarily on the LOE side I know that you guys have talked about kind of some of the structural changes you saw in the LOE drop in the Q which has been a huge improvement quarteroverquarter Again kind of looking at the guidance numbers that implied that theres a pretty significant ramp coming into Q and Q but kind of all the commentary and the calls suggested this is structural Can you just give us some incremental color as we think about kind of Q and Q guidance around LOE Whats indiscernible that higher Sure I mean look I mean obviously were very pleased with the second quarter results significantly below what we expected We have lowered the guidance somewhat I think at this point were just being a little cautious on baking all of that in at this point Okay Great And then just last question for me DDA had an uptick Just curious if you can provide some context around what drove that I guess specifically I know you guys do midyear reserves Just trying to get a little a better sense of kind of what was the change there whether it was kind of PUD or PDP kind of revisions just trying to get some color Yeah Certainly nothing related to PUDs I mean we do look at our reserves again at midyear and thats actually essentially PDP only I mean as prices have fallen significantly over the last year that does have some impact on the really on the tails of the PDP So we decided to raise the guidance in kind of in anticipation I will say that back to the cost guidance the cost following so significantly there is a chance thatll have an offsetting effect when we go into yearend reserves and really do a much more thorough analysis at that point Thats really the reason Hey Jay Great ops update And I was hoping you could expand upon some Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>data a little bit here And I think really just trying to get some context on potential returns youd ultimately expect to see out here And I respect that its early days here I probably dont want to peg a specific IRR at oil or something like that but maybe if you could compare this the returns how they can ultimately stack up against your Permian acreage which I think is commonly thought of as amongst the best shale acreage in the US how Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can ultimately compare ph versus that Well thats a great question And Ill just say upfront we have been really surprised as weve gone through sort of our midyear updates on type curves and well costs and how well our returns on a lot of these on the best portions of our acreage and a lot of its really good But on the very best portions how high those returns have continued to stay And its a little scary frankly from an industry standpoint that when we look at a quality acreage like ours that we can still make really decent returns And a lot of that is because costs are so much lower than they were This acreage here that we had drilled in this pilot is right in the gut of the Eastern portion of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And these wells have very high returns And were indiscernible these wells now for under million apiece and its really an astonishing number So they will have very high returns In comparison to the Permian and honestly when we run the numbers today theyre very very similar Our Permian wells do have really high returns particularly at lower Spraberry stuff And were going to get back to drilling that as quickly as we can at high density It keeps rolling in pieces here But I think if youd stack everything up today our Bakken Gooseneck stuff our Permian lower Spraberry stuff in this area and Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are all going to have very very good returns Obviously everything the values of all these stuff are down because cash flows are down But when you look at returns on capital employed these things all have pretty good returns apiece even at low price Got it And I think it might beg the question a little bit if ultimately the returns are very similar to Permian just look at where the stocks trade right now I think you guys sort of really one of the cheapest names in the midcap space and your Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>inventory might be doubling or tripling here with competitive returns Is the Permian makes sense indiscernible have in the portfolio or is that something that if MA is to be bid out there its really attractive that you potentially look to monetize or really clean up the balance sheet and accelerate new Thank you Well let me well go back first to your question A we dont need to clean up the balance sheet We got almost as strong as balance sheet in our peer group And we have no intention at diluting our shareholders We have an operating plan It doesnt require us to do that So were not in a position where we need to go sell assets to clean up the balance sheet With that said we dont sell oily inventory at the bottom of a price cycle Everything we own is always for sale And certainly we look at all the opportunities to maximize value We believe that our Permian acreage is very highvalue acreage that there are significant additional intervals that we can prove out there that will expand the value of that and that that piece of property would be worth a lot more money at higher prices And so at this point we dont see any compelling reason to be selling our Permian position In fact were going to get back to drilling it As quickly as we can get within our cash flows were going to get back out there and do it And were excited about the opportunity that we think can potentially double or more our inventory in the Permian And as you said our acreage is in the very best portion of the Wolfcamp B trend in the entire Midland Basin and the Lower Spraberry stuff looks even better to us So again were expanding inventory Thats the game were playing Our balance sheets in good shape and clearly were not really in the mode of selling all the inventory at the bottom and thats what we would be doing if we sold that asset right now Update I think Matt addressed a number of my questions One question though on the outlook just curious what sort of additional color maybe you could give on the activity level that would be implied by that within EBITDA spending level would you drop grade to get there drop it further rely more heavily on drawing down that indiscernible count or just any additional color around the activity and investment levels associated with that high level guidance Sure Well Im happy to do that I think our current plan for would envision something between a seven and eightrig program So very similar to our program say in the third and fourth quarters of this year As weve said we think well be spending around our EBITDAX number which ballpark number is in billion kind of range We will certainly be drawing down duck count in Were building out Were actually going to end the year as I think we said with even a higher duck count than we had planned so were okay Bad joke Were getting our ducks in a row And were planning to complete a lot of those wells in which certainly increases our capital efficiency during what we think is basically the bottom of the trough for cash flows And then as we come through our projections would suggest that were going to be growing quarteroverquarter in and were back on a growth trajectory at that point So I think you can expect that well be drilling on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at a reasonable rate that well have some Permian activity and some Bakken activity in that mix And again I think well be growing quarteroverquarter during Very helpful Appreciate it And I guess is it may be too early to ask but if we were to lets say strip out the MidCon for is that yearonyear annual growth as well And are you through in the exit rate versus exit rate Im just trying to Yearoveryear Yeah That barrels a day is hard to come up with but I think on an average yearonyear basis well be pretty much flat on retained assets Okay Very helpful And then I guess in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the stage spacing differences you outlined is there any cost differences between foot versus or is it spread now similar amount of money over more stages or how does that work It does cost more money to pump more stages and a little more wireline work and a little more time on location although quite frankly our efficiencies have gotten so high out there now I mean weve had days were pumping stages a day So just I mean the numbers that two years ago or three years ago you would have just laughed about that youre never going to get there So our well costs are continuing to get down It is a little more expensive to pump tighter stage basin Its one of the reasons were really interested in these interstage diversion products that were experimenting with because basically you can get the same kind of impact And to be clear what were chasing there is more frac initiation points spreading that sand out better near the wellbore And the reason thats so important if you get a more complex frac close to the wellbore you have less frac extension you can put these wells closer together Thats what were all chasing And our surface area calculations that were doing are suggesting to us that thats working for us Weve done it Yeah Im sorry to interrupt We have done it several two ways I mean In some of these wells we actually just cut the sand per stage and a half or the volume per stage and a half And then in a couple other wells we actually stepped up the sand the frac size per stage a little bit to see what the impact of that is So were going to be looking at data that for half stage exact same job essentially and half stage slightly larger job and then looking at those results and saying okay given the cost in each of those does that work I will tell you early on the results there are some differences and it pretty much fracs with how much money is The more money you spent the better the well you got But the results are so close together this early And in the life of the well its probably too early to draw a conclusion on the economics there Okay Fair enough Lots of tinkering Sounds good And then oil differentials were pretty improved in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Rockies Are those presustainable you think Will the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>kind of attract the LLS WTI differentials still you think Or how things indiscernible I know the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>looked better I mean I would emphasize to track the LLS there I think the LLS versus WTI was a little different during the second quarter So I would just point you to that Okay And then do you have a completion count by chance in the JV thats associated with the production there Yes So gross wells in the APC JV in the second quarter Okay Thats the number And those would be a varying working interest for us Yeah Good morning Jay on the Pilot No if that continues to attract your foot spaced wells whats the next step there if I heard you right It sounds like you feel pretty confident about the upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>potential Is the plan to go try an upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well in between those lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells or can you extrapolate from the other pilots that youre doing if those work where youre testing upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>work test Can you assume that is going to work in that eastern area as well Great question Mike I think in that eastern area theres a couple of different things were doing As I said earlier a lot a number of the wells we drill over there do have some were kind of completed in the upper portion of the lower and they tail up into the upper So as we look at the opportunities say for infill and development there certainly for infill what were probably looking at is more of a lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>infill program between those existing wells In the undeveloped areas certainly we need to look more closely at landing some wells more staggered lower up or lower upper and thats the test we need to do that we probably wont get done this year Its probably a kind of timeframe for us Obviously well learn a lot from the pilots were doing a little farther to the west where we are doing exactly that to see how that works out When we were planning this initial pilot we were really focused on just testing spacing in a near well near landing zone area and so we didnt get that piece in I do think there is potential in the east in an upper lower stagger to potentially even push these wells closer together and at some point we need to test that If you look at the pilot tests Im going to look for a slide here thats slide Is that right Slide or where we show the pilots I think its pilot number three which is sort of in the its sort of just a little bit south of the east area We call it the south area test That well is a lower upper lower staggered test I think its a fivewell test if I memorize everything So well have some true lower lower upper lower Those wells will be at a foot plan view spacing So in the same lower or upper landing zones it will be feet So here well be testing a W essentially at foot plan view versus the that we just showed here So those results theyll be really informative and help us see if okay how much harder do we want to chase even tighter lowerupper stagger in the east Got it Okay Lets switch over to the Bakken Looks like youre getting some pretty encouraging results there Youve got a couple of stepout wells planned I believe to the south Im just wondering the timing of those And if the nine wells continue to track your Three Forks or I guess bigger Three Forks type curve it looks like these stepouts work Is that enough data to say this is likely going to work over the majority of your acreage Well the two wells that youre referring to that are farther south are going to be completed in August and September So well have data Give us days on that and well have some data there I mean I think based on what were seeing so far with Three Forks wells down that area Were pretty we have pretty high chance that those are going to work for us Type curves just earlier are really tough And were resisting drawn the type curves for those Bakken wells so far just because a lot indiscernible on the north end and its still early But yes weve certainly seen a lot of encouragement there And I think by the time we get to ph summon up our inventory at yearend were going to be adding quite a bit of Bakken inventory Very good And then last one You spoke a little bit about the Permian I believe youd and it sounds like youre very encouraged on the lower Spraberry I believe you drilled the middle Spraberry well before you let that rig go Has that been completed yet and early signs there Hey Good morning guys I was hoping you could maybe break down a little bit the components of the inventory expansion opportunities out in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>You mentioned you could add by the downspacing But I guess how much could you add from the infill between producing wells How much from staggering in the lower and then also how much for the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Well now if you really add all these up and you look at okay what could it all be youre talking numbers that are two or three times our current inventory And so it just depends on what spacing you end up with and how many upper versus lowers you drill And the current number of wells we have already drilled lets say foot spacing is in the kind of range I think So theres a couple probably infills or something like that You could do and the numbers get really big The point I wanted to make with that number is look thats just easy math And in fact what were testing is orders of really in order of magnitude different from that And so we havent laid out even for ourselves really we havent laid out a completely ph unrisked stacked four wells in every wells in every section kind of thing because it again is at D versus D problem But the numbers are big What were hoping people will get out of this is that when we say double thats not an unreasonable expectation Because the problem is we thrown out some really big numbers and everybody will go off and risk them to nonexistence And that doesnt really get you anywhere either But I really do think if you think about what weve shown on Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>productivity what were showing about the potential to move these wells closer together with better completions that a double is a pretty easy thing to get your mind around And if we can get people to accept double right now thats fine Okay And just looking at the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>how many wells you have producing at this point and I guess how have those wells been trending And are there certain areas where you think the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>might look better than the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and vice versa Well if you look at standalone completely landed in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>only wells I think weve showed data on four that are out there And those wells are performing well The reality as I mentioned earlier in the discussion was that a number of our wells that were completed in the lower actually have significant portions of the lateral in the upper And in fact a number of our wells in that eastern area the north part of our eastern area row one a lot of those wells about half the laterals in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>So we know that the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is highly productive in the upper Thats really not a question for us We drilled those standalone wells to prove it to people But we know the upper can make wells Were confident that we have some of the very thickest energetic Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bay on the entire play The pilot testing as we go forward will help us demonstrate that to people And then whats really going to be interesting and fun is as we start to stagger these wells Upper Lower is how close we can get them together in planned view And that will end up determining your earlier question about how many wells are there really out there And well get more and more data on that as we go forward And just quickly touching back on the Permian Do you have an update on what you think you can drill wells for out there and the EUR expectations for the indiscernible over at Spraberry at this point We think we can drill a foot well out there right now for around million And frankly you know we dont compete in the EUR contest with people But if you look at our wells and Id encourage you to look at the public data on our wells and plot them over anybody elses curves publicallypresented curves these are big wells Im not going to tell you the kind of numbers other people might tell you for that because we dont usually kind of tell the clients what other people use in their forecasts But our production lays really nicely over some really big well curves that other people are putting out Well were still doing work on that in the lower Spraberry again we have about a foot thick section there And I think you got the potential to put something like wells per section in there pretty easily We really need to get our activity level up higher and were doing a lot of simulation right now as were kind of in this downtime period to tune up our plans One of the interesting issues with the Permian is when we get back to drilling there we really want to start drilling at much higher state and much denser spacing which means you get a lot of wells drilled before you complete any of them And that is a bit of an issue here when youre in this cashoncash kind of business right now you want to turn cash but certainly we want to get to an optimum development which will be much denser we think in several of those intervals Hello guys A quick question on the billion EBITDAX kind of ballpark that you mentioned earlier Dave for next year what price deck or can you say what price deck that assumes I apologize but indiscernible we need to limit everybody to one question because were running out of time So Ill give you another one though Okay Indiscernible The new sliding Im sorry The new plugandperf type curve the green line in the presentation I believe the red line from the sliding sleeve implied a barrel EUR Have you mentioned can you quantify what the green line represents a quick one on the ducks getting them in a row What would you guys need to see to either do those ahead of time before And then is there any constraint via geologic operational or regulatory on when you complete those wells or how long they can remain uncompleted There are some constraints Were not going to have a problem with that based on the way we have it planned I dont think we will pick up and start completing during this calendar year Were pretty committed to our capital where we are on our capital program versus cash flow at this point And I dont think youll see us make a meaningful effort to get after a lot of that until Well there are some issues in North Dakota I think its a year you have a year if I remember right to kind of a running basis to get your wells completed So we would have to get it faster at some point But were not in any jeopardy at this point Great Thanks a lot guys The question I had was looking at the CapEx numbers for Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Bakken given the soft guidance there of flat I guess flat to nominal growth yearonyear staying within cash flow is there any incremental facilities capital that would be needed to be added to those well costs if you were to raise your growth expectations at all I guess both Im just kind of curious like kind of what the runway is on the infrastructure gas handling water handling et cetera as you look at those two basins Well if you look at the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we dont pay for our gathering and stuff So there will be no incremental capital to us We are continuously in a process of working with our provider there to get ahead us as we look at this And certainly were sharing various scenarios with them about how fast we might be going in order to make sure that we have enough capacity out there And theyre indiscernible really been good to work with and were doing great there On the Bakken side I dont really see incremental cost Every well we drill has a certain amount of facility costs with it Its pretty much a standalone well development At some point we do want to do some water handling infrastructure up in the Gooseneck area but that is probably a couple of years off at this point In nonop Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>they havent spent some money and certainly will spend a little bit But obviously our working interest there is fairly low Hey I think thats the last question we had indiscernible I just want to thank
