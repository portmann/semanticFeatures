posted a fantastic quarter beating on both lines and sending the stock up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares many of the same fundamental basics as GM We are hoping that General Motors NYSE GM earnings tell us everything that we need to know about Fords NYSE F upcoming earnings call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to be reporting on October and if General Motors was any indication how the domestic automakers are doing with their global rollouts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors will likely be very happy next week We have already disclosed that we have a very longterm investment horizon for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>somewhere between and years but while our investment focus is long term we are of course interested in the shortterm indicators of how the business is performing This is part of the reason that every month we monitor domestic auto sales overseas auto sales and monthly metrics like EU registration data which gives us a look at the auto market in Europe as a whole Judging by General Motors last earnings report all of the key points to our bull case on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seem to be all systems go To quickly review General Motors report the company blew away bottom line expectations by posting EPS which was about above estimates The company also posted billion in revenue which was slightly ahead of consensus estimates Margins were well above and the company made the comment that margins over were here to stay In addition the company performed well in China and cited success overseas as supplementing its domestic success where fueled by easily accessible credit US truck sales and SUVs outperformed There are a lot of reasons why this is good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and were going to run down the list of what we think is promising First the general narrative is exactly the same as what our bull case is for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Since we have been writing about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we have been stating that we believe the key to the stock driving higher is continued domestic demand supplemented by overseas operations that are trying to move toward profitability We have been fans of the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has allocated its capital in investing in itself and its operations in densely populated areas like India and China GMs narrative to go along with this earnings report sounds very similar to what we believe Fords narrative would be for a successful quarter Second the main focus was trucks and SUVs for General Motors Since we have been writing about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we have been stating that the companys F line supplemented by Mustang was going to be the major driving force behind domestic auto sales We are now officially over the question of whether or not the public is going to take to the new aluminum body vehicle and we know now that the F is a hit Truck and SUV growth was solid for General Motors and we believe that the signs of increased significant demand for these vehicles from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to propel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to also have a fantastic order Third General Motors margins were fantastic We also believe that Fords margins are going to be impressive We believe this because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had recently introduced a new higherend luxury model of its F specifically to meet the demand for consumers that were looking to spend additional money on this line of trucks This type of demand at the highend of the ASP spectrum tells us that margin for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could also wind up coming in as a very impressive number Fourth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>consumers have essentially the same access to capital and credit that General Motors consumers have If access to credit was what was really fueling General Motors great quarter we can expect the same to be true for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In terms of the class of customer and that consumers access to credit between the two companies there is likely very little if any difference <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>consumers have likely taken advantage of very small incentives and the same easy access to credit that General Motors consumers have Fifth General Motors success in China leads us to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also finding some success in China As you may recall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has invested a significant sum in China over the last years and the company actually recently added to that investment in the billions by investing in trying to create the next smart car We wrote about this investment a couple of days ago and we were pleased that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to use its capital to invest in itself rather than making a significant buyback at these stages Finally in the data that we have looked at over the last to months consisting mostly of North American auto sales and European auto registrations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors have had very little deviation between each other Thus we believe that if General Motors can make these growth numbers work that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can do the same The main risk right now seems to be availability of credit While this has been unfolding there have been numerous questions beginning to rise about the state of subprime auto loans and whether or not we are beginning to create another bubble Keeping one eye on subprime auto loans is a great way to keep one eye on potential risk scenarios for both US automakers While keeping an eye on this risk we continue to happily hold our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>collecting the companys healthy dividend and awaiting this quarters results We think that applying a generous multiple of times next years estimates to General Motors shows that the company could be priced at above We believe this multiple is fair based on the results that we got yesterday Performing the same exercise with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we would see a price target of about Furthermore we believe that the company will probably blow away analyst expectations after a few more years once it has time to really dig in and saturate all of the
