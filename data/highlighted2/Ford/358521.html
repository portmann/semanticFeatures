sales data for US automakers slows slightly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has similar blips on the radar during its record year in With a hedge against auto credit and the average age of vehicles on the road at all time highs we continue to like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the long run We have been writing about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F for the better part of the last two years For the most part we have been bullish on the company stating numerous times that we believe it to be a great multiyear buy and hold investment For the most part we will admit that we have been on the wrong side of this trade But it is not a trade for us it is a chance to add a longterm holding to our portfolio and allow it to sit and reinvest over the course of numerous quarters Today we wanted to review some recent performance results talk about ways to continue to hedge against a financing bubble in auto and most importantly talk about a key metric that a lot of analysts do not seem to be paying attention to First lets review the companys performance in March March was a disappointing month for both of the domestic US automakers as tough comps from the year prior have been making it more difficult for the company to post impressive year over year results Here is a wrap up of March data courtesy of Seeking Alpha March US auto sales rose YY but a disappointing adjusted annual rate of M vehicles came in well below analyst expectations and the M clip the industry enjoyed in February <span

into the idea that with being a record year maybe were set up to start peaking a little bit in terms of consumer demand Bloombergs Kevin Tynan says However historicallylow gasoline prices and interest rates continue to lure consumers to dealer showrooms setting the stage for car sales this year to remain near s record M says Barclays analyst Brian Johnson who adds that some automakers will need to cough up incentives to keep it there For months we have been saying that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F series needs to continue to be the backbone to the companys sales especially in the United States Sales of the companys F pickup truck made from aluminum have helped drive the companys resurgence after the financial crisis We have stated on numerous occasions that we need Fseries sales to continue in a robust fashion alongside other good domestic selling vehicles like the companies Mustang Despite poor sales numbers in March we have continued to see the F series lead the way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the United States From Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F records its best performance ever in the US during March as FSeries demand stayed strong FSeries volume topped K vs the K for the line of Chevrolet Silverado pickups Sales growth by brand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to Lincoln to units Sales growth by model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fiesta to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fusion to <span

Lincoln MKC to Lincoln Utilities to Leading up to the companys record your last year and even throughout there were peaks and valleys in the companys performance There were several months where it looked as though growth was slowing or European auto registrations slowed down and we encouraged investors to continue to look at the big picture and take a larger view of the results for the year We think we are simply seeing another one of these valleys with this March data and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sales will continue to hold strong moving forward Of course credit quality has likely deteriorated as we have moved further and further from the financial crisis and as the shortterm debt cycle has a tendency to turn over every to years But whether or not there is reason to be concerned is the real question Heres how companies like Credit Acceptance NASDAQ CACC have fared in that time CACC provides automobile dealers financing programs and related products and services In a few past articles we have recommended having a small short position on in CACC only if you were nervous about the quality of the credit that automakers are distributing CACC is the vehicle through which many of these domestic automakers distribute their credit and we think it would make for a good hedge for those still looking to collect Fords dividend and perhaps protect against a broad market pullback or a specific credit event in automobiles This brings us to our final point which is a large key metric that many people have missed The average vehicle age in the US is at all time highs Despite the fact that credit worthiness of customers has likely moved lower and despite the fact that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has had a record your last year the average age of the vehicle on the road is at the highest it has ever been The average age of vehicles on the road is now over years This speaks obviously to the quality of the vehicles that are being produced of late but it also means that there may still be some fresh demand for new automobiles as we move forward We think that this factor could be the single most important ignored metric in the automobile space right now Our warning signs to owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would be whether or not the company has trouble stringing together several good months in a row or whether or not some of the financing market in autos starts to teeter on the brink We are keeping a close eye on both of these items in between companies reporting earnings but at this point we still do not see much reason to be concerned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to pay and attractive dividend that we are happy to reinvest as we move forward As you can see valuation on an earnings basis is as low as it was heading into F PE Ratio Forward data by YCharts Furthermore the company issued a special dividend last year as a way to add knowledge to shareholders that they believe the equity is mispriced and that they are committed to deploying capital to shareholders We like that move for management and that is the type of stock we want to own Lets take a look at the valuation As was commented on by another Seeking Alpha article out last week Fords valuation is the same as what it was back in This is pricing the company for some type of imminent collapse whether it be from a lag in sales or financing trouble We just dont believe that the compressed valuation matches the amount of risk thats involved with owning the company here and as such we think the Company remains a good longterm buy I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Consumer Goods Auto Manufacturers Major </div></body></html>
