increase in US auto sales in June compared to June as the new F aluminumbodied model continued to see tight supply levels The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang saw the strongest June sales since With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expecting to reach full inventory levels in September it remains well positioned to take advantage of the growing US auto industry in the second half of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F announced June US vehicle sales of K up from the same month in This increase came in slightly below the increase estimated by analysts Fords yearoveryear increase came despite overall US auto sales crushing expectations for the month with industrywide growth of With the poor winter weather behind consumers and gas prices remaining low analysts are expecting sales to be million which would be the strongest year in a decade Despite another miss compared to analyst expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>believes a strong second half is coming as the new aluminumbodied F pickup is reaching full production levels for the first time all year Based on this I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>June was the beginning of the lagging turnaround The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F production is continuing to ramp up the Kansas City assembly plant which is expected to reach full production levels later this quarter The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company has not utilized heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors Because of this the F saw another record setting average transaction price during June Additionally the new F is seeing positive consumer reactions when it makes it to the customer lot with a quick turnover time According to management the new F is turning twice as fast on dealer lots than the industry average for halfton pickups This turnover time bodes well for the company going forward as management said the company only had half of their normal inventory levels on dealer lots in June While this is encouraging it is disappointing that management doesnt expect to have to reach full supply levels until September Despite this setback I continue to be optimistic of Fords future because I think it is important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to get this product launch right as they are taking the Fseries brand in a new direction designed for better fuel mileage With optimal inventory levels expected in September I think its important to look at the quick turnover time of the model and the very strong US auto market Both of these indicators are signs of a positive second half of for the F and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as a whole In June the US auto consumer continued the shift back to less fuelefficient vehicles in response to the falling fuel prices This shift in consumer sentiment will boost sales for the companys higher profit margin vehicles such as the F Explorer and Expedition The Mustang saw another impressive month in June consistent with early results Mustang sales were at their highest June level since and continue to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in This is a title the company has not held since before the Chevrolet Camaro was introduced During June Mustang sales were up with Mustangs sold I believe the sports car segment will continue to see rapid growth as the weather warms and the US economy improves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is certainly losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions Generally a lot of times a customer will purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model This has been seen in the performance of Chevrolets Silverado and GMCs Sierras which combined saw more sales than Fords Fseries in May and June Furthermore GMs NYSE GM two fullsize trucks together are expected to outsell the Fseries this year for the first time in five years However this is not the big picture an investor should be seeing when buying shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>They should be seeing managements plan to shorten the companys normal summer shutdown in order to increase production This shows me as an investor the new Fs results are positive and the high end models are selling well which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward Once full production capacity is reached I fully expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to start leading the pack Given this longterm optimism with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I am not too worried about monthly US sales figures as long as they are not catastrophic I continue to be excited about the companys future as the new aluminum bodied F is nearing full production levels the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles and the strong sales of the Mustang With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to report stronger top line and bottom line growth in the second half of I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market I will continue to enjoy the near dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the longterm Source Fords Strong Second Half Is Setting Up Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in F over the next hours MoreI
