triple the industry average while our incentives are down showing how much customers value our investment in new vehicles with the latest technologies While the ASP is important and goes to show robust demand for a product that isnt being incentivized as much as industry comparables like GM we would have liked to see a stronger number from the FSeries Here is what a majority of the full report looked like As you can see the companys FSeries number was down YOY from to What is even more peculiar about this was last summer the company was expecting a slowdown in FSeries numbers as it was prepping for the launch of the new F It was widely expected that those comparable numbers wouldnt be robust as the company guided consumers away from the older model FSeries in anticipation of its
