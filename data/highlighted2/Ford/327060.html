NYSEF Seeking Alpha Both GM and F are highly dependent on North America sales for their profitability Several market indicators point to continued strength in US auto sales through That means both GM and F will benefit from lower interest rates and higher auto sales keeping their North America net income at current or slightly higher levels I recently wrote an article Automakers Getting Run Over Load Up On GM And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>While The Goings Bad in which I detailed why auto sales in the US arent likely to plummet to the levels the market expects them to After reading through the comments section of the article I realised that it would be a good idea to expand the analysis even further and find important factors that can influence sales and as such the fortunes of GM NYSE GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F in particular for the year Both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are extremely dependent on their sales and operational performance in the United States as shown below In GMs North America and International segments Asia Pacific and Middle East were the only profitable ones with the former bringing in billion in income before interest and taxes and the latter netting billion All other segments reported a loss The story was the same in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on the other hand was profitable in all segments except for South America in However most of the segments only did a little better than breakeven even as North America brought in billion in income To put it simply North America is what is keeping both these companies profitable If their net income were to approach a breakeven point in this critical segment they would be staring losses right in the face As such they are highly dependent on their performance in this region Though the relationship between low oil prices and car sales hasnt been proven beyond reasonable doubt I believe oil prices play at least a small factor during the decisionmaking process of buying a car Gas consumption is one of the things I look at when buying a car but when I know that gas prices are going to be low for the foreseeable future I might just look at something bigger that doesnt have the fuel economy I would otherwise want Admittedly low oil price doesnt necessarily send people rushing to their local dealerships but it does push them towards larger models The point here is that these models are typically more profitable for the company to sell and for the dealer who influences their decision to a significant degree Case in point is the SUV boom thats happening around the world and more relevant to this article in the United States With oil price being cited as the tipping point analysts are saying that the average consumer has returned to their prerecession taste in automobiles Ever since the US economy came out of recession interest rates have plunged and so have auto loan interest rates As an example the fouryear auto loan for new cars has been dropping steadily since and is currently at its lowest level for the decade Nobody expects Janet Yellen to raise interest rates in a flash because its just not possible without shocking the economy Interest rates will of course move to saner levels at some point but its going to be slowly and steadily done over a period of time From a recent Reuters report Feb Falling commodity and stock prices in the past few weeks along with slowing domestic and global economic growth had undermined market expectations for further Federal Reserve interest rate rises this year ahead of the central banks next policy meeting on March The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero in December the first rate hike in nearly a decade One interesting point of note here is that the interest rate chart since looks the exact inverse of the lightweight auto sales chart which includes light trucks So if interest rates remain at current levels which they most probably will then logically theres a high degree of probability that auto sales will remain at their current high levels The number of used cars sold in the US went down from a staggering million units in to a little over million units in December turned out to be one of the industrys most successful sales months while sales dipped by percent in December compared with the same month one year earlier Light truck sales grew by percent in compared with Persisting low oil prices are expected to further increase the number of cars and trucks sold in the USA In light of an aging light vehicle fleet a growing number of people will also likely replace their old vehicle with a new one On average US passenger cars are years old The used car market is a great secondary indicator for how new auto sales is trending When people buy fewer used cars and the age of cars on the road keeps increasing it means that people are keeping their old cars when buying a new one As auto sales strengthen to new levels this will subsequently reflect in the average age of cars There were so many doomsday theories swirling around the auto industry since the end of last year where socalled peak auto sales in the United States was merely a lead into a major decline in I disputed these theories with hard data over a year period in my first article In January auto sales remained at a healthy million after it showed slight signs of weakness since touching million in October It is now indisputable that we have reached any sort of peak auto in the United States and I expect this trend to continue through the year or as long as the prevalent boom conditions I spoke of hold steady Which brings me back to my original thesis for this article Investorspeak My Outlook for GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>From the above analyses of various factors influencing auto sales in the United States its clear that the primary driver of those sales is low interest rates while low oil prices tend to push buyers towards cars that are more profitable for the manufacturer and the dealers Even if interest rates are hiked during the second half of there is a high probability that auto sales will remain above the million per month region Right now GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are both running their factories at full capacity utilization while inventory vehicles in stock levels are lower than the same time a year ago Both are good signs that the companies intend to show healthy sales over the coming months That in turn will allow them both to post modest growth in profitability for North America in As I said in the previous automakers article GM and F are both great buys at this point In subsequent articles I also showed why their dividend payout capabilities were based on solid financial strength I reiterate my stand in this piece the market is showing signs of stability interest rates are at attractive levels oil prices arent going to jump higher any time soon and the auto industrys two biggest players are ready to reap the benefits of that in the United States I invite you to follow me for more analyses on the automobile industry and other consumer goods including retail ecommerce and more Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and
