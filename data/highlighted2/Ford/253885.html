Alpha November sales figures for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>show decent numbers and good momentum from pricing Trucks are leading the charge into the holiday Make no mistake about it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is more of a truck company now than they have ever been and the focus on trucks driving the business is at one of the highest levels we have seen since we have been following the business For those who have read us on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>you know that we follow all of the monthly metrics that are available for the company to try and gauge how the business is operating in between standard quarterly reports This includes looking at things like European auto registrations and US auto sales on a monthly basis November sales numbers recently came out showing what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>lacked in volume they made up for in pricing and also showing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sales continue to move in the right direction heading into the holiday Total unit sales missed analyst expectations but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still showed growth especially in trucks They had tough YOY comps as the company stated in its conference call This sales data released on Tuesday of this week looked like this We also went back and listened to the November US sales conference call Here are some of the key statements that stood out at us from this call Taking a look at trucks We sold over FSeries thats a strong number for November At that number FSeries retail sales were up and it was our best November ever for F specifically Those numbers boosted overall FSeries volume to a increase for the month This comes against a backdrop of average transaction pricing that was higher than October so sequentially monthtomonth up and higher than a year ago with overall FSeries transaction pricing totaling for trucks So we remain very pleased with the strength of our FSeries business as we close out this year and head into Our full product range saw great gains in transaction prices in November as well thanks to lower incentives and a really strong mix of higher series vehicles In fact Fiesta Focus Fusion Mustang Escape Edge Explore Expedition and FSeries were all up in transaction pricing It drove our transaction prices up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in November yearoveryear more than any other major automaker by a wide margin We had just really exceptional price performance across our entire lineup Its hard to believe its December were getting to a time of the year where were running out of months and were taking a look at our yeartodate sales and we are very pleased Our performance yeartodate was up versus last year Thats over units with one big month to go Most of that increase is in retail and our retail sales have hit their best year since driven by consumer demand for newest vehicles As you can see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains confident heading into the end of and into Our article yesterday talked about the company opening a new plant in Kentucky to manufacture its F and F models which will now be made out of aluminum just like the F is We made the point yesterday that the timing could not be better for such a move as aluminum pricing remains very low and will continue to help Fords margins This seems to be of more importance now than it has been in years past as trucks are one of the sole drivers behind the company sales growth and as we predicted we think that the chance to employ people in the United States to build these trucks will only help Fords image We ad also concluded in the past that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was making the right move when they decided to introduce a new topoftheline F model in order to take advantage of margin expansion and increased demand Its these types of moves that we are seeing the effects of now as pricing is helping to drive the momentum behind the company heading into the holiday In addition while incentive selling continues to be a moderate catalyst for the company we still believe that the automaker has many levers that they can pull in terms of incentivizing buyers and fueling more sales The November numbers while not a grand slam home run were respectable and showed strength in the right areas Based on the numbers themselves the companys conference call and our expectations for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the New Year we gladly remain bullish on the company heading into We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal
