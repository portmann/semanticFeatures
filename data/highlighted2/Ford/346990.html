getting back right on time Next up we have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>obviously I think at least from our opinion is progressing well through a transition and actually largely through it at this point just finished the ramp up of the F There are still some benefits from commercial fleet this year On the road to launching another incredibly important product in the product portfolio the Super Duty late this year and will have by our estimates a ton of new launches over the next few years which really is key to the story Along with this product success theres been great execution really stellar Its positioned the Company in great way on its balance sheet Its allowing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to not just institute and raise its common dividend but also to put a supplemental dividend in place of a billion this year And I think well probably see more in the coming years Thats by our estimates not necessarily Fords at this point But I think theres some great color were going to get from Bob Shanks today whos the Executive Vice President and CFO He also oversees the global data and analytics team I think which is a very interesting role in addition to the CFO position And he has been at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I think we were just talking years which I believe means that Bob probably started when he was about three years old given how great he looks But we really appreciate Bob you coming today Ill turn it over to you for a couple of opening remarks and then well get into the QA session Okay thanks And thanks for having us at the conference today I thought what Id do is Ill just make a few brief comments about where we see ourselves right now And then what well do is well just leave the balance of the time most of the time for just Qs and As Is that alright Okay So just to put it into context this year were coming off of six years starting in and really kind of started in even as we were coming out of the great recession of really really strong results Weve been doing billion to billion our profit pretax profit at a company level each year weve had very strong cash flow and it kind of was capped last year post the F launch because was quite affected by that really unprecedented launch for us With a record Company profit we had probably the highest level of automotive cash flow that weve ever had but we said since because thats when we started sort of calculating it the way we do now but I think if you go back it had to be the best year of cash flow weve ever had We had our best operating margins since at least the s We saw a big improvement in our risk profile We got all parts of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>other than South America profitable for the first time since I think ish So that was a great accomplishment for us and specifically for the European team because they finally got back to profitability And it was in line with what we had expected when we launched the European transformation plan back in We had targeted for profit and they actually delivered that And I think its kind of interesting about that it was done despite the fact that Russia of course subsequent to when we developed the plan went into a very deep recession driven by commodity cycle and probably sanctions on top of that So we felt very good about that And when we think about where the Company is as we go into this year we expect basically the business to do as well as if not better across almost all parts of the business than we did in So were looking for another strong year so a seventh year of very strong results by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In terms of just a brief comment about the external environment I think we had IHS and part of the Australian Yes Were looking at this year as being a year of relatively moderate growth on a global basis We do think that conditions are supportive of continued growth in global industry volume Its going to be different obviously by region and by market but we still see a little bit of growth We see the US continuing to grow modestly in terms of GDP and we see million to million unit industry We include medium and heavies in that Were seeing very strong growth in Europe in terms of industry probably at the high end if not a bit above the range that weve provided which was about million to million units So thats looking very very healthy China started off very strongly Little hard to tell in the first two months because of the impact of the Chinese New Year but it looks really really good Pricing there is starting to stabilize We still expect it to be negative yearoveryear but certainly were starting to see pricing stabilize if we look at it on a sequential basis which is a good sign I think the big issue that we have and probably everyone has in terms of reasons to South America the recession there probably is going to be even worse than what we had thought I think the GDP the decline in GDP will probably be greater than what we guided to although interestingly we dont see the industry moving in line with that Its still very low but it still seems to be within the range that we had projected So I think everythings shaping up so far still early in the year to be the kind of year that we guided to So we feel pretty good about where we are Always lots of work to do and certainly important to do even better but we feel pretty good about where we are right now Great Ill kick it off with the first question And this is sort of a ubiquitous question that we are all focused on is where do you think we are in the US cycle and how you think Fords positioned not just for the downturn you gave some great metrics yesterday in helping understanding that but maybe as an optimist more importantly if demand runs very high how are you going to keep up with potentially some real significant upside in the cycle from where we are right now Yes We see the US economy as I just mentioned growing at sort of probably the low twos percent maybe Weve got a range of we think were probably at the low end of that range We think the industry is going to be in that range I just mentioned million to million So that seems to be holding up well Pricing is looking good Our pricing is up more than the industry but the industry actually is up in terms of transaction prices although incentives within that are up modestly but pricing still looks to be healthy Its different by segment We see cars as being under pressure and thats more I think driven by the fact that consumers for quite some time have been shifting from cars into utilities trucks holding up pretty well And so I think thats really more of whats happening there Its more of a consumer demand driven dynamic than anything else in terms of cars But the industry still looks quite healthy The leading economic indicators that we look at when we look at quite a number as you might expect us to do all look for the most part to be supportive of that type of outlook Theres nothing that would suggest that were eminently ready to go into a recession here in the US which is what weve been saying for quite a number of months which I think the market is starting to recognize as well So things seem to be getting back on track in terms of even a market perception So I think that everything is being set up of for the type of year that we had thought it would be in terms of the US Ratchet up to and ramp up to I mean how do you response to that how do you think industry response to it because I think its I personally think its a high class problem the industry is going through Yes we do have a high class problem Yes What I think really again it will depend on Technical Difficulty Our production this year probably about of it will be coming from plants that are running on three crews which means that theyre running flat out And we run those types of operations dayin dayout constantly so that we can make sure that we have the appropriate supply of vehicles and the peak selling season so the spring or late summer and end of the year So we dont have a lot of room in those plants Theres about weekends where you can run overtime but thats about it Otherwise you get what you get We do have obviously some open capacity in other parts of our system but they tend to be in the segments that are under pressure which is the cars that I mentioned I think well be very careful in terms of any further capacity actions at least for example in trucks I think where we are is fine Id be concerned about adding more capacity of any substance at this point in time We know that some of our competition theyre also going to be adding capacity I think FCA is planning to shift some its car capacity into truck capacity So I want to be careful in terms of what the overall competitive dynamic is in that space Weve also got the ability with our One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>approach of the business that we also have the ability to bring in vehicles depending upon what the demand is from other parts of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>into North America if that were the case If there was a sustained level of much higher profitability I think yield or volume I think wed have to go back and look at that But I think where we are wed probably just look at pricing opportunities or mixed opportunities both of those And just on mix I mean when we see this phenomenon of cars shifting to crossovers I mean partially it seems like its gas price but partially it seems its quite a structural shift thats going on As you look at your capacity right now is there opportunity to move some this car capacity over to crossovers and do you think will crossovers as everybody is making some of that shift will remain much more profitable in cars And this may sound some of the industrys issues on the car profit side Yes I think we have that opportunity and we probably would do what weve already done on sort of an organic basis We have normal model changes or when we add a vehicle line to the line up and weve talked about adding four SUVs over the next several years to the line up I think well probably make those choices in terms of whats built where on organic basis And I think you probably will see some shifting of capacity from some cars into SUVs to some extent but well do that organically as those changes naturally occur Okay And then the other hot topic that we get and maybe just some thought questions this is on auto credit and how overheated do you believe it is is this stuff that were seeing on the fringes in the subprime market Is it just on the fringes is this something that you think is problematic for the industry And hows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit operating and how do you see the cost of funds for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit has it ratchet it up and are you seeing some pressure in the credit market on a cost basis not necessarily on the crisis basis Yes Let me just talk from Fords perspective and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit not the industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit has been following very consistent underwriting policies for a long long long time We havent really changed So if you look at the portfolio of the business in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit about to is what we call higher risk Thats not necessarily subprime client because we actually have a proprietary way of assessing customer risk So that has been constant at still to What we have seen is a continued shift and this has been something thats been happening for many many years not just recently to longer and longer terms Weve also seen more and more leasing in the industry Were kind of underindexed in both of these instances our portfolio also is getting longer and longer and leasing has been going up but again less than what industry has been But again we do all of that with these very very consistent practices that we follow in terms of who we lend to and how we assess the risk So if you look at the portfolio and the robustness of the portfolio its very very strong What were seeing in the credit markets is that credit is widely available We have seen spreads increase particularly given the overall volatility that we saw early in the years I think theyre coming in a little bit recently And certainly the upgrade that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>got from SP and Moodys has helped already So I dont think we see any constraints in terms of supporting the continued growth of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit that supports the overall growth of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I think everything looks good And when you think about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit its a big player in supporting the business in North America its a smart player in Europe and a smaller payer in China Is there the potential opportunity to globalize <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit And could you just talk about sort of really what the support is in aggregate in the business and how important role it is for the ongoing business and stability of earnings and cash flow going forward Yes Actually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit does support <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>around the world Now we do it in different way that kind of depends upon local conditions and does it make sense or not for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit sales to go in sometimes well do it with joint ventures sometimes well do it with partners but were behind the scenes in terms of supporting that partner who maybe if you will providing the direct support to the network or to customers We follow different models and weve got a specific approach that well take depending upon conditions in each market in terms of what label will go to market in that matter In Europe actually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit does provide a great deal of support both on the wholesale side and on the retail side Its more like North America than any other part of the world In Brazil I think we work in partnership with local banks and in Russia we work with local banks as well And in China we are wholly owned and support of there Although in China itself overall financing is much lower its just a market condition which I think will change over time as consumers become more and more comfortable with taking on financing to purchase vehicles But I think weve got a good position there And the good news I think in China is that the regulators the Peoples Bank of China has been working very aggressively I think to continue to open up the capital markets there make some normal if you will And so were continuing to see more and more opportunities to get local financing for the credit operations which is great Yes Bob Europe has been a really great turnaround Its I guess a third consecutive profitable quarter I know its been hard earned success If you could help explain what some of those milestones were what some of the game plan was that you actually achieved and then give us a feeling of how like sturdy ph that recovery and that business is going forward Yes Maybe a comment about what were seeing so far this year as well If you go back to when we announced the European transformation plan we said it was around three things It was brand working on the brand because we do at least versus some of our European competitors had sort of brand discount in the way that we looked at it So it was working on the brand working on products and working on costs And if you now look at what weve actually accomplish versus where we were in weve largely delivered on what we had expected And in some ways weve done a bit better and Ill explain that So if you look at that weve done very well on volume and mix share is actually flat over that period of time Weve gotten favorable pricing and that is around all the work that the team did on brand and on product If you look at costs I think we actually have done better on costs than what we have expected Weve had a bit of an increase in what we call structural costs which was expected If you look at the contribution cost I think there is sort of variable cost we actually have had a lot of good news And that is through I think teams doing more than we have been expected We also benefited from the commodity cycle turning so we picked up about million from that The thing that weve overcome and our original plan we had actually expected Russia to be a much bigger and positive contributor to the turnaround because of the investments that we were making there our expectations that Russian market probably by about now would be if not the largest in Europe among the largest And of course the commodity cycle turned its for actually gas oil driven economy sanctions on top of that So its in a very deeper session the industry fell sharply and its still at sort of million sort of level So of course we have losses there And so weve been able to accomplish return to profitability despite Russia actually going in the opposite direction And we see actually as you go forward were targeting to return for our operations in Europe including Russia and we do think that eventually the cycle will turn on commodities that will benefit Russia that will be a positive contributor at some point in the future But so far this year were seeing a really good start to the year clear operations in Europe And the team is continuing to focus on even making further improvements to our product line up really focusing on what customers really want and value are walking away from products that we think are no longer relevant If you will in the future in Europe doing a great job on costs pushing even further on cost weve announced the voluntary separation program across Europe that probably will get us about a million ongoing cost save versus what we were last year And so were not letting up at all And the industry as I mentioned looks like its actually going to be a bit of a tailwind this year for us its coming on very very strong other than Russia So its really Russias I think the really good story and will be a highlight for us this year And maybe if we could just quickly before we open for QA talk about South America I mean obviously its a smaller piece of the pie but with a big cost Yes big numbers and profits are small or losses are hopefully getting smaller But the million that you saved last year on cost savings that you showed very specifically yesterday was wildly helped and actually wildly impressive to do in a space of a year How much more of that do you see as an opportunity going forward to cut costs in response to a market that based on IHS and I think lot of our expectations is going to continue to be very very weak And do you get that region back to breakeven in the next two or three years even if were kind of still chugging along with these very levels because youre doing great cost cutting and great product launches I think the team has done a really good job and thats why we wanted to show that particular slide that we did yesterday at the Lets Chat event I think the team has done a really really good job of responding to the crisis that we have in the region It is entirely externally driven its an economic downturn is driven by the commodity cycle but its also overlaid I think by all the political issues that we see in Brazil and read about every day Frankly the turnaround is going to require the cycle to turn And I think resolution to some extent of the political crisis that we see because for Brazil to unleash its potential is really going to require some structural changes to the economy which is going to take government just have the ability and the will to do that So I think its dependent in part on that So I would say the turnaround of our business there is likely in probably a medium term I dont think its going to happen in the next year or two but we do think the commodity cycle is likely to start to turn next year globally And I think that will help but I think the political the political resolution in terms of the fiscal and structural things that have to be done to the economy in Brazils going to be an important factor in terms of how strong that turnaround happens to be So our team is still working on further things that we can do We actually mentioned yesterday that well be taking another shift the third shift off at our big Camacari facility in Northeast Brazil So that obviously is going to help and well continue to work on other things we can Weve actually challenged the team to think about what were going through as we did in North America back in as an opportunity as a crisis what more can we do even beyond the normal cost cutting to restructure the business so that when things externally do start to turn that we can come out of it far stronger than we were when we went into it So thats work ahead of us but I think the team has got the charge to be creative and it will be interesting to see what they come back with We can open it up for questions if weve got any in the audience Ive got a bunch more Yes thank you I just wanted to focus on the comment you made on the call yesterday about the lease returns and the impact to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit from residual pricing Just wondering the comment about the less than million impact is that based on current auction values or are we assuming further declines in auction values for the rest of the year And I guess stepping back how quickly can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit respond by raising lease prices monthly prices to offset the loss of the residual related income So its interesting whats been going on in the auction market and what residuals If you lets just talk about what normally happens Normally this time in Europe you start to see a seasonal increase in auction prices Until very recently we didnt see that They didnt go down but they just didnt go up to the extent that they normally should Actually in the last month or so after I think we ended February we started to see an increase in auction values still not back to the level that you would normally expect to see at this point in time but nonetheless they actually are now increasing in the aggregate its different by segment So one of the things that at least from an internal perspective were looking at versus our plan and what we had expected auction values are a bit of a drag on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit business which is what I talked about yesterday Were working to continue that but it is a bit of a drag on the business versus our expectations for reasons I mentioned When you look at whats happening on a yearoveryear basis on a yearoveryear basis trucks are actually up so auction prices for trucks are up In terms of utilities flat to a bit down and for us thats really driven by the Escape We launched the new Escape or what was in the new Escape in the model We unfortunately had quite a number of recalls on that model if you remember back those days And so were really paying for that now as the vehicles come back into the marketplace So its really a very specific focus issue for us around the Escape Cars is a different issue I think this is more of an industry issue Were seeing the auction value of cars decline and pretty sharply And again I think this is going back to what I said earlier around the whole consumer demand shift from cars into utilities and thats playing out now in the auction price One of the things thats encouraging if we look at our no sale rates and again Im just talking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the no sale rates have been throughout all of this very very normal and in fact recently I think theyve even been strengthening And just looking at last weeks auction values they were up several hundred dollars So I think things appear to be a little healthier than what we thought when we look at January and February But I think if you as I mentioned yesterday if you when you see our results for the first quarter our expectation is that when you look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credits results which I think will be quite good in the aggregate but within that on a yearoveryear basis youll see headwinds from auction values its not been what we had expected and certainly this yearoveryear I mentioned largely around the cars and it will be less than million in terms of that impact Just on that real quick just real quickly When you talk about pricing coming down that means how does that run through the PL for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit that ultimately means that your depreciation expense goes up as the expectations for vehicle prices There is two aspects in fact I think you asked that I maybe didnt completely answer it forgot it So theres two things that are going on First of all youve got vehicles actually coming back and going to auction and so how does that compare versus your expectation right And thats really what I was talking to more so The other thing thats going on is we basically largely use ALG in terms of setting a leasein value expectation for contract that were in the process of concluding And what weve seen is that the phenomenon I just mentioned around cars in particular that those values are lower And so as a result on a go forward basis at least versus our expectations those are less than what we had expected And so thats another phenomenon that youll see in the result as we move forward So that will be ongoing increase in depreciation if these vehicle prices came down in total it wouldnt be a onetime big bang hit I was just going to ask GM made a big purchase of the software company a couple of weeks ago Im just curious how you think about your spending levels organically versus inorganically takes that versus software because that seems to be big price paid for a threeyear old company Obviously theyre buying talent the purchase price maybe for some unique software that doesnt exist internally at GM or very much outside GM Im just curious how you as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>think about that because you guys are investing heavily in your business but obviously over time the more value is accreting to the software side will you be shifting something of your investments more to software as opposed to fixed assets Thats a great question And actually for quite some time now weve been talking about the business in sort of two ways So we talk about the core business which is the business you are very familiar with which is the business is generating all the profitability all the cash for us to invest in going forward However we choose to do that And then what we see is a lot and this is not us I think this is the industry this is also some of the larger nonOEM tech firms they see the same opportunities are coming from the other end of the spectrum around how you take new technology connectivity and think about the vehicle as a new big thing on the Internet of Things how do you take the ability to connect to the customer in the plus hours they spend every year in a vehicle how do you take that all of that together in a way and monetize it and develop a relationship with the consumer as they use that product in their daytoday lives And so what you have is all of us trying to figure this out I dont think anybody has yet because there is still a lot of work in front of us But clearly its going to require a lot more of a software type focus and solution than hardware We do a lot of software today inside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>calibrations and all the electronics that are in the vehicle But I think its true and fair statement that going forward to fully leverage the opportunities that we see and what we call the space the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>smart mobility it will require different solutions different expertise partnerships Well have to make some investments Its just going to be a whole new space that we believe and I think everyone has the same point of view Its just whos going to get there and how are they going to do and whats the combination of places that theyre going to invest in specifically to create new business opportunities new business models in that space to combine with the core business to create in our point of view a bigger and stronger business So I think youve seen GM do that youve seen Toyota do that youre going to see us to do things But what we will want to do as we go forward and were not there yet frankly but we wanted to explain how we see the space where were going to place our bets And as we do make these investments and particularly if theyre material we want to explain why weve done it how does it fit in how does it move us forward if you will in terms of driving and delivering value so that the investors understand the context in which the investment is made And we commit to you that well do that But this is a space thats going to be rapidly evolving and youre going to see it across a number of OEMs And I do think youll see and we know that from at least the rumors around Apple the rumors around Google and so forth youve got these big tech firms who are starting from the software side they have to go the other direction in terms of how they try to leverage and capitalize on this opportunity Were all seeing the same thing were just coming from different directions and working in sort of different ways that will be unique by company to leverage that opportunity Thats a lot of work ahead of us Youve done an excellent job improving the profitability of the business and the return on youre getting capital investment And you have the equity markets are obviously still tough on you and others and there is some voices one particularly a loud voice that speaks about the need to consolidate the industry Do you see opportunities to get step function improvements in capital investments to generate free cash flow either through scale either combining companies or more coordinated development of engine technology and transmissions and all the other things that are very costly to development Yes I dont actually let me come to that from a different direction I do think going forward that we in particular we will look for more opportunities in parts of the business that probably a customer doesnt care much about in terms of whether we did it all of ourselves and did we do it with other people I think that there will be opportunities for us to partner and we are doing that already For example in Europe on diesel engines we partner with PSA on that Here in North America on both speed transmissions automatic transmission and now these new and speed transmissions that will be coming we are developing those jointly with General Motors We then both build on our own because the scale that each of us has is so large it just makes sense to do that So I think youll see more and more efforts underway probably across the industry but including at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to partner and to join with others in various aspects of the business where the customers dont really care And I think that we can probably get better capital utilization by doing that and better scale by doing that I think youll also see I dont think youll see itd be surprise if you saw successful consolidations if you will Because one of the things that weve learnt particularly as weve developed in One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>plan and basically merged ourselves is there is a certain level of benefit that you get at sort of the global level You put all that those units together its largely around engineering frankly And so thats going from platforms down to and were working to get to Youre seeing tremendous opportunities and efficiencies from the engineering side But when you get down to actually then building that vehicle I mean you build it in A plant and A site the score is really at sort of that site level and with the suppliers around you which can be units or or based on whatever is the economic scale of a particular commodity or different part Its not million units its at that level So if you were to take two big enterprises and match them together I think you have to keep that in mind You may over time and itd be a lot of hard work I can tell you from us doing ourselves a lot of hard work to get the scale advances that are available at that global level But the real the paddle meets the road when you get down to that site level And thats just a lot of hard work and leveraging the local supply base and so forth Its not that big massive put it all together level thats just not where it happens I have a quick balance sheet question if its alright We have a lot of fixed income investors see here So the balance sheet has really been extraordinarily strong Yes I saw that You had about one turn of gross leverage which is really great And over time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has in the past talked about increasing their rating as kind of longterm competitive advantage in the cyclical industry Can you just kind of touch on that really quickly Yes I think we are cyclical And weve been through downturns And I think none of us will ever forget what happened in And of course we started a big restructuring in North America before that So we had a number of years that were extremely difficult It was difficult back then to fund <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit for example So we know and we feel viscerally what its like to be in a position where the balance sheet is not strong and what happens when the cycle turns and youre not positioned well particularly having a credit company but not just a credit company So since then we have really work hard to make sure that we got a very very strong balance sheet and we are absolutely committed to keeping a very strong balance sheet Thats also one of the key reasons why over the last six years at least we had a very committed strategy to fully fund and derisk our global funded pension plans because that was one of the bigger issues that we were facing Because you know what happens when interest rates go the wrong direction or asset returns dont work out You could be forced to make capital contributions just at the time when you dont have the capital to do that So were almost there This year were going to invest billion into our global funded plans and once we do that those plans in the aggregate will be fully funded were done And then going forward all we have to worry about are basically the ongoing service costs that should be million million million a year And that really is an important part of shrinking our balance sheet And I think its one of the key elements that influenced the rating agencies in terms of giving us this next move up along with the fact that were starting to see better performance in the operations outside North America So were absolutely committed to keep the balance sheet strong and to make sure that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit itself remains strong because thats a really critical aspect that we see in the support of the automotive business around the world going back to the earlier conversation Just one quick followup when you look at the assets and liabilities in the pension to get into an esoteric discussion on pensions They are largely at this point duration match so interest rate moves will have a relatively similar impact on the liabilities and the assets So once youre fully funded presumably there can always be shocks in assets but that is a fairly locked and loaded at this point And as part of that as we progressively have gotten more funded weve been increasing progressively the percent of the assets that are in fixed income investment But were targeting for the most part We still want to have in sort of equities alternative investments because we still would like to get a little bit of a higher return than what we get on the fixed income side because that will be largely matched And I think you saw that in terms of what happened with the overall funded status of the plan this last year There was a lot of bad news if you will both in terms of asset returns but also the interest rates didnt really move as much as what we had expected and we ended up improving the funded status overall The US actually got worse but it was offset by the funds outside So it all works And its never going to be perfect It will always probably be a little good a little bad but its not just going to be the big risk that it was if you back to and the very unfunded status that we had at the time Great And I think with that we have to wrap up Were out of time We really appreciate you coming Bob Good luck with the rest of the day Thank you Thank you Its great to be here Thank you Copyright
