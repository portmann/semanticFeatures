Fords Strong Guidance And Its Yield <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long F MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Just two days ago I wondered aloud about Fords operating margins in But a very bullish press release last night has alleviated those fears Just a couple of days ago I published a piece on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F that laid out the case that the companys only real headwind heading into was the potential that discounting would crimp margins Fords sales momentum and indeed the entire industry has been very strong in and with valuations at trough levels it looked to me like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was in very good shape heading into this year As it turns out we received a lot of news from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>last night so Ill update my position on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>here in light of new information Margins were my main worry heading into for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>so Ill start there as I think that was the most important piece of the puzzle from last nights announcement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>forecast that s revenue operating margin and operating profits would all be about equal to or higher than s comparable levels excluding special items That is a huge positive for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as the company could have easily blamed any number of macro factors and issued weak guidance but it didnt I saw Fords margin guidance as very bullish indeed and it certainly gives me hope The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sees positive sales momentum continuing along with flat to higher margins removes what I consider to be the biggest overhang in for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and with the removal of uncertainty comes increased willingness among investors to put money to work As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sees a brighter than despite the challenges the industry is facing I have to think investors will be drawn to its times forward multiple In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced not only its normal quarterly dividend but a supplementary dividend of cents payable at the same time Barring any other supplementary dividends or outright raises in the quarterly payout <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares will yield roughly this year a robust yield by any measure This reflects the underlying strength in the business as well as Fords ability to produce cash and liquidity from its operations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has more money than it needs right now and the fact that it is willing to put it to work for shareholders means management is very bullish on Fords future Gone are the days where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hoarded any excess cash for a rainy day and that is bullish long term While I love the new yield it has become clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has no interest in a large scale buyback program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>just put an extra billion dollars to work with a higher dividend and while that is great the company could meaningfully move EPS higher with a buyback of a couple billion dollars easily financed with cash on hand or low cost debt I must admit Im somewhat disappointed that the supplementary dividend wasnt a share buyback but at any rate the extra dividend is still nice I was just hoping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would take the plunge and try to get investors excited about the stock by buying some of it back <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also released some details about its strategic direction in something that investors are certainly keeping a keen eye on in the wake of the successful FSeries launch easily Fords most important model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>said it would introduce another products globally in including the popular FSeries Super Duty and that it would continue to focus on building electricpowered vehicles for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Lincoln lineups Fords long term bull thesis is predicated upon successful model launches and it achieved that in so I have no doubt will be successful as well We wont see the growth numbers achieved simply because the major success of the FSeries launch is being anniversaried so comparisons will be tough But the focus on electric and hybrid vehicles is where the marketplace is going so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is certainly doing the right thing In short the fears I outlined about the potential for margin contraction just two days ago were alleviated last night with Fords very bullish press release Not only is shaping up to be as strong or stronger than but the company is putting excess cash to work in the form of a special dividend In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still has the door open for an outright raise in the quarterly dividend so be on the lookout for that later this year or early next year I was disappointed that a buyback isnt in the cards but a yield for is enough to make anyone happy so overall I couldnt be more thrilled with the direction the company is taking in Fords business remains strong and is apparently getting stronger and a yield like that certainly pays you to be patient Any fears I had a few days ago have evaporated and now Im just excited for Tagged
