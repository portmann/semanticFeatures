record sales figures through and A recent article from Brent Miller highlights some of the ongoing success <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has had readers of the article presented another issue It seems a main concern with the increase in auto sales is the subprime auto loan issue I believe this concern warrants a deeper dive and hopefully we can finally put this issue to rest The subprime home mortgage crisis that led to the recession was a tough lesson to endure for lenders It turns out that giving people money they cant ever pay back is a bad idea The word subprime would forever be etched into the vocabulary of investors Individuals are once again concerned with this idea especially within the autoindustry In the years preceding the recession we saw record home sales driven by subprime mortgages now we have record auto sales and many feel that is due to a rise in subprime auto loans US Existing Home Sales data by YCharts The chart above certainly is scary at first glance words like bubble and correction come to mind when looking at the solid rise in auto sales even as home sales have remained relatively flat The subprime auto loan concerns weigh heavily on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Enter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company and their unique situation During the recession <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>avoided taking the government bailouts and as a result were able to retain <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit their inhouse bank With FMC retained <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is subject to additional scrutiny from investors especially as subprime concerns and peak auto theories rear their ugly heads If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is exposed to these subprime loans through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit and should the economy sink the company would be horribly affected One thing we must keep in mind is that not every <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold is financed through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit For my own knowledge I dove into FMC what I found was interesting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Company is a unique strength for the company In the financial services wing brought in just over billion in pretax profit for the company and is somewhat of a secret weapon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit also forces the company to carry a huge amount of debt on its consolidated balance sheet an issue that Dividend Drive recently covered in a great article I had failed to recognize this myself at my first crack at looking at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>consider this my mea culpa and apology The company carries billion in debt billion of that is a result of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit This good debt will remain good so long as those car loans continue to be paid and that will only be the case if those loans are to lowrisk customers The company goes to great lengths to provide investors with information on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit This graphic below is pulled from their annual report As expected the rise in auto sales has led to a rise in profit from their financial services The two most important metrics for investors here is average FICO and overday delinquencies In the average credit score in the US was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credits average loan placement was US Average Credit Score data by YCharts Any concern over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and subprime customers should be remedied with the above facts With a well above average credit score it is no surprise that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit only saw in delinquencies over days a full improvement over even with more contracts being written Such a small amount of delinquencies and the fact that they are going down YoY even as loans go up should ease investors minds At the Auto Summit Brokers Conference CFO Bob Shanks addressed this issue in even more detail and acknowledged that FMC only has of its portfolio in what it would deem as high risk but not necessarily subprime loans The lowrisk profile of the loans on FMC books cannot be stressed enough There is still additional concern with FMC if auto sales were to slow down this too has been addressed The concern is logical if auto sales slow down wouldnt FMC start to drag the overall company down During the most recent earnings conference call Bob Shanks informed investors that FMC is in fact selffunding and selfliquidating Simply put FMC costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>nothing to operate and should sales slow down then FMC will shrink in kind There will always be the concern that auto sales will slow down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cant do anything about that What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has done is insulate themselves very well from default risk on their auto loans and created a cashpositive financing arm Their conservative management during the rise in auto sales will pay the company dividends even if the industry sees a drop in sales Investors need not worry about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit and subprime auto loans I wrote this article myself
