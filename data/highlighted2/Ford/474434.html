class='textDiv'>Trouble In The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The United States Oil ETF LP NYSEARCAUSO Seeking Alpha Oil prices have fallen lately driven in part by an increase in rig counts which has caused me to make revisions to my expectations for the region this year Based on the data provided it seems as though the amount of production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be materially higher than I thought just a month earlier However when you factor in other revisions made by the EIA in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this increase in the rig count may not mean too much this year Around a month ago I published an article here about the oil production trends of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>one of the seven largest oil and natural gas producing regions covered by the EIA Energy Information Administration in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report Now that fresh data is out on the region however I figured that it would be a wise idea to revisit the picture and see what it should mean for investors in companies like Memorial Production Partners NASDAQ MEMP Approach Resources NASDAQ AREX and Legacy Reserves NASDAQ LGCY as well as for the United States Oil ETF NYSEARCA USO and other oilrelated ETFs Last month I wrote an article on the Permian where I called for a meaningful increase to production compared to my prior forecasts due to some revisions that were needed This month I have the same bad news regarding the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>You see in my prior work on this region I assumed that the rig count would fall by an average of units per month moving forward but after seeing the rig count tick up from to and then to stay flat through much of July at that level I now believe that it would be most appropriate to assume that the count doesnt change from that for the rest of this year unless data changes again In addition to changing the rig count I had to go back and look at the monthtomonth rig productivity improvement rate over time Unlike in the case of the rig count I was able to make a bullish from an oil price standpoint revision here You see while last month I used a monthly rig productivity improvement rate of the graph below which shows updated data provided by the EIA is calling for a rate closer to about Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report The last indicator I had to revisit was the decline rate in the region Last month I looked at three different scenarios a conservative one where the rate would be each month a moderate one where it would be and a liberal one where it would be Now however the EIA has revised those numbers down drastically and as you can see in the graph below they believe the rate is closer to Because of this I have dropped my conservative scenario down to my moderate one down to and my liberal one all the way down to Just as in the case of the rig count change this will have a material and negative impact for longterm oil bulls when it comes to predicting production from the region Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report After incorporating all of my assumptions in last months forecast I was able to generate the table below In it you can see that under the conservative scenario investors should have been expecting oil production to drop from a nowrevised amount of barrels per day in December of last year to barrels per day by the end of this year Under the moderate and most likely scenario production should have dropped to barrels per day while the liberal and least likely scenario called for output to fall to as little as barrels per day Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report The data has changed for the worse Unfortunately after I added the new assumptions made for the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>into my model the picture looks far worse for output for the end of this year In the table below for instance you can see that the conservative scenario is now calling for production to fall to a more modest but still significant drop to barrels per day The moderate scenario should see output fall to about barrels per day while the liberal scenario should see output fall to barrels per day Even the liberal scenario today is calling for materiallyhigher oil production than the conservative scenario called for just a month earlier thanks to both the change in the rig count and the downward revision by the EIA regarding decline rates Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report Putting my old forecasts next to my new ones we can see that the difference is meaningful Under the conservative scenario investors can now expect oil output to be barrels per day higher than I called for a month ago The moderate scenario is calling for production to be a whopping barrels per day higher while the liberal one is calling for production to be higher by about barrels per day All of this looks negative and it sure does warrant some sort of reaction but whats interesting is that if you look at the average production forecasts in todays model compared to last months model the overall impact for the year isnt that large Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report The average change under the conservative scenario thanks to downward production revisions by the EIA for prior months actually means that output this year in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be about barrels per day less than I was forecasting a month ago In the moderate scenario it should be an increase of only barrels per day while the liberal scenarios increase will only be about barrels per day If anything the changes made in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will have little to no impact on the oil market compared to last months numbers for this year but it should have some impact next year in the form of a higher starting base for production compared to what it would have been otherwise Based on the data provided by the EIA it seems pretty clear to me that the revisions made by the EIA combined with my own assumption regarding the change in rig count will have a meaningful impact on my prior forecast for the rest of the months this year Thankfully however due to other revisions provided by the organization the average impact on the crude market shouldnt be that large this year so investors would be wise to not overreact to this otherwise bearish news Disclosure I amwe are long AREX MEMP
