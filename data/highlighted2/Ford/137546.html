Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets ( United States ) With the increase in Eagle <b>Ford</b> and Wolfcamp EURs , is there a reason the 800,000 Boe a day production target by 2018 is unchanged with this improvement and recoveries already considered at the time of acquisition or is this just conservatism around giving multi-year growth target ? David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer We've matched up the growth with the capital spend and the activity level.Again, you've got flexibility here as conditions change and more information available to continue to update that.But what we're doing right now is honoring the activity level and performance that we've input into the model to layout that three-year program along with the capital and cash flow that it provides.So we'll continue to update that as we go.We're just two weeks into this since we've closed, but very excited about what we've got and where we're going.Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Great.And then with minimal capital being allocated to Marcellus in the second half and likely into 2016 and Noble having a deep portfolio of high return opportunities to allocate capital towards, how strategic is this asset to the company?And do we need to consider anything about the JV structure impacting a potential divestiture should you choose that route?David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer I think what we like about the Marcellus, it is still the premier gas play in the U.S. And when you look at the operational performance, it's been outstanding out there, but it's that operational performance across the industry that's contributed to this supply-demand imbalance.I think when you look about at it, though, you love having a high-quality asset that's the premier asset in its mix in the portfolio and the optionality that that gives you for the future with the tremendous amount in running room.The other thing that's I think very nice about our position and same with the JV is the fact that it's all essentially held by production out there.So you have the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and make sure that you're making smart decisions on how you create the most value out of an asset like this.Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Great.Can you update us on your latest thoughts around the DJ Basin midstream MLP?I didn't see a mention in the presentation.Just any color around specific assets, invested capital or EBITDA would help.David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yes.On the DJ midstream, we've worked and we've talked about it over the last couple of calls being in position and having the asset set up so that we've got flexibility on how we monetize and create value and leverage our midstream business up there, if you will.So we've got that in place.I think we still have the flexibility to decide what we want to do with that.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>When you look at that part of the business that we've kind of bracketed, if you will, if I remember right and Ken will straight me up if I misquote this, but I think we've probably spent $500 million to $600 million invested in those assets so far. (Uncertainty) </span>Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.Hello.This will be quick.Question on Cyprus, so a little more color on the timeline.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>From this point on, how many sort of months would we require to kind of get through the necessary steps to probably first production? (Uncertainty) </span>David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Cyprus, it's still ways off in the future, but it's a great opportunity.We got a sizable discovery there.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I think the next steps in Cyprus are establishing a market which we're in discussions with potential customers on, and then establishing someone to invest and put the equity and then laying the pipeline that's probably be required to establish and tie in that market. (Uncertainty) </span>So I think that's the sequence of things, Irene.Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.So it's going to be a subsea pipeline or what are we thinking?David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Definitely, I think what you'd be thinking is a subsea line.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>One of the possibilities is a line from Cyprus that would tie in to Egypt given the needs and the regional demand in that part of the world, but that's why we got to get the customers in place first and also the equity owners in a pipeline. (Uncertainty) </span>I think when you think of things over there, we've got three big projects over there between Tamar expansion, Leviathan and Cyprus that are all pretty interesting in their own rights.Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.So, great.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>We're looking at two to three years possibly. (Uncertainty) </span>David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer I'd say at least that period.I think what we're thinking of on something like that, the end-of-the-decade type of thing.Keith, do you have any additional thoughts on that?J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region Yes.So for first production looking at late 2019, mid-2020 kind of timeframe, I think in terms of sequence forward, really we're progressing the marketing efforts now, as Dave described, in building the project team and progressing toward a project FID that would put us in place for that kind of late a decade (01:06:17) first production.This concludes our question-and-answer session.I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brad Whitmarsh for any closing remarks.Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations Yeah.I want to thank everyone for joining us today.We've run a good bit over our one-hour timeframe.Appreciate everyone's interest in Noble Energy and certainly, we're available on the phone today.Love to continue some conversations with you.Thank you.The conference has now concluded.Thank you for attending today's presentation.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>You may now disconnect.
