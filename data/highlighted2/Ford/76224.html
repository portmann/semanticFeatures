Partners is acquiring an Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>dry gas and NGL midstream system Acquisition is part of a greater trend of EPs disposing of midstream assets I believe that this type of acquisition will continue The acquisition was done at a reasonable price and should be accretive to distributable cash flow The acquisition was small but could be meaningful if Enterprise adds Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>customers to its midstream and downstream business Just a few days ago Enterprise Product Partners NYSE EPD announced that it would acquire EFS midstream an NGL and dry gas gathering system in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In doing so Enterprise joined Kinder Morgan Inc NYSE KMI as a midstream business taking advantage of this price downturn by acquiring highquality midstream assets that would otherwise not be for sale Many EP companies are facing cash flow issues yet do not want to completely sell themselves to the bigger integrated names The shortterm solution seems to be for these EPs to bolster their balance sheets by selling midstream assets Kinder Morgan for example picked up Hiland Partners the private midstream partnership of Bakken explorer Harold Hamm Enterprises acquisition of EFS Midstream was cut from the same mold as the Kinder MorganHiland acquisition The selling entities in this case are Reliance Industries Limited and Pioneer Natural Resources NYSE PXD the latter name is the largest producer in the Permian Basin by horizontal crude oil production Enterprise focuses mostly on midstream NGL activity but has significant natural gas pipeline assets as well EFS Midstream is a good fit into the Enterprise system The acquisition will add miles of gathering pipe ten central gathering plants with gas processing capacity of million cubic feet per day and condensate processing capacity of barrels per day Enterprise is purchasing EFS Midstream for billion While we dont exactly know the valuation of this transaction Enterprise claims the acquisition will be accretive to distributable cash flow Lets do a little deciphering to get a better idea of the dimensions of this transaction EFS Midstream is currently about halfowned by Reliant Industries and about halfowned by Pioneer Resources In its press release Pioneer said it would be giving up million per year in cash flow Assuming the cost in cash flow would be the same for Reliant it is safe to say that Enterprise should gain million in cash flow per year from this transaction Considering a total consideration of billion Enterprise is paying roughly eleven times cash flow for this asset It does get better than just that Because this is a bolton transaction Enterprise may be able to sign on other producers to services provided by these assets These producers could also be brought into Enterprises NGL downstream service thereby achieving even further accretion Pioneer will commit production from its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>acreage for the next twenty years The agreement with Enterprise will be feebased so Pioneer will not pay for the actual handling of production but instead will pay for the capacity in which to do so In return Enterprise promises to spend million over the next ten years on improvements and expansions to the EFS Midstream assets in an effort to support continued development of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale As long as the shalefocused names need to raise cash flow to continue drilling I believe that we will see further acquisitions in this space Midstream assets should continue to be the disposals of choice for shalefocused North American EPs One example of a possible future midstream divestiture is Whiting Petroleum NYSE WLL A few months ago Whiting was rumored to be up for sale entirely However senior investors were very reluctant and did not look forward to being shareholders of one of the big integrated names Yet Whiting could still need to raise cash sometime soon I would not be surprised if Whitings midstream assets were the next ones to go to the midstream MLPs As for the Enterprise transaction relatively speaking this billion acquisition is a small one for the billion Enterprise Product Partners However Enterprise obtained some highquality Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>assets at a good price This deal wont move the needle too much but it should still contribute generously to Enterprises bottom
