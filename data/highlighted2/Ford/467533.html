Fords sales in China have accelerated this year as the company has focused on key growth segments such as SUVs and luxury vehicles to drive growth At the current pace of growth Fords Chinese sales could exceed million units this year thereby topping sales SUV sales in China are expected to triple by while the luxury market is anticipated to grow at a year which is good news for Fords strong lineup <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is on track to benefit from EV growth in China as of its models will be EVs by since it plans to introduce new electric vehicles Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F generates most of its revenue from the US market the ability of the stock to move higher depends on its prospects in other high growth markets like China and India Since I have already covered Fords India prospects in one of my previous articles I will be focusing on China now Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>crossed million units in sales for the first time in China with sales rising over the preceding year This means that China accounted for of Fords overall sales in as the company sold a total of million units Hence it is evident that China is an important market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>especially as auto sales in the country are expected to touch million units by the end of the decade as compared to sales of less than million units last year growing at a CAGR of As such it is important that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to make further inroads into China so that it can capture a growing share of this pie More importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is already making the most of the Chinese opportunity as its sales in the country this year have trended higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and its joint ventures in China saw a jump in sales in the first half of over the same period last year to vehicles Fords June sales were units or higher than June Including the Lincoln brand the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>groups first half sales in China were up to vehicles This clearly means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is well on track to sell more than million vehicles in China this year More specifically Fords sales in China are being driven by its SUVs and luxury cars The combined sales of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>EcoSport Kuga Edge Everest and Explorer along with the Lincoln MKC MKX and Navigator saw a increase over the first half of surpassing vehicles Among the individual achievers were the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Edge and the Explorer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Edge saw sales of more than units during the first half while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Explorer sales increased nearly over last year to This impressive growth in Fords SUV sales in China is not surprising as customers in the country are heavily favouring SUVs In fact by it is estimated that SUV sales in China will triple recording annual growth of a year This is the reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been focusing aggressively on its SUV lineup in the country Even as the pace of growth slows and the market matures customers continue to respond well to our products particularly our worldclass SUV lineup said Dave Schoch Fords group vice president and president of Asia Pacific Additionally customers are also responding well to Lincolns luxury sport utility vehicles In fact Lincoln saw an almost threefold increase in sales compared to the first half of last year and surpassed even its fullyear sales of last year in just the first six months The luxury brand has sold vehicles in China year to date while it had sold just vehicles in all of Again the growth of Fords luxury sales in China is not surprising either as demand for luxury cars in the country is anticipated to increase at the rate of a year until indicating that the growth will be greater than the overall car market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is moving ahead aggressively in the race to win over the Chinese market by modifying its vehicles to meet consumer preferences The company made its intention clear last year by making its billion investment plan for China public All that money is going to fuel research and development in China over the next five years The good part is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been able to impress Chinese customers already by modifying its vehicles to meet consumer preferences and its investment in the country will lead to further growth in the long run More specifically <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been investing in the key growth hotspots of the Chinese market For instance it is directing its resources toward building a range of electric vehicles particularly for China This move on Fords part is not surprising as the Chinese car market has the ability to adapt to newenergy vehicles faster than any other market in the world A recent report from Renew Economy estimated that of cars in China will be electric in up from in Hence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is planning to rapidly to capture this market As a part of its strategy to capture the Chinese EV market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>intends to push up the EV mix in its portfolio to in China by by introducing new models The company will kickoff its new EV models in China by introducing the Mondeo Hybrid later in with the CMax Energi plugin set to arrive early next year Hence it is clear that the major items in Fords pipeline or its strategy are aimed at offering exclusive made for China products In my opinion this is a smart strategy from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as it will allow it to maintain robust growth in the country <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has had a decent first half this year in China Moreover Fords plans for China seem to be on the right track The company is targeting the three key segments over here electric vehicles SUVs and luxury vehicles in order to improve its performance The strategy has worked so far in and as the market continues to grow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could further improve its sales in China in the long run
