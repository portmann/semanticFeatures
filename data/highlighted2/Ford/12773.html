Producers are countering the decline in rig count with a drive for efficiency gains in drilling and completion techniques and an increased focus on their more productive acreage.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>EP Energy is also following the same strategy of focusing on its key assets such as the Eagle <b>Ford</b> and the Wolfcamp in order to optimize production and costs this year , as shown in the chart above . (Ford: Uncertainty) </span>More importantly, the company has also made a smart move by hedging its oil production.In fact, 90% of its production was hedged at the end of the previous quarter.For 2015, EP Energy has hedged 96% of its production at an average price of $91 a barrel.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Investors should also note that 95% of EP's hedged production is through fixed price swaps , which means that EP will enjoy strong and predictable cash flows this year despite the weakness in oil pricing.
