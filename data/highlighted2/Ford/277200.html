a broad market selloff in practically any energy related equity However there is reason for concern due to lower production out of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale Meantime NuStar has been posting very solid quarterly results and nicely covering its distribution which is now an outsized So what is the market telling unitholders Is the distribution safe or does the smart money know something dangerous is lurking on the horizon The NuStar partnership consists of two publicly traded companies The organization is nicely summarized in this graphic taken from a company presentation at a Wells Fargo conference this month available here The general partner GP is NuStar GP Holdings NYSE NSH which holds the obligatory GP interest in NS along with of the LP units The LP has approximately billion in debt and currently has a debt to marketcap ratio of x miles of crude oil refined product pipelines Terminal and storage assets are diversified geographically across the US the Caribbean the UK and Amsterdam The feebased Pipeline Storage segments have contributed of EBITDA yeartodate with the Fuels Marketing segment chipping in only As a result NSs EBITDA is nicely insulated from weak commodity price exposure That said as explained below lower oil prices have led to decreased production from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale and has affected NSs growth trajectory As mentioned earlier NS has about billion in debt From the latest Q available here we can see that there are no nearterm maturities to cause alarm bells to go off However about million of NSs longterm debt matures in and another million will be due in More than half the longterm debt does not come due until or thereafter Roughly of the billion is financed at an average rate of with the remainder borrowed at a variable rate which currently averages a mere Seeking Alpha contributor Arbitrage Trader recently wrote an excellent article on NuStar Logistics subordinated notes NS is the parent guarantor of the notes In addition for NSS interest payments to be deferred NS has to also suspend its dividend As a result Arbitrage Trader did some research into NS and concluded NS has a very solid history of generating positive cash flow per share and is a constant dividend payer In fact this is one of the limited partnerships that is not experiencing a sharp decline in revenue and seems a good enough buy itself based on past performance While top line revenue was down significantly yoy so too were operating costs and expenses both drops due to divestitures and discontinued operations But note the YTD bottom line numbers are solid net income per unit was up EBITDA and DCF from continuing operations is up and respectively As noted in the press release results were goosed by a onetime gain related to the January acquisition of the remaining ownership in the Linden terminal Regardless yoy bottom line results would still have been nicely higher On a segment basis despite falling onshore shale oil production this year NuStars pipelines delivered increased crude and refined product throughput during the quarter and yoy Higher utilization rates in the storage business combined with the increased Linden capacity contributed to a increase in storage lease revenue for the quarter YTD results for both the pipelines and storage segments showed solid growth Due to continued strength in NSs core feebased operations the coverage ratio for Q was x the partnerships th consecutive quarter above x In summary the Q EPS report was solid as they have been throughout As discussed earlier NuStar runs a feebased business with only the small Fuels Marketing segment YTD EBITDA being directly exposed to commodity prices At the end of Q NSs storage terminals were effectively full utilized Pipeline revenue was contracted out on longterm takeorpay contracts with a diverse number of high quality refiners large integrated and national oil companies of tariffs are FERCbased and are adjusted annually for inflation As a result NuStars contracted revenue profile is stable and secure That said in the Q Seeking Alpha transcript President and CEO Brad Barron commented that approximately of our South Texas pipeline throughputs are committed under longterm takeorpay contracts with strong creditworthy customers who are actually shipping well above these minimum thresholds That means of current South Texas revenue could drop without takeorpay relief And roughly of total pipeline revenue are Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>volumes to refiners or to the docks at Corpus Christi Since we know Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production is declining lets take a look at the impact on NuStars potential growth versus earlier expectations As shown on the slide below taken from a Wells Fargo presentation this month and as predicted in my first article on NuStar the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and South Texas pipelines delivered excellent growth through Q of this year when lower commodity prices and lower production began to took a bite out of volumes Through Q volumes were down from their peak While the company expects volumes to grow in over Qs forecasted level Im not so sure If there is no oil price recovery next year a continuation of the trend line could lead to a decline in total volumes to an average of bpd by during Thats an estimated decline from Q and remember thats close to the amount that isnt covered under the current takeorpay contracts The drop is because total Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production has been declining for some time now This indicates that production from new wells being drilled cannot keep pace with declining production from old wells As can be seen from graphics taken from the latest EIA report on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale through November the rig count in the play has collapsed as has legacy oil production from existing wells As a result total oil production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was down bpd monthovermonth to just under million bpd That is a drop of over from the plays peak production The relatively high decline rate of legacy shale wells likely means lower volumes going forward Considering the price of oil dropped further in December odds are good the decline in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production may not only continue but could accelerate As a result I question NuStars guidance on the South Texas pipelines volumes barring a significant increase in the price of a barrel of oil in In the Q release President and CEO Brad Barron said We expect increased throughputs on our refined product pipelines to be largely offset by lower projected Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>crude oil system volumes As a result our pipeline segments EBITDA should be comparable to slightly higher than He also said NS expected the Storage segments EBITDA to decrease to million compared to This was primarily due to lower projected storage throughputs at the North Beach terminal that serves the South Texas Pipeline System So the CEO is guiding to lower volumes on the South Texas Pipeline System I just question the actual expectations versus the graphic above which shows average volumes higher than Q That appears to imply a significant increase in the price of oil during But things are not all bad A recent RBN Energy article Condensate Export Dock Facilities Ready To Roll In Corpus Christi shows NuStar holds the leading position in exports on the docks of Corpus Christi NuStar is able to load Panamex class vessels due to its docks favorable placement near the mouth of the channel NS has the capability to load barrels per hour across its three docks and has the capacity to move bpd In April NuStar loaded a record bpd Now that the US has lifted the crude oil export ban NuStars Corpus Christi terminal is a positive catalyst However it remains to be seen just how big a catalyst it will be in considering production drops across the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In addition NuStar completed construction of an additional barrels of storage at the Corpus Christi Northeast terminal during Q This is a positive catalyst moving forward All in all NuStar appears to be headed for relatively flat EBITDA growth in Based on forecasted capex and the expected budget spending next year is expected to be million lower than the current fiscal year While that is certainly a welcome development it may not be enough to move the needle considering the million of debt maturing in With the looming debt maturation and slowing pipeline volumes on the South Texas pipelines it appears the fall in the units and rise in the yields are due to the dependency of an oil price rebound to ease debt concerns The market apparently does not see a price rebound anytime soon Even though the debt maturations dont hit for two years the partnership needs the increased cash flow the growth projects it financed were supposed to provide To put some numbers to the potential lower volumes from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>risk if the total South Texas pipeline volumes continue to fall to the midrange of my bpd estimated average for bpd that would be a drop of bpd over Q or about of total pipelines volumes as compared to Q Since these volumes would likely not be covered by takeorpay contracts it would lead to an estimated million drop in quarterly revenue and million drop in operating profit With a coverage ratio of only x for Q that change would be enough to threaten a x coverage all else being equal So it will be extremely important for NuStar to add additional refined product pipeline volumes to make up for a drop in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>volumes should the downward trend from that play continue Meantime costs for NSs variable rate debt could increase from their very lowlevels if the Federal Reserve continues raising rates However any increase in interest rate expense is likely to be minimal over the next months NuStar is a wellrun outfit and will likely cover its distribution again next year but it likely will be close if the refined product throughput does not grow as expected That said NuStars growth trajectory has definitely and substantially been altered by falling production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale Volumes from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could drop without takeorpay contractual coverage While the Corpus Christi export terminal and new storage capacity additions are a bright spot managements forward guidance appears to indicate Corpus export growth may take a while to kick in As with so many other energy related equities NuStars future is tied to a price rebound in oil which would lead to increased Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production If the rebound doesnt come management may need to issue more units to raise equity capital Considering the drop in the unit price this year that would be a negative development not to mention dilutive While the current yield may not qualify as the proverbial trap door considering distributions should be covered next year investors should take a pass on NuStar due to the looming debt issue and expected drop in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>related pipeline volumes We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
