style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor released strong Q results on Tuesday Despite excellent results in the US and reaffirmed profit guidance shares are tanking Just when you thought Mr Market is finally treating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F a bit more kindly he falls back into old habits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor released excellent third quarter results on Tuesday just like General Motors NYSE GM did last week but Mr Market would have none of it Fords automotive revenues jumped from billion in the third quarter of last year to billion in the last quarter while the auto makers operating margin improved from to If you thought that wasnt good enough take note of Fords YY increase in automotive pretax earnings They jumped from just million a year ago to billion in the third quarter of a billion YY increase At the end of the day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor said it earned a total of per share in the last quarter which was per share more than what it earned in the third quarter of last year That does not sound too bad does it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors redhot US business drove a increase in YYper share profits In my book thats pretty darn good Once again Fords third quarter results underscored the auto makers dependence on the US market In Q North America was the only geography that was solidly profitable for the company although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was able to squeeze out a million pretax profit in the AsiaPacific region In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors third quarter results were driven entirely by its American operations In terms of revenues operating margins and pretax earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has had great success last quarter which was largely expected Fords management itself could not contain its excitement over the companys success this yearjust read Fords press release The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>team delivered an outstanding quarter with record third quarter profit best quarter ever for North America higher wholesales higher revenue higher market share and improved margin We are delivering a breakthrough year Mark Fields <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>President and CEO <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor did not only release respectable financial results on Tuesday but management also reiterated its earnings guidance for this year encouraged by a more than robust Q which is an expression of confidence in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors present growth trajectory For the fullyear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor reconfirmed its ambition to pull in billion in pretax profits before special items Sounds quite good right Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Investor Presentation Wrong Though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor reported billions in profits record earnings in North America growing sales F production on track and reaffirmed its profit outlook investors would have none of it a theme that has become way too familiar over the last few years No matter how good Fords results are Mr Market always finds a reason to beat down the stock This time Fords adjusted EPS of missed the Street estimate by two pennies due to slightly higher taxes Yawn An investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor more and more appears to be dead money simply because Mr Market doesnt care how good Fords results are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has seen record profits in North America still by far the companys most important geography in terms of sales but the Street just doesnt have much love for the company Frankly I am about to lose my patience here not with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but with Mr Market A YY increase in earnings and sales going through the roof and the stock goes down Come onit
