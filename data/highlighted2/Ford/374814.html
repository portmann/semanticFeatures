About UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay xLeveraged US High Dividend Low Volatility ETN HDLV Includes BDCL CEFL CME DUK DVHL DVYL F HCN HCP HOMX IP MORL PM SO SPLV T USMV VTR VZ WY HDLV performed its quarterly rebalance in January A new allocation to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a surprising but not altogether unwelcome development Dont look now but the ETRACS x US High Dividend Low Volatility ETN NYSEARCA HDLV has been cruising past its competition Over the past year HDLV has returned or when adjusted to x leverage In comparison the SP NYSEARCA SPY has returned only HDLV has also raced ahead of two wellknown lowvolatility ETFs including the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF NYSEARCA USMV this years most popular stock ETF and the PowerShares SP Low Volatility ETF NYSEARCA SPLV which have both returned about in the past year Unfortunately despite its great performance HDLV still doesnt have a significant follower base on Seeking Alpha At the time of writing only people have HDLV in their portfolio compared to for USMV and for SPLV HDLV Total Return Price data by YCharts In terms of the ETRACS x ETN lineup HDLV has also been far and away the best performer with its total return Coming a distant second is the Monthly Pay xLeveraged Dow Jones Select Dividend ETN NYSEARCA DVYL at At the bottom end of this league table are the Monthly Pay xLeveraged ClosedEnd Fund ETN NYSEARCA CEFL the Monthly Pay XLeveraged Mortgage REIT ETN NYSEARCA MORL the X Leveraged Long Wells Fargo Business Development Company ETN NYSEARCA BDCL the xLeveraged Diversified High Income ETN NYSEARCA DVHL and the ETRACS ISE Exclusively Homebuilders ETN NYSEARCA HOMX which have returned between and over this past year As mentioned in my previous articles the topheavy nature of HDLV means that the additions or deletions that take place during quarterly rebalancing can have a big impact on the characteristics of the portfolio The big story for this quarters rebalance was the addition of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F which because of its large market capitalization instantly entered with the largest allowable weighting of tied with Verizon NYSE VZ and ATT NYSE T The Top holdings of HDLV account for of the fund As a companies in the consumer cyclical sector <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not one of the stocks that instantly spring to mind when one thinks of high dividend low volatility stocks However pulling up a oneyear chart of F reveals that its yield spiked to above in January thats not even counting its special dividend of per share as its share price declined Now obviously HDLV being based on a passive index does not make active decisions but one cant help but notice what good timing the fund had in buying into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this quarter Since the rebalancing date on Jan the total return of F has been nearly double that of SPY F Total Return Price data by YCharts The rest of the Top are filled with the usual bluechip cashgenerating dividend machines including the trifecta of healthcare REITs HCN VTR and HCP Pleasingly VTR has reentered the fund after being removed for reasons that I could not ascertain last quarter Two of the previous stocks in the Top PPL and WY have disappeared from this quarters portfolio CME is no longer in the Top but it remains in th place with a weighting A new addition to the Top is International Paper Company at th place with a weighting IP has a very impressive recent dividend record having increased its distribution by at least for the last years though it was forced to cut during the financial crisis It currently yields HDLV has now paid out monthly dividends Its most recent months of dividends summed to which is higher than the comparable period a year ago Note that because HDLV is an ETN it acts as a passthrough type security in that all distributions received by the fund will be passed on to unitholders rather than being accrued in the funds NAV This means that the distributions will be somewhat lumpy from month to month HDLVs trailing month yield is Dividing that number by two gives which may be useful if one wants to compare the yield of HDLV with other unleveraged funds HDLV contains to churn out high levels of monthly cash to its unitholders As a nice bonus the total return of HDLV over the past one year has also been very pleasing bettering both the broad market and other lowvolatility ETFs The highly concentrated nature of HDLVs portfolio is a doubleedged sword With VZ and T both being top weights you instantly have of the portfolio allocated to telecommunications On the other hand one may take comfort in the fact that the fund is overweight in such types of grandma stocks I also like the fact that there are three healthcare REITs in the Top totaling of the funds weight as these should continue to enjoyable favorable demographic headwinds in the years to come The addition of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not something Im so sure that Im pleased with Obviously the recent rebound in Fs shares has been a boon to HDLVs unit price but if the market suddenly anticipates a slowing economy then F will not likely escape unscathed Both bull and bear cases have been recently articulated on Seeking Alpha and it will be interesting to see how long F remains in this highdividend lowvolatility fund I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged ETFs Portfolio Strategy ETF Analysis
