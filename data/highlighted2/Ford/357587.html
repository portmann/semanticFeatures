dominance in the light truck and SUV segment is going to drive robust profit growth above guidance GMs cardominant mix and pressure from Tesla will hurt North American earnings in Q <span

trading down off of disappointing March sales results I use disappointing in the loosest way as unit sales grew versus a Kelley Blue Book and Edmonds expectation of growth Lessthananticipated growth as well as Teslas NASDAQ TSLA blockbuster order book for the Model has created a nearterm buying opportunity as the composition of Fords growth suggests robust profitability Shares of GM NYSE GM are down a similar level even as it experienced a similarly solid mix shift However its total product sellthrough looks worse than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and I think the companys lack of unit growth will weigh on profitability After spending years shifting its capacity to smaller vehicles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generated stellar growth in March and Q from its popular fleet of SUVs and light trucks Key products like the Escape Edge and Explorer drove overall SUV growth of yy in March YTD sales are up a whopping in this segment Similarly truck sales were up yy in March with the recently retooled FSeries notching an impressive sales gain Sales of Fords most profitable truck are up YTD with total truck sales up a robust YTD Lincoln which is a less meaningful part of the business is actually performing fairly well with sales up YTD Unfortunately I do not believe this is the result of a fundamental turnaround but rather simply the function of robust demand for highend SUVs Lincoln car sales were down in March and are down nearly so far this year Car sales havent been great with unit growth of about YTD with monthly unit sales mostly oscillating up or down a few percentage points Luckily for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors its products do not compete much with the Tesla Model The Fusion which has certainly been a star in recent years could face some pressure However I think this vehicle and the majority of Fords lineup is geared towards a lowerend consumer Without question Id like to see cars performing as well as trucks but given the option of growth in one segment or the other Ill take trucks and SUVs every time SUVs carry higher ASPs and stronger profit margins carrying the average <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>transaction price up compared to February With the mix shifting heavily in favor of SUVs and trucks of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>brand sales I think Fords guided operating margin in North America of or higher in will prove conservative The company notched an operating margin of in with a mix tilted more heavily in favor of cars so I think in North American operating margins are achievable If revenue only comes in equal to Fords implied guidance of B and the company achieves a operating margin it will lead to M in EBIT above expectations This could create at least another M in operating cash flow to help funnel back to investors via dividends GM Struggling in the smaller SUV categoryTesla could take share GM which is also highly levered to light truck and SUV demand is actually doing an ok job of keeping pace with the FSeries and larger SUVs but it is struggling mightily in the smaller category Sales of the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra are up about YTD only slightly trailing the growth in the FSeries Sales of the Suburban yy and the Tahoe yy were pretty good the shift to the Edge and the Escape are hurting some of GMs more important models like the Equinox yy and the Traverse yy Overall Chevy sales were up just in March but the SUVcentric GMC grew at a solid clip This is where GMs brand diversity hurts it Buick sales though up YTD due to the Regal and Encore were down yy in March With the mix shifting even more heavily in favor of SUVs and Regal growth slowing I think this segment could be a drag on GM for the rest of Cadillac which is similarly geared towards cars has seen its sales drop YTD with the decline accelerating to in March While I imagine the Escalade could be among GMs most profitable vehichles on a perunit basis it will be difficult for the brand to achieve growth with its cardominant lineup Plus this segment faces more competition from the Tesla Model Lincoln which is a small portion of Fords business The ATS competes directly in the same pricing and demographic as the Model and given the Model s K preorder figure I think this entire segment is under pressure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is performing extremely well in the highly profitable SUV and light truck market CEO Mark Fields provided modest profit expectations for GM in North America that should easily be eclipsed assuming a consistent product mix going forward Shares continue to trade at a low valuation but expect this shareholder friendly management team to award investors with capital returns from robust free cash flow As for GM I do not have a particularly sophisticated view on the longterm value of the companyI certainly have not covered it as closely as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>However I think GM faces stiff completion in light trucks and SUVs a heavy car mix and a key product in the ATS that is under attack from the Tesla Model Id avoid shares ahead of Q earnings I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business
