Mazda Might Impact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GM and FCA Stock General Motors Company NYSEGM Seeking Alpha GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Jeep owned by FCA have posted a few years of solid sales increases almost exclusively as a result of x SUVs x functionality has usually been used to improve offroad capabilities reduce wheelspin and improve grip on snowice Mazda is bringing to market an allwheel drive system that is optimized for funtodrivefast with drifting control especially on icesnow This new system is being delivered in three attractive SUVs from the smallest to one of the larger threerow ones starting this Spring With Mazdas US SUVs sales poised to grow perhaps in its a new risk factor for GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and FCA stocks One of the clearest trends in the automotive world over the last couple of years is that the market has shifted away from twowheel drive sedans to x SUVs I could shower you with overwhelming statistics on this but I dont think its necessary And by the way Im using x interchangeably with AWD allwheel drive as for most people they mean the same thing I know there is a minor religious war perpetually fought between those who feel a need to differentiate between the two terms but for the highlevel discussion it is simply not necessary Furthermore realize that not all SUVs are x and some sedans are x This discussion does not depend on making those distinctions right now The signs that the market has shifted in the direction of x SUVs are not just found in the macro statistics but also in the plants that are being built and reconfigured Here are some examples BMW OTCPKBAMXY built an SUV factory in South Carolina which is now BMWs largest worldwide Jeeps NYSE FCAU demand for SUVs has become so large that it opened new factories in Italy Brazil and China and is now exporting SUVs from Italy to the US Audi OTCPKAUDVF is building its first factory in Mexico where it will make the Q SUV model starting later this year Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY will begin building a new large threerow SUV in the US later this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F announced just last week that it will launch four entirely new SUV models in the next four years responding to booming demand Buicks NYSE GM demand for additional SUV products is so great that its starting to export SUVs from China to the US this Spring Its also relatively well known that the USbased brands have had traditional leadership in x and SUVs Why There are two main reasons The US has traditionally enjoyed lower gasoline prices than most countries favoring heavier vehicles with higher rolling resistance and lower aerodynamic efficiency The US is a fairly rural country with big spaces and big houses including large garages making x and SUVs more feasible and suitable As such it is no surprise that GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Jeep have unusually high exposure to x and SUVs Take Jeep for example global sales up in and up a whopping in the US alone Jeep is of course the flagship brand of FCA US sales of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>SUVs were up in whereas Fords US car sales were down Thats a spread and a huge impact on a company of that size For GM having seen an overall US increase of in SUVs outperformed that average dramatically Heres a partial list As you can see without GMs SUVs and x models its US results would have been a disaster In fact without SUVs and x models its no exaggeration to say that financial performances by GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and FCA the owner of Jeep would be collective disasters and these companies would be shrinking as opposed to growing and with improved profitability This success in SUVs and x however is now starting to attract attention from players other than just Range Rover and new North American SUV factories being built by BMW Mercedes and Audi Case in point Mazda OTCPKMZDAY Mazda you say Thats not a name that comes to mind first if you think of improved competition against GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Jeep and thats the way you should have thought about it until now The company produced vehicles in which puts it in an odd category of its own Mazda is three times larger than smaller manufacturers such as Volvo OTCPKVOLVY and Jaguar Land Rover each reporting approximately half a million sales in However it is a third or less of the size of FCA and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and less than a sixth the size of GM all in terms of units of cars per year in Mazda used to have its cars codeveloped with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for many years as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had a significant ownership interest Current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CEO Mark Fields was CEO of that operation from to for example Fords stake in Mazda substantially went away in and as a result the company has been developing its own cars since then The rationale for fourwheel drive allwheel drive x same thing systems There are a variety of ways by which you can employ x systems to improve a vehicles capabilities At the heart of it there are two purposes Improve the ability to drive offroad Improve the ability to drive faster and safer on regular roads In terms of improving offroad capabilities there are at least two major avenues you can pursue Physical body and related Higher ground clearance shorter overhangs More capable x system including locking center and axle differentials Mazda employs some technologies to make its x system help the driver get through the snow and other tough offroad conditions but overall there are other competitors who also do a good job there enough so that it probably wont be Mazdas most important x selling point Allwheel drive systems for driving fun and drifting Where things get more interesting is in terms of driving dynamics onroad typically on snow or ice Many of the lighter x systems that are meant to penalize the fuel economy the least work along these lines During favorable conditions the front wheels drive the car and the rear wheels basically roll with the flow being disconnected from the power Then when the car senses that the front wheels are starting to slip turning faster than the rear wheels it engages a clutch that transfers typically up to of the power to the rear wheels That way the car regains grip and calms down reducing the propensity to slide on snow and ice for example Its a reactive system However in that kind of system it can take just a little bit of time for the system to engage and it often results in the car understeering This may be a safe approach but it is not particularly fun Its basically like someone slapping you on the fingers from doing something that might be fun but also unsafe What Mazda has done to set itself apart is to engineer a system that allows the driver to aggressively pursue a curve in ice and snow where the system engages so fast that it seems seamless to the driver This system makes it easier for the driver to control the rear of the car drifting sort of like on a rearwheel drive car like Mazdas own MX Miata Its a system that is more predictive than reactive In short it becomes more fun for the skillful driver especially on snow and ice The driver can drive faster but not feel like the tractioncontrol system slaps him on the fingers as if with a ruler Mazda first installed this system in the CX SUV which used to be considered small but is now no longer considered the smallest thanks to many automakers launching even smaller SUVs especially in the last year The Mazda CX competes with cars such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape Chevrolet Equinox and Jeep Cherokee As a result Mazda sold units of the CX in the US alone in up over This has accelerated in December and January with and sales increases As you can see almost of Mazdas entire global output now is in the form of this one model being sold in a single country the US But wait there is more In Mazda started selling an even smaller SUV the CX with the same differentiated x system This allnew mini SUV has become Mazdas fourthbest selling car in the US in a matter of just a handful of the most recent months It competes with cars such as Buick Encore Chevrolet Trax Jeep Renegade and nothing yet from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Its interesting to see Mazda beat its former owner <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to this hot new ultrasmall SUV segment Mazda is set to close the competitive loop with GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Jeep this June quarter with the arrival of its flagship threerow SUV the CX in US dealerships This is the last model to be completely redesigned away from the old <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>legacy The company has targeted US sales of the CX to annualized units at least to start Much of this will come out of GMs Fords and Jeeps lunch box This threerow SUV competes with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Explorer Chevrolet Traverse GMC Acadia Buick Enclave and a future Jeep model yet to be unveiled model year Wagoneer To say that the stock market has treated <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GM and FCAU unkindly over the last months is no overstatement All three companies continue to post improving results with sales records overall but the stocks have gone mostly nowhere and in some cases have gone down a bit One trembles at the thought of what would have happened to GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and FCA shares if the companies had not seen exceptionally strong sales growth in their most profitable segment x SUVs Sales and profitability would have been down Its as if the market has been discounting such scenarios already And now comes Mazda with a trio of x SUVs that promise exceptional styling I mean just look at these cars in combination with a fourwheel drive system set up to optimize for driving fun instead of offroad terrain and simply calming the vehicle down so you dont slip off the icesnow With Mazdas overall US SUV sales up in and as a start to it should do even dramatically better ahead in as it benefits from a full year of sales from the CX and the onset of CX sales in June It would not be a surprise to see Mazdas US SUV sales up over taking market share from GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Jeep Conclusion Watch up GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and FCA GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and FCA are priced for perpetual bear market If their x SUV franchises were left relatively undisturbed continuing to outgrow the market and do so profitably these stocks would probably outperform from here However it now looks like their x SUV franchises will not be left undisturbed While they will be under attack from multiple directions Mazda is at the knee of a hockey stick competitive assault with a unique allwheel drive system applied to three very attractive SUVs going after the meat of the x SUV market At million cars per year produced Mazda has room to grow at the expense of GM <span
