Despite dirt cheap valuations domestic automakers have been poor performers in the market during They are one of few deeply undervalued sectors in what I consider an overbought market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stands out for a growth and value play at cheap valuations The company just delivered standout results The stock is compelling given growth prospects and an over four percent yield Its time to purchase this core value play <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is one of the more unusual names in my income portfolio The shares yield north of four percent at current levels as domestic automakers have continued to underperform the overall market which I consider overbought The stock has done basically nothing for over a year I believe this will start to change in the second half of the year as investors focus less on the challenges in Europe and emerging markets and embrace the results a very strong domestic vehicle market is driving This can be seen in Fords solid quarterly earnings report this morning I think this could be the beginning of the recognition by the market of what a compelling growth value and dividend play this American manufacturing icon is at current levels I expect a strong performance from these shares through yearend and beyond as their value is recognized Revenues for the quarter came in almost billion over expectations at slightly over billion Overall operating margins were up basis points to as the company is making progress to get to operating margins as its most ambitious new model rollout in its history takes hold North America accounted for over of total revenue with billion in sales and billion both figures are all time records AsiaPacific region primarily China saw some billion in quarterly revenues and operating margins move up an impressive basis points to The company continues to post small losses in Europe where a strong dollar and an auto market just bouncing off recessionary lows are headwinds Revenue came in at billion for the quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also continues to lose money in emerging markets in the Middle East and South America which is got just under billion in sales this quarter This is in line with a much faster growing and profitable AsiaPacific region There is a lot to like about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at this point in time despite challenges in Europe and some emerging markets First of all it should see accelerating revenue growth in in the midsingle digits as its benefits from the largest new model rollout in the companys overall year history Earnings are on an impressive ramp up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>posted profits of just a share in FY The range for this years earnings is roughly to a share after todays report it is likely to hit the top end of that range The consensus currently has a share in the black for FY Europe is slowly getting better as auto registrations have drifted up since the European Central Bank initiated its own version of quantitative easing in March In addition the company is benefiting from low gas prices at home The share of overall vehicle sales accounted for a much higher margin trucks and SUVs thats at its highest level since Fords all new and market leading F truck series will continue to benefit by that shift An investor can now pick up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with its yield and likely annual earnings growth over the next couple of years for around times next years likely profits This is approximately half of the overall market multiple with the average stock not possessing Fords likely profit growth over the next few years and not anywhere close to its income yield Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Exceptional Value In An Overbought Market Disclosure I amwe are long F MoreI wrote this article myself and
