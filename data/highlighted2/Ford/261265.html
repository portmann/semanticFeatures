style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gets a multiple much lower than companies like Tesla because its not considered an innovator <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a leg up on GM as it allocates capital toward innovation versus returning it to shareholders The world of automobile manufacturing as an industry is a relatively stable business By that we mean that there are some relatively decent barriers to entry and that the business does not fall into super volatile declines and advances but rather it is a relatively steady industry that ebbs and flows with the economy For that reason alone automakers are not given multiples that are very aggressive As you notice from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F Toyota NYSE TM and General Motors NYSE GM auto company PE ratios are generally between eight and times earnings This is why so many critics of the company Tesla NASDAQ TSLA have issues Tesla is not only trading at an enormous price to earnings ratio but it is trading at an enormous price to anything book earnings sales ratio that has led an unprecedented number of people on the short side of the case that claim that Tesla is overvalued due to the lack of cash that it generates and its poor earnings performance So why has Tesla achieved such a multiple Of course this goes back to the age old public company buzzword of whether or not you have a disruptive technology Tesla is getting its multiple because people choose to believe that the company is singlehandedly revolutionizing the automobile industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors get their multiples because people choose to believe that they will be safe sturdy conservative businesses for years to come This is why Fords latest move in investing billion into electric vehicles by is such a brilliant one we think Here is a news release by the Detroit Free Press that was put out yesterday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced its largest fiveyear investment ever in electrified vehicles with a pledge to spend billion and introduce new models by CEO Mark Fields announced today Fields said of nameplates globally will be electrified by the end of the decade up from now They will be a mix of hybrids plugin hybrids and full batterypowered electric vehicles Its a move driven by customer demand as well as the need to meet fuel efficiency standards Fields said Among the plans is an update to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus electric vehicle coming at the end of for North America and Europe It will have an improved range of miles and can reach of its charge in minutes considered the maximum length of time consumers will easily tolerate The current Focus Electric has a range of miles and can be fully charged in hours with a volt outlet Getting to an charge takes about hours Obviously we think this is an enormous positive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is thinking down the line when electric vehicles will no doubt play a much larger role than they do today Actually <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is doing a great job playing to both crowds A newly innovated pickup truck line running on good old fashioned gasoline for your right wing heading down to the ranch type crowd A new investment in electric vehicles for your left wing green energy crowd and younger generations Now all thats left is to surround and capture those in the middle When we look at the landscape of automobile manufacturers and we try to locate the much longer wavelength in terms of this industrys adoption curve versus other industries we see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors are lagging behind Tesla Tesla has the disadvantage of no conventional auto business and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors have the disadvantage of not being known as innovators in the electric space We think that this investment shows Fords willingness to spend on itself in order to try and benefit over the course of the long term We have time and time again criticized General Motors for their rush to deploy capital back to shareholders We have also time and time again commended <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the cash that it has spent trying to innovate in places like India Asia and now here in the United States If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to eventually want to command a higher multiple it is going to have to show the market that it is a company that is slated for success not just now but in the future Making this type of investment in electric vehicles which no doubt will play a much larger role in our future shows the continued focus on the course of the long term for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Its also a brilliant business strategy in diversification of the companys vehicle portfolio F Dividend Yield TTM data by YCharts We continue to think that the companys valuation at current levels makes it attractive while its dividend yield also adds reason to hold the stock for shareholders We see this investment in the same way we see Fords international investments we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the far more innovative of the two domestic automakers and we believe that while companies like Tesla are valued based purely on innovation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is at an advantage in having innovation but with a solid underlying business to back it up They could be the Tesla of conventional automakers and if the public starts to see them through that lens and they start boosting the bottom line internationally we can expect future multiple expansion We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the
