about Fords profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is sensitive to the macro environment we shouldnt judge it based on recent results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to prove to investors that it can keep what it earned during down years Despite posting record profits the market still isnt giving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F any credit Even though the stock looks incredibly cheap I mentioned several drawbacks such as the rigid cost structure and its sensitivity to macro factors in previous articles read Think Twice About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In other words we cant just take Fords recent success at face value We must take future uncertainty into account As Buffett has said anything times zero is still a zero Of course I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is worth zero Even in an event of a major downturn I believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can withstand the shortterm impact as it did so during the last recession However its worth noting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>never really recovered Over the course of a full cycle even though the trough was a bit extreme the stock ended right back where it started from As weaknesses in the auto sector have begun to surface eg souring loans its understandable that investors are nervous once again However I believe that the management can change this perception if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is truly undervalued Turning the stock around is no longer about posting better results Increasing profitability should be the norm in a typical economic environment every macro sensitive stock will do well when the economy is growing Instead of touting its profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can differentiate itself by showing investors how much it can keep during a downturn As I mentioned earlier Im skeptical about Fords value I fail to see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will fare any better in another downturn given the fact that todays margins and capital structure look quite similar to precrisis figures Click to enlargeIf the financials look the same you cant blame the market for thinking that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will suffer a similar fate once the auto market turns south How can the management give a large boost to the stock There is no need for a massive strategic shift such as their investment in technology I believe that the management can achieve the goal by simply being more transparent By transparent I mean that the management should give contingency guidance concerning an unfavorable outlook What would happen if sales decline by No one can answer that question better than the management and it is a critical piece of information that would allow investors to accurately gauge the cheapness of the stock If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cant preserve value for equity holders in a downturn then it will negate all the progress that it has made thus far Unfortunately Ive yet to come across a management team that likes to talk about what could happen in a bearish scenario even though its an important issue that is on the back of everyones mind Nevertheless I believe that this is one of the few tactics that the management could employ to push the stock to a more fair valuation at no cost at that Posting good results wont be good enough for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>If you cant keep what you earned at the bottom of a business cycle then the stock isnt worth investing in I am bearish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as I see little evidence that would suggest an easier time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>once the auto market starts to flounder Of course the management may see things differently if so I believe that it is crucial that they release this information to investors Simply riding on the up portion of the auto cycle just wont cut it anymore Click the Follow button beside my name on the top of the page to be updated with my latest insights To learn more about the V Portfolio whose goal is to compound capital at over the long
