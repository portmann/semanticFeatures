any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may look like a late entrant in the race to EV dominance but their strategy although risky may put them years ahead of both Tesla and General Motors Their ongoing research and development in new battery cell technology could disrupt the industry in a big way if they manage to get it to market before It looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is positioning itself to command a large segment of the battery industry itself instead of hitting the EV market directly with existing technology In the race to produce affordable EV cars that appeal to the mass market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has fallen way behind its peer company General Motors NYSE GM Notwithstanding the wild card entry of Tesla NASDAQ TSLA into the arena a few years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still has a long way to go before it can hope to achieve any kind of recognition for its EV lineup Fortunately the magic year of EVs is still four years away Fords current electric lineup has just three cars the all electric <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fusion hybrid and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CMax hybrid The Focus Electric being the only pure EV does put <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the running for EV dominance but without any significant advantage In fact its range of miles doesnt take it anywhere near Teslas mile range or even GMs new Chevy Bolts miles Even the recent investment in EV technology is vague at best Not to knock Fords ability to dominate a segment of the car market like theyve done in Europe with their commercial vehicles but Fords just moving too slow in the EV race to make any significant impact over the next few years Unless In a recent SA article their planned investment of billion in EV technology over the next years was already covered What the article did not cover because it was published before GMs announcement of the Chevy Bolts entry into the EV space was that the bar has now been officially set for EV performance in terms of battery range With miles being the new standard for all EVs of the near future where does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stand at this juncture This is what I intend to delve into Its a known fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also uses the same battery supplier for its Focus Electric model that GM has partnered with for the Chevy Bolt So the first question that comes up is this why dont they have their hands yet on a mile battery when theyre both working with the same manufacturer One explanation could be that GMs contract with LG Chem includes an exclusivity clause that precludes the latter from capitalizing on or even disclosing their lowcost highrange battery technology to any other entity for a set period of time Such a contract would make sense considering the shroud of secrecy that preceded the launch of the Chevy Bolt into the EV market The second explanation and one that I think makes much more sense is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking way ahead of GM in terms of battery technology Theyre not after existing technology theyre creating their own technology so they can dominate the space with advanced battery technology a decade or more into the future That would really put GM and even Tesla in a tight infighting position because both essentially are trying to stretch the limits of the existing Lithiumion technology that rules the battery cell world right now Even though Tesla has partnered with Panasonic for their battery packs the tech is essentially very similar to what LG is producing This is how I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>coming into the EV market in a strong way get the forwardlooking technology right and then slowly create the infrastructure of car production that can feed right into that technology when both are mature enough to be release to the market Naturally its hard to find information on such industrydisruptive technology before the company is ready to reveal it The best we can do is compare whats available now with what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may be cooking up in their chemical plants Possibly one of the earliest adopters of Liion technology for automobiles was Nissan which teamed up in with computer giant NEC to create Automotive Energy Supply Corporation AESC The or so Nissan Leafs sold in the past five years all have this technology which has only marginally improved in performance over that time That could be why Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has recently indicated that the new generation Leaf slated for release in or could have a battery from a new manufacturer Any guesses on who that might be LG Chems and Panasonics technologies are both based on the same essential cell chemistry but the latters success with much higher ranges in Teslas Model S are more to do with mechanical elements and packaging than the battery cell technology itself Fords new technology is still under research but the University of Michigan Battery Fabrication and Characterization User Facility is already producing pilot versions of a battery using Fords cell technology Much of the talk about future EV dominance has been assumptions based on the battery technology that is currently available Everyone talks about range performance and cost per kWh but what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is doing now could disrupt the entire industry in a few short years from now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is already promising a higher range of miles for their Focus Electric compared to the current miles for the current model How much of that has come from their new technology is anyones guess at this point As for me I dont think theyd be careless enough to release industrychanging technology before its ready to beat the milelowcostbattery standard by a wide margin The way I see it none of these companies Tesla GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are going to see stock prices increase based on incremental improvements in technology Tesla perhaps will start showing high gains once the Model is more of a concrete reality than the pipe dream that it currently is but GMs stock isnt going to get a big boost from selling Bolts this year or next For sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>isnt going to get much stock price mileage on the mile range of its new Focus Electric However one thing is amply clear whoever is going to change the face of EV for the next few decades has a window of opportunity from now until to stake their claim By then the Gigafactory will be at near full capacity GM will have already taken its battery technology and any upcoming supercharger network plans several levels up and anyone with a lessthanmilerange car selling for anything more than excluding rebates will only be unceremoniously sent packing to the EV graveyard Yes there will still be a market for highend EVs that cost and over and I call this the PLUGXURY segment which I believe will grow in an almost parasitic fashion along with mainstream massmarket EVs But just like the luxury segment for ICE vehicles is an offshoot of the core market the Plugxury segment will continue to thrive because of the basic human need to be better than the rest Considering that these three companies TSLA GM and F are the only ones that have shown any indication of taking the lead over the next four years I would invest in all of them for longterm growth As the EV market inches its way closer to the ICE market year over year the headway that these companies have made in this technology can only help their stock when that finally does happen In GMs and Fords cases it will be complemented by their performance in the ICE segment in which they are already the two dominant players As for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>if their new battery technology is viable and productionready in a few years it will give them a major advantage over every other EV player in the field If however their cell technology cannot deliver to the cost and range demands of the current market by a significant margin they will have to fall back on existing technology and scramble to claim third place in this raceunless someone like Volvo or Nissan is able to beat them to it Tagged Investing Ideas Consumer
