style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>made headlines with a comment concerning a potential share buyback The company has become more profitable and has been able to reduce its debt levels The CFO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Co NYSE F Bob Shanks made some news when he mentioned that the company plans to return more value to shareholders possibly through a share buyback I have read a lot of discussions concerning this issue and there are a lot of different viewpoints that I have seen Reuters reported the CFO said that the company is largely done repairing its balance sheet and can now look at using growing cash reserves to invest in growth or increase shareholder returns He did not offer specific plans but did not rule out a dividend increase or a share buyback Concerning the increase in shareholder returns Shanks is quoted as saying it would either be through an increase in the regular dividend if I thought that was sustainable through a business cycle a supplemental dividend or potential share buybacks This has sparked much discussion and I would like to share a few points of information concerning the potential of a share buyback by the company I have seen many discussions about how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cannot afford to make share repurchases That the company is too heavily laden with debt and it would put the company at financial risk The first point concerning this is that I believe the CFO may understand the financial position of the company he works for so I dont feel that he would make a comment like this one if it were not a possibility We can also look at the most recent financial statement from the company to see what kind of position it is in concerning its debt and cash position Many get confused because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit has high amounts of debt as it is in the business of making loans to customers The company separates its automotive cash and debt from that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit in the financial statements so we can see the debt and cash position without the effect of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit Below is a snapshot from the most recent quarterly report for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>As the CFO stated the company has been able to reduce its debt to levels where it feels it can begin to return capital to shareholders Over the first nine months of this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was able to reduce its automotive debt by billion as it fell from billion to billion This is a large amount of debt that the company was able to pay off in nine months Also noted is that the reduction was offset by the addition of the external debt of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Sollers joint venture as its debt was consolidated So if it were not for this onetime addition of debt from the consolidation then the company would have lowered debt by more than the billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has billion of debt payable in one year this is a large liability in the next year but the company has shown that it is able to pay large amounts of debt It also is expected to be much more profitable over the coming year than it was in the past nine months so I would not expect this to be an issue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The company states in the financial statements the following concerning the automotive debt We continue to work toward achieving our Automotive debt target of about billion by We plan to reduce Automotive debt from current levels by using cash from operations to make scheduled debt repayments That means it must pay down billion over the next years This does not seem too much of stretch for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as it has been able to pay down billion over the last nine months when the company was less profitable than it is expected to be over the next few years Its position also grew by million over the nine months this is while paying down billion in debt As noted in the financial statement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had billion in cash available in the automotive division Taking away the debt from the cash there is billion left in net cash an increase of billion over the past months Taking these facts into consideration I believe this is why the CFO made the comments that he did <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is well on track to reach the debt level that it has as a goal and has been able to increase its cash available while doing so It is also showing continued growth in revenue and earnings which will strengthen the financial position of the company even more I would say that the possibility of a share buyback is logical and could be carried out by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I wanted to discuss a share repurchase program a little I have seen many comments concerning share repurchases and some of them seem to me to be misleading Lots of comments state that repurchasing shares is just financial manipulation and doesnt provide benefit to the company and its growth The first thing I want to mention was that as an investor you purchase a share of stock You own that share of stock You are willing to pay a price for that share according to the earnings that are attached to it times a multiple this multiple has many other factors that weigh into it such as growth industry etc If a company has earnings of and it has two shareholders then each share in essence has attached to it If we have the same scenario only now there are shareholders instead of two there is in essence attached to each share As an investor the share that has attached to it is much more valuable than the share that only has and you as a logical investor would be willing to pay much more for it So when a company chooses to repurchase shares it is directly making the shares you own more valuable With fewer shares claiming the earnings of the company your share now has more earnings attached to it It is not just financial manipulation but it does directly increase the value of your share Now it is true that the share repurchase does not boost the profitability of the company and its operations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not going to sell more cars because it issued a share repurchase program However it does boost the profitability of the share that you own That is the question that you need to ask as investor What is the value of a share After all that is what you are buying When a company issues a share repurchase program it is taking cash away that it could have used to invest back into the business It is just a matter of how much the company can get in return if it invests back into the business and how much cash it has available If it has plenty of cash to continue to fund the growing business there is no point in just funneling money into itself if it is not getting a good return on that invested capital Different companies have different policies and different growth rates If a company is growing its business by a large percentage year over year and has lots of room to keep growing then I as an investor would want it to continue to use its cash to grow its business not pay a dividend or repurchase shares This is why it is common for example to see young companies not pay a dividend or repurchase shares as they are continually using that capital to grow the business operations Companies that are more established and have slower growth are more likely to pay a dividend and return profits to investors There is also an example like Apple OTCAPPL where despite the fact that the company has continued to grow at a fast rate it has enough excess cash that it continues to pay a dividend and repurchase shares Apple could choose not to pay a dividend and not repurchase shares and instead use the cash to invest in the growth of the business but the company already has sufficient cash to fund its continued growth and rather than throwing the extra cash at projects that will not give a high return it returns the cash to shareholders through a dividend or a repurchase When we look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we see the same thing The company could continue to spend all of its extra cash on upgrades to plants RD on new features for cars etc but is that going to provide the best return for the shareholder That is the question a company has to ask and figure out What is the best use of the capital that it has and what will provide the best return to shareholders A share repurchase program and a dividend are doing the same thing Both are ways for the business to take capital and return it to shareholders The dividend as well as the share repurchase program take capital out of the business that it could have used to invest in the growth of the companys operations and give it back to shareholders So if you dislike the idea of a share repurchase program you might equally dislike the idea of a dividend There are of course distinct advantages that both a dividend and a share repurchase program have and depending on the stock and its valuation one might be a much better option than the other but they are in essence performing the same function just in a different way So when I read a comment that says a company should increase its dividend but that a share repurchase program is just financial manipulation and a waste of capital I tend to disregard that comment If you think repurchasing shares is a waste of capital then more likely than not you should agree that paying the dividend is a waste of capital as well Analysis of a Share Repurchase Program I have run an analysis to see the effect a buyback would have on the dividend payout <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would make each year The company has a strong dividend and it has shown a commitment to growing that dividend I would expect it to continue to grow that dividend over the coming years I have estimated the growth that I expect to see in the dividend over the coming years While this is not a comprehensive analysis on the dividend and its growth I do think it is a reasonable estimation The purpose of the analysis is more to show that the buyback can affect the company directly in a financial way Also noted in the chart below is the dividend yield going forward based on the stock price today As the dividend continues to grow the dividend payout will continue to grow as well This creates a larger liability for the company year over year If the company repurchases shares then it does not have to pay a dividend on those shares This lowers the amount that it pays out each quarter for its dividend We can look at an easy comparison between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and its biggest competitor General Motors NYSE GM As you can be seen GM pays a dividend that is more than twice the amount <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pays Yet the amount that it pays out each year is actually less than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pays out due to the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has so many more shares outstanding Of course the amount of shares outstanding also affects the stock price and the yield on the dividend but the point to be made is that with the large amount of shares outstanding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>must pay a large amount each year on its dividend Moving on the company would spend more on the buyback than it would save on the lower dividend payment at the time of making the buyback It would have to have a dividend that is higher than its stock price for it to be otherwise If you look at it over a longer time window the purchase of shares has a financial benefit for the company The fact of the matter is that when the company repurchases shares it returns value to the investor by making each share have more earnings attached to it as I previously discussed but it will also reduce the total share count and in so doing will lower the amount the company pays on its dividend I have run an analysis to show how the buyback can have this direct financial effect on the company I ran the analysis as if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>issued a repurchase program of billion that it would execute over years To simplify the calculations I assumed that it spread the repurchase evenly over the quarters of the two years While I know that this is not the likely scenario I dont think there is any better way to try and make an estimation of when the company would make the purchases and to what amounts Also the overall impact of when it makes the purchase would not make a significant difference in the evaluation in the long run The earlier the company made the purchases the more it would save as it would have a lower share count to pay a dividend on for the following quarters Also one last assumption I took the billion and divided it by the current share price to get the number of shares that the company would purchase Once again it is not likely the company will purchase the shares over the two years at the current price as the price will fluctuate during that period I thought that to try and estimate what I think the stock price will be over the next quarters and take that into account for the analysis would not make it any more accurate per se While I personally expect the share price to increase over the next year someone else might argue that the price will go down My estimation of the share price over the coming quarters would add complexity and probably not much more accuracy Having stated that the main reason of the analysis is to show that a buyback does have an influence on the payout that a company will make Over the long run if the company was to purchase its stock consistently it would save a lot of money in the amount that it pays each quarter in the form of a dividend It is especially true for a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that has such a large share count outstanding and also has shown a strong growing dividend So by issuing a repurchase program of billion and multiplying the amount of shares repurchased over the two years by the dividend for the corresponding year we can see the amount that the company would save each year due to the repurchase of shares The total amount saved over years would be just over billion While this analysis does have some assumptions involved that can be disputed the effect of the share buyback can still be seen If this were extended over say or years then you could easily see that the company would save more from the lower share count and dividend payment compared to the amount spent on the buyback I thought this was a perspective that not many consider when viewing a share repurchase program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been able to grow its revenues and income over the past year It has also been able to grow its cash available The CFO made some comments concerning the different potential uses of that cash While no specifics were given he mentioned a share buyback I have read many discussions concerning the company and a share buyback Upon further review of the company it appears to me that a buyback is a possibility A share buyback is also not just financial manipulation but actually makes the share you own more valuable Another effect of the share buyback is that it equates to a lower share count which saves money on its dividend payout in future quarters As an investor in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I find it promising that the
