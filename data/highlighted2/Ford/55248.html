energy prices even though its production increased at a terrific pace Carrizo however looks wellpositioned to combat the oil price drop as it has hedged over of its oil production with floors and ceilings An increase in demand and a falling rig count in the US will support the recent recovery in oil prices enabling Carrizo to improve its performance going forward Carrizo enjoys strong economies of production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>so it will continue drilling in this play going forward to take advantage of better pricing Carrizo Oil Gas NASDAQ CRZO has performed exceedingly well in the current oil environment gaining around on the stock market so far this year But Carrizos firstquarter results released on May were below expectations Still it is highlylikely that the company will be able to sustain its momentum going forward due to smart operational moves and an improving oil environment Carrizo reported a massive increase in production in the first quarter of particularly from its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>assets In fact its oil production rose to Bblsd while its total production including gas and natural gas liquids increased over the first quarter of The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>play alone delivered approximately Bblsd for the quarter However weak oil and natural gas prices created a huge impact on its financial performance Carrizo witnessed a massive drop in its earnings for the first quarter of driven by a sharp decline in revenue It reported revenue of million a drop of from the prioryear period Also its earnings came in at per share significantly lower than per share in the yearago quarter Nevertheless Carrizo outpaced consensus estimates on the bottom line Wall Street was estimating earnings of per share but due to its key assets in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>play where the company can extract more oil at lower prices it was able to beat expectations Had the oil and gas price environment been strong Carrizo would have reported strong numbers Sadly oil prices have dropped steeply in the past year and this weighed on Carrizos performance However Carrizo has prepared itself for such volatility by hedging its production which is why it expects to realize approximately to of the NYMEX price for its oil revenue apart from to for its gas and NGL revenue in the ongoing quarter In fact Carrizo has hedged more than of its total production for the balance of the year This consists of barrels a day with floors and ceilings For as well Carrizo has hedged barrels of oil per day so far with a ceiling and a floor As such the company has made a smart move by hedging a substantial amount of its production as this will help it mitigate the weakness in oil and gas pricing to a certain extent In fact as a result of its recent crude oil hedge transactions Carrizo has been able to lock an extra cash flow of million for the remaining quarters of along with another million for next year Thus the company has a goodlooking hedge book that will allow it to cushion further falls in energy prices Now it is wellknown that the oil market is oversupplied and this has kept crude oil prices under pressure But the good thing is that demand is returning to the market while a drop in rig count is leading to supply cuts For instance the US rig count dropped for the first time in weeks recently As reported by MarketWatch The US Energy Information Administration on Wednesday said crudeoil supplies fell million barrels for the week ended May That was the first decline since the week ended Jan even though oilrig counts have been falling since December based on data from Baker Hughes At last count as of May the number of active US oil rigs stood at Concurrently demand is also rising This is indicated in the following graphic which indicates that the International Energy Agency expects oil demand to increase at a faster pace of million barrels per day this year Now a decrease in supply and an improvement in demand will support the recent surge in oil prices and this is good news for Carrizo As a result the company is improving its production in more profitable areas such as the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>where of its wells can deliver returns even at a low crude oil price of per barrel Now the current WTI price is a shade under a barrel which means that a majority of Carrizos production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is currently profitable Currently Carrizos Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>portfolio has about gross or net wells along with three drilling rigs that are running a frac crew round the clock Carrizo recently drilled about gross or net operating wells and completed gross or net wells during the first quarter due to the economical production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Looking ahead the company is on the verge of completing gross or net operating wells in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale These wells are expected to come online in the current quarter and will add more than barrels of oil production per day which will help Carrizo strengthen its margins Carrizos recent results might have been weak but the company could improve going forward due to its smart hedging economical Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production and the oil recovery Thus investors should look beyond Carrizos recent results and instead focus on its longterm prospects that are still intact as its bottom line is expected to increase at a CAGR of for the next five years Source Carrizo Oil Gas Holds Promise Despite Weak Q Results Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
