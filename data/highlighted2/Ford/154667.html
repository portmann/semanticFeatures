There Anything To Be Read Into Fords Decision To Dump Fidelity Contrafund From Its k Fidelity Contrafund Fund No Load MUTFFCNTX Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced last week that its dropping Fidelity Contrafund from its k plan lineup Fidelity Contrafund has about B in total assets M of that comes from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>retirement plan While Fidelity Contrafund is going the Fidelity Growth Company fund is staying as a plan option Contrafunds track record under manager Will Danoff coupled with its low expenses and risk make it a curious choice to be dropped from a retirement plan Its not often that the relatively mundane topic of k investment options makes it into the news but we had one of those instances last week when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F announced that it was dumping the ultrapopular Fidelity Contrafund MUTF FCNTX from its k lineup Given the funds popularity and performance it seems to be a bit of a curious move When it comes down to swapping out investment choices in a retirement plan its usually due to one of three reasons below average performance above average cost or management changes But looking at Contrafund none of those factors seems to be a reason Will Danoff has been managing the fund for the past years as well as a handful of other smaller Fidelity funds during parts of that time frame but Contrafund is clearly the big dog and his performance record over the course of the last two and a half decades has been nothing short of stellar Contrafund is currently beating the SP during the past year year year year and year time frames in addition to doubling the indexs performance year to date Seems like the type of performance and track record youd want available in a retirement plan From a cost standpoint the current expense ratio doesnt appear to be a big issue either The funds current net expense ratio of compares favorably to other funds in its category and in fact has been dropping annually over the last several years Looking at risk levels the funds beta is currently less than indicating below average risk and according to Morningstars own risk rating categorizes the funds risk is either below average or low depending on the time frame considered It just doesnt seem that there are any glaring red flags with this fund Mainstay Capital which administers the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>k program states on its website that it simply is removing one of the funds from the plan without naming which one specifically although it does link to an article explaining that Contrafund is the one being axed For its part <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has said simply that it makes changes from time to time While Contrafund is going its counterpart the Fidelity Growth Company MUTF FGCKX fund is staying although to be fair its performance is similarly strong like Contrafund Contrafund is a B behemoth so the estimated M outflow the fund will experience thanks to Fords withdrawal shouldnt affect management of the fund in any type of meaningful way Its a bit odd to think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would drop a fund as popular and well performing as Contrafund but thats whats happening Perhaps the powers that be at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>feel that Contrafund and Growth Company have overlapping management styles and objectives and are eliminating one as a cost savings measure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has announced that Contrafund wont be replaced In that case Contrafunds dismissal makes some sense With other Fidelity funds remaining one would have to assume there isnt any type of relationship issue between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Fidelity My conclusion is that there isnt really anything to read into this decision Although this plan change happens to feature one of the biggest and bestknown names in the mutual fund world it appears that more than likely this is simply just part of the normal course of business for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Disclosure I amwe are long F MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
