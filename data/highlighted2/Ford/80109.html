Weirdness Of A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor released robust sales data for the Chinese market on Friday Yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock retreated sharply and again slipped below Positive news flow doesnt seem to help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock Wow Something is definitely not right here It is not only since yesterday that I think that Mr Market is completely off when it comes to valuing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F but though I have seen a couple of ups and downs in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock price sometimes even I am left in awe when I look at how weirdly the stock reacts to good news <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has not been a great performer to say the least The stock is down over the last year and yeartodate Thats annoying when you are a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor shareholder or like in my case a stock and optionholder More important it is frustrating to see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock languishes despite a fairly good news flow Consider Fords release of US sales figures for the month of May at the beginning of June <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>beat the consensus estimate by a wide margin yet the stock failed to react positively to the sales announcement Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor reported robust vehicle sales growth in China at the end of last week and what did the stock do Yeah you guessed it it went down again SHANGHAI China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>China sold vehicles in May a fourpercent increase compared to in May From January to May <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold vehicles in China up one percent from during the same period last year Fords passenger car joint venture Changan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automobile sold vehicles in May an increase of three percent from in May Yeartodate sales for CAF reached vehicles up one percent from during the same period last year Despite a softer commercial vehicle segment Jiangling Motors Corporation JMC which sells the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Transit commercial van sold vehicles in May up seven percent from in May Yeartodate sales reached vehicles up four percent from during the same period last year Wrong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock retreated on Friday in a lackluster trading session that saw the Dow Jones fall and the SP slip Downward pressure on the stock market indices came from good jobs data that reignited the rate debate once again Good employment numbers raise the odds of the Fed increasing interest rates sooner than expected which is something that should have happened years ago but rate fears continue to scare investors every single time the topic crops up Selloffs related to good employment data make probably the least amount of sense Rate hikes will surely come and thats a positive for stocks The reason is that positive interest rate growth underscores the fact that the economy is strong enough to grow on its own and without the artificial life support it still gets from the Fed In any case the selloff in Fords stock on Friday and the current trading weakness arent justified at all The unfortunate truth is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is simply not an investors favorite right now despite good news as opposed to General Motors NYSE GM for instance which made a strong case for itself by announcing a major capital return initiative in March For the time being shareholders of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor need to play the patience game and hang on Weak fundamentals are NOT the cause of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors slumping share price The auto maker is not a preferred investment right now which is kind of odd since the company pumps out and sells a good amount of vehicles around the world and is valued very lowly In the stock market companies rotate in and out of favor and investors simply prefer General Motors over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor right now As far as I am concerned I am holding on to my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock and my options and I will sit out the current trading weakness A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investment still offers a very wide margin of safety and at x forward earnings investors are clearly not running the risk of overpaying Any retreat in Fords share price is actually a good opportunity to take advantage of a rising dividend yield Buy Source The Weirdness Of A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Investment Disclosure The author is long F MoreThe
