stock has been acting like the global economy is in turmoil But so far sales data out of Europe and China are yet to confirm the price drop is warranted International growth is extremely important to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F at this stage in the game We wrote an article earlier this week talking about why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>might be a name worth looking at during this economic downturn Today we are going to reiterate that view and base it on continued outperformance in Europe The worries over the last few months have been that China is slowing down and that vehicle sales in China would follow Contradicting this were the statements of numerous CEOs who do business in China including Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX Howard Schultz who commented during his last earnings call that he thinks the Chinese middle class remain strong despite the stock market Remember the stock market isnt always the economy and the economy isnt always the stock market Based on that we made the case that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at its insanely low multiples as a result of the broader US selloff should be considered if you are looking to buy and hold the company for a longterm investment and reinvest your dividends This is been the investment approach we have advocated for over the last year and it will continue to be the investment approach that we advocate for as we move forward Fords last quarter and full year for were both very impressive As we have argued all year things worked out for the company because international sales perched themselves on top of a strong domestic backbone and segments outside of the United States began to show a profit Over the course of the last year we had been following sales data from China as well as European auto registration data to try and make sure that we were not seeing any monthtomonth aberrations in the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is doing business This morning it was announced that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to show momentum in Europe with SUVs and pickups continuing to lead the charge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>of Europe reports sales rose to units in January SUV sales were strong during the month led by the Kuga EcoSport and Edge models The automaker expects to grow SUV sales by on the continent in Fords market share in Europe improved bps to Things have gotten very hairy over the last couple of weeks Everybody seems to be on edge and with markets continuing to be volatile overseas US equities continue to be negatively affected US automakers have gotten his especially hard As volatility rises investors look for new potential risks in all US equities For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and for the rest of the United States auto industry that potential negative comes in the form of subprime auto risk There have been an extraordinary amount of articles published over the last month talking about the bubble that we are seeing in the auto market as a result of automakers allowing lower creditworthy individuals to finance vehicles The headlines have been everywhere Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors have said on conference calls that they are using incentivized selling and subprime risk in limited quantities to continue to keep sales perky When that point gets to bubble status and then when bubble status turns to burst status we do not know We do know that the average age of the vehicle on the road continues to grow and that the data even though it is on a trailing basis continues to look promising for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>We are going to continue and watch these monthly metrics to look for warning signs but as for now things look OK in the shortterm and we are even more confident in the long term Investing today will yield you over which you can then invest back into the company making a further fall in the stock price simply just a buying opportunity if you have a long term outlook on the company like we do If you are still worried about the subprime auto risk you can put on a pair trade by going long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and by shorting Credit Acceptance Corp NASDAQ CACC an idea that has been tossed around on social media over the last few days CACC is a company that provides automobile dealers financing programs and related products and services that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers It advances money to dealers in exchange for the right to service the underlying consumer loans and buys the consumer loans from the dealers and keeps various amounts collected from the consumers In other words CACC backs all of the auto finance indsutrys loans and would make for a great hedge to short if you are a nervous investor regarding the subprime lending happening in the auto sector To conclude what we do have is fresh new European data that shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to move in the right direction in arguably its most important market overseas This in conjunction with the domestic performance of the company over the last few months continues to allow us to reiterate our long term multiyear bull case on owning the company at these ridiculously cheap multiples Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in F over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
