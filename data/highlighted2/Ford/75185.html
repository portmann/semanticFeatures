was liquids Even more important than the impressive liquids split were comments Cabot Oil Gas Chairman President and CEO Dan Dinges made in the Q EPS report with respect to productivity improvements in the play Referring to six wells located on EF acreage COG acquired in Dinges said These six wells in addition to four wells we placed on production during the fourth quarter have outperformed the previous operators cumulative oil production at and days by over percent on average highlighting the valueenhancing proposition of these bolton acquisitions In fact during the Q conference call Dinges said that with these improvements in operating efficiency see graphic above and well performance combined with a reduction in service cost COG has eclipsed the same return threshold at a price of bbl that it had achieved one year earlier with oil at bbl In other words that is a near per barrel improvement in overall return in just one year That is phenomenal During Q Cabot drilled wells in the
