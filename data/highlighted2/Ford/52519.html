Securities Inc Brian A Singer Goldman Sachs Co Hiram Monroe Helm Barrow Hanley Mewhinney Strauss LLC Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc Welcome to the Marathon Oil Corporation Q Earnings Conference Call My name is Vivian and Ill be your operator for todays call At this time all participants are in a listenonly mode Later we will conduct a questionandanswer session Please note that this conference is being recorded Christopher C Phillips DirectorInvestor Relations Good morning and welcome to Marathon Oil Corporations First Quarter Earnings Call Im Chris Phillips Director of Investor Relations Also on the call this morning are Lee Tillman CEO and President JR Sult Executive Vice President and CFO Mitch Little Vice President International and Offshore Exploration and Production Operations Lance Robertson Vice President North America Production Operations and Zach Dailey Director of Investor Relations As has become our custom we released prepared remarks last night in conjunction with the earnings release You can find those remarks and the associated slides at marathonoilcom As a reminder todays call is being recorded and our comments and answers to questions will contain forwardlooking information subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements Ill refer you back to the aforementioned slides where you can find our full Safe Harbor statement With that I will turn the call over to Lee Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Thanks Chris and glad to have you back on the call Let me add my good morning to everyone Id like to open with just a few comments regarding the elements of our business that we control costs efficiencies and execution and discuss how our actions will enhance returns and have us wellpositioned for the current environment as well as when commodity prices show a sustained improvement Rigorous cost control across all areas of our business is at the forefront of what we do each and every day and the first quarter was no exception We reduced our North America EP production costs per oil equivalent barrel to down from fourth quarter and below the yearago quarter Operating cost reduction is hard work and our teams have taken on that challenge There is no one magic bullet but rather theres a diverse range of drivers within these savings A few examples include more coordinated deployment of contract labor focus on compressor utilization aggregating water production into gathering systems and optimizing our chemical programs These types of savings are durable in nature and resilient to the commodity cycle In parallel we continue to work with our vendor base and supplychain experts to take full advantage of our scale to drive commercial savings On the service cost side we increased our yeartodate captured US unconventional DC service costs by an additional million bringing that total to million That represents a reduction from our revised activity levels and we fully expect to secure more savings as the year progressesAnd finally on GA we have taken the necessary steps to scale our organizational capacity to match our activity level And our first quarter workforce reductions are expected to generate annualized net savings of approximately million During the first quarter we have also made significant progress enhancing our returns through efficiency gains Our highspecification rigs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are a prime example and delivered pacesetter spudtoTD results of under seven days drilling feet per day significantly above the quarterly average of about feet per day In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>our EUR uplift was for condensate wells and for highGOR oil wells relative to fall of last year while completed well costs have fallen about Finally we are reallocating more than million of capital to the Oklahoma Resource Basin to further advance our understanding of the resource potential which already stands at over one billion oil equivalent barrels on a P basis We are complementing our tworig operated program with incremental highvalue nonoperated activity which is a very efficient way to maximize the benefits of our capital dollars From an execution standpoint our teams had a great first quarter We grew production from our three US resource plays over the prior quarter and yearoveryear Our total EP net production excluding Libya also posted strong results growing and respectively All this was accomplished within our planned first quarter capital budget We recorded average operational availability for companyoperated assets during the first quarter our most economic barrels Yesterday we announced a further optimization of our capital investment and exploration budget to billion This reduction is driven by a relentless focus on capital discipline and maintaining financial flexibility in this period of ongoing price uncertainty Were adjusting activity levels to manage cash flows while still delivering on our strategic objectives and our three US resource plays and with no change to full year EP production guidance In addition we are continuing our commitment to ongoing portfolio management regardless of commodity cycle and are targeting noncore asset sales to generate at least million in proceeds Portfolio management is simply part of what we do as an independent EP company At quarter end cash and cash equivalents were approximately billion which combined with our revolving credit facility resulted in a total liquidity of billion And in May we amended the revolving credit facility to increase the available capacity from billion to billion and extended the maturity date to Our capital program was always designed to be frontend loaded and the first quarter of has been a quarter of transition We are efficiently ramping down to lower activity levels in our US resource plays and will achieve our target of rigs by the end of second quarter Our current plan is to hold that activity level relatively flat for the remainder of the year averaging a midteens rig count for the full year But just to reiterate our guidance of to yearoveryear production growth for the total company excluding Libya and growth for the US unconventional plays has not changed With the enablers of lower costs improved efficiencies and strong execution our strategic objectives in the three US resource plays remain in full force even at an overall reduced budget level We will continue our successful Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>codevelopment expanding beyond the Austin Chalk to the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in our stackandfrac pilot Our first quad stack and frac pilot which includes one Austin Chalk one Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and two Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells is online and early performance is encouraging We also placed five Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells online in the quarter In Oklahoma we are executing our tworig operated program and brought five gross operated wells to sales this quarter all in the SCOOP Were also continuing to leverage the benefit of our high value outside operated program and plan to participate in approximately of those wells this year in the SCOOP Woodford SCOOP Springer and STACK areas thanks to our reallocation of budget to one of our most prospective areas The capital weve reallocated to Oklahoma is primarily focused on increasing our nonoperated gross well exposure This increase in capital demonstrates our belief that Oklahoma represents an exciting growth opportunity for Marathon Oil that competes very favorably with our existing portfolio We continue to advance our technical work here to be positioned to step up our activity as prices improve And finally in the Bakken we concluded our enhanced completion pilots and have incorporated the improved design into all wells drilled this quarter Additionally initial results from the first of our four downspacing pilots are encouraging The second pilot is currently online but with fewer than days and the third just completed drilling Our ultimate objective is to fully integrate the downspacing pilot results with the now concluded completion design trials into our future development plans Before we open the call up to questions Id like to reiterate that our strong operational execution cost reductions continued efficiency gains and capital discipline are enhancing our returns today have us wellpositioned for the current price environment and wellprepared for a sustained commodity price recovery Christopher C Phillips DirectorInvestor Relations Thanks Lee Before we open the call to questions Id like to request that you ask no more than two questions with associated clarifications And you can reprompt as time permits With that Vivian well open the lines for questions Thank you We will now begin the questionandanswer session Our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse Please go ahead Edward George Westlake Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC Broker Yeah Good morning and congratulations on the strong operational momentum And quick question on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>charts I mean I guess you did discuss on the Q call but just a clarification How much of the EUR improvement that youre talking about is kind of high grading and how much of it is due to completions performance Lance W Robertson Vice PresidentNorth America Production Operations Ed thats a very good question and I think you should look at it in both of the things youre referencing are important in that First and foremost the ongoing completions optimization were doing is clearly driving EUR enhancement As we work on stage density profit loading fluid loading and active diversion we continue to see improvements on that side There is an impact as we focused in this year particularly on a more focused area to deliver the highest returns in a lower commodity environment So we are seeing some uplift from that But Im encouraged to say its principally driven by the completions efficacy were pushing all across those basins Thats what driving the real EUR enhancement And I think thats reflected if you even look at the early IPs again driving that Edward George Westlake Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC Broker Okay And a totally unrelated question and we wont talk about the politics of whats going on in Alberta But the oil sands a very solid performance in the first quarter Is that a sign of the sustainability that you were looking for or is that just a lucky quarter Lance W Robertson Vice PresidentNorth America Production Operations Ed not just us but our partners and Shell as an operator have worked very hard over the last several years particularly the last year to two years really working on the reliability system I dont think weve seen enough runtime yet to say thats sustainable But the signs are encouraging from our perspective We really like the focus on operating expense and we have more steps planned to work on that this year Certainly the production is a sign that in fact this is the fourth strong quarter in a row of production deliverability out of that business So I think were on that road to improvement that we havent been able to point to before Again Id like to see more runtime but Im certainly encouraged by this past quarter and actually the past four quarters That trend is headed in the right direction and it needs to in this environment And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Please go ahead Thanks Good morning everybody Lee I wonder if I could I dont know who actually who wants to take this one But if I look at the results you posted in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>quite a wide range of day IP rates there Im just wondering if those wells were all similar design or if theres some obvious kind of variance between those that caused maybe just give us an update as to whether you think the type curve is moving higher or if this is really more of a high grading in Then Ive got a followup please Yeah Well maybe Ill offer a few comments and then let Lance weigh in Were still in the early days of the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>codevelopment I would say that were still in the process of really delineating where the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to be prospective across our acreage And I think as part of that delineation we will see some natural variability in well results as we test different things in that particular play I think overall though were very encouraged from what were seeing in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and in combination of course with the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And were seeing similar strong results in the stackandfrac of which the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a component part Maybe Ill let Lance just comment on the completion design aspect of that Lance W Robertson Vice PresidentNorth America Production Operations Yeah Doug I think Lee actually highlighted it very well Were testing Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in a more fulsome way spread out over a fairly large area So were going to see some disparate result to that as we make sure we fully delineate it Id say those results are very much in line with Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Austin Chalk in the same respective areas And I would say whats most encouraging to us the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is working well in the areas where the Austin Chalk has worked a little bit less effectively And so we see those two as increasingly interchangeable so we can codevelop in a broader area And very encouraged thus far on the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>both in that Northern end as well as in the stack and frac I think to be more clear we brought on five Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells that we announced that are distinctive And in that stack and frac pilot that came online also includes a sixth or one more incremental Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well thats performing similarly Doug Leggate Bank of America Merrill Lynch All right I appreciate that Lee you obviously had my followup is in the costs You clearly had a very strong cost performance and I think that weve actually characterized your tenure since youve been CEO But I guess my question is assuming we do get a recovery in the oil price lets assume into the s or something like that how sustainable are these cost reductions Is it dynamic with an oil price recovery or do you expect to be able to hang on to a lot of these gains And Ill leave it there Thanks Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Thanks Doug We are very focused on cost and I give a lot of credit to our asset teams And as I mentioned in my opening remarks operating cost is just hard work Its many things coming together to contribute to driving that unit cost lower Its both the numerator as well as the denominator Its working your absolute cost as well as making sure youre keeping your barrels online and the teams did an outstanding job at that this quarter Many of those things I think in the operating cost side though are structural in nature When you think about things around preventive maintenance and our ability to efficiently deploy contractors when you think about efficiently using our installed compression horsepower when you think about our optimizing of our chemical programs in the oil field all of these things in our mind are independent of the commodity price environment And we will carry those forward in time In parallel with that though were not turning a blind eye to our scale and our ability to leverage that scale in commercial dialog as well And some of those will be more sticky than others in some cases But we do expect that well retain even an element of those commercial gains as we move forward in time But those will have a much closer correlation with the pricing environment that we find ourselves On the capital side when you think about the cost reductions weve achieved there I mean when you look at the million of well in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the million of well that weve achieved in the Bakken the weve achieved per well in Oklahoma those capital efficiencies have in large part been driven by the response of the service industry to participate in this downturn that were experiencing But even within that there is a commercial element and efficiency element as well Our most efficient frac crews can deliver a high number of stages on a monthly basis Thats a winwin for both the operator as well as the service provider And our ability to keep those most efficient crews running even with the downturn in activity I believe will be key to our ability to continue momentum as we see prices improvements in the future Appreciate the answers Lee Thank you Ryan Todd Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Yeah thanks Good morning gentlemen Great results And if I could ask maybe the first question is can you talk a little bit about the rationale behind the decision to drop the incremental rigs and what that means for the trajectory of production Previously you had talked about the US onshore showing kind of an exittoexit incline Is that still the case Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Okay Yeah thanks Ryan Let me maybe start with the rationale around the further optimization and reduction in capital budget I would really describe that decision and really driven by two things First is just a continued focus on capital discipline and financial flexibility in a period where we still have uncertainty around the price environment albeit weve seen some strengthening here as of late A lot of the macro factors that have driven the downturn are still in place so we need to recognize that Secondly with the enablers of both cost efficiency and cost reduction were still able to achieve our strategic objectives in each of the three US resource plays and hold our guidance under that revised budget and drive those efficiencies and savings really down to the balance sheet And if we start to see a sustainable price recovery we can then reconsider if we want to take some of that cash flow and redeploy it into the business In terms of volumes targeting and trajectory you mentioned that we had communicated previously an exittoexit in the unconventional target or unconventional production Q to Q to slightly up on an exittoexit basis And we still feel that that is consistent with the budget that were putting forward today Great And then maybe one followup on that If we look at the normalized second half outlook youve given obviously we have an updated CapEx budget and like everybody else you came into the year a bit hot Can you talk maybe about what the normalized CapEx run rate looks like in the second half of the year Yeah Let me maybe describe it more from an activity perspective and I think the capital will then kind of follow Ryan As we talked about you used the word we came in hot I think we recognized that we were going to come into the first quarter at high activity levels We were coming out of with nominally plus rigs running in the unconventionals We started that deceleration in activity in the first quarter and in fact our capital budget we delivered essentially against our capital budget in the first quarter But we did have a momentum effect as we came in from last year That rampdown is continuing By the time we get to the end of second quarter well be at our rig count that we will hold flat for the remainder of the year and that will set the activity levels in our unconventional plays Ryan Todd Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Okay And any idea of what the CapEx number is associated with that rig program Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Well again if you kind of think about our billion rate in the first quarter you think about that in the context of our overall billion budget you put in the fact that were relatively talking about a flat activity level from the second quarter forward I think that you can back into the math in terms of what the actual rate will look like And our next question comes from Matt Portillo from TPH Please go ahead Matthew Merrel Portillo Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Just a question around capital allocation thoughts As you guys continue to see positive improvements in the SCOOP and STACK can you talk about your capital allocation decisions as you think about heading into and how that may shift between the Bakken Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Oklahoma asset base Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Absolutely As weve talked in the past we look at capital allocation down really to a typecurve level And it is a competition for capital allocation amongst the three resource plays Specifically when we look at the SCOOP and the STACK and we think about incremental cash flows becoming available to reinvest in the business were going to drive those to the highest return opportunities Today when you look at our singlewell economics thats really the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Oklahoma And the highest quality of the Bakken the Myrmidon and as we integrate both the completion trial results and the downspacing results well see how those fare in the capital allocation decision But theres no doubt that as incremental capital becomes available that will be directed to the US unconventionals and Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Oklahoma will be the strongest competitors for that capital Matthew Merrel Portillo Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Great And then just a followup to that question you mentioned potentially north of million in noncore asset sales Just curious as you see a firming of the commodity price here and potential execution on those transactions should we expect to see that redeployed potentially into the ground in the back half of this year heading into in regards to activity or can you provide a bit of an update on how youre thinking about the capital allocation from those transactions Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Well first maybe just a few thoughts on the potential transactions themselves In our view portfolio management is part of what we do Its an evergreen process These are noncore assets that were talking about and what that means to us is that these are assets that are not going to compete for capital allocation and likely have higher value in someone elses portfolio This process would be going on irrespective of the commodity cycle that we find ourselves in because we think again these assets will have appeal to the right portfolio Assuming success in those divestment activities then well look at that at that point in time and see how constructive the price environment is and make a decision as whether or not we bring that to the balance sheet or redeploy it into our organic investment portfolio which is very competitive Brian A Singer Goldman Sachs Co I wanted to followup a little bit on some of the capital allocation questions In SCOOP STACK and Springer youve reallocated capital there But can you talk to your preference on balancing nonoperated spending versus accelerating your own spending and specifically what the milestones you would be looking for between price costs and well results for you to make a more material acceleration in your operated activity levels Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Yeah absolutely Well first of all the tworig operated program beyond delivering very profitable and competitive wells is also allowing us to protect our pretty significant leasehold position in Oklahoma over acres So that is an important element of our operated program and why we wanted to continue that commitment going into this year Theres no doubt that theres been an activity uptick in Oklahoma in our nonoperated portfolio as those folks that are multibasin operators direct more capital into Oklahoma We want to participate in the highquality wells that that affords us because it simply expands the number of data points in our knowledge base around the resource potential that exists in Oklahoma Having said that though and kind of consistent with my previous comments to the extent that we see a sustained strengthening in prices that we see incremental cash flow come available Oklahoma our operated program will compete very favorably for those incremental dollars Brian A Singer Goldman Sachs Co Got it Thank you And then I have a somewhat nuanced followup to I think Ryan Todds earlier question with regards to how you are thinking about yearend What Im trying to figure out is or what were trying to figure out is whether on a goingforward basis you are saying you can do exactly the same as previously as we look into next year but with fewer rigs And so I guess my question is with your Q having beaten expectations you now have a little bit of a buffer to lower activity and get back to the same point in terms of yearend production that you were at before Is that just the case or is what youre saying youre going to be on a growth trajectory from the yearend point that was no different with a lower rig count than it was previously with a higher rig count Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah I think we want to make sure that were wellprepared to reengage and ramp up in the unconventionals Our base plan this year is to be at our rig count by second quarter We think that is the right answer from a capital discipline standpoint But we have the execution capacity to step into more activity as the macro environment supports that decision and well be wellpositioned to do that And one of the advantages of course of holding on to our best rigs our best crew is that it does position you very favorably to step back in to that high activity or higher activity periodSo as we look ahead to we view that as an opportunity to start that rampup again assuming that we see that constructive price environment in front of us And within our of course budget we do have some items some investments that will be either reduced or falling out of the program that will provide us a little bit of accommodation space even on a flat budget outlook going into And our next question comes from John Herrlin from Socit Gnrale Please go ahead John P Herrlin SG Americas Securities LLC Yeah Hi Just two quick ones from me Could you talk more about the Rodo well in EG and what your plans are there Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah absolutely John Well let Mitch take that one Thomas Mitchell Little Vice PresidentInternational Production Operations Sure John Thanks for the question We talked about in our Q call the two well exploration program in EG And we previously announced the noncommercial hydrocarbon results of the Sodalita well We did fare a bit better on the Rodo well But we now want to integrate the results of both of those wells into our regional database look at the options to further exploit the other prospects in the area and understand what the commerciality options might be looking forward Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director And I think just building on that the EG program to us is a great example though of really infrastructureled exploration where we have the investment there These would be possibly smaller accumulations that we think that we have a unique ability to bring online and make commercial But as Mitch stated we still have some work to do to integrate the results from both wells before were ready to move forward John P Herrlin SG Americas Securities LLC Yeah I did I was wondering whether you think your current distribution is too high relative to the cash flow your dividend whether you need to address that going forward or given you current capital plan and asset sales that its not an issue John R Sult Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah John this is JR How are you this morning John R Sult Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Im good Thanks No John still weve been pretty clear that when we think about capital allocation that the dividend today remains in that pool of the first call on our capital At the end of the day thats not the decision around the dividend is really the boards and not management At this point in time it remains that first call on capital Theres no doubt some or commodity price environment that it pulls on our cash flows much harder than it did when it was just a year ago But at this point in time were still committed to that dividend John Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director And our goal is of course to grow back into it David Martin Heikkinen Heikkinen Energy Advisors Thanks Just curious on the production and reserves associated with the noncore assets Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Just we havent detailed out specifically any granularity on those assets but theyre noncore And for us that means that they will likely be not significant from a volumes or resource standpoint David Martin Heikkinen Heikkinen Energy Advisors Are they in you guidance or not I guess if its not significant it doesnt really matter Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director David Martin Heikkinen Heikkinen Energy Advisors Thats helpful And then thinking about cadence in each of your onshore resource plays and your second quarter guidance can you break out some idea of expectations of how you maintain the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at a higher activity level and then I guess Oklahoma next and then what happens in the Bakken as youve slowed more rapidly there Im just trying to get an idea of production in each of those as you go through the year Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Well just in terms of cadence or paces its really again driven by rig activity and frac crew activity A case in point David were already at a single rig of activity in the Bakken But within that single rig capacity we are very confident that we will still be able to deliver on our downspacing pilots which was a key strategic objective for this year in the Bakken In Oklahoma our tworig operated program was largely dictated by our desire to ensure we protected all of our highquality leaseholds while continuing to develop the SCOOP area as well And then of course leverage to the extent that we can the nonoperated side of the business to leverage our capital very efficiently And then in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>its really taking full advantage of some of the efficiencies that we are seeing on the drilling front and hopefully being able to extrapolate those moving forward into the second half of the year David Martin Heikkinen Heikkinen Energy Advisors I guess just to make simple math if we take your gross operated wells in each area subtract first quarter and divide by three is that a rough approximation of completed well cadence Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah I think it is a rough approximation because as we get down to that we are a little bit in that that still that transitional period David as we come out of the first quarter where were still kind of decelerating and ramping down But as we kind of hit the back end of the second quarter that really is setting the pace as we look forward in the second half of the year Guy Allen Baber Simmons Company International Lee I apologize for belaboring this point but on the topic of pivoting back toward increasing activity levels youve mentioned consistently that you want to see a sustainable price recovery before you begin the added rigs Can you just talk a little bit more about what that really means and what you want to see Prices are at a barrel on the forward curve later this year Do you need to see a higher price or is it more of a duration question or is it just a matter of you all becoming more comfortable with the macro internally And then relatedly you mentioned a number of times you want to be wellprepared to reengage Are there any bottlenecks that youre aware of that could hinder an efficient ramp back up And really just wondering what risks youre most focused on mitigating in a rampup scenario and how you believe the company is wellpositioned to ramp up whenever you feel that the time is right Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah well let me maybe take the question on the price outlook and what were really looking for there from a trigger point standpoint And then maybe Ill defer the bottleneck question around our unconventionals over to Lance But on the question of what is the trigger what are the signs that were looking for to then give us confidence to begin a rampup in our unconventionals For us youre right the forward curve is looking around I think if we saw sustainment at plus certainly going into the back half of the year in to us its more about seeing that being a sustainable recovery and having the confidence to come back in and begin a rampup But if we saw those levels we felt that the macros were supportive and constructive of a sustainable plus kind of a range we feel very confident going into with a rampup in our unconventionals Let me hand over to Lance though to address more of the question about execution bottlenecks as we start thinking about a rampup in the unconventionals Lance W Robertson Vice PresidentNorth America Production Operations Guy as we reduce activity we have a clear focus on retaining the most efficient service providers crews and equipment which naturally creates an efficiency drive on our existing activity that remains But it also positions us well as we grow We have existing relationships with those providers Many of those are going to be the most equipped to bring equipment and people back into the sector on the road side So I think were going to be comfortable there And I think our drive to be really efficient is naturally a place where service providers would want to work for us before others And so I think well have some opportunity there Having said that I mean we do have some concern that the labor force is leaving the energy space during this time and its going to make ramping up more challenging than ramping down And I think thats something that not just to us but others will have to face in the market Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Scott Hanold RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey if I may just pile on again to the same theme and just maybe take a different tact As you look into ramping up if you do get a sustained price increase would you all be willing to utilize your credit facility to do that or do you have a tendency not to want to I guess add that to ramp up And if I can throw in my second question right away maybe this is a good one for JR Is there any change in view on hedging because it looks like youve obviously now have some collars there with some floors Can you just give us a sense of how that works into the equation John R Sult Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes Scott You and I probably talked before I dont think its necessarily a change in view Weve always looked at commodity risk management much more broadly than just derivative usage But I think weve been pretty clear and transparent that if we saw opportunities in the market to protect our cash flows while still giving us a piece of that upside in the commodity price that wed be willing to do that And I think weve demonstrated it on a scale at least for as well as beginning to look at the market all predominantly through the use of collars again to ensure that were participating in that upside I mean in terms of the balance sheet again arguably Im definitely leaning on the balance sheet this year although Im reinvesting the proceeds that we receive from Norway and those highreturn North American unconventionals And weve been clear that we are willing to lean but were not willing to stress that balance sheet And so it definitely is a balancing act But dont forget when those commodity prices do improve or as they do improve the rest of my portfolio that weighted for oil is going to also increase my operating cash flows that then will further support our ability to reinvest in increased activity And our next question comes from Monroe Helm from Barrow Hanley Please go ahead Hiram Monroe Helm Barrow Hanley Mewhinney Strauss LLC Gosh I must have my name misspelled as David Heikkinen Its a good thing Im not Monroe Heikkinen It would really be bad My question is just kind of a follow on to what the discussions been here about increasing activity and a better commodity price environment So if we look at the strip for its So lets just assume that the BTS for next year I know you havent done your budget for next year but you got to have some sense of what your production profile will look like in a world So Im wondering if you can give us a very early outlook on what CapEx and what production might look like in under a environment Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Luckily it is a bit early from a budget cycle perspective But of course were continuing to think about what may look like under various pricing scenarios But I think under the scenario that you described which is a confident firm market going into in that sense we could take a flat budget into and still have a rampup in the unconventionals due to the fact that we have other investments falling away in And that would of course be our plan And then wed watch for other signals in terms of how far we would want to go beyond that flat budget toward our ramp up in activity But we can absolutely ramp up in the unconventionals on a flat threethree budget in in the environment that you just described Hiram Monroe Helm Barrow Hanley Mewhinney Strauss LLC What do you think given that and this rampup in the unconventionals could your production in the can you give us a sense for what your US production growth might be Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah well again its awfully early to talk about volumemetric growth in particularly with the dynamics that were experiencing in the market right now But as we think about that flat budget and that rampup that it might afford in that price environment we could see average production looking not dissimilar to our Q exit rates And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James Please go ahead Pavel S Molchanov Raymond James Associates Inc Thanks for taking the question guys We havent gotten a lot on international So I thought Id try a few on that front Pavel S Molchanov Raymond James Associates Inc In the UK you guys obviously had interest in the past in selling the asset But then a couple of months ago we got a positive change in the tax treatment in the UK sector So does that change your stance on whether this is something that you want to keep for the long run Thomas Mitchell Little Vice PresidentInternational Production Operations Yeah Pavel Thanks for the question As you said we did entertain a marketing effort last year We did not receive offers that we thought represented full value for the assets And so weve taken the position that were going to continue to operate those assets in the most efficient manner we can And certainly were focused this year in this down environment on both commercial leverage extending some of our scale with strategic suppliers from North America across there and some structural changes No doubt youve seen some of the equal time rotation work were doing which is decreasing our overall cost structure focused on chemicals logistics all of those things And of course the tax reforms that have been introduced in the UK are helpful to us but were at a point in the asset life where theyre not as material to us as they might be to earlier life assets Pavel S Molchanov Raymond James Associates Inc Okay Okay Thats useful And then on Kurdistan I know that there have been delays for obvious reasons with the Atrush development Are you incorporating any production from that field in guidance Thomas Mitchell Little Vice PresidentInternational Production Operations Sure Pavel We had in our original plan had very minimal production from that asset And as youve noted we have been informed from the operator of some potential delays to first oil which was previously targeted for the very end of Were working through that with them and understanding the forward plan on that and look to have further updates in the near future Pavel S Molchanov Raymond James Associates Inc Okay But youre still committed to keeping that Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Well I would just say Pavel just going back to our discussion around portfolio management that thats part of what we do That includes our activities in Kurdistan as well Well test all assets for their fit in our portfolio As you can imagine with the dynamics now in the KRG even if we were to take a position of wanting to monetize all that that it might be relatively tough But those are assets that when we look at the above ground risk well need to consider their longterm fit in our portfolio Jason D Gammel Jefferies International Ltd Thanks very much I wanted to ask a little bit about the stackandfrac Can you talk a little bit about the actual configuration of that and if you were to move into a program what it would mean for something like interlateral spacing within the lower Bakken And then maybe talk a little bit about the costefficiency that comes from the process Lance W Robertson Vice PresidentNorth America Production Operations Sure Jason The stackandfrac weve defined it I think I cant remember the exact time we actually rolled that out But if you look at the diagram we put out in our previous press releases were showing that as a fourinterval codevelopment four vertical intervals which is Austin Chalk Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and then two wells in the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>We would actually broaden that to say that well have stackandfrac pilots where therell just be three which is Austin Chalk Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as well as Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>So its that vertical codevelopment We like the rates from all three of those horizons when theyve been stacked We announced that first pilot in that and we have some additional pilots flowing Well be able to talk about those as they mature But in terms of the efficiency youre referencing there and this opportunity we really like the efficiency because were codeveloping all of those horizons from the same pads So were spudding from rig to rig and it gives us an opportunity to address those efficiencies So if you look at those pilots what youd see is that in most of those cases its acre spacing in the same zone In the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>where we have two Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells its acre vertical but its really acre between them So its like a chevron or a W pattern if you will in that lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>when you put two in there But generally same zone acre with the exception of that in the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we actually separated into here it gets confusing the Upper Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the Lower Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>creative names I know So its generally acre with the exception when you put two in there in the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>it gets to whats effectively acre spacing but theyre offset in that pattern Okay Thanks Thats really useful If I can just ask one more question Theres been a lot of discussion about capital allocation over the course of the call in a low price environment You really had to take into stock what is important to you Im just wondering how deepwater exploration now fits into your future plans just given that even if youre successful the amount of capital that would be required for development and the rate of return on that may not even be competitive with what were youre doing onshore Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Well I think there youre hitting upon really the contrast between the short cycle and the longcycle investments And to be fair to the deepwater you need to look at it in terms of fullcycle returns as well not incremental returns So I guess it really comes down to your view of that longerterm price outlook over time If you take a view to where that longerterm outlook is constructive then deepwater has a role to play in continuing to meet part of the future demand And in our view the highquality deepwater assets still have the ability to compete in that longerterm environment I think the question for us becomes one of scale and cash flows and our ability to support the large investment dollars that are required in deepwater development And so were going to be very selective and very focused This years exploration program is half of the spend that we were last year So were going to bring a very sharp focus to that program that reflects the fact that these longercycle investments can have a role to play in your portfolio And our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers Please go ahead Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc This is a great call A lot of color I wanted to ask you if you could provide a little bit more color on the Oklahoma resource nonop activity And what Im really wondering is is this just mirroring operated activity without the burden of adding a rig or does it present an additional opportunity to perhaps compress the learning curve on areas about which you have a less defined division Lance W Robertson Vice PresidentNorth America Production Operations Yeah Jeff It clearly accelerates the opportunities youre describing Were learning an enormous amount from all of the offsetoperated activity That activity is predominantly focused in the highest values areas within the SCOOP and in the STACK where we have acreage We clearly want to participate and capture that acreage and convert it to HBP But we also want to take and leverage all of the early production the petrophysics and the learnings we can have from that One of the things we really appreciate about the Oklahoma resource basins is were getting several multiples of data from the OBO activity that we get from an operated activity for very few capital dollars So were learning tremendously at very low risk really accelerates our description of the resource of the well productivity and allows us to design our own pilots and grow and get ready to grow to scale activity much more rapidly I think our increasing capital spend in that area reflects that as Oklahoma continues to be resilient in the returns it can deliver the activity in Oklahoma has also been resilient And were just responding to make sure we dont miss any valuable opportunities Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director And Ill also just add that even though were excited about the incremental information that can be gained from leveraging into nonoperate we have a very good understanding of Oklahoma I mean we have already greater than a billion barrels of oil equivalent and P resource ascribed to Oklahoma So this is really just continuing to move that and progress that further and doing that in essentially a low price environment Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc Okay Thank you And just as a followup lets take the same thing but think of it comparatively with the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Following on your earlier remarks about well performance was the decision to pull capital out of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>while increasing capital in Oklahoma an example of capital competition or was it more that Oklahoma offered a unique opportunity to increase activity without having to commit to another rig Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yes I think it was one that Oklahoma does compete for capital very favorably If you go back to our single well economics and you look at those even headtohead with the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>those wells are on par So strictly from an economic standpoint absolutely competitive But we saw a unique opportunity in Oklahoma I think as Lance very well described to really leverage our money there to continue to expand our knowledge and insights around the Oklahoma resource basin So we felt that was a unique opportunity Its largely being driven by Oklahoma continuing to attract more capital from other operators portfolios and we want to participate in that Jeffrey L Campbell Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Inc And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo Please go ahead Roger D Read Wells Fargo Securities LLC Quite a lot of this been hit I guess Id like to see would you give any more clarity on the what qualifies as noncore and is there any risk if a sale occurs this year that it would impact the production guidance Or are we thinking about more of the undeveloped as you mentioned competing with capital going forward Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah Again for a lot of reasons we cant go into to details on exactly what we would place in the noncore assets But suffice to say because of the definition of noncore we view these as being not significant from a reserves and volume standpoint So we would not view this as being highly impactful to our forward guidance And to the extent were successful on those transactions well communicate those clearly and transparently into the market But for now I think suffice to say we have identified a select list of noncore properties that we feel like will struggle to compete for capital could potentially have higher value in someone elses portfolio And we want to pursue those and accelerate those cash flows either to the balance sheet or for redeployment Roger D Read Wells Fargo Securities LLC No its fair And I guess the last question I have is as you think about reducing rig count reducing CapEx maintaining production and youre seeing different ways of testing wells and completion designs is there anything youre doing differently in terms of choking back to production or anything like that to sort of smooth out I mean some companies are going for more the drill but uncompleted build a backlog Clearly youre not in that camp But I didnt know as we think about the exit rate for and all the discussion about CapEx and future drilling activity in if there was an incentive to sort of lets call it smooth out things a little bit as you set yourself up for the next up cycle Lance W Robertson Vice PresidentNorth America Production Operations Roger we managed each of the individual wells to deliver the highest value in that investment So we generally let the technical and operations teams manage those wells effectively So rather than try this for example flow them on a smaller choke size and smooth that out Were looking for highest value on that investment return today The wells were investing in this quarter are generating good returns at current pricing So we have confidence we can do that and decisions weve really let the technical teams make Weve scaled our activity in North America in logical increments that make sense So for example in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we want to keep whole frac fleets active rather than partial frac fleets to drive efficiency Weve scaled the drilling activity to match that Part of the reduction weve taken in activity there is actually not just related to capital spend but just recognizing as the efficiencies continue to improve we were going to have to let go of one or more rigs anyway to make sure we didnt overdrill our plan for the year And so well keep doing that I think as you noted also we have not been building a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells for use later in the year Were really managing that as an operations basket of wells to complete to manage our stimulation operation smoothly and efficiently John R Sult Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Edward George Westlake Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC Broker Ive got followups but Ill limit it to one Im surprised we havent been talking more about the SCOOP and STACKS so maybe people arent quite as as I thought But let me ask you about when do you think youll be able to give us an update just in terms of timing in terms of the well costs in a development mode And then appreciate that the Meramec is quite thick up in the STACK and obviously youve got the Woodford spring occurred about an opportunity in the south So the spacing could be really quite tight So when do you think youll be able to give us some updates on these spacing tests Lee M Tillman President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah when we typically talk about production results with you Ed we tend to talk about wanting to get days of production to really understand well performance understand where we are on a specific type curve We are still on the learning curve in Oklahoma when it comes though to DC costs And we think were starting in a much more favorable position because of all the good work that has been done already in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the Bakken to drive well costs down We captured in well costs already since we released our new well costs this year and our singlewell economics But we think theres a lot more room to maneuver there from both an efficiency as well as a commercial standpoint And thats just going to take some time as we grow to scale Bear in mind Ed we had plans that had actually ramped up the six rigs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at yearend Im sorry in Oklahoma at the end of the year here And so the execution capacity is there And I think as we move that to scale that is going to allow us to really accelerate on that learning curve particularly when it comes to DC costs Edward George Westlake Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC Broker Right I was just trying to see if I could see if there was a NASCAR track in Oklahoma but so therell be an Analyst Day at some point in the future And Im not showing any further questions At this time I will now turn the call back over to Mr Chris Phillips for closing remarks Christopher C
