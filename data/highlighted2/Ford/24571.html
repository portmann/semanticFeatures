measures Rosetta Resources will be able to reduce allin inclusive total well costs by to this year Rosetta will hold its core acreage in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Permian Basin in order to take advantage of the low cost of production in these areas Rosetta will operate within its means by not taking any more debt while an increase in cash flow and a drop in capex will strengthen its balance sheet Rosettas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Wolfcamp assets will achieve breakeven at and a barrel respectively allowing the company to keep its margins intact in a low price scenario There is a lot of uncertainty regarding oil prices right now There are certain bright spots such as an expected increase in global demand For example Saudi Arabia has increased crude pricing for its sales to Asia for May citing increased demand But at the same time there are some concerns as well such as the probability that Iran will be allowed to export crude oil after reaching a nuclear agreement In such a scenario it is best to remain cautious regarding crude oil pricing and keep a close watch on those oil companies that are successfully reducing their costs in order to remain competitive In my opinion Rosetta Resources NASDAQ ROSE is one such company Although the stock has taken a massive beating in the last year losing over its revenue and earnings have increased at an impressive pace as shown below Thus Rosettas top and bottomlines have accelerated at a terrific pace despite the massive drop in crude oil pricing in the past year The companys development and delineation of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale and the Permian Basin are driving its results as these high grade assets are capable of delivering returns even in a low oil price environment For instance its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>assets can achieve breakeven at a price of a barrel while the Wolfcamp A horizontal wells are expected to remain at breakeven at a price of a barrel More importantly Rosetta is reducing its service costs in order to strengthen the economic returns of these assets by adopting various measures For instance Rosetta has implemented a new stimulation design that is based on changing the proppant type ceramic to sand apart from trying out higher proppant loadings As a result the company will be able to reduce its drilling and completion costs Also at the Lower and Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>areas at Gate Ranch Rosetta has recently initiated staggered pilot programs This program along with its new stimulated design should help Rosetta reduce costs going forward In fact Rosetta expects its allin inclusive total well costs to drop in the range of to in fiscal Additionally the company has taken a smart decision by cutting down its capital expenditure for the next two years It expects to spend approximately million in and a drop over its capital expenditure in Rosetta plans to spend nearly of its capital budget on drilling and completion while the remaining will go to other corporate costs leasehold and other facilities Looking ahead Rosetta plans to hold its core acreage positions in the liquidrich areas of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the Delaware Basin The below table illustrates its core acreage position across its different assets For example Rosetta has recovered nearly of the reserves in the Gates Ranch Far South area in two years generating about of the present value Hence its decision of not drilling too many wells in a low price environment is a good one The company will lose some acreage as a result as reflected in twoyear change column below due to continuous drilling obligations But considering the concentration of its assets in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Permian Rosetta should be able to accelerate production in the long run All in all Rosetta should be able to reduce its costs at a good clip going forward This is a smart strategy in the current crude oil environment where there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the future direction of oil prices More importantly Rosettas cost cuts will allow it to operate within its means ie the company will not take on additional debt and operate using its cash flow This is a good initiative since Rosetta has a very high level of debt at billion and a debtequity of close to But the companys cash flow has trended positively in the past year and stands at almost million as shown below ROSE Cash from Operations TTM data by YCharts Thus by operating within its means Rosetta is following the right strategy Moreover since the companys assets are in key shale plays such as the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the Permian it should be able to scale up production when the market conditions permit Hence despite its huge drop over the last year Rosetta can make a comeback in the long run Source Rosetta Resources Operating Within Means And Holding The Core Acreage Are LongTerm Drivers Disclosure
