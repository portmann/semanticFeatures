market which is now about higher than where it closed in will also go exactly nowhere The reason for this pessimism can be summarized in three bullet points i bifurcated thematic returns Goldman thinks that due to divergent monetary policies Fed tightening vs ECB and BoJ easing the USD will strengthen and benefit some stocks and harm others Some of those impacted the most will be multinationals and luxury retail companies see Tiffany earnings today Overall the biggest headwind cited by companies in Q has been the strong dollar expect this to continue and to further depress revenues and thus earnings ii higher rates According to Goldman when fund managers eventually realize the tightening process will be more sustained than originally anticipated the PE multiple will contract and offset the otherwise positive impact of earnings growth iii margin expansion stories If companies cant rely on top line growth and multiple expansion is not available there is just one source of growth margin expansion It is bullet iii that is the most important because here the divergence between Wall Streets hopiumdriven margin euphoria is most visible According to Goldman tech accounted for of the overall SP expansion during the past five years Apple is responsible for of rise Tech sector now has margins that are twice the overall market That tremendous tech but mostly AAPLdriven margin growth has now ended So can this torrid surge in tech margins continue Goldmans answer is a resounding no Many of the drivers of margin expansion during the past few decades appear to be behind us including lower interest rates outsourcing and technology SP net margins have been essentially flat for five years at just below We forecast margins will remain flat in and at Information Technology has been a notable exception with margins rising in recent years to or x the overall market However roughly of the bp leap in Tech margins since is attributable to Apple AAPL alone Given rising labor and health care costs firms in most industries will struggle to simply maintain margins Investors will reward firms able to demonstrate a path to higher sales and margins But perhaps the one chart that confirms that one cant have their wage rising cake and eat corporate profits too is the following In other words if the Fed is hiking because it sees something about the economy that few others do ie rising wages then by definition that means that profit margins will contract as growing wages take out ever bigger chunks of the corporate bottom line So with sales declines set posied to accelerate due to the soaring dollar central bank liquiditydriven multiple expansion no longer feasible and corporate margin growth set to resume its contractionary path again we wonder where will the next leg higher in stocks come from Unless of course the whole the Fed is hiking because the SP has topped out economy is recovering was just the latest economist consensus mirage Tue LetThemEatRand In other words if the Fed is hiking because it sees something about the economy that few others do ie rising wages then by definition that means that profit margins will contract as growing wages take out ever bigger chunks of the corporate bottom line Though I dont believe for a minute that wages are rising for anyone in the it also seems pretty obvious to me that low wages are the root problem of our economy If the last years is not proof that trickle down does not work that offshoring is a net negative to the broader economy and that what makes the US economy function well is a middle class that can afford to live comfortably and retire comfortably without massive debt to fuel spending I dont know what does And corporate profit margins mean shit if fewer and fewer people can afford to buy what corporations sell Ill take a profit on sales any day over a profit on sales Pretty basic stuff if you ask me Henry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford

httpwwwforbescomsitestimworstallthestoryofhenryfo It had nothing to do with paying his workers enough money to buy his product In todays labor makret few employers worry about turnover Most employees are grateful to just have a job Tue LetThemEatRand Note that I did not make the argument that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>explicitly decided to pay workers more so they could afford the cars He paid them because it ultimately saved the company money and the middle class was born perhaps as an unintended consequence httpwwwhenryfordcomaday The fact remains that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bucked the prevailing logic among US corporations repeated here often that wage arbitrage is the longterm answer to corporate profits And it seems indisputable to me that corporations will make more money in the long term if they have buyers for their products Chasing profit margin by offshoring is a longterm recipe for disaster as we see unfolding now Tue silverer Just bought one of those SIM adapters so I can use my old flip phone again and put my s spy device in the closet in a soundproof box I know the old flip phone offers days of standby and talking no spyware the inability to host a virus because its as simple as the mind of a Washington politician Im done with Apple and done with Apples updates All the updates do now is make you work to relearn a machine that breaks rules and becomes less and less intuitive as time goes on When my Apple becomes crippled on the internet due to my resistance to follow instructions and if I decide the internet still is worthwhile at that time Ill be using a Linux box Sorry but Im a selfish bastard I worry about me and my money not Apple and Apples money And here I thought just lawyers
