Since Breakeven Is So Much Lower Should You Buy General Motors Company NYSEGM Seeking Alpha General Motors can withstand a sizable slowdown in its US operations But does that mean it can withstand a slowdown among the rest of the world Even so these stocks trade poorly and revaluation from the market seems unlikely at this stage of the auto cycle Earlier this week General Motors NYSE GM hosted its annual meeting of shareholders ahead of which CEO Mary Barra called the stock undervalued Now I want to be clear up front I like Mary Barra very much I think shes done a good job at GM and I agree with the broad statement that the automaker is undervalued I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is undervalued too I wrote as much back in April when I asked why the automakers are so hated The automakers are posting record profits and for crying out loud have dividend yields that are almost higher than their PE ratios But that hasnt stopped investors from punishing the stocks with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>down on the year and over the past months and GM down and over that same time period respectively The general thesis is that investors should buy these stocks when the economy is the dumps ride them into the recovery and essentially dump them before things get too good But these companies have cleaned up much of their operations and Barra said as much just the other day Anyone whos got minutes and seconds to spare I suggest watching her interview compliments of Bloomberg The company says it can still operate at breakeven results if the US SAAR falls into the million to million unit range down considerably from the million sold in the States last year Thats quite impressive considering that in the worst economic downtown most of us have ever seen the SAAR didnt break below million in and only briefly spent time below million units I do have one issue with this assessment though If the US SAAR falls to million units what the heck is the rest of the world going to look like Because right now we have a million to million unit SAAR while China is barely posting any growth and is likely only doing so because of government incentives South America is in the toilet and Europe is only just beginning to get moving If the US economy takes a big enough dump to cut auto sales by I have a feeling the rest of the world will be in some trouble and so will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM The only caveat is if Barra implied GM can operate at breakeven with a big drop in US sales and the rest of the world but thats not how it came across Its nearly impossible or at least beyond my statistical capabilities to find the midpoint where US vehicle sales need to fall to in order to drag down the rest of the world auto sales to the point where GM is functioning at overall breakeven Perhaps at million SAAR in the US the rest of the world will be weak but not in freefall and GM will be at overall breakeven then Im not really sure but its something for investors to consider I will be the first to admit that GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are both in a much better place than they were years ago its tough to argue that But I wouldnt blindly accept that we could encounter another like scenario and these companies would be around breakeven operations For the record I dont think Barra is suggesting that but instead highlighting that the company is financially stronger than in previous years while at the same time the stock is undervalued as investors fear peak auto In effect shes saying that even if we are near peak auto the company will still be quite profitable during a period of stalled or lower sales growth GM can weather a worse storm than many investors assume The automakers have been a tough one for me I had owned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for several years and GM for quite some time too Last fall I explained this in greater detail in the story linked above I threw in the towel because despite the continual good news the stocks just didnt trade well Here we are now with the latest quarters showing tremendously upbeat results and putting both on pace for an amazing Yet the Street doesnt care If you can look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM as bondlike holdings where the stocks move very little but have a handsome dividend payout and the possibility of some upside then yes these make sense in ones portfolio If however you are looking for the market to suddenly revalue these stocks with a higher valuation in the current environment and want the stock price to appreciate considerably in a short period of time I suggest looking elsewhere Disclosure
