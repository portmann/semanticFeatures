growth appears to be leveling off Through selective and very moderate incentives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should be able to maintain current sales growth in the US Concerns about Chinas impact on companies doing business there have been widespread over the last week as the Chinese government moves to devalue its currency for the third day Some estimates are claiming that US auto sales are beginning to peak but were not concerned yet about that Nor are we concerned about the domestic demand for Fords NYSE F vehicles As weve shown in our previous articles demand for the companys flagship F continues to be robust We have a longterm long position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and as weve said were not betting on the company having a great year this year were betting on the companys meticulous selection of capital allocation into select investments to fuel its growth globally over the long term We continue to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a winwin because We have a very longterm time frame in holding the company and in the meantime were collecting the companys yield of almost Weve been covering all of the news that comes out of the auto maker to see how it stacks up with our bull case on the company Recently we wrote about the continued demand for Fords F domestically a sign that the companys backbone of sales remains firm The question of US auto sales leveling off has come up several times and we think the company can handle this leveling off with incentivized selling if necessary which it may not be We are also happy to see the companys continued confidence in the longterm plan in China Expanding from firm sales here in the US most of our position is a bet on Fords ability to move itself globally and position itself to major populous countries like China Our argument is that the companys investments in these areas would help out in the future in the form of bottomline improvement Concerns about Chinas impact on companies doing business there have been widespread over the last week as the Chinese government moves to devalue its currency for the third day in a row We were happy to see Fords executives this week stating that they remain confident in the longterm game plan in China and that they havent seen any signs of worry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Cos head of global purchasing on Wednesday said the company remains bullish on China despite a drop in auto sales recently Longer term were still very bullish on China said Hau ThaiTang head of global purchasing for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Speaking at an auto industry conference in New York Hau ThaiTang said that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>adjusted for expected lower volumes ahead of the recent downturn But if there is a prolonged period of recessions in China the company will make moves to balance supply with demand he said adding we dont see anything like that at this point Our last article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>went on to detail some of the steps the company is taking in India to tap into the vein of compact vehicle sales The company is playing into a tried and true strategy of lower cost engineering to help drive profit Domestically well take a plateau over declining sales any day If the US holds steady and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to execute globally thats still a prescription for profitability Profitability and the bottom line are the only two things that weve identified as catalysts for Fords stock to finally start to march upward again This reiterates what CEO Mark Fields recently said on the companys conference call Theres a lot of discussion around the market being at a peak but I really term it a plateau When you look at whats driving the market its really around replacement demand In any mature market about of the industry in any given year is driven by replacement demand Selective discounting is a tool that auto dealers use in the same way the Federal Reserve uses lowering interest rates When selectively used and not abused it can provide bursts of stimulus to sales when markets begin to cool off If abused it destroys margins This is still a tool <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>very much has at its disposal hasnt used yet and is still available We continue to believe that as operating leverage begins to take hold the narrowing losses and eventual bottomline growth from Fords international markets backed by strong domestic sales will be the catalyst that drives its shares higher Disclosure I amwe are long F MoreI
