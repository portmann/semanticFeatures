US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Plant Is A Win For PR The Country And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha A large part of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bull case is continued domestic success <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been criticized of late for outsourcing work to Mexico <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>solves the problem of increased demand and the PR issue of creating jobs by investing billion in a new US plant in Kentucky While following the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F story for the better part of the last year we have constantly laid out what our longterm thesis is for being bullish on the company This thesis consists of a strong backbone of domestic results spearheaded by the F and the new Mustang as well as coming profitability as a result of investments internationally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors have watched the stock remain in a trading range for years now with the dividend the only constant each quarter The key for the stock price moving up is going to be what type of return the company gets on its investments overseas Since the recession the company has spent significant sums of money investing in property plant and equipment in places like Europe and Asia Just as soon as several months ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>said that it was essentially doubling down on its investment in China and continuing to allocate capital towards innovating a leading smart car in the extremely populous region We have said in numerous past articles that we believe once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can show some operating leverage with its international operations in China and in other markets like South America that the companys bottom line will finally show a positive effect and the stock price will begin to move up out of the trading range that it has been in for over a year Just as important as its expansion is the companys ability to keep domestic demand fulfilled and maintain strong sales in the United States In order to do this they need to effectively manage moving the levers of incentive selling and need to maintain positive public perception in the country This brings us to our news which is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is investing billion into a brandnew Kentucky based plant to help take its F and F series and move them to aluminum models similar to the move the company has made with the F Heres a small excerpt from this press release We believe this is going to have a positive impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for several reasons The first reason is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been receiving an enormous amount of criticism from a certain presidential candidate who has been critical of them moving jobs overseas and into Mexico We understand that it is important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to maintain its made in America image for many of its consumers who seek to purchase American products Making such a sizable investment in the United States and a plant that is supposed to employ over shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is serious about its commitment to the United States We believe this move and this headline will also help out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>significantly from a public relations perspective Obviously this is also going to help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>out in the sense that it is going to make sure that there are vehicles to meet demand of its new products The hope is that the F and F will sell as well as the F did a model that continues to have significant demand and continues to impress from a sales perspective Aluminum has been one of the most hardest hit commodities over the last few months as all commodities have dropped into a bit of their own recession Aluminum pricing is near multiyear lows as you can see from the above chart This is a great time to get this initiative off the ground for the company While again we understand that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock may not break out of its current trading range until the company can put all of the pieces together and show significant profit overseas we are happy with the way that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is spending its capital by investing in itself We continue to be bullish on the automaker and think collecting the near dividend yield while waiting for the company to execute its longterm strategy remains an attractive place to allocate capital We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
