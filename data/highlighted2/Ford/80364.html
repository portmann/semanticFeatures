gross oil production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>declined monthonmonth and relative to the Q average Despite the curtailed drilling pace completions calendar in April was very active setting the stage for a solid production volume in May Halcns AFE in El Halcn has declined to million per well from million in Q Individual well results are provided and discussed Important Note This article is not an investment recommendation or research report It is not to be relied upon when making investment decisions investors should conduct their own comprehensive research Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this article Halcn Resources NYSE HK April daily gross oil production in El Halcn Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in East Texas declined from the previous month and from Q average Source Zeits Energy Analytics April The cadence and timing of well completions have been the primary drivers of Halcns production volumes in El Halcn Even though the company has reduced its drilling activity in the play to just one rig the completion calendar in April was quite busy with five new wells turned to sales This compares to an average of three wells per month during the preceding twelve months when Halcn was running rigs in the play With five new wells brought online in April Halcns May production in El Halcn will likely remain stable even if no new wells are completed in May As a reminder East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>accounts for approximately onequarter of the companys overall production volumes with the Bakken being a much more significant producing area for the company However El Halcn is important to the stocks valuation due to the assets sheer size and significant value potential Individual Well Performance In El Halcn Halcns average well performance during the latest twelve months shows a noticeable uptick relative to its earlier wells in the play Several recent wells including the Sturgeon Goanna Lucy and Glover have contributed to this performance improvement The Lucy and Glover have a good chance of taking place among the top five wells among the drilled by the company in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>so far Of note Halcn has commented that all four wells we are outperforming its Mboe type curve The following tables show performance of Halcns every individual well in the El Halcn play Shown in blue are new data points that have been added since my previous update Reviewing Halcns Type Curve In The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>My more granular analysis of Halcns recent individual well performance in El Halcn suggests that the companys average well in the play is likely to produce thousand barrels of oil in the first year on a normalized basis using certain assumptions for offline days This result is essentially in line with the data provided by Halcn in its recent presentation Halcn shows that its recent wells have produced Mboe in the first year Two factors help to reconcile the difference between my rough assessment and the companys estimate First the graph below includes natural gas production my analysis is focused solely on black oil Second Halcns sample excludes certain wells An important footnote on the slide specifies that the sample includes wells placed online since spaced a minimum of feet apart and completed with at least lbs of proppant per lateral foot Mechanically compromised wellbores excluded Source Halcn Resources May The significant number of wells that have cumed well over barrels of oil in the first year indicates that Halcns type curve may have some upside if the company manages to reduce the percentage of weak wells However at this point I hesitate to predict a material improvement while several recent wells have been impressive a greater consistency of wells that beat the type curve would be required Halcn has reported impressive and much needed improvements in its well costs at El Halcn In May the companys AFE for its operated wells at El Halcn was approximately million about lower than in the fourth quarter In addition to across the board service cost reductions the company has taken steps to bring certain service elements such as directional drilling inhouse contributing to cost savings and efficiencies Quite notable is the companys commentary that it anticipates its completed well cost to continue to decline by additional in the next few months That would bring the AFE in the million range Source Halcn Resources May Halcns cost reductions are very significant However as has been the case across the entire industry much of those reductions are cyclical in nature and may not be sustainable in the event oil prices recover enough to justify higher activity levels Halcns ability to minimize its well costs will be restrained for another few years as the company is still in lease capture mode at El Halcn and continues to drill one well per pad That means that one well has to bear the full cost for land and GG costs location preparation title opinion production facilities and gathering tieins all charged to that first well Halcn estimates that completed well cost will decline by about another million per well once it transitions to development mode sometime next year Halcn estimated that its type well in El Halcn generated IRR using type curve the current million AFE and midMay strip pricing Obviously a welllevel IRR can hardly be thought of as competitive in the context of US shale oil business The economics should become more compelling however once the company implements additional costs savings and completes its lease capture program As one can see from the following slide assuming those additional savings are achieved the play should be viable at the project level at oil prices above per barrel My broader review of drilling results in East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>indicates that Halcn remains an undisputed leader in the play in terms of its well performance to date In addition to Halcn my comparative review has included drilling results for Apache NYSE APA Clayton Williams Energy NYSE CWEI and Comstock Resources NYSE CRK While well costs completion designs and location within the play vary by operator and impact well performance it appears that Halcn is further along on the learning curve than its peers and therefore may be best positioned to opportunistically capture additional core acreage in the play at low cost in the event others retreat That being said Halcn still has some ways to go to demonstrate that it can bring its drilling returns to a compelling level in a scenario that the oil price trough proves extended For the time being the companys drilling IRRs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trail far behind its returns in the Fort Berthold area in the Bakken Overall after the first three years of evaluation drilling in the East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>one can conclude that the play has lived up to optimistic expectations and is now an established proven play The obvious disappointment is that the play has not yielded superproductive sweet spots that would be able to compete in terms of well productivity or economics with core of the core areas in the Bakken and South Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Not dissimilar to many other smaller plays drilling activity in the East Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has dropped dramatically with the decline driven mostly by Apache taking its rig count in the play from at the recent activity peak to just one rig Comstock and Clayton Williams have suspended their new drilling activity and Halcn will be running just one rig throughout the rest of the year Disclaimer
