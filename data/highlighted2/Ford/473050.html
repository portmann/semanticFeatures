as bad as the companys valuation leads on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still a cash rich company that yields and with diversification into other international geographies its arguably a safer company now than its ever been The entire auto sector was priced as if there was going to be catastrophe Valuations coming into Fords NYSE F earnings yesterday suggested that we were waiting for a large auto credit bubble to burst and they also suggested that US automakers were pushing through as much inventory through incentive selling as was possible It seems as thought the latter was definitely true but the former has yet to fully play out This leaves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a cash rich company at a valuation that we still find enticing We know these scenarios are expected because shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have been priced at around X earnings for the last year or two and the company cannot seem to get its multiple to expand even when it has good news The inverse of this the company having bad news easily drives the stock price down There seems to only be one direction that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock wants to go in and that is down While it is nice that there seems to be unanimous miserable sentiment on the sector as an investor what does this mean We wrote a small article yesterday after Fords earnings stating that we would update our view after we got to listen to the companys conference call We did get a chance to listen to the conference call and it wasnt all bad news Here are some of our favorite clips from the call Global market share declined outside of North America but share was up in the US and Canada Our automotive operating cash flow was an alltime quarterly record Europes pretax profit almost tripled from last year and North America and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit remained strong Now combined with our first quarter record we achieved record firsthalf pretax profit and operating margins for both the company and for North America Now we continue to expect another strong year and we are committed to our fullyear guidance of company pretax profit and operating margin equal to or better than last year but at the same time we now see a number of risks that the entire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>team is working hard to mitigate to achieve our guidance and well explain more as we go through the information this morning Our returns were strong as I just reviewed now in terms of risk we received a rating upgrade by Fitch Our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable for the third consecutive quarter and we achieved billion of cost performance in the first half versus our plan And in terms of rewards we distributed regular dividends of million to our shareholders Okay lets go on to Europe which as I mentioned earlier was a bright spot for us If you look at the wholesale and revenue up double digits share actually declined a little bit That was market mix The Southern European markets grew disproportionately Our share performance there is a little below the average of what it is in Europe and so that affected us Margin was which is a very very good performance and the profit that I touched on earlier And then if you look at the first half we made million in the quarter a margin of and you can see very strong growth at the top line as well and share was flat So this is a really great story Okay Lets turn now to cash flow Cash flow a very very good story for us in the quarter It was the best ever in the quarter and the half billion operating in the quarter billion in the half It was driven by the profit but also you can see that we had favorable working capital and we had favorable timing differences As you can see Europe is the first outside of US location that could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>navigate volatile quarters by contributing to profit from overseas The goal for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is to become so diversified internationally that while it is nice to have a domestic sales as a backbone the company should be able to hit the bottom line from many different geographic locations Once the company achieves this type of diversification shareholders will be far less at risk then they are now with such a concentration of profit coming from the companys North American operations While we only saw glimpses of this yesterday and admittedly the results were not as great as we thought they were going to be we had to step back and take a cold hard look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>again yesterday afternoon The company remains a cash cow The numbers really continue to be impressive for the valuation F Cash from Operations TTM data by YCharts The fact is that the results missed estimates yes But YOY the results continue to still be impressive for a company priced with a X multiple The company is a cash cow F Free Cash Flow TTM data by YCharts The fact is that the guidance was soft and there continues to be a case for there being a bubble in the automobile financing sector We are not disputing these claims But when it comes down to fundamentals it is really tough to argue that a position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a terrible idea at these levels With the company losing about of its market share yesterday shares are again now trading at about X forward estimates This is an extremely distressed valuation even for the automobile sector This valuation is predicting nothing short of a total collapse in the sector that we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>now can actually ride out with some of its international legs that it has to stand on Europe should be a talking point from yesterdays report Cash generation should be a talking point If the US auto market starts to implode that traditionally isnt going to take down other international locations by itself When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may see some weakness it may be able to capitalize on strength in other international locations We see this to be a tremendous positive and we think it is a key that will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to elude watching its bottom line suffer so much Right now the appeal of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>share is that the earnings are cash rich the dividend yield is now over and the forward outlook while below expectations is still that of a very profitable very cash generator company We are going to remain long shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and potentially short Credit Acceptance Corporation NASDAQ CACC as a hedge against the auto financial boom bubble bursting I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock
