options activity in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on Tuesday Company releases details to new Super Duty Nothing catches our eye more than bullish options activity in a company that we are long Yesterday that company was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F Yesterday we received information on the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Super Duty European car registration data for June and all the while options were buzzing ahead of the companys earnings report which is due later this month First our readers know that we believe the companys investment into its Fseries of trucks after the crash was one of the smartest investments we have seen a company make in itself The new aluminum bodied F with EcoBoost engine has revolutionized gas mileage and productivity for Americanmade trucks and it has set the standard for companies like Dodge and General Motors NYSE GM who moved to adopt some of the same technology but only after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had already proven it a success <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has focused on cultivating all aspects of its business rebirth since including brands like Lincoln which have helped propel sales in Asian locations where American luxury is sought out We learned yesterday about the new Super Duty to be released At the same time the company is reaping the benefits of investing into its F after a banner couple of years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>says the new FSeries Super Duty model will feature the most horsepower and torque of any heavyduty truck The V turbo diesel engine standard on all FSeries diesel trucks from the F to the F will boast horsepower and lbft of torque The automaker was able to boost power by strategically redistributing the weight saved from the use of aluminum <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Super Duty trucks go on sale this fall As you can see the companys bet on aluminum continues to pay dividends as even the Super Duty V turbo diesel will have unprecedented power as a result of the weight distribution change by using aluminum The continued focus on efficiency from weight loss proves that innovation made years ago and continue to pay benefits for years to come While other automakers like GM are focused on distributing capital to shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to make strategic investments in itself all over the globe in hopes that these initiatives will pay out in years to come We think that profitability in key international markets will drive Fords stock much higher in years so we support these strategic investments across the globe Also catching our eye was a bullish bet in the options market yesterday that came in to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Traders bought the weekly expiration calls contracts were bought in one shot and K contracts in total were traded during the day This was compared to total open interest of K contracts This bet signifies the bettor is looking for an almost immediate price move to the upside The company again has its earnings report later this month so we will be on watch to see if the same investor rolls out this position to expiration closer to earnings or if the company is to give us a clue as to what the quarter looked like early We also got some data from Europe yesterday European car registrations which is a number that we continually watch came in a little low for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with the automaker down for the month We have noticed with metrics like car registrations and yearoveryear sales in international locations that we do get a blip on the radar here or there and a month occasionally where we do not have growth We believe this is simply one of those aberrations and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will continue to grow moving forward As you can see from the bottom of the most recent ACEA report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>registrations remain up on the year As always with data that is less than favorable well be on watch for next month to see if a pattern starts to develop Usually these spikes lower have a tendency to resolve themselves as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to show growth in its operating results I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it
