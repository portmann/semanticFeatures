Welcome to the Marathon Oil Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call My name is Hilda and I will be your operator for todays call At this time all participants are in a listenonly mode Later we will conduct a questionandanswer session Please note that this conference is being recorded Thanks Hilda and good morning to everyone Welcome to Marathon Oils second quarter earnings call Joining me this morning are Lee Tillman President and CEO JR Sult Executive Vice President and CFO Lance Robertson Vice President Resource Plays and Mitch Little Vice President Conventional As a reminder todays call may contain forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements Please read our disclosures in our earnings release and in our SEC filings for a discussion of these items Reconciliations of any nonGAAP financial measures we discuss can be found in the quarterly information package on our website Thank you Zach and good morning to everyone Ill make a few brief comments and open the call for questions Our second quarter headlines strong well results continued cost reductions successful portfolio management Our Oklahoma asset team delivered two outstanding STACK Meramec wells with oil cuts above while continuing to balance leasehold demands with acreage delineation This same team also closed our PayRock acquisition on Monday just six weeks after announcing the deal and are rapidly integrating that asset into our Oklahoma business The team actually had a countdown calendar in the office as they marched toward the accelerated close date Needless to say they are excited and their focused efforts will ensure no loss of momentum We had an exceptional quarter in the Bakken delivering a record well on our West Myrmidon acreage through a combination of great reservoir quality and enhanced completion designs The Bakken asset team has truly embraced this time of lower activity to prepare for whats next Theyve dropped their production costs materially and upped their game on well returns to place West Myrmidon in the mix for capital allocation The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continued seeing uplift from tighter stage spacing while feeling the effects of a planned stepdown in activity and challenging base production declines And despite their move to higher intensity completions their completed well costs are down significantly yearoveryear Winning the production cost battle is hard work and typically measured in numerous but smaller victories Rest assured that cost management remains front and center with all of our asset teams North America EP production costs are down almost from a year ago And weve dropped their full year guidance by per oil equivalent barrel Weve also reduced unit production expense guidance for International by per oil equivalent barrel Through a combination of capital discipline and efficiency gains across all of our businesses well deliver a capital program thats million below our original budget all while funding the incremental activity associated with our STACK acquisition including the additional rig well add there this quarter Oklahoma is getting busy With the acquisition we will be doubling our activity in the STACK to four rigs in total Not to be outdone by North Americas success in our International business we achieved first gas from the B compression project in EG in July on schedule and within budget The project is fulfilling its mission to extend the Alba fields production plateau by two years and the assets life out beyond As our capital investment in the compression project falls away EG will contribute significant free cash flow that we can reinvest in our deep inventory of highreturn opportunities here in the US resource plays On the portfolio management side our noncore asset sales program has now achieved over billion yeartodate And though we exceeded our initial target we arent done Expect noncore asset sales to be ongoing as we continue optimizing our capital allocation to the lowestcost highestmargin opportunities On the other side of portfolio management the net acres we acquired in the STACK Meramec oil window ticks all the boxes quality scale value and with further upside not assumed in the purchase price Through this volatile and uncertain commodity price environment weve been resolute in executing against our playbook strengthening our balance sheet resetting our cost structure simplifying our portfolio all with the goal of profitable growth within cash flows when sustainably higher prices give us the confidence to ramp activity With that Ill hand it back to Zach to begin the QA Good morning a lot of excitement on the STACK You spoke in the prepared remarks about resuming sequential growth at low to mid s so maybe just some opening remarks about that statement Yeah good morning Ed Were still committed to that Ed As we look out at the macro today though were sitting at today but as we look out to and see that more constructive pricing we feel very confident in our ability to begin that growth sequentially again and do it within cash flows in that low to mids kind of price range A lot of that will also hinge on our ability to ensure that we have operational momentum coming out of as well And so maybe some color on the rig activity that would be embedded in that I mean obviously we can do our own forecast but just interested in your color on rig ramps and buying Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>STACK Bakken Yeah absolutely Ed Weve talked about nominally a billion program in that would get us back on that sequential growth track within the resource plays And within that the way I would ask you to think about it is is embedded basically an almost the doubling of the rig count from where we are today to when we would exit in And that would support both that capital program as well as that volumes profile All right Okay If I could sneak one final one debt repurchases or blending and extending maturities any thoughts there Other companies are doing the same thing Hey Ed This is JR You know as weve talked I think on previous calls even though were focused here on ultimately being able to get that capital program up to a level to where we can resume the growth path the balance sheet is still going to be important I think weve got some maturities coming up here in October of and again in March of Sitting here today it would appear to be the right allocation of capital might be just to wait to be able to pay off those maturities when theyre due And thats one reason why I think were maintaining the cash balance that we are today to give us that option But well continue to look at other opportunities to be able to reduce overall gross debt But right now I think were leaning toward just repaying those maturities when theyre due So guys as things post your acquisition in the STACK obviously theres a lot of tension going on there Can you just give us some idea as to how you would prioritize incremental rig additions in the event that the commodity does continue to recover next year Yeah Yeah Doug Good morning Oklahoma STACK is going to be our absolute first priority Doug Once weve met our leasehold requirements and our strategic objectives in the STACK then were going to look at optimizing across the remaining basins to maximize economic return I think the good news there for us is that when we look at that multibasin optimization weve got a very competitive and diverse Tier inventory that really now features everything from Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>oil and condensate to Bakken West Myrmidon to SCOOP So its a great portfolio but that first incremental capital is absolutely going to Oklahoma STACK In fact as we stated in our released material last evening well be looking to add that second rig into the STACK acquisition acreage later in the third quarter bringing us to a total of four rigs in Oklahoma As a followup obviously the STACKs a fairly meaningful change in your inventory where youve got how would you characterize your comfort level or your satisfaction I guess is a better way of putting it with your current acreage position up there because obviously relative to some of your other peers you still have a relatively a small footprint Do you see other additions in the future Or whats the overall characterization of availability of acreage And Ill leave it there Thanks Yep Well thank you Yeah Doug I certainly wouldnt Im very happy with our footprint in the STACK as well as the SCOOP as certainly with the bolton of the STACK acquisition the PayRock acquisition it enhanced our position materially in the STACK But as I look across it from a overall resource standpoint and you think about the fact that we now have in excess of about billion P resource in the STACK as well as another billion or so in the SCOOP that is a very very material position going forward in Oklahoma And at just over net surface acres in the STACK we feel very good about our position We would never forego accretive small bolton positions or greenfield leasing but were quite pleased with where we stand right now in Oklahoma Thanks Good morning gentlemen Maybe with the PayRock deal closed can you talk a little bit plans to integrate these assets I mean I guess youve talked about rig addition there but generally how you characterize that acreage relative to your legacy acreage and potential improvements or any changes operationally that you might look to make on things like lateral length or completions or such versus what youve done on your acreage Yeah Let me maybe kick that one off and then Ill turn it over to Lance to maybe provide a bit more color But we just closed on the STACK acquisition on Monday and took over operations after lunch on Monday so integration is still a work in progress though the team is well advanced As you mentioned were going to be putting a second rig to work there The two rigs are going to be initially focused on protecting that valuable leasehold but also looking toward continuing strategic Ill say delineation around the play as well But in terms of economics and where those wells fall in our set of opportunities theres no doubt that the STACK oil opportunities compete at the very top of our Tier inventory And thats even been confirmed yet again with the three additional wells that have been brought to sales within the acquisition between up to close And so maybe Ill just let Lance fill in a few more details on just how the integration is going Sure Thanks Lee We took over the operations Monday Its been very seamless to date Obviously we look at the acquired acres Theyre on the oil bias side We think it balances the portfolio across the breadth of the STACK basin very nicely for us Were going to have the ongoing obligations there to defend the lease position And our heritage Marathon acreage in STACK as well is ongoing in the acquired acres We do have a bit of excess capacity there I think one of the things that you had recognized in our activities to date so for example in the results we reported this quarter weve been transitioning to XL wells in our overpressured area to look at the value there Those well results have been very compelling and were very excited about those We also purchased this acquisition on the oil bias side based on the fact that they had among the very best productivity on a lateraladjusted foot basis with very low capital costs which together create a great value opportunity for us And so were going to continue on that basis But I think we also recognize the opportunity with about half the acres in the acquired package suitable for XL that were going to move to also test the XL in that area to see what the best longterm result for Marathon is How much of your acreage across the entire not just the acquired acreage but across your entire STACK portfolio now is conducive to long laterals I think in general about half of thats conducive to long laterals perhaps a bit more as we continue to consolidate and unitize in there But thats where wed stand today Im just trying to understand the financial and operational framework youve set out here for So I had a followup there But I believe you mentioned the early view is that about billion in spending or so next year would be sufficient to return the company to sequential growth assuming oil in the mid to low s I believe you also mentioned the desire to live within cash flow So is billion plus your dividend about the type of cash flow you expect to generate next year in a low to mid world Or are you incorporating some asset sales proceeds into your forecast to support that as well Yeah Guy thanks for the followup question First of all I want to be very clear the billion Im talking about Guy is for the resource play element only That would not include other capital requirements and the conventional elements of our business although we would expect similar to what we did this year that the bulk of our capital investment in will in fact be allocated to the resource plays But in that low to mid window we would absolutely expect to cover that capital demand within operating cash flows Does not mean that were not still pursuing noncore asset divestitures but were certainly not saying were going to be reliant upon those They give us optionality but we dont feel that we need to rely on those if were in that price band Great thats very helpful And then my followup is understanding is something of a transitional year for you during which you attempt to return the company back to sequential growth but once you get a better commodity price environment youve improved the well results the operational performance I think significantly Youve also made meaningful improvements to the portfolio and your opportunity set When the time comes what type of growth rate do you think Marathon is poised to fundamentally deliver longer term Just trying to understand that framework for longer term growth Yeah no absolutely I think first and foremost you said it well weve got this great opportunity set that very much competes for capital and the price band A lot of that I would say growth aspiration though will be highly dependent upon the pricing that we see Being a very oil levered company of course we have a very strong response in operating cash flows as we see improvement to the oil price So to the extent that we need to modulate between growth as well as generating free cash flows were prepared to do that But the potential that weve got in the three resource plays definitely provides us an avenue for moving to a very competitive growth metric in the future Without getting into specifics there we have that potential My first question your Meramec your legacy wells are performing better than your type curve How large of a well sample of production history do you need to raise your resource estimate I guess the same question applies to Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with the stage spacing and Bakken wells with larger completion I know the last time you lifted your resource estimate was September How are you guys thinking about that Sure Evan This is Lance So Ill start kind of in the order you asked them perhaps but overall its clearly early in the STACK still I mean were delineating the whole acreage us and peers Those well results we reported this quarter the Irven John and the Olive June are excellent well results Theyre XL wells Theyre performing above that type curve Theyre also only about days or days into their total production So I think were going to need to let those run a while I think were excited that theyre above that curve and so theres certainly an opportunity for resource upgrade Well also have as you might recall a number of other XL wells in the third quarter and fourth quarter in that same Blaine County area from our heritage acreage well get to talk about So when we get the breadth of those and theyve matured a bit would be a bit more appropriate time for that Turning to the Bakken I think the well results we reported there are really remarkable this quarter All off of the same pad among the three best wells put in the basin in the last three years That really demonstrates what technology application the right landings on the right combination is And we have inventory like that Similarly wed like to see those mature But there are other wells in that area that also perform well which is why we were aggressive in that area So I think we need to let those mature But Id just echo your point Theres clearly opportunity for a resource upgrade there driven by that Lastly Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>We continue to be really pleased with the results of tighter stage spacing particularly in the oil areas in the Upper and Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Responding very well Weve got a breadth of wells there now almost wells in that group So its maturing which gives us more confidence And I think we recognize therell be a need to do a resource update in the not too distant future Okay Thats helpful If I could follow up in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I know you upspaced your Austin Chalk assumptions to acre spacing Could you walk us through what drove that change And is that because you were getting well interference at the acre spacing I guess are you planning on draining the Austin Chalk with your Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>laterals Yes Evan So I think we went last year from unconstrained Austin Chalk very quickly to acre spacing in the Austin Chalk to try to find the bounds of productivity of that reservoir I think what weve discovered over the last few quarters is that at acre spacing when weve had groups really our first groups of Austin Chalk wells together that are constrained that the reservoir quality is very high Its got a lot of natural fracturing which we suspected but werent certain of And those wells are communicating laterally a bit and that overall were going to get the best capital efficiency in the Austin Chalk at wider spacing In that same timeframe weve also been testing the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>really doubled the amount of our delineated acreage over that time in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and recognized that we could backfill some of those Austin Chalk locations with Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but both at wider spacing They just interact better Ultimately were looking for the highest recovery of hydrocarbon out of that unit at the lowest capital input So were trying to optimize the returns at the drilling unit level Is there a reasonable oil price in which youd go back to the acre downspacing Or how does that interplay work Sure I think you have to take a view on price any of this and I would reflect that we started this density testing at north of a barrel Probably looks different at So the higher commodity price I think the more youd want to look at that ultimate density because that just drives the returns from that unit We think where we are today evolving making these adjustments is appropriate for todays commodity market I wanted to follow up on the CapEx billion I think you clarified on the earlier question that this is for the key resource areas and just wanted to kind of put that into context to make sure the base is right Is this essentially off of about a million spent for those resource plays in the first half of the year And then can you talk about the trajectory for how youre thinking about the rest of the company I think if we look at least on a cash flow statement type perspective you spent about million overall for the company in the first half Yeah Certainly in the first half of the year Brian there was a bit of a bias because we had a couple of longcycle projects that were running their course that are now of course both started up which are the EG compression project as well as the nonoperated Gunflint project So there was probably a bit more bias to the conventional portfolio in the first half of the year As we look forward to the second half of the year thats going to largely be paced by the resource plays themselves and that will really set the Ill say kind of that exit velocity that we achieve from a capital program standpoint as we move out of the year We do anticipate based on the activity weve described including the additional rig in Oklahoma as well as some additional completion work in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that we will exit the fourth quarter with some pretty strong momentum going into To your point I guess on the rest of the portfolio the looking forward to you should expect us to continue to minimize the capital allocation to the conventional program very similar to what we endeavoured to do this cycle in Great Thanks And then as a little bit of a followup from more of a strategic perspective which is given your I think interest in the return that youre seeing from the resource play portfolio how strategically are you thinking about the assets elsewhere Do you anticipate additional asset sales or as you perhaps just described minimal levels of capital investment try to use these assets for the free cash flow to offset potential outspending going on at the resource plays Yeah Brian our conventional business is absolutely geared toward generating free cash flow that can then be redeployed Thats the model thats what Mitch drives the team toward I will look at some selective investments there Great example is the EG compression project albeit a long cycle project its very accretive its delivering very strong economics and performance in the portfolio and its simply going to add to the ability of Equatorial Guinea to add to our cash flows I think a separate question though is more of the noncore asset question We continue to scrutinize our portfolio and ensure that it is fully optimized As I said in my opening remarks weve achieved billion yeartodate of noncore asset divestitures but we believe there is more work to be done there We dont think theyll be to the scale of say a Wyoming but we still believe theres some good solid portfolio work particularly here in North America that we continue to drive And again its all focused on that simplification and concentration of the portfolio toward the highest riskadjusted returns Good morning A high level question if I could I assume that youre basically planning the company at about a outlook How would things change if we were to start assuming or in your mind And I know youve been a little bit reluctant probably quite rightly to commit to levels of prices at which youd start to think about faster growth and stuff but Im trying to pin you down on it Thanks Paul I appreciate your transparency Ill maybe take those two bookends that you just talked about the and the Obviously I think at similar to what weve experienced this year wed be looking to protect our balance sheet to ensure that though we continue to drive those leasehold and strategic objectives in the portfolio and then look with great discipline at some of those discretionary economic opportunities within the portfolio Wed still be bearing down on cost wed still be bearing down on noncore asset sales So those would be the behaviors and the objectives if we saw an environment moving into that is more in the ph handle range I think conversely if we see more constructive pricing moving into at that as weve talked about a move in pricing for us is a big impact on our operating cash flows And wed be looking to redeploy those pretty strongly back here into the US resource place to not only get back on sequential growth but to get on that growth quite strongly if we saw that level of price support Weve protected the organization in such a way that we have the capacity to move to much higher activity levels And if we saw that wed move toward that as quickly as we could Thats interesting So on the dividend is that still something that you aspire to return to be relatively a high dividend payer Or do you see yourself shifting as to a more of a unconventional growth story I think as you look at our portfolio Paul you look at our business model we have made the shift We made the shift in the dividend last year Of course it was helpful from an operating cash flow standpoint but it was also much more consistent with where we were headed in this very shortcycle investment resourceplayintensive business that were in And we think from a competitive standpoint given our opportunity outlook for growth and reinvestment thats the right place for us to place our shareholder money Great Thanks And if I could just try one to Lance Lance weve seen something very interesting here which is that obviously theres been a significant improvement in cost performance really across the industry at lower prices But whats also interesting is I guess the technical improvements are still being achieved even though activity is so much lower If we did go back to higher prices do you think technical improvements would accelerate or would they actually deteriorate because wed be going into presumably into less high quality acreage Yeah Paul I think thats an insightful question I think what we would focus on at todays activity which we are or at higher activity in the future would be in our Tier inventory As weve taken those technical advances and weve lifted up the returns of some of our portfolio we have such a breadth of it now that were going to focus within that Tier first Well take a portion of our activity to try to test some Tier and lift it up to meet that thing We need to stay disciplined in any price environment to make sure were bringing our best opportunities forward but also taking the view that were going to bet on technology were going to bet on the innovation and the creativity of our people to keep bringing our portfolio up accretively over that time Yeah Could I just ask a followup You said that youve retained is it that you havent restructured people Or how have you retained your ability that both of you mentioned Yeah Sure As we spun down our activity we recognized that we have a cadre of early career talented people And we dont necessarily have the direct activity to put them into So weve taken them out to special projects across the company Theyre out doing site supervision work on rigs and frac crews production supervisors So were retaining them in very valuable functions maturing their leadership and their technical skills and their business acumen And then as we grow activity we can recall them into other petrotechnicalfocused roles And theyre going to be even better prepared to take those on So that early activity ramp those people are here for us Yeah Hey guys Maybe I can ask you to force rank your Bakken and Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>opportunities So youve been very clear SCOOP and STACK will be the first call on capital Which one goes second Yeah This is Lee Just for clarity At the top of our batting order is going to be STACK oil That clearly has the superior returns whether we look at a environment or even a environment I think then the lead table gets pretty interesting Because of all the good work the asset teams have been doing we actually have more diversity within our tier one inventory that will compete for capital But the ones that we would see really rising to the top are were going to continue to see Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>high GOR oil Were going to continue to see Bakken West Myrmidon specifically come in to the mix And then also the SCOOP condensate area is going to be a strong performer which will also maybe amplified in the event that we see stronger gas support as well So thats really the lead table as we see it today Okay Thats helpful Then just a point of clarification on the small drop in your fullyear production guidance is that purely the net effect of taking out Wyoming and putting in the new STACK acreage Thats an element of it But there is also an element of course of just base decline and other elements for our business specifically Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which weve already talked about Yeah Good morning I was wondering if you could give us your outlook or expectations for how the US resource play production could trend in the back half of the year And secondly is there going to be some more knockon effect from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>completions the high density completions you highlighted in in the update Yeah Ill take maybe the question around the back half of the year on resource plays And then maybe pitch it over to Lance to take on if theres any knockon effect of the completion discussion I think youve seen the releases that have come out over the last few days Theres clearly more optimism in the market particularly I think as you stretch into I think the sector in general is struggling with striking the correct balance between wanting to be prepared if they get a strong and sustainable price signal versus getting too far ahead of their headlights and losing I think the discipline that has been required during this downturn So speaking from a Marathon Oil perspective we do expect to build some momentum going in to the fourth quarter which we thing would position us quite favorably in the event we do see more constructive pricing And I would say that theres probably many others within our space that are looking to do the same There of course will always be an element that may have to be more in a balance sheet repair mode as opposed to being on their front foot and looking to drive toward incremental activity But I dont see a dramatic adjustment just because the declines have been pretty challenging this year And its going to be hard of course to offset that completely with lateyear activity And maybe Lance if you want to chime in on just the question around the knockon and the completion effects Sure So specifically focusing on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I think as Lee referenced our guidance takes into account our view on all that So its there in it We have made some adjustments to the development plan Youll see those reflected in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>second half of the year Shift to focus ph on more twothirds of that activity is in the high GOR oil areas which are our highest value type curves at current pricing And we have widened out that Austin Chalk from acre to acre spacing to mitigate those influences And the three and four zone high density pads are really were foregoing those for the rest of this year And so that will help mitigate those concerns Otherwise weve put into our guidance what we think the base decline from s going to look like Great And my followup Just Lee in terms of your comments of earlier in the call about doubling maybe the rig count between now and yearend in order to get to that lets call it flattish with some growth in the US resource plays Would you anticipate a stairstep kind of linear kind of move in activity over that time period Yeah There will certainly be a ramp associated with that I mean I mean that would not be a step change if you will There would be a ramp across the year So I was trying to just kind of project out kind of where we thought we might exit out of based on that nominal billion type investment But there will absolutely be a ramp And I think too you have to bear in mind that the rigs today are doing a lot more than the rigs did a year ago And so we absolutely are taking advantage of that efficiency In fact in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>weve actually gone down a rig since second quarter from five to four rigs recognizing just the sheer efficiency of our drilling operations and the ability of our teams to continue to set a very strong pace on the drilling side of the business We have no further questions at this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr Lee Tillman for closing remarks Yeah Well I would just like to thank everyone on the call for their questions and certainly their interest in Marathon Oil Its been a busy and productive quarter for the company I think the headlines speak for themselves I wont go back through those But we are preparing for that sustainable price environment where we can profitably grow our business within cash flows In we can get our business back to sequential growth and live within our means with WTI in the low to mids And as Ive stated during the call we have the potential for even higher growth at higher pricing with an industryleading leverage to oil Thank you ladies and gentlemen This concludes todays conference We thank you for participating You may now disconnect Copyright policy All
