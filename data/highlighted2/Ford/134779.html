class performance yield and more check out the ETF Hub ETF Hub After reporting earnings Fords stock price has not exactly broken out from current levels as it is still down over the last year The performance in North America carried the company but profits should only improve during the second half of the year domestically and internationally The companys longterm management looks more than competent to carry out the breakout they have predicted during the second half of the year I Know First wrote a bullish argument for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F last week on Seeking Alpha arguing that the runup to the earnings report was a great time to buy the stock Much of the fundamental analysis which pointed to the stock being undervalued proved to be true during the earnings report and the companys overall performance was quite good In spite of that the stock price has not been able to break out from the level like it should Even after reporting its best quarterly profit since with better performance coming in the next couple of years the stock price is remaining stagnant While pessimistic investors might point to the irrational trading of the stock patient longterm investors can take advantage The company has successfully made it through a transition during the first half of the year and a successful second half of the year is coming Much if not almost all of the success during the second quarter came from North America where the company posted its best ever margins at over Demand for the retooled F and Sport Utility Vehicles helped the company earn billion in net profits during the most recent quarter a increase from the same quarter a year ago The performance was boosted by some external factors as more customers wanted larger more expensive vehicles due to low oil prices These external factors should continue into the second half of the year as any recovery in oil prices is expected to be slow and gradual The performance of these vehicles especially the companys trucks should actually improve during the second half of the year The first half was always expected to be a transition period as the company retooled its factories for the new aluminum bodied trucks The manufacturing turnover was completed during the first quarter but sales were still lower compared to the year ago period as production was lower during the first couple of months With production now at full speed sales should improve during the second half of the year The truck shortage during the second quarter was offset by higher transaction prices as customers are going for higher end models The stock price took a hit in the beginning of July based off of reports that the company was offering huge price deductions for the new trucks Speculation that demand was not as high as expected were clearly off base as the company reported that average transaction prices were at all time highs and price deductions were lower than they were last year Further these vehicles also spent less time on the lot than other vehicles in the segment showing that there is still more demand and upside for these vehicles to contribute to profits during the second half of the year Indeed with the companys performance during the second quarter in North America so impressive it is almost baffling that the stock price has not traded up more than the roughly gain since earnings It is possible that investors are worried that external factors are playing a larger part than the companys actual performance and there are still concerns in other markets But this strong performance in North America came a quarter earlier than the company promised and guidance for the region is being pushed higher Performance will need to improve to make up for struggles internationally especially South America but there is reason to be optimistic about Europe and Asia <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been struggling in Europe for some time now but that trend is expected to turn around during the second half of the year The strong dollar is negatively affecting the profitability in the market Even so the company increased sales in the region as a whole by during the first half of the year with higher industry sales in European countries The improved performance in Europe is also building up recently and even though sales in the region are usually weaker during the second half of the year that might not be the case this year Sales in June increased in June compared to the same month a year ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has already opened one hundred FordStores across Europe with another hundred modern stores to open by the end of the year With more stores sales of popular models should increase This is true of models like the Mondeo and Fiesta the latter of which was named the most popular supermini in the market for the first half of The second most popular vehicle in the market overall this shows that Fords move to recalibrate efforts in the region are paying off and having already come close to breaking even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will start to post profits there during the second half of the year as the company has long projected Concerning China the big news coming from the earnings call was that management at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was lowering its guidance for the rest of the year This is not as big of a deal as it initially seems for the longterm and I will explain that in a minute In the nearterm this market still showed improvement and reasons to believe that performance will exceed expectations during the second half of the year While the overall sales in China are expected to slow down it still remains the biggest market in the world one in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expanding its market share And while sales slow in the major cities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>believes it can continue to grow share by targeting smaller cities or socalled Tier to Tier cities These dont have the same restrictions on new cars as some of the larger cities and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is focusing much of its efforts on these smaller markets with new dealerships Clearly there is enough to be excited about in the shortterm to push the stock price higher Even more exciting for longterm investors should be how the companys strategy adopted in the One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>plan is clearly coming to fruition The first half of the year was expected to set up the company for a breakout in the second half and it has overachieved on these expectations The restructuring to operate profitably has achieved its goal with profits improving everywhere except for in South America Even in this market where the automotive industry as a whole is facing huge resistance the companys local team there is managing to keep losses at a respectable level with high pricing until the market recovers This is going to take time unlike in China where the current projection for a fall in demand during the second half of the year should only be temporary Management at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects sales to increase to million vehicles within the next five years Even with the dip in the industry during the previous quarter the company was able to increase operating profit by recording million in profit The company has successfully been able to adjust production in the market due to falling demand and it will be ready to address growing demand in the future Even more exciting for investors in the longterm should be the managements competency As such a large company with a respectable dividend yield still at investors can take advantage of the income from this company that is ready to take advantage of the legwork of its strategy Mark Fields the companys CEO talked about thinking as a startup in the changing auto industry as the company is exploring the future of the auto industry in big markets with things like car sharing and other ways for people to get around With experiments currently going on exploring everything from autonomous cars to car sharing to connected cars the company is looking forward to a changing environment instead of focusing on its laurels something that put the company in danger roughly years ago As the article published last week previewing the earnings report predicted the earnings report beat expectations and laid the groundwork for a breakout in the stock That hasnt quite happened yet and the stock continues to trade in the low dollar range something hard to justify with its prospects for the second half of the year when profits should only keep improving Even more importantly than nearterm prices this report shows that the company has an excellent strategy and is set up great for the next five years With the current PE ratio still near and the high dividend yield this is a solid investment choice that longterm investors can hold on to for a long long time I Know First is bullish on this company over the longterm believing the stock price still has plenty of upside during the next year and beyond Source Add To <span
