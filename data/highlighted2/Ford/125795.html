style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems to be losing momentum at the top of the US light truck pyramid as its rivals are closing in Investors might be thinking that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is offering discounts in order to extend its lead over GM but there is more to the story that we need to know Fords discount offering has been blown out of proportion as its promotional spending is way lower than rivals while the Fs average transaction price has increased robustly Fords low truck sales are due to supply constraints but the F is now turning up twice as fast on dealer lots as compared to other halfton pickup trucks At first it might appear that Fords NYSE F pickup trucks are struggling This is evident from the fact that the company is offering at least in discounts to customers on the flagship F pickup truck Now this doesnt come as a surprise since Fords Fseries of pickup trucks are losing momentum at the top of the US pickup truck market helping General Motors NYSE GM make a comeback of sorts But is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>really struggling in the pickup segment Lets find out Fords FSeries has a long history of rivalry with Chevrolets Silverado pickup utility truck But Chevy is closing the gap with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the pickup truck market which is bad news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors as this vehicle category accounts for nearly of total light vehicles sold in the US by volume The FSeries accounts for about of the Light Truck sales in the US More importantly for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>it accounts for nearly of the companys sales volume and of its total light truck sales as shown in the following charts This indicates that the FSeries pickup is an important product for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>However this year the Fseries has brought disappointment for the Blue Oval Its sales have been lower than last year on an yearoveryear basis for the last months As a result sales of this product line have dropped over the first half of as compared to the same period last year In comparison sales of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup have climbed during the same period outpacing the overall pickup truck markets growth of The following chart shows that weakness has crept into Fords Fseries this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems to be the only one thats losing ground in the pickup truck segment In comparison its nearest rivals are reporting steady growth and cutting Fords lead in the segment In this segment Chevrolet is the closest rival of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Chevys Silverado has found a total of buyers this year to date At number comes Fiat Chryslers RAM truck followed by the GMC Sierra The key thing to note here is that the sales of its nearest three rivals has increased while Fords pickup segment is in the negative this year as shown below Well at first the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is offering huge discounts to move its Fseries trucks coupled with declining sales of the product line in indicates there is trouble However a key thing to note in the above table is the huge gap between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and rest of the players indicating that the company will keep its place at the top of the ladder As far as the sales drop so far this year is concerned it is not a result of declining demand Instead the loss of sales of the FSeries this year is largely attributed to the tight inventory caused by the conversion of its two plants to build the allnew F trucks with an aluminum body The company estimated that both the factories were down for about weeks causing a loss of units of production This stopped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>from supplying enough Fs to match actual demand which helped its rivals gain some ground Thus investors the low sales figure in the first half for the Fseries trucks doesnt reflect the true picture Looking ahead it is likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will gain its lost momentum once again as the conversion of its plants is complete Fords factories are back to speed and the company should have full inventories of its new trucks soon In fact in its June sales report the company stated that the allnew F is turning up twice as fast on dealer lots as compared to the industry average for halfton pickup trucks Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is aggressively building the stock of its F at dealer lots in order to satisfy increased demand Also the FSeries average transaction price has reached an alltime record of per truck up from last June This means that as more FSeries pickup trucks hit dealer lots and sales increase <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will see an increase in its margin performance as well Moreover there is another story behind Fords latest discount and investors should not read too much into this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is offering promotional discounts up to on certain higher versions of the new F to make up for the sales lost in the first half of the year and appease customers But the overall incentive provided to customers is down from last year as the truck is selling at the highest transaction price in the segment Thus in effect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is spending less in terms of incentives as compared to last year which is why investors shouldnt be making a big deal out of this Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has cut of its spending on marketing promotions in the first half of Fords first half average promotional spending was just while that of General Motors was and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NYSE FCAU was Despite this lower spending demand for the F has increased through the period under consideration The problem was entirely on the supply side In a tight supply situation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gave first priority to its most profitable customers retail buyers who look for loaded trucks Instead it kept the commercial fleet buyers waiting This gave General Motors a big opportunity to tap into the void left by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>As a result GM delivered more vehicles to commercialfleet customers in the first half of and its deliveries of fullsize pickups to governmentfleet customers more than doubled last month versus a year ago Contractors mining companies oilfield services companies and cable companies are the major commercial fleet customers who buy most of their pickups from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was not supplying the entire share went to GM Thus it is not surprising that the gap between the two narrowed last quarter But as Fords production is back to speed the gap should start increasing once again The transition from a steelbodied version to aluminum has cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>market share But going forward into the second half <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects its volumes as well as market share to grow on the back of strong demand and a superior product For instance the aluminum bodied F is pounds lighter with the fuel economy increasing by Thus driven by a better product and improving production <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should be able to improve the performance in its pickup segment going forward Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Dont Worry About The F Discount Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
