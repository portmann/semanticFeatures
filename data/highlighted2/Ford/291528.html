other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>declares a per share special dividend for Q This is alongside the regular per share quarterly dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is now approaching the dividend yield level With robust earnings and free cash flow Fords dividend appears to be well covered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F did something unexpected with its dividend earlier this week when it announced its initial guidance Rather than increasing the dividend like it has done every year since restarting dividends in the automaker declared a special onetime supplemental dividend of billion or per share This is in addition to the regular per share quarterly dividend In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shareholders will be getting dividends of per share during Q and a total of per share in dividends for the year assuming no dividend growth Does the special dividend mean no dividend growth for While many investors were expecting an increase to Fords quarterly dividend the special dividend more or less serves the same function The dividend per share will be higher by in versus to While the effective yield on the common stock is boosted from to As for Fords rationale the company may not want to commit to a higher dividend payment for beyond While the outlook for the year is strong as will be discussed below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may be simply hedging its bets In addition there is also the possibility that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may want to shift its cash flow from dividends to share buybacks The share price is trading at its lowest level since early This is despite growing earnings considerably It makes a ton of sense to focus cash on repurchasing the undervalued stock rather than dividends as this will serve to lower the float and further increase Fords earnings power <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had an excellent while is looking to be just as good From the press release Looking forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects to sustain its strong financial performance in with automotive revenue equal to or higher than automotive operating margin equal to or higher than and strong automotive operatingrelated cash flow The company expects its pretax profit excluding special items to be equal to or higher than and its operating earnings per share to be about equal to or higher than In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking at either flat or low earnings growth in versus There may be a bit of sandbagging going on here as consensus analyst estimates has EPS growing at a clip to versus in Keep in mind that EPS is up a massive from levels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is trading at a discount to peers Nevertheless even a year without growth would still make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a deeply undervalued stock For example looking at cash flow TTM free cash flow is billion up from prior year levels On a per share basis free cash flow has grown to versus last year This puts Fords price to FCF ratio at an extremely low x When factoring in debt the EV to FCF multiple rises to x These are extremely low multiples For example General Motors NYSE GM trades at a x price to FCF multiple and a x EV to FCF multiple and higher compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fords dividend is well covered by earnings and free cash flow While a yield usually implies some elevated risk in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>it appears to be well covered by free cash flow The regular quarterly dividend represents just of TTM free cash flow when adding the special dividend As for earnings the dividend payout ratio is a modest of EPS and of estimated EPS and when adding the special dividend Fords stock has had a rough start to down YTD Though this decline could represent a buying opportunity for longterm focused investors As noted above the company has not been this cheap since In addition the dividend yield is very well covered Though there is quite a bit of risk <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a high debt load longterm debt was at over billion as of Q The vast majority is from Fords financial services side only billion of this was automotive debt Nevertheless the leverage remains very high at over x which in my opinion makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a tad too risky for my taste
