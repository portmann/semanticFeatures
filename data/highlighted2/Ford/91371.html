NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM have seen their stock prices decline over the past year despite some strong economic tailwinds that have boosted their operating results Still investors dont seem convinced It seems investors are worried that the low gas prices and low interest rates that have helped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM are about to vanish I would counter that the recovery in the housing and labor markets are far more important indicators of Fords and GMs future results On these fronts things look very good Dividend investors can use their declining stock prices as opportunities to pick up dividend yields from these wellrun automakers This seems like a great time to be an automaker Gas prices are low thanks to oil in the United States The price of oil is down by about since reaching nearly per barrel at the peak last year Furthermore credit remains very easy as interest rates continue to sit near historic lows Both of these factors heavily incentivize car buying and the major US automakers are reaping the benefits As a result conditions are ripe for rising car sales and that has indeed happened In fact US auto sales soared in May Last month US auto sales hit million units at a seasonallyadjusted annualized rate This represents the highest rate since summer But apparently someone forgot to tell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM investors because both stocks are performing poorly Over the past year shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are down while GM is flat Investors arent giving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM much credit for everything thats going well right now But heres why this pervasive negativity may actually be a great buying opportunity Despite their poor stock price performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM are doing very well from a fundamental perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the maker of the F pickup the most popular vehicle in the United States In May <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw record sales results across several models The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Edge had its best May ever with sales up The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang had its best May and yeartodate results since Retail sales of Lincoln vehicles rose Meanwhile GMs sales rose last month and the company had its best May performance since Pickup trucks and crossovers were especially good sellers for the company Chevy pickup sales jumped while Silverado deliveries rose Still the market is brushing off their excellent results due mostly to fears that the good times are about to come to a screeching halt Indeed its reasonable to assume economic conditions wont be quite this favorable moving forward Its unlikely gas will stay at extremely low levels forever and oil has already bounced about off its lows Separately its widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year possibly in September Rising rates will make the cost of borrowing more expensive which will conceivably put a dent in auto sales But its worth noting that low gas prices arent typically the biggest driver of car sales I view the health of the housing and labor markets as far more important indicators of whether consumers can and will purchase automobiles On those fronts Im not overly concerned The housing market is in recovery and the US is adding jobs Jobless claims fell last week and initial claims are near year lows Moreover the US added jobs last month with another in upward revisions to March and April job growth Plus average hourly worker earnings rose eight cents last month I believe these factors are atop the list of consumer concerns before buying a new car while gas prices and interest rates are much further down in the pecking order For example oil prices were much higher in which caused Fords automotive revenue to fall only For its part GM grew auto sales by last year and has registered two consecutive years of record sales when oil prices were substantially higher Clearly the major US auto manufacturers can thrive even under higher gas prices From this perspective one could argue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM have been beaten down too far and are now good buying opportunities Investors who maintain incomeoriented portfolios should view both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM attractively right now because their dividend yields are at rarelyseen levels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM both currently yield which are very near fiveyear highs for both companies Their dividend yields are elevated because their stock prices are languishing but all the while they are both aggressively raising their dividends Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>restored its dividend program in it has tripled its payout It has grown its dividend by compounded annually over the past three years Meanwhile after reinstating its own dividend last year GM recently delivered a solid dividend raise I view dividend announcements as a view into how management perceives the future of its business Companies that foresee trouble up ahead typically wont raise their dividends and especially not at such high rates I see their generous dividend increases as signs that both management teams are very confident in their companys future Because of this Im inclined to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GMs recent underperformance as great buying opportunities for income investors Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And GM Dividend Investors Should Take Advantage Of These Yields Disclosure Iwe have no positions in
