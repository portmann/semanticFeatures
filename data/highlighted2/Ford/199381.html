believe that the companys investments internationally especially in places like China have already begun to provide rewards for the company For the longest time we have argued that the investments that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is making in international operations overseas in places like Asia and Europe would eventually be a driver for the companys consolidated bottom line It is been our thesis that investments that the company has already made in places like China where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has spent a significant amount in innovation and marketing tailored specifically to the Chinese population will add to the companys robust domestic demand and round out a fantastic new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>We believe that the companys investments internationally especially in places like China have already began to provide rewards for the company International sales for the company have been a strength and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is widely regarded amongst analysts and contributors on Seeking Alpha as heading in the right direction Satisfied with the investments the company has already made especially with recent investments in India we were actually a bit surprised to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>making a new investment in China valued at over billion The interesting thing about this spending is not that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be researching simply new and innovative ways to make costefficient high margin vehicles which was their previous research and development strategy in places like India The interesting thing is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to be spending this money to try and actually get ahead of the technology curve in China focusing on smart cars that you can control from your phone and where the driver has significant technology at their command through a sophisticated indash system This is not just an investment in trying to create a cost efficient vehicle this is a real investment in trying to corner the future of the automobile market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Co FN said on Monday it will invest billion yuan billion over the next five years to expand research and development in China the latest effort by the US carmaker to secure a larger slice of the worlds biggest auto market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has rapidly gained market share over the past few years at mainly the expense of Japanese rivals helped by its efforts to incorporate Chinese consumer tastes in its cars sold in the country The Dearborn Michiganbased carmaker is the fifthbiggest foreign automaker in China after General Motors GMN Volkswagen VOWG_pDE Hyundai Motor Co KS and Nissan Motor Co T Speaking at a corporate event in Shanghai Chief Executive Mark Fields also said the company will introduce the CMAX Energi a plugin hybrid and the Mondeo conventional hybrid to the China market next year By we will offer customers in China a range of hybrid plugin hybrid and full electric vehicles he said Beijing has been trying to encourage the use of more electric vehicles to combat pollution but progress has been slow mainly due to the lack of infrastructure What does this mean for the company What does this mean for the investment thesis First it means that the company continues to be committed to allocating capital toward innovation and growth internationally We think this method of capital allocation versus something like General Motors massive buyback is still a great forward thinking way to hopefully provide continued longterm Alpha for you shareholders In that respect we think it is a good idea On the other hand on the other hand this will probably have an impact on the investment case for the shortterm though not for the longterm The increased level of spending associated with international development means that profitability may take longer then many had expected If Fords goal is simply to bolster the top line in places like China we think that this could be one item that puts a damper on the stock price in the shortterm Our conclusion on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been relatively simple We dont see the stock price moving back towards or over until the company can easily beat estimates and produce significant profit growth At some point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to have to turn off some of the spending and it is when they do that we predict the bottom line and stock price will really start to show significant improvement Its profitability is put off its not the worst thing in the world for those who have a longterm view of the company Our goal as shareholders is to take a minimum fiveyear outlook on the future of this company and hold our shares and collect dividends accordingly Again while this aggressive spending may make shortterm profitability difficult to achieve we dont mind collecting Fords yield in the meantime We remain long
