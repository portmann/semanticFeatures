ConocoPhillips Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Operations Will Survive WTI ConocoPhillips NYSECOP Seeking Alpha ConocoPhillips is doing extremely well in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>given the current pricing environment Going forward ConocoPhillips intends to keep maximizing its resource and earnings potential in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>play through several optimization programs ConocoPhillips Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pilot program has been a success so far a big win for investors and the company With a fullcycle FD cost of per BOE currently per BOE on a forward basis ConocoPhillips is fully capable of dealing with WTI Developing top tier shale plays remains a priority for ConocoPhillips NYSE COP after its big update on April even in the face of an uncertain commodity pricing outlook WTI West Texas Intermediate one benchmark for American crude prices is expected to plummet from an average of a barrel last year to somewhere around a barrel this year By WTI is expected to recover and begin climbing back up towards a barrel ConocoPhillips is operating under the assumption that WTI Brent and Henry Hub will trade around a barrel a barrel and per mmBtu in respectively which is fairly conservative guidance and points towards ConocoPhillips realization that it needs to keep costs under control Recently WTI has climbed back towards a barrel as of April which is a good sign for energy investors As you can see in the graphs below no one is certain where oil or Henry Hub US natural gas pricing benchmark will go or how long it will take for prices to recover Shale plays have a much higher cost of production with a rough breakeven price of a barrel than the a barrel breakeven price for onshore fields in the Middle East However that number is much lower in the core parts of the most productive shale plays in North America In order to cope with WTI ConocoPhillips and the energy industry as a whole have been reducing third party costs as a result of low oil prices while boosting the productivity of their wells In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>ConocoPhillips has extended the length of its laterals and shortening the space between each frac stage This means that the horizontal reach of its wells are longer and that there are more locations for oil NGLs natural gas liquids and natural gas to flow into its wells On top of that Conoco is using more proppant a solid material like sand or ceramic based materials that is added to fracking fluid to frack wells during the completion stage to further boost well productivity Below is a picture that highlights how ConocoPhillips improved technique has translated into much better results Being able to bring wells online that yield an EUR estimated ultimate recovery rate that is higher than its design for less drilling and completion cost wise faster spud to production cycle time is why Conoco isnt worried about low oil prices just yet The EUR rate is how much oil NGLs and natural gas a well will produce over its lifetime and is a very important metric to watch Higher day IP rates dont mean much unless the shale operator can prove that it will translate into a higher EUR rate ConocoPhillips has done just that Combined all of Conocos efficiency gains have turned the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>into a very economical shale play An excerpt from its annual analyst and investor meeting transcript Interestingly with all of the improvement that weve had on cost on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and well show you some detail in a minute and the early part of the cost deflation that were already experiencing our full cycle unit FD cost in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is now down to about and on a forward basis our unit FD cost is well below now in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Investors should keep in mind that the fullcycle per BOE FD finding and development cost is based on the price to produce one barrel of oil equivalent not just a barrel of oil Assuming a oil at a barrel based on WTI NGLs at WTI dry gas mmBtu based on Henry Hub production mix Conoco would receive an unhedged price of per BOE from its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>output The fullcycle per BOE FD cost doesnt include every cost involved but it does show that Conoco can still make money on its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells even if the payback period takes longer than normal According to Wood Mackenzie cited in ConocoPhillips presentation Conoco needs WTI to be just over a barrel in order to generate a internal rate of return IRR on its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells There still remains room for improvement as Conoco is testing out its Drilling Execution Efficiency Program which could further reduce drilling times Initially early results pointed towards the DEEP pilot project reducing drilling times by Now that the results are in management noted that drilling times could be reduced by The faster Conoco can drill its unconventional wells the less it costs generally speaking and the quicker ConocoPhillips can capitalize on any meaningful increase in WTI in the future Bringing more productive wells online faster and at a lower cost is just part of Conocos plan for the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Another way Conoco is seeking to maximize its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>potential is by tapping into both the upper and lower benches of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to grow its drilling inventory and thus its resource potential In order to do this Conoco has been actively testing out downspacing pilot projects in the area Downspacing refers to reducing the distance between the laterals of wells allowing for more wells to be brought online in the same amount of space assuming the wells dont communicate with each other in other words interfere with each others production Results from ConocoPhillips Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pilot tests point towards wells targeting this interval producing similar results compared to its wells targeting the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>horizon More information is needed to get a better picture of what to expect but so far it looks like wells targeting either the upper or lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>horizons will be very economical and productive Below is a picture that highlights just what stacked potential means The horizon on the top in the picture below AC is the Austin Chalk formation which also holds plenty of upside and is currently being evaluated by ConocoPhillips So far Conoco has successfully implemented its highlow spacing program in the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>horizon which is a vote of confidence for future spacing and stacked play drilling programs In investors should see if Conocos Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>downspacing tests work out and should also look out for how well Conocos triple stack pilot program targeting both the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the highlow Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>goes If successful ConocoPhillips will be able to substantially extend its growth runway in one of the most prolific shale plays in the world The single biggest problem facing Conocos Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>growth ambitions comes down to the price of oil Production out of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is heavily weighted towards oil and NGLs which are primarily valued based on the price of oil making ConocoPhillips drilling economics mostly dependent on the price of crude If Conocos realized oil price out of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale stays around a barrel for a prolonged period of time then it will have to keep bringing wells online in the core parts of its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>position to withstand the pricing environment This means that Conoco is forgoing some of its future earnings potential as these locations would generate very strong returns if WTI returned to a barrel To counter this Conoco is doing what it can to expand its highreturn drilling inventory Management sees at least years of drilling locations left in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>if not more depending on how its pilot programs go Natural gas prices will play a smaller role but could offer some upside if the startup of American LNG exports ends up pushing prices back up to over mmBtu versus mmBtu as of April ConocoPhillips plans to boost spending on its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>operations as its major projects like the Surmont facility and the APLNG development become operational This year Conoco intends to operate an average of seven rigs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which will grow to by In order to ramp up its drilling activity in regards to ConocoPhillips will boost its annual Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>capex budget from billion this year to billion in Conocos capex plan will boost its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>output from BOEd in to BOEd by equivalent to CAGR compound annual growth rate over that period of time There remains a ton of upside for ConocoPhillips in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and this company is well positioned to expand its growth story in the region in the event that WTI begins climbing back towards a barrel As ConocoPhillips continues to optimize its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>operations it will be able to keep lowering its cost of production Once ConocoPhillips completes several of its major projects this year that are under construction it will have the financial flexibility to shift that cash to its unconventional North American operations The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>play remains one of ConocoPhillips best assets and stands to reward shareholders with strong liquidsweighted output growth for many years
