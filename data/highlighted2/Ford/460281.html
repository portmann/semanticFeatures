class='textDiv'>Pickup Truck Wars GM Vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Vs FCA Vs Toyota Vs Nissan General Motors Company NYSEGM Seeking Alpha US pickup truck market grew in and on track for million Over of the entire light vehicle market GM remains market share leader but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gained in as did Nissan The smaller pickup truck size is growing the fastest in terms of sales suggesting new buyers switching from sedans and other cars Diesels are gaining market share and Android Auto Apple CarPlay and G LTE are introduced into the infotainment systems I review the actual products and provide my top five pickup truck recommendations Its time to talk about what makes the US light vehicle market distinctly American The widespread use of the pickup truck mostly by people who are not transporting cargo in the bed The personal pickup truck is as American as the Texas cowboy hat The other thing thats as American as apple pie are discounts My favorite part of the purchase process is going to the auto dealer and haggle for the lowest price As you can see from the latest analysis average pickup truck discounts can approach per vehicle All of that discounting has yielded a large and growing market from a unit sales perspective The halfyear US unit sales statistics are in and the market which consists of twelve models looks like this As you can see in the table above the market grew from the previous year Sales came in just below million so fullyear sales should hit million at this pace Thats little over of an overall US light vehicle market of million We also see that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F FSeries was the most important vehicle in terms of growth in absolute units Others grew more on a percentage basis but nobody came close to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>FSeries in terms of overall market importance The other thing to understand is that while some companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and FCA NYSE FCAU classify their pickup trucks under one major model name others such as GM NYSE GM Toyota NYSE TM and Nissan OTCPKNSANY dont They have different sizes and in GMs case two brands for each size Chevrolet and GMC for a total of four in GMs case As you can see in the table above while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>FSeries is the market leader by far GMs four models combined outsell the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>FSeries GMs market share is compared to Fords FCA is third at followed by Toyota at Over the last year or so I have driven some variant of almost all of these pickup trucks The major exceptions are the Nissan Frontier and Honda Ridgeline Keep in mind that there are numerous variants of most of these trucks different engines different cab sizes different trim levels onroad offroad etc In some cases I drove multiple variants of each in others not GM is the largest player overall and it competes in both sizeclasses Its also the only one that offers a diesel version of the smaller truck The diesel puts it on par with the best fuel economy of any truck up to MPG depending on the version GMs basic pickup designs are some of the older It shows in some of the electronics such as the ignition which is not wireless the foot parking brake and that the steering wheel in the fullsize truck doesnt telescope That said GM has also updated its trucks with some of the most important electronics Specifically it was the first to implement Android NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Auto Apple NASDAQ AAPL CarPlay G LTE and WiFi hotspot GMs OnStar also remains unmatched I find the steering and overall precision in the handling to be superior in the GM trucks fullsize and small alike From a driving dynamics standpoint its the least trucklike and most resembling a car or at least a smaller SUV in a good way Fords FSeries is the secondnewest design in the segment and its a very modern one with the latest in most feature areas The optional upgraded seat is the best and the sheer amount of features is bewildering in a good way Soon enough the FSeries will also get Android Auto Apple CarPlay and G LTE FCAs main calling card with the RAM is that it has the only diesel for the halfton truck segment This makes for superior fuel economy at up to MPG FCA is on a path to get an updated infotainment system thats got Android Auto Apple CarPlay and G LTE but I dont know when it will be Certainly not in the next few short months It could be a year away or perhaps two or three years in a worstcase scenario We may find out next year I drove the two Toyota pickup trucks and I was not impressed They felt noticeably rough and featurepoor compared to most of what GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>FCA and Nissans Titan HD had to offer The seats werent particularly comfortable the driveline felt unsmooth and all the electronics were lightyears behind GM in particular Toyota lives on its superior quality reputation and the Tundra wasnt quite as unimpressive to me as the smaller Tacoma but still they were simply not in the same class as those other trucks from the other brands Toyota has a lot of work to catch up Nissan has an impressive offering in the new Titan XD diesel Thats the only version of any Nissan truck I have driven in recent years Its got a liter V diesel made by Cummins yielding a massive lb ft of torque at extremely low RPM but its available only in a beefier truck in the threequarter class The Nissan is a modern but still masculine and classy at the same time design statement The interior is a very tasteful mix of car and truck If you want the most sophisticated look inside a pickup truck look no further than the Nissan Titan XD diesel in Platinum Reserve trim The only real downside I could find with the Nissan Titan XD is the lack of Android Auto Apple CarPlay and embedded G LTE Nissan just started equipping its first car the Maxima with Apple CarPlay so perhaps there is hope for the Titan in the months to come As for Honda I simply havent driven the allnew Ridgeline yet Its arriving in dealerships now and is getting strong reviews It has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay Its also a very different kind of truck than all the others given that its a unibody design not bodyonframe What makes a pickup truck fundamentally different to drive compared to an otherwise equivalent large SUV That is except from the obvious bed Well a truck is meant to support more weight in the back if you fill it up However when you drive it without any significant load back there the suspension will be extremely stiff Bumps may not be kind to your kidneys The stiffness becomes exacerbated with the latest fashion in pickup trucks equipping them with or even inch wheels That means very little sidewall for the tires As a result the ride becomes extrastiff This will be very tedious for people who drive their trucks without anything heavy in the bed or who dont tow The solution to this fundamental truck problem is to make sure you get your truck with wheels that are inches or less depending on the trucks size If you do you will get a much more comfortable ride making it feel more like a regular large bodyonframe SUV My newest favorite is the GMC Sierra AllTerrain X On this fullsize truck GM removed all chrome and made it DarthVader allblack It looks like the Zombie Apocalypse truck Many people fear you in traffic The tires are beefy inch offroaders and it rides like a dream very cushy and confident Fuel economy is acceptable for such a horsepower liter gasoline V beast at MPG city MPG highway At little over before discounts reasonably equipped its not a bad deal given this extremely tasteful package that makes you feel good both driving it and looking at it GMC is also offering huge discounts right now The GMC Canyon is essentially the same vehicle as the Chevrolet Colorado Its got the best electronics handling fuel economy and is the least difficult to park The configuration you want is going to be over before discounts The only fly in the ointment right now is that GMC isnt discounting it very much making the larger Sierra a better buy Modernity and features abound What it lacks is a diesel for the halfton class as well as embedded LTE Android Auto and Apple CarPlay either just arrived or will soon be arriving as a software update I find the steering a bit lightvague but on the whole the new SYNC infotainment system took away the remaining obstacle from recommending this bestselling truck The kind of configurations I want start at anywhere from to before discounts This is for the guy who would like to tow up to lbs and for whom a modern and sophisticated interior design is important The configuration you want is going to be at least before discounts This may not be the ideal pickup truck unless you have serious towing needs There is one rationale for buying the RAM today and thats its excellent diesel engine which is the sole one of kind and in its weight class In perhaps another year or two RAM will also have solved the infotainment issue currently lacking Android Auto and Apple CarPlay You can configure it for less but I see a great luxurious configuration starting around before significant discounts Summary A large and lucrative vehicle market So there you have it these are my favorite three pickup trucks in the US market right now The market grew in the first half of and GM remains the largest
