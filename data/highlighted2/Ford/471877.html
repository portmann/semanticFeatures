#A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors is down Thursday after reporting second quarter results The company beat big on the top line but it was not enough to boost EPS above estimates Management says fullyear guidance is at risk Youre seriously selling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>This company is the definition of a cash cow This article is my th installment in a segment called Buy on the Drop where I choose a stock that recently experienced a large decrease in price and give a recommendation on whether investors should Buy on the Drop or not This is a recurring segment so if you enjoy the article Follow me to see more You can read about my previous installment discussing Skechers USA NYSE SKX here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F investors are likely pretty unhappy Thursday as the stock is currently down about after second quarter earnings that left much to be desired Most of you reading this likely know the numbers so Ill just quickly sum up the report in the next couple paragraphs If you know why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is down today and dont want a rehash of the details skip to the next section Lets start with the bad news Despite beating consensus revenue estimates by billion almost Fords EPS was just below estimates and lower than Q EPS The revenue beat and EPS miss would naturally point to a margin issue and sure enough operating margins declined across all regions except for Europe But considering that billion in revenue comes from North America about of the total the decline in operating margin there by bps to was the main pain point for EPS Even more worrying was perhaps that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also warned that demand is expected to be lower than last year in the second half of and that fullyear guidance is at risk Shortterm performance looks to be trending down for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and investors are paying the price Yet I have another question mostly directed at longterm investors who cares The Bull Case and Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Will Bounce Back <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is one of those stocks thats a pure dividend play and nothing else Share price growth has been virtually nonexistent which is fine because thats not what investors are looking for in the stock Yet it can still get pretty volatile sometimes as Thursdays trading session again proved For a company that is so financially stable there are an awful lot of sharp movements along this price chart Yet there is a recurring theme which is that after those shortterm price movements F always bounces back up Its almost as if the catalyst for the stock movements is traders and not investors Weird right Traders play around with shares making them go up down and sideways in the shortterm and then longterm investors pick up shares on the cheap A predictable cycle Heres my complex stepbystep instructions to explain how this cycle can benefit you Stock sells off due to nonfundamental shortterm issue Easy right Okay Im being a bit sarcastic but how could I not be I mean look at the results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported billion in net income for the first half of up yearoveryear generated a record billion in operating cash flow in Q and distributed million in dividends for the quarter With the annual dividend the yield on F shares is just about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the very definition of a cash cow The company solely exists now to return value to shareholders There is no aggressive spending to foster growth and market share gains and thats the way it should be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>isnt going anywhere and this share price decline is screaming buy me We are now at step of the cycle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has sold off Step is now in play Buy F at a discount when it will just bounce back up again Step will then take hold and unpredictable price movements will happen in the shortterm But then the market will realize the selloff made no sense <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still just as valuable as it was before which leads to the profits reaped in step You get some share price gains in addition to that dividend All is right with the world Until another something comes along to inquire of the edifice which is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company Some will go running for the exits and the smart ones will go straight to step I shouldnt even need to emphasize the fundamentals here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not worth a few billion less dollars because of poor second quarter results and cautious guidance Fluctuations and anomalies happen The longterm prospects of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>were not negatively affected whatsoever by anything in second quarter results If anything I think they were actually brightened by it North American sales are expected to be weak in the coming quarters but Europe is showing promising growth with operating margin for the region up bps to and pretax net income nearly tripling yearoveryear Fords US prospects will inevitably bounce back and when they do they will have improving European results to bolster profits and maybe display some significant overall top line growth as well Use the current decline as a buying opportunity and game the cycle of irrationality I rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company a Strong Buy on the drop If you want to stay uptodate on my articles you can
