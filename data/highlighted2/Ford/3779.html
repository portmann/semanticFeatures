<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And GM Compare In China General Motors Company NYSEGM Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is behind GM in China although recent sales figures seem to favor the former In absolute numbers GM remains ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and gives it a big advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and GM NYSE GM are the two most prominent car manufacturers from the United States Throughout their long history together they have competed with one another and the two can be considered rivals Neither of the two companies has a clear advantage over the other to be number one in the United States They go back and forth as time goes by With that said it can be argued that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been the better of the two in recent years For instance while GM needed a massive government bailout to recover from bankruptcy at the height of the Financial Crisis in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>did much better and was able to keep its problems more or less under control However the one consistent and constant advantage that GM has had over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is in the Chinese market In China GM is way ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>by a huge margin Some of GMs brands such as Buick are doing very well there even though they may be struggling elsewhere That helps illustrate the level of success GM has managed to achieve in China Recent sales figures from GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in collaboration with their Chinese partners seem to suggest that this advantage may be slipping In fact GM sales in China are actually down in comparison to the previous year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on the other hand is doing much better with significant sales increases Some would therefore argue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is gaining on GM in a market where it has long trailed The latest sales figures come on the heels of other reports which indicate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>increased sales last year by over percent in China GM also did well with a percent increase but thats substantially below that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The tables below show the performance of GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>over the last several years Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has beaten GM for the last three years using this metric You would have to go all the way back to for the last time that GM was able to post a higher number than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>It would seem that a pattern is beginning to appear The market in China continues to grow With China now being the largest market in terms of vehicles sold its important for automakers to do well there as best as they can No car manufacturer can aspire to be number one globally without also having a strong position in China Especially not with the Chinese market continuing to grow at a strong clip The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers CAAM forecasts sales to grow by around percent in to million vehicles That continues the steady expansion of the market as seen in recent years The table below shows the total number of vehicles sold in the preceding years Its important to note that while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may be posting higher sales figures than GM in terms of percentages its sales are coming off a much lower base Therefore GM sales may seem smaller because the base is so much bigger Fords increases in percentages may seem bigger but they also translate into much smaller increases in absolute terms Taking a closer look at the sales statistics shows that while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may have increases sales last year by over percent and GM by percent GM sold more vehicles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had more vehicles In other words GM sales increase in absolute numbers is more than twice that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>increased its sales by a higher percentage Bottom line GM is still comfortably ahead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in China despite the progress <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has made Even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>last year managed to sell more than one million vehicles for the first time in China GM managed to do that a long time ago and is now at more than million vehicles GMs unit sales are easily over three times that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>China remains a strength of GM Granted GM had a headstart because it entered the Chinese market before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>did GM first entered China in the early part of the twentieth century and reentered the market in the mid nineties Compared to Fords greater reluctance GM placed much stronger emphasis on China than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>did The former is now reaping the benefits of its decision and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is forced to play catch up in a market that GM projects could grow to million passenger and commercial vehicles by If this turns out to be accurate GM will be in an excellent position to take advantage and eclipse the competition To Fords credit it has managed to make impressive strides even though its behind For instance it has managed to beat Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota NYSE TM and has now surpassed them in sales The key is to keep up the effort and its possible that for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the best is yet to come With all that said GM should not become complacent even if it doesnt have to worry too much about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Frequent recalls like you have now and other technical defects dont exactly help your reputation when youre selling a product GM therefore shouldnt take its current position for granted It would not be the first time that an automaker lost its leading position After all just because youre ahead in the race doesnt mean youve also won the race The race is far from over Source How <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And GM Compare In China Disclosure The author has no positions in any
