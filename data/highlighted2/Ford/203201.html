#A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha US auto operations continue to perform well for both companies It is the NonUS operations of both companies that continue to be a drag August auto sales expected above million again Both stocks are cheap on many different metrics The dividend yields and freecashflow are particularly compelling Growth stocks which typically trade at a lofty valuation premium typically require longterm revenue and earnings growth trends to continue to sustain the premium valuation It is safe to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and GM NYSE GM are value stocks today with the China yuan turmoil and the slowing economic data in China the latest shot across the bow that has knocked down both the shares of both auto giants GM is trading down from its late high of while Fords multiyear high is from early For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the reason for the sudden outperformance in in the stock and then subsequent swoon is pretty clear in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>earned per share on roughly billion in revenue which was the year prior to Europe falling into its own recession In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expected to earn roughly per share on billion in revenue thus the auto OEM is scheduled to earn less in EPS five years after what was peak EPS on better revenue today GM is a little harder to figure the stock peaked at just over in late a year in which GM earned in EPS on billion in revenue while the company is expected to earn in earnings per share this year on billion in revenue Thus GM is expected to earn substantially higher EPS on less revenue Basically opposite metrics and yet the stocks heading the same direction So what is happening to cause the latest disinterest in the shares Monthly auto sales August monthly auto sales are due out Tuesday September and are expected to come in over the million SAAR seasonally adjusted annual sales rate In July monthly auto sales rose and at a million annual rate This was the th or th consecutive month of better than million run rate but the problem or perception is that there are some worries that this sales rate can continue Personally the improved state of consumer balance sheets today particularly in terms of the average consumers ability to service debt like mortgage and auto loans is better today than at any point in the last years Car sharing and such have put doubts into the industry as to whether a million plus SAAR is sustainable NonUS operations For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the US or North America segment is of total revenue but basically all of Fords pretax income as of the nd quarter thanks to the regional crises that have impacted Europe South America and now ChinaSoutheast Asia The problem in and for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was Europe which cost the auto giant in EPS in alone but in Q Europe lost just million on a pretax basis Asia Pacific was the only region in the black in Q and you have to think now with China wobbly that might be an issue Europe is of Fords total revenue With Greece now moving to the background and some of European economic data improving Fords European operations which have been a chronic drag on pretax income to the tune of billion the last three years might start to improve GMs US operations are of total revenue but EBIT earnings before interest and taxes is of GMs total EBIT as of the nd quarter GMs IO or international operations which according to the Q is China to a large extent were profitable to the tune of million in Q and had been showing steady improvement IO was the only nonUS operation that was profitable for GM and you have to think after the last weeks the shorts are pounding GM for just that reason Like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GMs Europe operations are of Q revenue thus a little smaller in size relative to the total but the EBIT loss like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been improving Europe lost just million for GM in Q versus a million loss in Q Those European pretax income trends must continue for both companies to help ease the pain of China if that pain should occur Union pension contributions Although the auto giants are carrying a lessonerous pension burden post thanks to the VEBA trusts which as I understand it allowed the auto OEMs to offload a significant chunk of the UAW healthcare liability and Im not sure if this is current healthcare costs or postretirement but the burden appears to be lessened However persistently low interest rates and the flat equity market in are a doublenegative for the pension liabilities while a year like which saw the SP and Treasury yields substantially higher was a doublepositive for example While higher interest rates might crimp auto borrowing by increasing the cost of auto loans higher interest rates as I understand it reduce the present value of the defined benefit plan pension liability and thus reduce plan expense and would contribute positively to EPS for both companies The point being that post you would think a stronger equity market and expected higher interest rates which havent materialized continue to be a mixed bag for the PBO or post retirement benefit obligation Using Q and current consensus here is a key valuation metric comparison between the two companies Calculations made with stock price as of close The Financial Services arms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit and the old GMAC or what is now Ally somewhat distort cashflow data Id prefer to look at cashflow of just the auto operations which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>segregates but I didnt see the same easy compare for GM Here is a quick summary of the above valuation metrics EPS growth Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM expecting a huge year of EPS growth in and yet the stocks stay punk Auto OEMs typically trade at half the multiple of the SP which is clearly how the auto stocks are being valued today at least on a PE basis even though both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM are seeing record North American pretax auto margins Because of that I think both PEs have a little room to expand Revenue growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a little stronger than GM this year GM is expecting negative revenue growth now for Cashflow valuations Even without the Financial Services arms cashflow and freecashflow is plentiful for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM Stocks are at a sweet spot in the cycle in that regard with little credit issues in my opinion Dividend yields very enticing with plenty of freecashflow Unless a reader thinks the US is headed for a recession these dividends are very safe Intrinsic value estimates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is trading at a roughly discount to intrinsic value while GM is trading at a roughly discount to intrinsic value Unless you can be a very longterm investor in the Energy or Basic Materials sector it is hard to find steep discounts like this to intrinsic value in Consumer Discretionary or the other major sectors Analysisconclusion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM have been owned for clients for years with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>far longer than GM The stocks have underperformed and my pounding the table on the names has not helped Seeking Alpha readers very much as this article and this article detail In my opinion both OEMs are making a higher quality car and when I see the cars on the road these days of both manufacturers I like the look and the style of the new models <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is waiting for the F aluminum truck to catch on and the big issue with GM continues to be the numerous recall issues and ignition scandal although I think all of that and the China worry are discounted in a GM stock price Id like to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stay above and GM trade back above technically The last two weeks were nasty in terms of the market decline so we took advantage of it in these two names for clients In terms of which OEM I like better I still give a slight nod to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>although with Alan Mullaly leaving staying with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>upon the departure of an iconic CEO is a break from investing strategy I do think Mary Barra has a chance to permanently transform the GM culture if she has the spirit and the time For a year holding period I think investors will be rewarded We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell the personal
