Auto Undervalued A Yield And Value Opportunity Seeking Alpha The auto industry has inherent risks which dictate caution for both the short and long investor GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pricing provides fundamental support for starting a position The yield opportunity provides further support to balance industry risk GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have improved their balance sheets significantly to weather a downturn US automakers have been left for dead in the equity markets since the Great Car Crash of I was lucky enough to be working at an auto plant at that time and remember those dark days but we should not let previous calamities prevent us from seizing a rare opportunity at a time when the SP s PE is at a historically significant peak Both General Motors NYSE GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F are trading at very low multiples when compared to the market If both were purchased evenly to fill a position you would have a position trading at only of the PE of the market and a PEG of well below the recommended ceiling of PB is approximately half the SP average which is reasonable given the higher risk during a downturn The dividend of would more than double the SP despite a lower payout ratio The position would however have a lower operating margin at vs for the SP The combined leverage ratio is in line with the SP a blend of GMs at less than and Fords elevated leverage at The volatility is also high at a beta of Overall the depressed pricing presents a tremendous amount of room for capital appreciation with a high barrier to further depreciation over a long horizon Even if the price continues to stagnate the dividend will provide a steady income and the payout ratio indicates that there is a high probability of dividend growth in the future Both companies have raised dividends the previous years a healthy start given the dire situation prior to that Another economic crash could cause a change in direction though for the dividends With a solid fundamental base for investment we now focus on the risk level of the investment During GM went bankrupt and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>very narrowly avoided it Global auto sales crashed by during this period and US auto sales by source Statista Sales generally returned to base within years This was an extreme situation but lets review the financial statements to understand if they are better prepared today For GM a reduction would be Byear in lost revenue They have a strategy documented in their annual K report that they will keep B in cash and equities and have a total of B in liquidity for their automotive arm If you include cash used for stock repurchasing capital expenses and dividend payments as liquid B total the total is B The remaining B would be required to come from reduced purchases and production or borrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets All info from December K In total GM should be able to scrape past a similar economic condition although there are many factors which could tip the scale in the wrong direction For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a reduction would be Byear in lost revenue I did not see language in their K with a specific cash target but they have averaged B across and with another B in marketable equities for B total Adding in cash allocated for stock repurchase programs capital expenses and dividends the total can be brought up to B The remainder would need to come from reduced purchases and production or borrowing All info from December K In total <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is in a situation similar but slightly better than GM where they should be able to cover the automotive decline for a short period It is important to note that I have not included impacts to the financial arms or pension obligations in the analysis above Despite this I feel comfortable that these companies are better suited to handle a global crisis than a decade ago and are suitable for my investment US auto manufacturers GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have very favorable valuations in todays market with solid fundamental support While a combined beta of and known cyclical risk is inherent with the auto industry a dividend and improved balance sheets offer a compelling argument to initiate a long position All financial info from Yahoo Finance wwwfinanceyahoocom unless otherwise noted I wrote this
