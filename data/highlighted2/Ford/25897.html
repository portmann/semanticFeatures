Litmus Tests Point To <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Success In China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Were closely monitoring Fords growth overseas combined with its ideas for fueling further growth One item weve written about is the rebirth of the Lincoln Continental Bullish March sales and a positive reception of the Cadillac overseas give us confidence even though were not GM fans This will be a shorter article simply to point out two things of promise for those looking to hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the longer term China and now India as well has essentially been the main focus for us when we look to see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is going to continue to develop The automaker while making progress domestically and overseas has yet to put a kick behind its stock price of recent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shareholders continue to look for answers what is it going to take to move Fords stock One of the recent contentions we made was an article stating that a rebirth of the Lincoln Continental could be one of the catalysts that pushes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sales higher while helping bump the stock over resistance You can read that article here Our readers will also be happy to know that we finally began staking our longterm position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>just days ago We are now long the stock Heres what were looking at this week The first litmus test that continues to point to success is the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>outsold Hyundai in China As reported this week sales in China rose to vehicles in March The second litmus test is a little less prominent but one that we took notice of and think the market needs to also take note of It was reported that General Motors NYSE GM reported strong sales in China Specifically Cadillac sales rose on new model introductions This is important because it indicates to us that our argument that American luxury is still in demand overseas holds water Ironically the Cadillac is still partially out of favour domestically but were not the country with billion people in it Wed much rather see a burgeoning US luxury market in China with its dense populous than in the US If China responds the same way to the Lincoln Continental <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may have found its catalyst to break out of the funk its perpetually been in the last couple of years As investors these indications are exactly what were looking for We are also looking forward to the upcoming Shanghai auto show where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will have a chance to unveil vehicles specifically made for the Asian demographic like the reworked Taurus A new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Taurus is on the way at least for some markets As part of a huge unveiling of seven models for the Asia Pacific market at the Shanghai Motor Show <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is announcing the debut of the companys nextgen large sedan on April just before the event in China begins Unfortunately the Taurus that we see in Shanghai might not signal too much about the future version in the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>spokesperson Monique Brentley tells Autoblog that this debut is specifically for the Chinese market and the Blue Oval isnt saying whether any of this updated look will come across the Pacific The Taurus should pair well with the Continental to fill out growing demand for larger sedans overseas As a reminder from an earlier article we wrote the three reasons we listed for the Lincoln potentially making a difference were We think it marks the continued rebirth of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>name and brand to a number of younger generations While some consumers that were fans of the brand likely never dissented from it the lot that shunned the brand during the crisis will start to notice that things are again picking up It allows high margin access to overseas markets specifically China Luxury items sell well in China just ask Apple NASDAQ AAPL or Burberry OTCPKBURBY With a Chinese eye on American luxury Lincoln should help the company roll out its plans of continued growth overseas in China and places like India where the company recently broke ground setting up a production facility What model is better to do this than the classic American continental We think its going to help a global shift in how people think about luxury automobiles While GMs Cadillac brand has a timeless feel to it especially because of its ageless logo and cool factor Buick and Lincoln havent done well to keep American luxury on the map Buick is undergoing a shift to a sportier vehicle but we believe the brand is stuck spinning its wheels Lincoln has a real chance to reignite a spark for those who consider luxury to only be European This can help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>obviously but it can also help the US domestic auto sellers grow quicker overseas Also worth noting was that in Alcoas earnings report on Wednesday of this week the companys CEO pointed out that China has about million vehicles that dont adhere to Clean Air Act standards These vehicles will turn over hopefully with Fords new low emission vehicles We added <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to our dividend portfolio this past week We dont mind collecting the companys attractive yield while we wait for the rest of the market to see the value we see in owning the stock In general <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to be our preferred way to invest in the US auto market Heres a piece on why we have a target over Again we have to reiterate that we take a longterm view on the company Source Litmus Tests Point To <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Success In China Disclosure The
