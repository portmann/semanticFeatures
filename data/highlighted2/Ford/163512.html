General Motors billion share buyback has bought back millions of shares well above current levels The market crash has made buybacks of automotive shares at current levels GM included even more accretive for investors This could be an ideal time for undervalued <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to step in and repurchase its shares during a market downturn Automotive investors have had a rough year watching their shares go from trading at low valuations to ultralow valuations But this sets up a situation where wellpositioned companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F can repurchase shares on the cheap and build shareholder value Furthermore the recent market downturn has not only made shares cheaper but gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a way to execute its buyback even better than General Motors NYSE GM ongoing billion buyback Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM have a history of share buybacks to look back upon While precrisis buybacks were not the best moves in hindsight its also clear that share buybacks were not the make or break factor that caused Detroit automakers so much pain in Since then the companies have taken varied approaches to buybacks GM has been highly aggressive repurchasing a billion stake from the US Treasury in and adding a billion buyback after being pressured by an activist hedge fund Unfortunately for GM the company has a paper loss of about million from its latest buyback While I still see this buyback as having positive effects for longterm GM investors the price paid for these GM shares was far from ideal In contrast <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has remained lighter on the buyback front In the company announced a billion buyback but it was for countering dilution from convertible notes and executive compensation In its annual report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>noted that the buyback was completed in August and that the million repurchased shares essentially balanced out other dilution As a bull on both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I have seen shares as undervalued for over a year now and the recent market downturn has only made these investments appear even better priced For companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this is an ideal opportunity to commence a buyback ie when shares are on sale to get the most value per buyback dollar By waiting until this market downturn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could actually beat GM at its own buyback game by repurchasing shares at a better time in the market With shares trading at only x est earnings x est earnings and x est earnings valuation is on Fords side Additionally retiring shares would save the company on dividend payments and put some buying pressure on shares <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also has some advantages over GM when it comes to safely executing its buyback Much of the capital investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needed to make happened in when the company refreshed or launched over models freeing up future cash for buybacks dividends and debt reduction <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also less exposed to a downturn in the Chinese auto market than GM due to smaller Chinese vehicle sales allowing it to better weather the storm if forecasts for a Chinese slowdown prove correct How <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wants to implement and structure a buyback is ultimately up to itself Fords management probably has the best information on what the companys capital needs will be over the next several years and should be able to plan a buyback accordingly In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would need to make the buyback a significant size in order for it to actually reduce outstanding shares rather than just balance out executive compensation That said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should determine a buyback thats right for itself and not get into a battle with GM over some type of buyback size envy Ultimately it would be beneficial if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could also keep raising its dividend alongside the buyback as many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors like the company for the income and a flatlining of dividends could cause some of these shareholders to leave In light of the recent market downturn I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as being in an excellent place to implement a share buyback even if modest in amount This would send a signal of management confidence while allowing the company to repurchase shares at a deep discount boosting EPS and reducing total dividend payments While GM could not have seen this market downturn coming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should consider picking up where its rival has incurred paper losses to
