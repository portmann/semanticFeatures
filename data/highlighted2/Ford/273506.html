<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not one of the first names that comes to mind when speaking of dividend growth its fair to expect an increase in January as the company has done so for three consecutive years This article presents a few reasons why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can afford to increase its dividend and also attempts to predict the dividend

An eight percent increase to cents per quarter will only push the payout ratio to which is still fair But given the companys and the industrys history it is prudent to be cautious and not overstretch
