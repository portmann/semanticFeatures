<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has got off to a tremendous start in Europe this year and this will allow the company to build further on the success that it had seen last year So lets take a look at the reasons why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will continue to do well in Europe In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>achieved a remarkable turnaround in Europe The companys European division reported an income of million before tax as against a pretax loss of million in This clearly indicates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has got its strategy right in Europe For instance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking to push sales toward retail customers as compared to fleet customers This is because the company gets superior margins from retail than fleet In fact the contribution of Fords fleet sales out of its total sales dropped from a year ago to in January Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also closing down on the practice of selfregistration Under this practice dealers register new cars as demo cars therefore counting such cars as sales and thereby inflating the numbers By clamping down on the practice of selfregistration <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to distinguish real sales from rentals and devise its strategy accordingly for the future In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is on track to release seven new or updated models in Europe The new upcoming models include the new Kuga and the Edge SUVs apart from the Focus RS performance car thats aimed at the enthusiasts and will improve Fords profile Additionally the company will equip the Transit Custom and the Transit ton models with new power trains apart from giving a facelift to the Ranger pickup Once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is through with these launches this year it will come up with five new crossovers for the European market over the next three years Now as we can see above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is focusing a lot on the SUV and crossover segment in Europe This is not surprising as the company expects sales of SUVs and performance cars to remain strong in Europe this year In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects SUV sales in Europe to surge as compared to on the back of increasing demand As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects to sell more than SUVs in Europe this year which will be a record for the company This will help boost sales margins and overall profitability as SUVs and performance cars carry higher margins At the same time sales of Fords performance cars are also expected to increase by over with a projection of about cars to be sold in this segment Moreover by launching new crossovers and SUVs over the next three years in Europe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is making a smart move Im saying this because crossover and SUV sales in the continent are expected to grow from million units this year to million units in The good part is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is already on top of the crossover game in Europe as the growth in sales of the Kuga has outpaced almost all of its rivals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has started the year well in Europe with sales increasing at a faster clip in February than in January This will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to build up on its profitable performance in Europe last year especially because the company is focusing on improving its highmargin SUV and crossover lineup Thus investors can expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to go one up on its performance in Europe this year as compared to which will ultimately have a positive impact on
