</span>who was the UKs Ambassador in Syria during was asked by the BBC in their The Big Questions interview on February th whether the current Syrian President Bashar alAssad would have to be a part of the solution in that country after the war is over and Ambassador <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>said I think sadly but inevitably he is Realistically Assad is not going to be overthrown This becomes more clear with every day that passes Western analysts have beenindulging in wishful thinking for years its time to get real we owe it to the Syrian people to be much more realistic and hard headed about this The West has to stoppropping up the socalled moderate opposition which is not moderate at all This was quoted by Almasdar News on February th which went on to note that The frustrated interviewer asked Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>about what we should have done and he responded that we should have backed off we should have not tried to overthrow theregime Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>eloquently added that this policy has been like a dog returning to vomit The interviewer was clearly antiAssad and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>responded with evident anger by noting starting aton the video the shocking fact that In Aghanistan Iraq Libya like a dog returning to vomit we go back toand the audience already was started to clap herewe never saw a secular Arab regime that we didnt want to overthrow He was saying there that we support only nonsecular regimes sectarian regimes in Arabia this meaning fundamentalist Sunni governments especially Saudi Arabia Qatar Kuwait UAE the very same regimes that even the US Secretary of State acknowledged in a cable that was wikileaked are the chief regimes that are funding Al Qaeda ISIS and other jihadist groups <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was noting that the United States and UK strive to keep in power those governments the ones that are led by royal families that supply the bulk of funding for jihadist groups jihadists who perpetrate terrorism in the United States and Europe We never saw asecularArab regime that we didnt want to overthrow Ambassdor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was so bold as to imply that our governments are supporting under the table the very same ruling families that they know to be funding as that cable only vaguely referred to them Sunni terrorist groups worldwide which includes in Western countries too The BBCs interviewer ignored that statement he wasnt struck by it such as to ask Why are we supporting the chief funders of Islamic jihad Why are we overthrowing or in Syria are trying to overthrow a secular regime against which we join foreign jihadist groups in order to overthrow thatnonsectarian regime why are these dogs as you call the US and UK returning time and again to that vomit This was a live interview program and so the BBC censors werent able to eliminate Ambassador Fords responses from the interview but instead the interviewer did his best to interrupt and to talk over Fords shocking and shockingly truthful assertions about the government ours that supposedly representour interests and not the interests of Western oil companies etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will probably not be invited again to be on live television in the West to air his views about Syria Fords evident anger at whats going on and at the medias resistance to letting the public know about the reality appeared to reach near to the edge of his blurting out that ulterior motives have to be behind this addiction to vomit but he was a professional diplomat and so he was able to restrain himself there The US Secretary of State who had specifically requested the fundamentalistIslamic Arab allies to stop funding terrorism was Hillary Clinton the leading candidate now contending for the Democratic Partys Presidential nomination Here she was expressing her current view regarding Syria in a recent debate against her Democratic Party opponent Senator Bernie Sanders QUESTIONER In respect to when you take out Syrian President Bashar alAssad Right now or do you wait Do you tackle ISIS firstYou have said Secretary Clinton that you come to the conclusion that we have to proceed on both fronts at once We heard from the senator just this week that we must put aside the issue of how quickly we get rid of Assad and come together with countries including Russia andIran to destroy ISIS first Is he wrong Shes still now after five years and even though she knows that were supporting jihadistbacking Arabic royal families and their Shariahlaw regimes comes back to that vomit that we never saw a secular Arab regime that we didnt want to overthrow Shes an example of this addiction to that vomit She does this even though in October the man who had collected the megadonations to Al Qaeda all of which had been in cash had detailed under oath in a US court proceeding that the Saud family were the main people who paid the salaries of the terrorists The Saud family are now the chief backers of the overthrowAssad campaign Do politicians such as Clinton actually represent the Sauds Its not only the Bush family who do Whats exhibited here is a doublescandal first that a person such as that would even be a Democratic Party candidate for the US Presidency and Jeb Bush shares Hillary Clintons foreign policy prescriptions though hes virtually certainnot to win the Republican Presidential nomination and second that the Western press try to avoid as much as possible to expose the fact that this is indeed vomit and avoid to explain to their audience the very corrupt governmental and newsmedia system that enables people such as Ms Clinton to become and remain a leading Presidential candidate in the United States Clearly a person like that isnt qualified to be in government at all shes corrupt or elseincrediblystupid And no one thinks shes that stupid But lots of people accuse her of being corrupt Investigative historian Eric Zuesse is the author most recently of Theyre Not

about Assads use of sarin to almost get a major war started Hillary is a psychopath who was delighted by the gruesome death of Gaddafi The US is beholden to the constant war policy of the Neocons to serve Israeli interests in the MiddleEast That policy is not likely to change and people in the MiddleEast will continue to die while the US pretends its bringing democracy to millions of poor medieval people httpwwwglobalresearchcaussponsoredgenocideagainstiraq httpswwwwswsorgenarticlesisisjhtml While claiming to be committed to a war against ISIS Washington and its regional allies have

for a two terms it looks like the American voter also returned to vomit Sat Oldwood Truly intelligent people would be constantly reassessing circumstances and results to ensure some reasonable level of success What we are witnessing is either the height of stupidity or an incredibly successful agenda In either case we are fuckedthe world is fucked If only it was simple war mongers but unfortunately they are the useful idiots I think rest of the world should come together httpwwwveteranstodaycom Second photo That is Mike Harris looking over the shoulder of Syrian Minister of Justice

Sat Which way to th The system unfortunately is designed to promote asshats like Cameron and the rest of the pond scum in Brussles Politicians quite often see the light when they get out of office much like Saul did on the way to Damascus Someone who would actually promote friendly relations with those it seeks to slander purely for monitary gain MIC are weeded out Those who would promote the demise of NATO and develope a Europeon Defense force most likely dont make it past sergeant Europeons have to start defending their interests not outsiders A Europeon defense force would be much like Russian Defence force enough to give an invader a very bloody nose but not anywhere near enough to invade and conqure To have a person become the head of such an orginazition would require a political decision It would require a leader that breaks the mold and to use a worn out phrase think outside the box One such person was Putin Did Yeltsin expect Putin to take the direction that he did I dont know America now has a chance to pick someone outside the box Im not sure how it would work with Trump as president but the rest are a continuation of the same tired old schtick He has said that he could work with Putin It could be a long shot but one that could pay off some remarkable dividends down the road The other choice at the moment is Clinton who looks like she cant wait to start another war Interesting times we live in indeed Just noticed an interesting article by that witch Anne Applebaum Is this the end of the west as we know it It is full of the usual BS To site one item we are two or three bad elections away from the end of NATO I would hope it is just one good one with Trump delivering the hammer blow Interesting read from a perspective of knowing the evil amongst us Warning you may need a vomit bag at the ready Sat buttmint many great kudos and thumbs up to all the ZHers that have posted great feedback I read and readsit back and sip a hot coffee and wonder what bad juju and karma is America reaping that will see our land despoiled by civil and international wars Sat Young Buckethead Karma Fukushima is just the warmup for the US The majority of failing nuclear power plants in the US are blowing their radiation down the Eastern Seaboard satchurating DC Its going to be slow and painful and broadcast in living color Sat TeraByte What was the point of dragging petty criminal Slobodan Miloevi to Hague when other presidents and their henchmen go unpunished Hilary rightfully deserved a one way ticket to the tribunal but now instead this madwoman is allowed to run for presidency Sat Bazza McKenzie He stood up against the US and EU warmongers and had no great power protecting him That enraged those warmongers Sat Billybullshit And blair the worst

tell about Ukraine and how he supported nazies there But he wont because he is too busy doing his best to make Mordor collapse I suppose every US ambassador deserves the fate of Chris Stevens and may it be so Amen Sat jmc America following or in other words agreeing to implement ultimately British derived ideology has always been bad for both countries and all those it was imposed upon Since Truman we havent been following American foreign policy we accepted the British Empire narrative and carried as if it was our own Big mistake Sat Orc from Mordor Youd better read Karl Marx he predicted all that as the inevitable stage of capitalism development it has nothing to do with UK or anything else but greed It of course has to do with the UK The Queen Bitch and people say like Bertrand Russell have worked to corrupt and killenslave billions They workedwork tirelessly to change the metrics to those that are more corruptible in order to be able to fill the reality gap with their bullshit The same ideology has been acquired and utilized for thousands of years since Greek times The western oligarchial system arose out of this and its what has learned to adapt to the times the American experiment and ascension Karl Marx was part of the system he just was a differing part of it Think of it like a king of years gone by having his minions be against the policies of another king That was Karl Marx Is he partially right sure but not for the reasons he thought For maybe a poor example if you watch something like Game of Thrones its apparent that ALL sides are playing a losing hand because the setup is wrong Liberty and freedom is more then Karl Marx or Austrian or WHATEVER Its about the human mind being free to overcome limitations human beings place on conquering the physical world and universal principles discovered or as yet undiscovered to prosper for themselves and ultimately everyone else But I understand your point He had a meme that capitalism will eventually destroy itself Not so black and white when it ceases to be capitalism when we stop adhering to capitalism or something more broadly that represents the tenets of it But we ARE at a point where everyone believes we run capitalism and the current tenets of what we call capitalism have produced policy that is so blatantly negative we are now irrefutably destroying ourselves in insane ways Sat Orc from Mordor You are talking of something which has nothing to do with reality mate The reality is the American imperialism which developed from capitalism exactly as Marx wrote a hundred years ago And all you see now is the result of capitalism and of its ideology individualism Sat Volaille de Bresse Youre right Obozo was awarded the Peace Nobel Prize right after he got elected to prevent him from being another warmonger He didnt follow the advice he led his own Neocon war and now hes concerned cos he knows that by Janauray hell end up in the dustbin of History just like Bush
