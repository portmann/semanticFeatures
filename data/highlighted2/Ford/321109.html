especially in Q There are three areas that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to focus on if they want a recovery Can they keep European operations in the black Can they become a viable EV competitor Can they penetrate APAC effectively especially China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F possibly delivered the best quarterly results in a long time but the stock continues its downward spiral In fact was a stellar year for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe returned to profitability after spending billions of dollars and making drastic changes to turn things around it became the bestselling commercial vehicle brand in Europe it recorded over a million unit sales in China and it made a record billion pretax profit To understand the current slide we must look closer at the some of the developments in the automobile industry in the United States and abroad over the last few months which I believe have significantly stacked the odds against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Here are the seemingly insurmountable odds that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is now up against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Electricians were Asleep at the Switch When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced that it will be investing billion by to electrify its line up by up to the plan sounded like an ambitious one to be closely watched Since then however the game has changed in a big way and it now looks like too little too late Notwithstanding Teslas NASDAQ TSLA promise of delivering a massproduced version of the much touted Model GM NYSE GM came in with a bang at the start of the new year with the unveiling of the Chevy Bolt I covered this in detail in an article called GM Starts EV Battle With A Bolt Of Lightning Though it will take a few more years for GMs Chevy Bolt to hit high production volumes its the technology knowhow that will be a game changer for the company To make matters worse for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Elon Musk recently announced that the Model will be unveiled on March this year and preorders can be made the same day with a deposit Easy million Id say At least With GM and Tesla now competing for essentially the same buyer segment that leaves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>coughing fitfully from the nonexistent smoke at the tail ends of two major EV entrants Admittedly it will take years before any kind of meaningful sales hit GMs bottom line and in Teslas case their aggressive investments in technology and research are already forcing them to scrape the bottom of the barrel but thats not a problem in the least at least not for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The problem now facing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is much larger than that Fords key competitors in the EV space now have the wherewithal to eat into the ICE segment and begin a mass conversion in the United States With Tesla that equation is fairly simple achieve price parity with ICE vehicles in the next few years and start claiming market share in what could be the future core market for automobiles Even GM being a leader in the ICE segment wont hesitate to make the change quickly if thats where it sees the future And weve already seen that CEO Mary Barra is not one to shy away from what she sees as one possible future for the automobile industry In Fords case their fate is further darkened by this an excerpt sent by Rod Lache a Deutsche Bank analyst to his clients Fords new F which incorporates a number of advanced but costly powertrain lightweighting and safety technologies represents one of the most prominent early examples of this forthcoming change At the same time the cost of electrification will continue to decline and a key finding of our study is that electrified vehicles should reach cost parity with internal combustion vehicles by the early s <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has tirelessly worked towards improving its bottom line in Europe but such is the nature of the competition that their turnaround now looks like it came too late Their operating margin in that division went from during the fourth quarter of to while sales improved from billion to billion for the respective fiscals Europe is the second largest segment for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in terms of revenue with near billion in sales compared to near billion in the United States Theyve turned things around in Europe and will continue to work overtime to make sure it stays that way However even more hurdles now present themselves The biggest of these is the cost factor linked to strict emission standards in Europe The same Deutsche Bank analyst Lache also said that the regulatory cost burdens facing the industry from new fuelefficiency mandates are unprecedented and the resulting increase in prices of new vehicles could dissuade consumers from making new car purchases in an environment of rising interest rates Though this will increase the cost for all the automakers in the future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe will be under tremendous margin pressure as its only now recovering from the slump Thats asking a company that just turned profitable to voluntarily increase their cost of production Id be surprised if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>doesnt start making some drastic resource cuts over the next few quarters Theyve already done a lot on that front but the question is how long they can sustain further optimization of an already stretched resource pool The company sold a record million vehicles in in China one of the biggest and fastest growing markets in the world Put that against GMs figures however and it pales in comparison The latter has been selling three to four times that many cars for the past few years alone accounted for million GM vehicles sold in the PRC Moreover the Chinese government is moving at an astounding pace towards more electric vehicles I covered this in detail in an article called Kandi Technologies The EVolutionary New Leader in China in December All three companies GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Tesla are well aware of the situation in this potentially largest market for their electric cars but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been the slowest off the starting line In fact I think they missed the starting gun altogether by the looks of it In an earlier article called Fords Electrification Master Plan I outlined their yearold effort to enhance battery technology and how it could potentially disrupt the market for EV batteries I still have faith now only a hairthin strand unfortunately that they will somehow manage to turn things around to their advantage in the next years The more I look at the situation however the less I think theyre on the verge of revealing a major RD secret and the more inclined I am to believe theyre just sitting on their thumbs The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus Electric is the only thing they have on the market right now and in its fifth year its still far behind the mile plus range that both the Bolt and the Model offer Investorspeak Fords Engines Failing to Fire Fords stock is in a dive more because of how the current industry landscape is shifting away from it than anything else Weve just seen the three biggest mountains they must cross to gain investor trust Electrification their Europe performance and the big China Challenge While theyve certainly made headway on the second hurdle they still have miles to go before they can keep investors happy about owning F stock China is not about to roll out a red carpet for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>any time soon Theyre not even giving GM or Tesla an inch against local players despite the fact that the two companies would be willing and even eager to have their EV cars made there On the electrification front theyve been in neutral gear for a long time and theres no sign that things are moving ahead So does that mean Im short F On the contrary I think this is a great time to buy if youre willing to wait for a few years for your investments to bear fruit The company has been around far too long to sit by and watch company after company beat them at their own game For now you may need to watch their numbers from quarter to quarter but that situation is temporary in the larger scheme of things and from the perspective of how old they are as a corporation In my most recent article Automakers Getting Run Over Load Up on General Motors and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>While the Goings Bad I outline why these companies are in a slump and why I believe that will not last Their time will come of that Im sure Perhaps GMs time will come sooner than Fords but both these stalwarts of the automobile industry certainly arent going to let a few bumps in the road be they molehills or mountains bring them to a screeching halt If you think this article has any merit I invite you to read and comment on my other articles on the automobile retail sportswear and other industries
