Seeking Alpha Our long term bull case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expanding globally remains in tact and we believe they are the clear choice for going long a US auto maker We wrote an article just two days ago talking about why we were invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F instead of General Motors NYSE GM The condensed version of the story is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to invest in itself rather than returning capital to shareholders in excess while its business remains status quo <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>doesnt have the major question of the ignition switch recall in the air Fords valuation while not as ridiculously cheap as General Motors is still attractive to us F PE Ratio Forward data by YCharts In addition to their low multiples the market hasnt been able to aggressively move either equity to the upside or the downside for that matter anytime recently To put it another way both companies stocks are in a holding pattern <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is in a holding pattern because investors are waiting to see if the companys large overseas expenditures reap a reward GMs shares are in a holding pattern while all of its contingent liabilities are sorted out When it boils down to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>specifically we like that the company is spending its cash increasing its global footprint and trying to drive profits in its segments other than North America The companys investments in countries like China and Russia where it has built out infrastructure are forward thinking moves by the companys management They may cost a significant sum and burden the stock now but as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>once again grows into a global powerhouse these foundations of infrastructure will allow the company significant operating leverage going forward When we see an announcement like we saw this week stating that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to continue to build out its operations in North Africa we feel good because we know the company is pushing the ball forward This in turn validates our continued long term bullish thesis on the company Tuesday mornings news was that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had announced it will expand operations in North Africa with new offices in Morocco In addition and according to Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stated it had plans to launch seven new vehicles in the region this year and build out a local supplier network and that retail facilities are also slated to be opened in North Africa in Fords official press release can be viewed here The companys effort to boost sales in South Africa where luxury vehicles are in demand have been successful This article from early May details the progress theyve made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Co on Tuesday reported record sales and market share in South Africa driven by a slew of new products and renovated dealerships The Dearborn automaker said it sold vehicles last month up percent compared to the same time a year ago Sales through the first four months of the year are up percent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also posted a percent market share and ranks second among all automakers who sell there Three years ago Fords share was between percent It really boils down to having great products and great dealers said Jeff Nemeth president and CEO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>South Africa Weve really been broadening our product lineup <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has planned to introduced new products in South Africa this year and has already introduced the Transit Transit Connect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fiesta and Fusion Nemeth said We have called an investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a winwin in the past Weve stated that we see Fords future as its valued today to hold one of two of these winwin scenarios They can either continue to execute their business plan slowly and steadily the market will notice and the stock will respond Well collect dividends in the meantime The company can continue to move its chess pieces into place across the globe as theyve been doing and wait for the proper moment to pounce and announce surging profitability across many segments other than the US We are pleased with the progress the company continues to make globally We are also hopeful that once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does begin generating substantial amounts of cash from its global operations that it will start to deleverage its balance sheet Once capex comes down and the company gets to this point we can then ask the question of whether or not the company should be freeing up more cash for shareholders For now aside from the dividend were glad that question isnt on the table As weve stated in the past we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still at a jumping off point for global profitability and with the equity priced at just x of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expected to earn next year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to look like a nice place to have some capital In the face of the companys continued global expansion and the recent news that the company has moved into North Africa <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to be our preferred way to invest in the US auto market For more of our continued coverage on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>you can read all of our articles here Heres a piece on why we have a target over Source
