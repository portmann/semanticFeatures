Energys SM Management presents at Wells Fargo Energy Symposium Brokers Conference Transcript Seeking Alpha Gordon Douthat Wells Fargo Securities All right well go ahead and get started Im Gordon Douthat with the equity research team here at Wells Fargo and this morning were pleased to welcome SM Energy Weve got Wade Pursell here to present Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jennifer Samuels IR in the back Good morning everyone Thanks for your interest in SM Its great to be in New York this time of year isnt it But it is a tough time in the oil and gas business I dont have to tell you guys that For those of you that know me what a difference the year has made right A year ago I had a full head of hair okay maybe not but its been a tough year And not just for us and our peers you guys too I dont envy your job in the least trying to figure out when the macros is going to turn what the macro is going to do and then which companies to invest in when youre making those decisions Im sure you want a company thats a top tier performer with a solid balance sheet and lots of inventory and frankly that sounds a lot like SM Energy I hope youll agree with me at the conclusion of the presentation this morning So I have to warn you Im sure Ill talk about the future a little bit this morning and Im definitely not a prophet but I would summarize those words There is again top tier performers strong balance sheet lots of economic inventory and that inventory is in some of the best basins in the country the Williston Basin the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and over in the Midland Basin Ill kind of take you through those areas this morning Its going to be a very simple presentation this morning Im going to organize it around those three main points so lets get started Top tier performers its always a big question what metrics do you use when youre measuring performance in the EP industry I think it has to be cash flow growth as well as production and reserves growth but not just growth for the sake of growth economic growth And then whats the best way to measure that I think everyone would agree on a per share basis and even better yet on a debt adjusted per share basis I think is the best way to measure that performance Theres really no place to hide when you think about it if you measure it that way So you can see on this slide we look at this this is an annual metric so youre looking at and us versus our peer group and you can see we were in the top tier top quartile in each one of these metrics through The other thing I think were the only company thats been top tier on each of those I think the other thing that jumps off the page at me every time I see this slide is how many of the peers dont even grow on this basis And if you think about it this was during a period where commodity prices were pretty robust the whole period so just keep that in mind and this should be a really interesting slide when we put the metrics in More recent performance this is third quarter we released this information about a month ago Solid quarter outperformed our guidance I think every quarter this year we beat expectations pretty handedly Production was up its up over levels Costs were down LOE was down about over the comparables levels in And CapEx continues to fall I think the best example of that is the cost of the wells in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>now are about below where they were a year ago I will talk about that further later in the presentation The other point we made and Ill reiterate it today havent given any specific guidance on yet The other thing we are saying is that were building a program that well spend within our EBITDAX levels next year From an activity standpoint were exactly where we thought we would be We started the year at rigs Were now down to seven rigs and thats primarily in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the Williston Basins The other thing thats interesting on this slide the line going up into the right represents our count of drilled but uncompleted wells Were now projecting that well end the year at about DUCs as we call them Thats higher than we had previously anticipated and thats really due to the faster drilling times that were experiencing So this program of reduced activity coupled with cost falling as they are is resulting in a budget of about billion this year which is below levels So I said strong balance sheet how do you define strong balance sheet I think theres three main ways to do that that you have to cover one as total debt compared to your cash flow the other is how much liquidity do you have and the third is what does your maturity schedule look like So from a total debt standpoint we ended the third quarter with x trailing EBITDAX Lots of liquidity Our borrowing base recently has been redetermined at billion We had about million drawn on that at the end of the third quarter And then from a maturity standpoint the nearest term maturity on our longterm bonds is So a strong balance sheet You look at those metrics relative to the peers and stack up really well probably the most important metric we have to EBITDAX were well below the peer average of a little over x The other thing Ill say is this is a pretty strong peer group that were comparing to I mean you guys all know theres a whole lot of peers out there with credit metrics much worse than this Final slide on balance sheet relates to hedging We do include hedging as an important part of our financial risk management program We hedge volumes out four or five years All those hedges that we have in place currently are in the Appendix of the presentation If you want the details relating to Ill tell you we havent guided production but if you just assume flat production was where we are currently our hedges cover about of our production next year Okay so the last piece was economic inventory About a year ago for the first time we quantified how much inventory we believe we have and we said we had about billion barrels of oil equivalent and thats a big number for a company our size If you compare that to production last year thats about x so a pretty good number And its in as I said earlier its in the Williston Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and also in the Midland Basin These are some of the best plays in the country and the economics stack up very well with everyone in the industry So I think the more exciting thing about inventory right now is now just those numbers that we released last year but the belief that we really do have the potential to double those numbers that we just showed you on that slide and its really in each basin In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we have some of the thickest pay in the area anywhere between feet and feet thick its energetic ph In those numbers that I just showed you we were assuming very conservative spacing and frankly primarily just the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Ill get to that in a minute The Bakken interval well talk about Divide County where were most excited right now In the inventory numbers weve only assumed Three Forks and Ill show you in a minute that were very encouraged that the Bakken is working there as well And then finally in the Midland Basin not unlike a lot of folks we believe that there is at least five intervals of interest here and weve only touched a couple of those todate So lets go through each of those areas real quick starting with the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Those of you that know us well know that this has really been the growth engine of the company in the last several years very large productive position for us You can see the production has gone from beginning in to currently about barrels a day Thats about of the total companys production The position is located over to the West You can see the Mexican border on the western edge of our acreage Weve got about net acres A little over of that we operate with the remaining being operated by Anadarko So youll hear us seem a lot recently better wells better cheaper wells better wells at lower costs This slide I think is a nice demonstration of the cost reductions in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>not just the drilling side but the completion side So starting with the drilling side you can see that were drilling these wells for about less than we were a year ago and its not just the reduction in the services costs its also the efficiencies Were drilling them in about reduced time period versus last year And then on the completion side costs have really fallen Theyre down about this year versus last year on a per lateral foot basis So you combine all of that and you get the number that I quoted to you earlier Total drilling and completion costs are down about versus last year in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>So what about inventory thats what we were talking about earlier As I mentioned before we have especially from an energy standpoint some of the thickest pay in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>you think about feet to feet thick but thats a lot of pay And I will repeat what I said earlier the numbers that we were reporting in the inventory was based on very conservative spacing and really not much contribution from the upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>So what weve done is weve put in place a very aggressive testing program nine pilots that you see listed on this slide to test the acreage to find out how many locations we think we have by pushing the spacing by testing the upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The first five of these nine are already producing or flowing back Pilot number one you know weve given a lot of data already on and those wells are now producing the tight curve I can tell you theyre continuing down performing on the tight curve Pilot two still a little early but thats a well test over in the East as well I should have mentioned that the first pilot is over in the eastern area and you can see on the map where these pilots are located Regarding two its still too early to report any results on that well test I will remind you that we anticipated lower pressures on these wells and thats what were seeing but were seeing good production so far just too early to make any conclusions Pilot three Ill come back to in a minute We have some news on that Pilot four and five swinging over to the North side our programs that were really excited about and hoping well be able to talk about those in the coming months but certainly still too early to tell on those So I mentioned that we have some results to share with you on pilot three Let me back up for a second to locate it on the map You see that pilot three is down in kind of the southern part of our position so here it is Its a well test in the W style design testing both the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>So you can see on the map to the right where those wells are located two in the upper three distinctly in the lower The point Ill make from this slide that you can see is how aggressive the spacing is foot planned new spacing on these wells and you can see that the multiple facies to the left and this is testing in the facies and Early data very encouraging This is showing you the production showing reliance for the upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and you can see both of those are now handedly outperforming the tight curve Ill point out you can see it these wells were choked back early on and finally through November we were able to release them and let them produce and youre seeing the very positive results now Equally as important and as encouraging is the pressure data relative to these wells and you can see that both in the upper and the lower were seeing very strong pressures hold up and thats very encouraging to this as well I think theres no interference which is great I guess the final point on these wells that Ill make if you know the acreage very well you know this is kind of the gassier part of the play so thats not great But the thing thats exciting to us here is we think this has huge implications for our ascensions in the whole eastern area with respect to the upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and spacing And as you also should know that that area is in some of the most economic wells in our play So you can see why were excited about the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Lets turn to the Bakken where we also have a very large asset about net acres up in northwest North Dakota and eastern Montana Kind of the area of focus for us right now is up in Divide County near the Canadian border You can see that yellow blob in the middle thats about net acres very large position for us We have about average working interest in that area so if you imagine net acres a very large position that were controlling in the area So why are really excited about it We really do believe we have the geological sweet spot here If you think about that map of Divide County this is kind of in the center of the county where it gets shallower I guess about or feet Its very thick pay and the water cuts are lower So what you end up with is lower cost wells which are also very productive so very good economics here I dont have a slide in here for the Bakken showing the lower costs as I did in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but I can tell you were seeing the same things in the BakkenThree Forks For example I think the most recent well we drilled was about down and indiscernible feet of drilling was done in days which was pretty amazing What I have done is included a slide on improving economics were seeing by going to plugandperf from sliding sleeve That comes with a cost obviously If you think about these wells costing about million using sliding sleeve I told you they were really low costs adding about million a well for plugandperf that you can see from this slide that the benefits far outweigh the costs You can see that were outperforming the tight curve and more importantly the IRRs are significantly improved So what about inventory Ill take you back to that slide where we talked about the amount of inventory we have companywide The numbers that were assumed in the BakkenThree Forks there assumed only the Three Forks up in Divide County At the time based on the logs we were assuming the Bakken would be wet and would not work Thats turning out absolutely to not be the case and were testing that this year Weve drilled about nine wells now in the upper part of the acreage in the Bakken and you can see theyre actually outperforming the Three Forks tight curve so very encouraging Weve now drilled two wells in the southern part actually completed those so we should be able to report some news on those pretty soon as well So you can see while were excited about the inventory in the Bakken as well And then finally the Permian position we have more economic inventory I say This is a very contiguous position we have about net acres in the Midland Basin kind of right on the border of Midland and Upton counties If you know the area very well you know that this is where the best Wolfcamp B wells are being drilled and Ill talk about that in a minute But first of all on inventory weve only touched I mentioned earlier a couple of intervals here and we believe weve got at least five intervals of interest in this area So were looking forward to testing those and if we start thinking about net acres start thinking x or x becomes a lot bigger position So were very excited to get back to work in the Permian frankly In the reduction of activity during this year we dropped our rig in our Permian I think back in May and frankly that was just because it was easy to do Our position is HPP We didnt have any longterm rig commitments so it was easy to slow down and wait on cost to fall in the Permian So were excited to get back to work here probably in January So I mentioned the Wolfcamp B this is just some recent state data on all the wells being drilled in this area and what is shows is that our wells based on early production early IPs are actually the best in the area So obviously a testament to the geology but also to the guys and pushing the completion designs more sand et cetera and doing a really nice job hitting the right landing zones which is very important here So looking forward to I mentioned excitement about getting back to work in the Permian It shouldnt shock you that we say were going to be focused on the best returns right We always do that but its particularly important in this low price environment So what you could envision with that is some slight allocation away from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a little bit into the Permian and the Bakken the oiler areas Weve already started completing the oily DUC wells up in the Bakken later here in the fourth quarter It should have a very minimal impact on CapEx because of starting so late And we continue to focus in talking about bigger wells at lower costs and obviously still working on the inventory continue to test and see how much we got in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and up in the Bakken Divide So I told you it was a simple presentation I hope you sense some excitement about where we are right now at SM Energy Look were not doing cartwheels down the hall at oil and by gas but we are excited about the opportunities that we think that gives us to differentiate SM Energy from a lot of the peers and thats what were doing and working on And we really believe coming out of this were even going to be stronger and thats exciting to us So hopefully when you think of us youll remember top tier performer with a strong balance sheet and lots of economic inventory Thank you again for your time and interest Thank you Wade We do have a little bit of time We can take a couple of questions So Ill kick it off You mentioned a number of things about in the various basins a number of initiatives youre undertaking to double the inventory And just as you look forward into I know it will play some part of your program but how expensive will those initiatives be as you look to formulate your program Theyll play a very large part As I mentioned we certainly havent guided anything for next year but we have guided the fact that were going to spend within EBITDAX If you think about the rig count were at now the seven rigs Ive told people before if you think in terms of two or three rigs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a couple of rigs in the Bakken and one or two in the Permian you end up with a program thats probably pretty close And within that program we certainly have a very significant amount of the testing that youre asking about that well continue to do And certainly one of the trends from you and across the industry in this downturn has been doing more with less With kind of that general framework out there how might that translate to and beyond And then also with the DUC inventory that you have there how do you kind of weigh all those within the context of your balance sheet and leverage Yes its hard to quantify anything in that question but directionally I certainly anticipate wells getting better Amazingly were still working on different things with completion designs and improving well results I think if prices stay down here or continue to fall I think cost will continue to fall as well So that will be part of the more with less And what was your third Well from a balance sheet standpoint I think Ive said that were going to close this year around x Thats part of the idea of working with an EBITDAX next year to keep the balance sheet metrics in areas that were comfortable with so that will play a part of it as well And sorry working the DUCs down that will clearly have an impact As I mentioned we have I think you need to think in terms of ish or in that ballpark of an area that we probably have normally anyway But the first half of next year well be pretty aggressively I think working that count down and obviously that will be very efficient productive capital since the drillings already been done so that will be part of it as well Good question If you didnt hear the full question without the mic is if weve had some great production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the past years and with some reallocation of capital to the Bakken and Permian what would be the impact of that on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I certainly cant guide any production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at this point but everything equal its going to slow it down a little bit Were not going to be focused on production for the sake of production Gas production is pretty easy right So when youre allocating oil thats going to slow the production line down a little bit and its going to make it more economic which is what were all about Copyright policy All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha
