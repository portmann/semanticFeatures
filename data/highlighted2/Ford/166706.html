sales in China have dropped of late as the countrys economy is slowing down and the stock market is under stress Since China accounts for of Fords sales weakness in the region has created a negative impact on the companys stock price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however can make a comeback in China as it is focusing on key growth hotspots such as SUVs budget cars and luxury cars In a smart move <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has added three SUVs to its China lineup as the segment grew in July indicating that it is targeting a key growth market aggressively Chinas luxury car sales are expected to grow at a year till which is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expanding its Lincoln dealerships in the country There is no doubt that China is an important market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F which is one of the key reasons why the companys stock price has taken a beating in the past three months A slowing Chinese economy coupled with weakness in the countrys stock market has created pressure on Fords stock price performance as the company gets of its sales from the country In fact a slowing Chinese economy has pushed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares down by in the past one year as concerns regarding the companys profitability in the country have surfaced since dealers are forced to give steep discounts to move inventory However I think that the weakness in the companys stock price performance in the past year is an opportunity in disguise as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is making smart moves to overcome the problems in China Lets see how Fords management has shown the ability to weather the storm in China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sells its products under joint ventures with two local Chinese automakers With Changan Automobile Company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>makes passenger cars and SUVs while with Jiangling Motor Corporation or JMC it builds commercial vehicles mostly vans from Fords Transit lineup The commercial vehicle division ie JMC has suffered more loss of sales among the two joint ventures in China in recent months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hasnt declared its August sales for China yet But at the end of July sales at both JMC and Changan were near about flat as compared to the same period last year Additionally June and July were the months in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>posted negative growth In fact in July Changan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw a sales decline of which was better than the industry sales decline of But JMC put up a poor show by selling less commercial vehicles as compared to last July Now the decline in sales is not surprising as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>said in its Q earnings call that it foresees a slowing Chinese economy by analyzing the slowing commercialvehicle market in the country for several months As a result in response to the imminent slowdown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>China has made some smart adjustments in spending and production in order to cut costs and optimize margins in a scenario where vehicle pricing is under pressure Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems to have identified the bright spots in the Chinese market which is why CEO Mark Fields recently made a statement stating that he is still bullish on China While the auto industry in China is seeing a downturn the SUV segment is still going strong For instance SUV sales rose in July yearoveryear To capitalize on this trend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has added three new SUVs to its product lineup in the country The new SUV models include a fivepassenger version of the Edge and a sevenpassenger version of the Edge that are being manufactured by its Changan Joint Venture Further the Everest SUV recently went into production The Everest is a midsize SUV based on the platform of Fords Ranger pickup and is equipped with offroad capabilities Most of Fords offerings in China at present are suitable for urban uses only Thus the new Everest SUV should prove to be an appropriate model at this time to complement the companys existing lineup <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>already sells the Kuga EcoSport and Explorer SUVs in China and by adding new SUVs the company is giving itself a stronger chance of capitalizing on this growth segment Moreover since SUVs generally carry higher margins a growing SUV market will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>offset the headwinds that it is facing in China Another segment that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is targeting in China is the budgetconscious families The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escort which is an entrylevel vehicle positioned between the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fiesta and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus was launched recently It carries a conservative style and is equipped with a spacious backseat to strike a chord with its target customers On the other hand although Fords focus area in China is the SUV segment the company believes that there is potential in the premium segment too The company is already selling its luxury vehicle Lincoln in China since late last year and plans to open eight Lincoln retail outlets in seven different cities in the region Considering the fact that the Chinese luxury vehicle market is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of till I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is doing the right thing by focusing on this segment Apart from Lincoln <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has also launched its new flagship sedan the Taurus In the next few months the Taurus will be produced by the Changan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>joint venture and will carry the nameplate of Golden Bull It will be positioned as a vehicle for selfmade and successful business people Moreover this model has been designed exclusively for the Chinese market Despite headwinds in China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is taking smart steps to counter the problems It is getting more aggressive in the SUV market and also focusing on the luxury brands in an effort to tap the growth hotspots in the Chinese market As a result I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to make a comeback in China in the coming quarters and since the country accounts for almost onefifth of its global sales growth over here will have a positive bearing on its financials Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
