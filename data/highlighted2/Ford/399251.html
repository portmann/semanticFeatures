Financial Officer Vice President Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Marshall Hampton Carver Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by Welcome to the Carrizo Oil Gas First Quarter Earnings Call During the presentation all participants will be in a listenonly mode Afterwards we will conduct a questionandanswer session As a reminder this conference is being recorded Wednesday May I would now like to turn the conference over to Chip Johnson President and CEO Please go ahead Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Thank you operator and thank you all for calling into our first quarter earnings call Our management team is pleased to report another outstanding quarter for the company Our net oil production of barrels of oil per day was up sequentially and represents another record level for the company Our team has also continued to do an outstanding job managing our expenses as our unit costs declined by approximately versus the fourth quarter and our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>drill and complete cost has dropped another Given the commodity price downturn our key goals at entering the year were to protect our balance sheet hold our oil production for the year roughly flat with our exit rate and maintain the flexibility to quickly ramp up our activity in production once the commodity price outlook warranted it We remain on track to achieve these goals Our drilling and completion capital expenditure guidance of million to million is unchanged but due to further efficiencies and cost savings weve been able to increase our planned activity levels in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Delaware Basin during the year Based on the new plan we no longer expect to draw down our inventory of Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>ducts drilled on completed wells during which should increase our operational flexibility to respond to further changes in the commodity price outlook Although the incremental activity is not expected to have a material impact on production we are raising the lower end of our crude oil production guidance by barrels of oil per day following the strong first quarter production taking the range to to BOPD for the year Our land CapEx guidance for the year rises to million based on our outlook for additional bolton acquisitions We also recently completed our semiannual borrowing base redetermination Ill let David Pitts discuss the details that fall in the redetermination We continue to have significant capacity on our borrowing base as well as the new covenant package that increases our flexibility in the event of an extended commodity price downturn Now Ill turn it over to David to talk about the quarter David L Pitts Chief Financial Officer Vice President Thanks Chip and good morning everyone As Chip mentioned we had another quarter of record oil production at barrels per day higher in the fourth quarter and higher than the first quarter Gas production for the quarter was MMcf per day and NGL production was barrels per day First quarter production exceeded the high end of guidance primarily due to the continued strong performance of our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>assets higher than expected nonop production and lower than expected levels of voluntary curtailments in the Marcellus The first quarter included revenues of million of which million was attributable to crude oil During the quarter we realized of NYMEX for oil of NYMEX for gas and of NYMEX for NGLs each of which exceeded the high end of our guided realizations Total costs and expenses for the quarter were million or per Boe which was below our guidance and down from per Boe in the prior quarter We continue to see the positive impacts of our overhead expense reduction initiatives mentioned last quarter For the first quarter adjusted net income was million or per diluted share which exceeded consensus earnings estimates of per diluted share Drilling and completion capital expenditures for the quarter were million over of which was in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with the remainder weighted towards the Delaware Basin Included in the press release is our second quarter and full year guidance For the second quarter we expect to realize to of NYMEX for oil to of NYMEX for gas and to of NYMEX for NGLs DDA guidance for the second quarter is now to per Boe The decrease relative to the first quarter DDA per Boe is primarily due to the ceiling test impairment recorded in the quarter In the aggregate guidance for second quarter costs and expenses reflect lower cost per unit than the guidance for the first quarter we provided in February This quarter we also added interest expense to our guidance table We estimate that gross interest expense for the second quarter will be million to million with a split of million to million for interest capital loans and million to million for net interest expense Due to the positive impacts of our overhead expense reduction initiatives mentioned earlier we have reduced our annual guidance for cash GA to million to million which reflects a reduction in our cash GA from Currently have hedges in place for of our estimated crude oil production for the balance of These consist of barrels per day of swaps at per barrel and barrels per day of collars that have floors and ceilings Additionally we will receive million of cash flows through the remainder of related to our prior hedge transactions Based on crude oil strip prices as of yesterday we expect to receive million to million from derivative settlements during the second quarter For the first half of we currently have swaps covering barrels of oil per day at per barrel We plan to be opportunistic about adding additional hedges for in order to protect our cash flows Details regarding our derivative contracts are included in the press release As Chip mentioned we recently completed our spring borrowing base redetermination which resulted in a borrowing base of million down approximately from the previous borrowing base of million In connection with this redetermination we amended our revolver to replace our netdebttoEBITDA covenant with a secureddebttoEBITDA covenant that has a maximum ratio of times We also added an EBITDAtointerest covenant with a minimum ratio of times Our new borrowing base and covenants provide us with ample liquidity in the current environment and increased flexibility in the event of an extended commodity price downturn Further details regarding the amendment are included in the K we filed this morning Ill turn the call back over to Chip for an update on operations Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Thanks David In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we are producing from gross or net wells with two drilling rigs running and one frac crew During the first quarter we drilled gross or net operated wells and completed gross or net wells Crude oil production from the play was approximately barrels a day for the quarter an increase of approximately versus the prior quarter At the end of the quarter we have gross or net operated Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale wells waiting on completion equating to net crude oil production potential of more than BOPD We currently expect to drill approximately gross or net operated wells and frac gross or net operated wells in the play during That is basically one less frac and eight more wells drilled in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>than we had guided to previously The one less frac will be fracked in the Delaware Basin adding to that frac count and the drilling additions are due to the lower cost drilling Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells Our focus on cost reductions and efficiency gains continued to bear fruit during the quarter as we were able to lower our expected well costs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to million from million per well This reduces our PV breakeven price in the core area of the play to approximately Our downspacing tests in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continue We currently have three staggerstack pilots on production that are testing the effective lateral spacing of feet to feet and are currently fracking two additional pilots on a different acreage block We estimate that a successful staggerstack development could add approximately to net locations to our drilling inventory In addition to organic inventory expansion we have also been focused on expanding our acreage position We recently added net highquality bolton acres to our position in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The new acreage is contiguous to our North LaSalle position which has an estimated PV breakeven price of less than a barrel We estimate that the new acreage adds approximately net drilling locations to our inventory equating to a to increase in our core area inventory and almost equaling our wells drilled in We were able to acquire the acreage in a creative manner as we funded the acquisition through the sale of noncore exploration acreage In the Delaware Basin we completed our third operated well the Liberator State H during the quarter The well was tested for days before being shut in pending infrastructure and full restart of the Ramsey Gas Plant The well tested at peak hour rate of approximately Boe per day prior to being shut in Given the strong results from the Liberator State well coupled with the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cost reductions we have elected to increase our Delaware Basin activity during the year Weve added two additional wells to our drilling plans with one of the wells expected to be drilled on recently acquired acreage that offsets the Liberator State well We expect to spud this well later this quarter This well will be the Corsair H and have an foot lateral In the Niobrara we are producing from gross or net wells with gross net wells waiting on completion at the end of the quarter representing about net BOPD of potential initial production Given that our acreage in the play is primarily held by production were likely to limit spending in the Niobrara during Our current plan calls for the completion of several drilled but uncompleted wells later in the year as well as some nonop activity For the second quarter total company oil production is expected to range between and net BOPD For gas and NGLs second quarter production should range between and net million cubic feet per day and and net barrels per day respectively The sequential decline in production during the second quarter is consistent with the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year and results from the planned shut in of a significant number of Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells due to offsetting completion activity coupled with a limited number of wells brought online in the first quarter following the frac holiday in December Additionally since two of the pads we plan to complete are large it results in an extended period of downtime for the neighboring wells We expect the second quarter to be our low point for the year for oil production and expect this to ramp into yearend positioning us well to accelerate production growth in if we have an appropriate commodity price signal Thank you And our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust Please proceed with your question Neal D Dingmann SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc Morning guys Say Chip just maybe just two quick ones today Just on sand concentration and all I guess you were talking about efficiencies and all Optimally you think youre at that or does it I guess my questions is two questions there One what is that optimal amount and how does that vary by your areas John Bradley Fisher Chief Operating Officer Vice President Hey Neal This is Brad Fisher As far as sand concentration goes were pretty happy where we are right now in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at around to pounds per foot What were working with right now is redistribution of that sand within our frac stages Right now we only put about of our sand in our slick water portion of our frac which makes up about of the total volume Were looking at shifting a little more sand into slick water to try to create a bit more complexity there Neal D Dingmann SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc Got it And then just secondly I went back looking back at one of your older presentations Chip where you talked about breakeven for some of the areas like your top areas like Gardendale Brown Trust RPG et cetera How much does that differ today versus I think the last one I saw was maybe I dont remember a few months ago at least Im just wondering if you could give me an idea of some of those better I think breakevens you had at the time was as low as around and with an average closer to about or so Im wondering if that given the well cost and the efficiencies where that would be today Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director We think it dropped to per barrel for the breakeven price in the entire core area Neal D Dingmann SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc Brad Carpenter Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hey guys good morning and congrats on the great quarter I guess Chip to start the acres in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>thats a nice add given how tightly held everything is down there in the quality areas Could you give us any details on how you came across this asset and if youre willing the price that you paid for this acres I didnt see anything in the release Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director No weve been trying to buy every good acre in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for about two years So were aware of everything and every block that might be potentially an acquisition so this is one weve been looking at for some time It turned out that the seller wanted something we had so we were able to make a pretty creative deal that looked a lot like a trade Brad Carpenter Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay Great So no real cash exchange Brad Carpenter Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay And then I guess a followup from a broader portfolio management perspective Youve discussed the possibility of selling your DJ assets in the past and yesterday we saw a fairly sizable package trade hands just to the west of you Just curious if the valuation that you saw in that package changes your thoughts on the potential to move forward with a potential DJ sale of your own Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director I guess what that transaction showed us is that we dont want to sell this asset too soon unless we have a great use of proceeds And weve said that before We dont want to sell assets at the bottom of the market unless we need the money to buy assets at the bottom of the market and we dont right now So we think that the Niobrara with the proven potential in multiple layers that is worth per net undeveloped acre which is what most people think Noble got for that deal is a good number And thats not even Nobles best acreage If you look on their presentation youll see that East is one of the areas they highlight and thats where we are and are partners with them So we have high hopes for the Niobrara We dont want to sell it cheap And so well just hang onto it Brad Carpenter Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Morning guys So costs have come down pretty materially You guys mentioned that the well costs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>coming down a little bit and breakevens are now down a few bucks Does that give you a better feeling about wanting to hedge out and maybe production at this stage How are you guys thinking about that Are you guys set with current levels of hedge protection Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Well thats a good question and were going to discuss that at our board meeting in a couple weeks We need to factor in the changes in our bank covenants now which are quite a bit different than these debttoEBITDA covenants we had before We need to factor in these lower costs The futures market is a little different than it was So basically weve said well hedge about a year out and so well be looking at third quarter hedges during the third quarter of So were pretty well hedged in the first half of and very well hedged this year So were in good shape that way but as far as how much we want to hedge in third quarter in a market thats running up like this we havent made that decision And would you most likely go the swap route or would you guys look at some other type of option Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Wed look at collars We havent made that decision but the prices have rallied enough now that collars might make sense At very low prices they dont At least not to us and thats why we did swaps But as prices rally and theres more excitement on the upside then collars might make more sense And then one final one for me If prices continue to stabilize or maybe even improve further from where they are you guys add a rig say late this year early next year just theoretically How quickly could we get first production on that first well thats drilled with that new rig after you guys ultimately say go Just want to get a sense for how you guys would think about timing if you did intend to bring on some additional activity Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Well what weve looked at is adding a frac crew instead of a drilling rig Because if we add another frac crew in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we can basically go for about six months with the inventory we have and the pace were adding inventory with the two rigs we have that we dont have to add another rig for six to eight months So once we decide to grow we can do that pretty quickly with a frac crew We already have the inventory and the infrastructure and so it would be very quick Wed be adding production in a month Brian Michael Corales Scotia Howard Weil Good morning guys In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we saw a big drop in the cost on the wells What was the major driver there John Bradley Fisher Chief Operating Officer Vice President Hi Brian This is Brad Fisher The last time we really gave an update on our well cost was back in November Since that time with the kind of gen rigs that weve got with better motor runs better bit motor pairing and the fact that we have to do a lot less steering on our wells now because weve drilled wells across all our acreage So now were pointtopoint drilling rather than doing so much steering Weve cut two days off of our average well out there Between that and a significant decrease in the amount of dollars were spending on casing Casing costs have come down a lot Since that time weve received an additional discount on our fracs And were playing around with our frac chemicals a little bit and coil tubing drill outs are down significantly So when I add all those together I come up with about in savings and thats the driver to go from million to million Brian Michael Corales Scotia Howard Weil Okay And then switching to Delaware I think you all have two more completions to do this year What is the timing for that Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Brian Michael Corales Scotia Howard Weil Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development Good morning and thank you for taking my questions I wanted to follow up on the question just a moment ago about how youd reaccelerate when oil prices hit that magic number Does six months you talked about of inventory does that bring you down draw down all the ducts to zero or does the six months still keep you at a normalized kind of run rate level of uncompleted wells Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director No I think by my math after six months we still have ducts and after nine months with normal drilling wed have seven So we have a lot of flexibility in that regard Okay Thats helpful And twothirds of the rule of thumb people usually say twothirds of the well cost is completions How should we think about funding that acceleration or we allow just rising cash flows to help give you the incremental spend Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director I think everything we do would be based on rising cash flows under any sort of normal price signal because if we had a giant price signal might stretch into the revolver to ramp up faster But thats not what were anticipating Thats really helpful And then just last one for me The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>oil mix dropped a few percentage points sequentially Was there anything noisy that happened over the quarter Is the a good run rate we should think about from here Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development This Andy Agosto If you look back at our GOR in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>it bobbles around depending upon where were completing wells primarily We did bring on a number of wells in some areas that had a little bit higher GOR That was probably the single biggest reason but no theres nothing fundamental going on thats going to change the oil gas mix Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Hey John Its Jeff I think something else which is influencing it a little recently is the difference between produced volumes and sold volumes I think our flaring probably went down a little bit so were actually selling some additional gas in some areas some things like that So historically if you look at it that percentage has bounced between to And it can be influenced quarter to quarter based on the things weve talked about And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital Markets Please proceed with your question Jeff S Grampp Northland Securities Inc Good morning guys Question on the stagger stack and I understand its maybe a little bit premature to comment on results of the producing pads but it looked like you guys are bringing a couple more test pads online here Just wondering if youre doing anything different on the completion of these upcoming based on some of the results that youve seen todate or are these just another data point in another area I guess just trying to get a sense for the strategic significance of the additional stagger stacks versus the ones you already got online Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development Yeah This is Andy again The latter point is spot on I mean these would be tests similar spacing configurations but in different geographic area Jeff S Grampp Northland Securities Inc Okay Completion wise though you guys are sticking with the same recipe that you use on the initial stagger stack Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development Well I think on the completion side as Brad mentioned earlier were going to be experimenting with some different things particularly with respect to sand concentrations in the slick water stage or portion of the jobs But no were not going to make a significant deviation on completion technique so we can compare the results fairly with the prior well that weve drilled in the area Jeff S Grampp Northland Securities Inc Got it Okay And then back on the well cost front Do you guys kind of have an updated estimate on of the cost reductions if we go back to kind of peak in to where youre at today estimate on whats internal efficiencies that are more sticky versus just kind of help from the service guys And the next question comes from the line of Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Sorry Jeff We were having a little discussion on your question Yes Honestly most of what were seeing from what were calling our base case back in when oil was to versus where we would end up if oil reversed course and went back to I would say of that is going to be from discounts from the service companies and about of that is going to be from efficiencies that weve gained over that timeframe And the next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice Please proceed with your question Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Good morning Maybe just one quick followup on Jeffs question You look at the stagger stacks between the three current pilots and the two that youre completing Are they fairly well spread across your Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>position or are they fairly concentrated Just trying to get a sense as to how much of that inventory increase can be figured out through these first few pilots Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development Well the this is Andy again The pilots the three pilots we have producing and the two additional would be focused in an area that represents to of our future locations So we think the results are going to be representative for a very large portion of this portfolio Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Okay great And then I know youre testing between foot and foot spacing on these first pilots is part of that driven by I know in your current inventory you have some at foot spacing and some at foot spacing Are the tighter spacing on the stagger stacks in areas where youre already drilling on tighter or how were those designed Andrew R Agosto Vice PresidentBusiness Development Everything were doing were testing now is in areas that we would otherwise be drilling at foot spacing in the lower part of the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Okay And then Chip or maybe Andy again but on the second quarter production levels Im assuming most of those offsetting completion operations are going to be in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Are those pretty weighted throughout the quarter Or from a timing of getting that production ramp back up is it something that we should expect for the full third quarter Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Hey Ron its Jeff I mean all of that activity is in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations I mean thats where the majority of production is so thats where the major completion activity is going to be in the quarter So these are big pads were taking offline when were having to frac some of these wells So we simply shut the pads in the offsetting pads in a few weeks before we do a completion so they can be offline for an extended period of time So thats a lot of volume that were just not going to have during Q So once those completions are done we bring all that stuff back on so you should definitely see an increase in Q just because we wont have that same level of downtime Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC Okay Great And then maybe one biggerpicture question We asked earlier about how long it would take for you to get some production to respond And if you float that across to the industry if oil prices rebounded and people started increasing activity Chip any color you might have on how long you think it might take industry supply to start to reverse from this decline that weve been in here for a couple months Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Well I think in general itll take longer than its going to take us because we have the ducts and the infrastructure and were sitting in the middle of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which is theres a lot of service company equipment there already I think in some of the other plays its going to take longer to get the equipment Its going to take longer to get the crews put together A lot of the service company personnel has left the industry And it could take longer than we anticipate I think for industry to add a lot of rigs and frac crews and start get production back up So I dont see how it happens in less than six months for most companies Jeff P Hayden Vice PresidentInvestor Relations Hey Ron Its Jeff again One other thing Ill add to that thats maybe a little different for us versus some of the other guys in the industry is I mean we still have some slack in the system on the completion side I mean our current plans still assume the pretty significant frac holiday later in the year So we could increase our completion activity without having to add any additional crews any additional people And I think thats where one of your big bottlenecks is going to be So I dont know if everybody can do that but I think thats one of the reasons why we might be able to bring on additional production maybe sooner than some others once we make the decision to increase activity Ronald E Mills Johnson Rice Co LLC And our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Please proceed with your question Marshall Hampton Carver Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC Yes Good morning So in your press release you mentioned that early results from the down spacing in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are in line with your expectation What was your expectation Whats your expectation to have some communication or no communication or can you give any Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Well our expectation is it will what we used as a threshold is that we need at least six months of noninterference for the economics to work And so thats what were looking for Someday there will be interference There has to be But the math works on the economics if you can get six months of noninterference Marshall Hampton Carver Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC And how many months in are you on the longest ones Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director The longest one is right at six months The next two are at four to five months And then the next two are fracking now Marshall Hampton Carver Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC Okay And you havent seen any interference yet Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Were meeting expectations We havent seen anything negative And our next question comes from the line of Chris Stevens with KeyBanc Please proceed with your question Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Hey Morning guys Just wanted to touch on MA again if I could If you could talk about maybe whether you think there might be some opportunity to make a little bit more of a significant acquisition at some point in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>especially as some other operators seem to be deemphasizing their plans out there Or do you think going forward its going to be more of the type of bolton acquisitions you did this quarter Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Well well always be trying to do the bolton deals but we are trying to do a bigger deal at the same time So were talking to just about everybody in the play There have been some sales packages on the market lately that are finally starting to have some quality assets in them Usually the whole package is not quality but at least there are some in there So were looking at those kind of packages Wed like to do something bigger than acres per quarter But if thats what we do thats still thats a great addition Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Got it Yeah And then what about over on the Delaware Basin side I mean would you do something bigger over there in a more derisked area of the play Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director We have tried in the Delaware Basin have been out bid significantly So I think the competition over there is worse than it is in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>probably because there are so many smaller companies in the Delaware that are selling things and so many more PEbacked shops that are trying to buy things Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Okay Understood And I guess what are the recent AFEs out there in the Delaware Basin that youre getting on these upcoming wells And are you going to try anything different between either the completion design or different zones or anything like that John Bradley Fisher Chief Operating Officer Vice President Hey Chris this is Brad Fisher Right now were expecting our well cost depending on the actual casing program that we run and it varies across our acreage a bit Anywhere from probably about million to million drilled and completed As far as trying different completion techniques right now were fracking with an Eagle Fordlike frac out there a little heavier on the slick water but higher sand concentration More in the range of pounds per foot We are varying our landing points in the various wells depending on what we see in the offsets and what the pilot holes look like So we have several different tests going out there for different intervals So its not been consistent across the play at this point And our next question comes from Brian Velie from Capital One Securities Please proceed with your question Brian Taylor Velie Capital One Securities Inc Good morning guys Most of my questions have been answered but I just wanted to follow on on the bolton acquisition real quick The increase or the tick higher in CapEx for land this year from million to million despite the fact that you almost traded for the acreage you picked up this quarter Should we think of that as more bolton size stuff becoming available I know youve been on the hunt there for a long time Is it finally starting to free up at least in that kind of scale package wise Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director Yeah thats whats driving that increase is we were able to make some smaller acquisitions acre to acre deals in the Permian and we also have a couple of smaller deals in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>right now that are in the acre to acre category So we just have more of them that were confident were going to be able to close Brian Taylor Velie Capital One Securities Inc Sylvester P Johnson President Chief Executive Officer Director If there are no more questions well move on then Thanks again to the Carrizo team for an outstanding quarter Its always great to set records on oil production and Boe per day Going forward were very excited about the staggerstack testing and the fact that we are close to the finish line I think on two or three pilots And that could change our drilling inventory significantly and the way we go about our operations The Delaware Basin results on the Liberator and now on the well were drilling the Corsair should be very exciting and that could help us to determine our capital levels in future years as we try to add more acreage So it was a very good quarter Were looking forward to the results of this quarter and well be back in days Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today We thank you for your participation
