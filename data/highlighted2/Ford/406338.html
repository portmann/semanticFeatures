reports of particular interest is that this cut to orders is about upcoming iPhone not about the wellpublicized iPhone slowdown The timing would be right about now for early wafer starts for silicon for September launch of iPhone and it seems market participants agree However as Bloomberg reports for investors contemplating prospects for the smartphone market after a shaky earnings report from Apple Asian suppliers just provided a few hints Its going to get worse before it gets better Three suppliers that seldom command much attention working behind the scenes to make devices sold under the brands of betterknown customers put out backtoback earnings reports Tuesday They spell trouble ahead for smartphone makers and other companies that once thrived on mobile mania Pegatron Corp which assembles iPhones missed profit expectations and said April sales dived percent Minebea Co which makes LED lights for mobiles lagged its own forecasts for revenue and earnings Japan Display Inc which supplies screens to Apple and others said profit has deteriorated so rapidly it will lose money for the fiscal year and suspend a promised dividend Adding to the gloom Lenovo Group Ltd tumbled to a fouryear low as analysts warned of rising competition Asian components makers are positioned early in the supply chain so they often signal whats ahead for giants like Apple Samsung Electronics Co and Xiaomi Corp The iPhone maker offered evidence of a deteriorating market with its first quarterly sales decline in years Now some are bracing for a possible triplewhammy sliding sales an unfettered marketshare competition and crumbling prices The smartphone industry will continue to slow down this year said Richard Ko a Taipeibased analyst at KGI Securities Co Competition will worsen and prices will likely continue to fall Thu Catullus Because there is no product innovation and who the hell needs a better camera when the batteries dont support it or the resolution Thu Vampyroteuthis Thu Theonewhoknows Thu KnuckleDraggerX The iPhone is hipster bait It looks like people are starting to go back to dumbphones so I guess Im finally cool Dumped it for the Galaxy s My god what a far superior product Steve Jobs is dead and apple will sadly soon follow Innovation had been non existent since his passing Shades of Blackberry Thu rpboxster I gave my iphone to my kid and got a Nexus x I dont miss a thing even though Ive been an iphone user since the first gen Once fingerprint unlock came to X and P I made the switch Truly cant justify the AppleSamsung high end price tags in view of these Nexus offeringsmarginal performance differences at half the price unlocked Thu Lorcas Novena I see dead hipsters and idiots with apple stickers on their cars driving off cliffs in my dreams

thesonandheir Thu duo Gee when people had to pay up front for a phone instead of month for years they suddenly found them expensive Thu jnx Youve hit the main reason right here although my monthly bill was always the same regardless if I was subsidizing the phone or not I never minded subsidizing my phone with att because I am never leaving them anyway so being locked into a year contract was something I didnt care about Then they went to this interest loan over years where you pay a month extra for the phone until its paid off when you never had to do that before and all this legalese mumbo jumbo about what happens to the phone if you leave before its paid off etc just confused people myself included It is now cheaper in the long run to buy the phone outright and most people dont have to pay for one of these things hence the drastic decline in sales Thu rpboxster Which is why I got a G Nexus x for of the performance for of the price Great phone I dont miss my iphone at alland I was a longtime user of the apple ecosystem Thu Dr Engali Thu pebblewriter As a longtime fanboy Id say thats very true No real breakthroughs in a very long time Bigger screens and removing headphone ports dont count Thu jnx Past years at every Apple event when all my coworkers are huddled around the projector with the Apple conference on the big screen I always pop out to say let me guess bigger screen faster processor more memory and they just wave me away ZERO innovation going on there for at least years now I still prefer their phones over Android which I currently use now but Android has a lot going for it over Apple Android needs to develop some kind of integrated easy to use imessage txt message and phone sharing capability with their tablets like Apple does and then it will be no contest Those are the features I miss most from my old iphone Cook is more interested in how he looks in his skinny jeans than in making sure his company is leading the pack in innovation The board should have ousted him a year ago imo Thu TradingIsLifeBrah Thu nuubee In early Samsung or one of the other Jap TV mfrs announced it would not build a longplanned plant to expand flatscreen TV

smart they even got more charts and shit Thu mainstream medi Thu pebblewriter Got a great iPhone almost two years ago and my contract is up Why in the world should I spring for a new phone and new contract when I can simply replace the aging battery for IMO Apple screwed the pooch when they went all in on the iPhone disregarding all the other cool products that paved the way Thu RockySpears I got a Samsung SIII mini inherited it from No son years ago when his yr contract finished Battery is original and a new one is and I fit it myself Thu Lorcas Novena An decline in chips for the iPhone coming out next year is an decline in sales This Pos stawk should retrace back to realistic levels unless the FBIs and CIAs of the world will prop it up like the fakebook scam Does aapl even make computers anymore other than their laptop Apple originally had three cofounders The third cofounder a man named Ronald Wayne joined Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak but he left the company only days after it was founded He sold his share for only and got an additional payout of Had Wayne stayed with the company his shares would be worth around billion today Thu rejected I have a company provided ICrap

south_dreams Facebook is the one that scares me Worth nearly that much and no hope of ever selling anything This is the obama legacy Thu RedDwarf Apple sat still and now the industry phones have cuaght up and Apple has not come out with any new groundbreaking stuff Without Jobs Apple lacks the vision to stay ahead of the curve Thu Spungo Smart phones cant grow because everyone already has a smart phone Even I have one The future is still bright since most of us will never go back to dumb phones but dont expect market growth Thu WhackoWarner Who needs a cell phone I truly mean that Pagers worked for decades and did not interrupt every phase of life Who needs to be in constant touch with everyone or needs instant access to the internet emails This technology is so very invasive I will
