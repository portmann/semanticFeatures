Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>delivers sales growth for August beating expectations Industry factors and vehicle demand are both driving growth for the company Amidst fears of a China slowdown and another day with the markets covered in red <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F delivered some good news to investors absolutely crushing analysts expectations with a yearoveryear gain of for the month of August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was not alone with Fiat Chrysler posting a gain despite predictions of a decline and maintaining its month streak of monthly sales gains GM NYSE GM also beat expectations declining yy which was much less than analysts expected However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was the real showstopper Going through the data we see that Trucks really powered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>ahead with the segment growing yy primarily driven by the new F FSeries delivered its best August sales results since increasing almost with the F EcoBoost representing percent of F retail sales in August and growing yy For months limited supply led to doubledigit declines in the F sales but now that production is ramping up to full capacity the demand for these vehicles is clear And keep in mind the FSeries alone accounts for over of all vehicles sold in August making up the bulk of Fords revenues so this is a critical sign of strength for the company Vans also reported phenomenal growth at making it Fords best August Van performance since and SUV sales grew the best August sales performance for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>brand SUV lineup in years These gains are even more impressive when you consider that Labor Day sales are not counted in August this year as it falls later on the calendar This is the most critical point to understanding just how strong sales were in August Labor Day weekend is a huge sales weekend for car manufacturers and dealers and for the past several years it has been included in August So the comparisons were really tough to beat because the previous numbers included the sales and volume of Labor Day weekend while the current ones do not I believe this point also addresses the issue raised earlier today by another article that highlighted total YTD sales as still being below s sales numbers K vs K Although it is technical true that is still lagging YTD sales I believe YTD will show positive yearoveryear growth once the Labor Day weekend sales are included for this year in next months data So how exactly did <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and others manage to exceed expectations without their key weekend Two reasons oil credit Without a doubt cheaper gas prices had to have played a role in the August sales beats were seeing from several companies finally providing a positive side to the collapse in oil prices and the energy sector that has been such a drag on the economy The strength seen in larger vehicles sales trucks SUVs etc supports this idea as these segments powered not only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but also Fiat which saw strong growth from Jeep and Ram The other piece of the equation is most likely increasing access to credit and better financing terms for consumers at least in the auto sector The combination of lease deals loans extended from the traditional year terms to years and increased subprime lending all help to manage the monthly payment for customers I believe this smaller monthly payment size will likely continue to be a tailwind to the industry in general over the next few quarters even as the Fed moves forward with its plan to raise rates Overall this was a stellar month for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sales and September promises to be even better Furthermore the solid monthly sales data from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GM and Fiat provides another positive data point for the economy Taken together with the positive data coming out of the housing market you can see that the US economy is continuing to move in a positive direction This will benefit all auto makers however <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems to be capitalizing on it the most due to the strong demand for their vehicles particularly the Fseries trucks I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will outperform as these trends continue yet the stock continues to sell off with the broader market It is now trading below x earnings and sports a dividend yield well over making it an attractive buy for opportunistic investors Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
