class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GM Both Or Neither Seeking Alpha Automobile and light truck sales in the US have been on the upswing lately Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM reported significant sales increases last quarter The financial crisis took a toll on US automakers While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F made it through the crisis without assistance from the US government GM NYSE GM went through a debt restructuring and received assistance from the US government Both companies also received concessions from the United Auto Workers UAW and exited the financial crisis as smaller and more nimble companies Auto and light truck sales in the US experienced a major decline during the financial crisis and are have been on a slow recovery since Automobile and light truck sales in the US are up this year and if the July and August sales pace holds up it will be a banner year for US auto sales August sales came in at an annualized rate of million units The last time US sales were this high was in The mix of vehicle sales in the US this year so far has been dominated by light truck and SUV at the expense of traditional cars as well as electric vehicles and hybrids The table below shows the mix of vehicle sales in August All of the car and minivan segments were down significantly while pickup and most SUV segment sales were up significantly Not broken out separately in the table above plugin EV sales fell off significantly from the August pace The August estimate of EV sales came in at versus a year ago a drop of roughly Tesla NYSE TSLA sales are running roughly below last years pace One explanation for the shift in sales away from small and midsize cars towards SUVs and light trucks is the price of gasoline which is down to about per gallon in my area Cheap gas equates to more people buying larger vehicles This should be good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM as both earn significantly higher margins on their larger vehicles though both will have to figure out how to move their vehicles from other segments as well Overall it should be a good year for US auto manufacturers as the consumer seems to be in a buying mood and the average age of vehicles on the road in the US is over years Overall revenue for GM has been slowly trending up over the last years while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>revenue has been generally up over the period but with some variability For the analyst consensus is that GM revenue will come in at B a decline of from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expected to achieve B in revenue an increase of about over For the EPS consensus estimate for GM was but that was before GM settled its case with the US Justice Department GM recently announced that it would take a charge of M against third quarter income which will reduce EPS GM did not indicate how it would disposition the remaining settlement amount of M M total but Id expect that GM will take another charge against fourth quarter earnings Charging the total M against income will drop expected EPS to about per share Even with this most recent write off GMs EPS is expected to be up almost over the per share earned in Note that GM also took a nonrecurring charge against earnings in of per share Without that nonrecurring charge GM would have reported earnings of in Fords consensus estimated earnings per share is versus in an increase of almost over Earnings for for both companies are expected to be up substantially Both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have been struggling with negative operating cash flow with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>struggling more than GM on this front As a result of running negative cash flow and continued capital investment both companies have been growing their total debt Based on expected revenue and income for GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may be able show positive operating cash flow GMs debt has been rising much faster than has Fords However GM has a distinct advantage here as it went through a managed restructuring in and was able to shed much of its large debt burden GMs debt to equity ratio was a modest as of the end of Q while Fords ratio stands at Both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>carry a just barely investment grade credit rating from SP of BBB Both companies are looking for an upgrade to their credit rating with the expected improved financials in The automobile market in the US is highly competitive with several large and strong companies vying for market share The graphic below shows the change in market share of US auto and light truck sales from through June of Both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have seen their market share continue to shrink while the new FiatChrysler Group has picked up additional market share There are a number of smaller manufacturers not included in the graphic above that have also picked up market share in the US namely Hyundai Kia and Subaru All three have aggressive marketing and sales campaigns to further cut into the market share of their larger peers This does not bode well for continued growth in GM or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The current high pace of auto and light truck sales in the US is raising the fortunes for GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in but will not likely be sustained In order to grow both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM have to regain lost market share in a very competitive market GM just recently reinstated its dividend in March of at an annualized rate of per share and raised it once to a current annualized rate of per share That dividend provides a yield of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reinstated its dividend in January of at an annualized rate of per share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has raised its dividend three times since reinstatement to a current annualized rate of per share At that rate Fords dividend provides a current yield of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM have managed to recover significantly from the financial crisis and have recently reinstated their dividend payments Income or dividend growth investors may be tempted by the currently healthy dividend and increased sales volume to add <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>or GM or both companies to their investment portfolios I will be continuing to watch and monitor the financial performance of both but I am not comfortable recommending either company for conservative investors of which I am one at this time Im in the neither category Both companies continue to lose market share to able competitors While may be the year of the turnaround both companies continue to struggle with negative operating cash flows and continually increasing debt to equity ratios While GM just recently settled its criminal charges with the US Justice Department it still has the overhang of several lawsuits associated with the ignition switch recall to work through Finally the UAW and FiatChrysler have negotiated a new contract which will raise the cost of production for the big three automakers going forward I believe it is too early to invest in either GM or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at least for me Im going to watch and wait to see if either or both of their financial recoveries has staying power Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
