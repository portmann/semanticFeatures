Toyota stands out as a unique player in the US auto industry compared to the homegrown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM have an equally expansive global footprint matching Toyotas but is it really the same Recessionary resilience is an important mark of a wellrun global organization especially a capital intensive industry like automobiles Whats the missing ingredient in GM and Fords mix Ask Toyota As US Automakers came out of recession <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and GM NYSE GM have steadily grown their top line worked double time to increase profitability in key markets outside the United States and slowly moved our sentiments about the companies into a positive one I have written about this extensively in my previous articles the latest of which was published early Thursday morning US Automakers Update Market Successfully Corrects Its WorstCase Scenario In that article I also praised both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM for the things theyve done But everything only seems to be going well as long as you keep your eyes away from their financial statements For the past few years sales have been as good as it gets figuratively speaking With average automobile sales in the United States hovering around the million mark both companies have fallen back to their complacent mode essentially both have failed to learn the lessons of the recession Their respective sales and top lines have once again become highpriority items while fiscal prudence ranks very close to the bottom of the list From this viewpoint it makes sense to compare the alpha male Toyota TM OTCPKTOYOF with both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to see what single big lesson the latter are yet to learn In terms of operations Toyota GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are all global companies but Toyota leads the pack with million vehicles while GM sells million and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does million each year Now lets jump from that into the net profit that each of the three companies makes every quarter If you notice a disparity thats because there is one and a huge one at that Just because youre big doesnt mean that you have to earn less So the worlds largest automaker seems to have the largest operating margins as well Except for when the wrath of the recession was felt Toyota remained profitable We all know what happened with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors but that is not the problem itself The key point here is that once economic activity returned Toyotas operating margin returned to near while that of both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM continues to languish Its an interesting position for the US automakers to be in because now they cannot cite their size as an excuse for not having high margins or can they blame it on the market or the industry or anything else because Toyota and Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY play to the exact same rules in every country including the United States Recessionary environments dont care if a company is Japanese or American every company goes through the same things essentially jobs are lost confidence tanks and money has to be watched carefully But the real test of a wellrun organization is how quickly it can get back to normalcy after the hardest period of the recession passes So how was Toyota able to bounce back so fast when GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>took several years to shake off the effects of the recession More importantly what is this factor that is creating a widening gulf between the top company and the rest of the field That answer can only come from Toyotas global footprint But its not what you think Of course GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have a comparable presence around the world but its the profitability of those segments that sets Toyota apart from the US carmakers Thats why a major recession in one or a few markets doesnt hit them as hard as it would GM or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>They have a measure of insulation from a recessionary environment because they arent dependent on one single market for their profitability not even one as large and mature as the United States Though I dont see economic headwinds soon you can bet your bottom dollar itll come and when that happens I just dont think GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are ready to handle it the way Toyota can The sooner they prepare themselves for tough times that may lie ahead the better it will be for both companies Be a King at Home but Not a Slouch Overseas Toyota is not so different from GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>because the company retains the crown in its home country Japan which accounts for nearly of its operating income The significant aspect of that figure is the that comes from other markets from North America and from the rest of Asia and other continents For GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however their home market is everything every other unit is either making losses or just barely profitable This is the biggest problem both these companies face and also one of the reasons why Toyota enjoys a much higher valuation compared to the rest GM PS Ratio NYSE TTM data by YCharts Investorspeak Singlemarket Dependency This is the biggest problem with a lot of US companies recently Even something as positive as a strengthening dollar creates headwinds for their overseas earnings Of course they cant change their home country just to avoid foreign currency fluctuations because it could work either way What Im saying is that they need to take their overseas profitability as seriously as they do their top and bottom lines at home Toyota stands out not because it is a Japanese company but because its global strategy does not focus on a single market or region You can see this clearly from the graph below even if you arent familiar with that part of their business Europe is their only weak point other than that they have spread their risk base across Asia North America Japan and other markets Theyve also managed to be profitable in all these markets unlike <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM Until the US carmakers double down on other markets and get them to the kind of profitability levels that the US divisions can boast of they run the risk of incurring significant losses every time the US economy dips In my opinion this is the best time to do it While both companies are relatively stable and have a good run ahead of them they need to figure out how to be as profitable overseas as they are in the United States And thats only the first step the more important longterm moat they need to build around their businesses is higher profit margins It the only way for them to grow from strength to strength and I see it as the only way forward if they want to be anywhere near Toyota and stand up and be globally recognized as companies with respectable valuations and recessionresilient operational models The increased dependency in one single market is the single biggest reason why their stocks remain volatile The moment the market thinks or expects even a mild shock to the US economy investors start to flee both the companies partly because of the aftertaste of prior recession and partly because sales will have to drop But its understandable and there is no way out as of now Till GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>start posting consistent profits outside and grow their earnings outside the United States the fortune of their stock is directly tied to just one single economy the United States Things are good now They have already had a string of successful years and if they dont change the current status quo outside the United States within the next four to five years it will be an extremely hard ride for investors who have given these companies their hardearned money Please follow me for engaging articles and insightful analysis on the automobile industry technology retail
