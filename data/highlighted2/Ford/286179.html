Disclosure I amwe are long F MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Fords automotive margins have been very strong in as the company has captured higher ASPs with new models But Fords margins are volatile and that introduces uncertainty into the stock I think investors are panicking for no reason as none of the disaster scenarios for vehicle sales are in place Automotive giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has been one of my favorite valuedividend stocks for a while now The companys shares are cheap and management has shown a distinct willingness to return extra cash to shareholders And given Fords success in recent years theres a lot of extra cash to put to work But of late it seems automotive investors are scared of the future as the stocks of all three major US participants <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GM NYSE GM and Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU have plummeted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is now trading for levels not seen since the panic crash last August and before that another panic low in October of At this very low price what are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors afraid of I dont believe investors are afraid of the companys ability to sell vehicles Industrywide sales numbers are strong and getting stronger so that is not the problem Indeed Fords own recent sales numbers suggest that momentum is robust heading into So whats the problem It seems investors are worried about margins as inventory levels rise fueling the potential for discounts in order to move excess inventory As it turns out we have some precedence for this kind of thing the financial crisis was the nuclear disaster scenario for margins as vehicle sales plummeted on skyhigh gas prices remember that and an elevated unemployment rate Lets take a look at what happened back then to Fords margins in order to gain some clues about what may happen in the next year or two To start all data was taken from Fords SEC filings and charts are my own In addition when I say margins Im referring to Fords automotive gross margins defined as automotive sales minus cost of automotive sales divided by automotive sales This chart shows Fords automotive gross margins for the last years encompassing the period leading up to the crisis and the time since We can see that Fords automotive margins have been all over the place in the defined period ranging from more than in to negative in Fords composition has changed since this period began but with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>brand making up the lions share of sales the overall trend is plenty sufficient for this analysis Fords margins have improved markedly since the crisis and that includes which has seen very strong pricing off of new models like the F Series and Mustang We dont have detailed Q data yet but assuming those results are even close to the first three quarters of the year we should end up with an appreciable bump in margins for the entire year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has done a terrific job of capitalizing on the launch of its F Series and that is showing up here as well with stronger margins But what happens if we see a slowdown in vehicle buying I personally dont see any reason why that would happen as the pieces of the puzzle that caused Fords disastrous drop in margins a decade ago are not in place Part one was high gas prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is heavily reliant on larger vehicle sales and those are generally less fuel efficient But gas is under for much of the nation and has been for a while now so high gas prices certainly will not be the cause of lower sales andor discounting The other condition that caused discounting was a recession that saw the unemployment rate skyrocket Obviously a financial crisis will cause consumers to pull back on spending and that includes new vehicles but again we dont have that this time around The economy isnt what Id call strong but unemployment is only and the Fed feels confident enough to raise rates So where is all of the weakness going to come from In short I think fears of a slowdown in the automotive sector are overblown the reasons why people stop buying new cars are not in place right now and in fact arent close to being in place The automakers may have overproduced some in the back half of as inventory levels have risen so we may see some discounting in early but we also may not It is possible that any discounting that is done is moderate and has little impact on margins well just have to wait and see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares are pricing in substantial losses in margins and I dont see any cause for that right now One thing Im sure about is that Fords margins are volatile and can swing hundreds of bps at a time That kind of uncertainty is a huge negative for the stock and I believe that is why shares are down so much But with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hitting almost gross margins in the first three quarters of it would take a financial crisis to get its margins to fall to levels where they would begin to eat into profits enough to justify the selloff that has taken place Investors are pricing in margins well below levels with F trading for just times forward earnings There is no reason to fear massive discounting for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in as the conditions that need to be present for that to happen arent present or even close for that matter Fords sales and margins may tick down in but barring some kind of disaster <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is cheap I think well still see margins north of in on strong sales numbers which would represent a slowdown from but still plenty for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to grow out of its trough valuation Investors are panicking for no reason and that is a buying opportunity Tagged Investing Ideas Consumer Goods </div></body></html>
