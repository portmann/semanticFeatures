It Too Late to Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F Stock Modest Money For the past few weeks Ive kept hearing about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F stock Since February th the stock is up almost However since this time last year its down nearly I decided to take a look at the details to figure out if its worth your time and money Learn how to trade

that a strong brand can create significant value for a company Branding is so powerful that it can give a company a halo effect Think of Coke do you know someone who will never stray from Coke and absolutely abhors Pepsi If a consumer deeply identifies with a brand image price becomes more inelastic increasing profit margins and significantly boosting the bottom line According to Consumer Reports CarBrand Perception Survey <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had the nd best overall brand perception of all automakers Toyota was the best Land Rover was the worst The companies were ranked on quality safety performance value fuel economy designstyle and technologyinnovation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>ranking this high in a consumer perception survey is extremely impressive to me This means that wordofmouth marketing and endcustomer experience are both powerful tools for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Discover the secret to uncovering the most profitable stocks If youve ever read any of my work you know that I love dividend stocks Right now Fords dividend hovers around which is great <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been increasing its dividend since so locking in now at current prices might be a good idea <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is one of those companies that I like to pick up in market downturns Not just because of the dividend but because American automotive companies are closely linked to consumer confidence When the general stock market falls risk aversion negatively affects Fords stock price From the beginning of the year to its low on February th the SP was down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also had a recent low on February th From the beginning of the year January th to February th <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock was down Both the SP and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have recovered since then and in step with one another Speaking of ups and downs of my biggest concerns is the automotive sales cycle In car companies achieved record sales Combine that with the Fed possibly considering another rate hike its highly unlikely that demand will be stimulated enough to keep the cycle peaking Another one of my concerns is the intense competition within the auto industry Toyota is the worlds bestselling automaker and ranks extremely high in consumer confidence Remember that Consumer Reports study I mentioned earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was in second place because Toyota was in first On top of that Tesla will soon launch its Model III which will be available for The move towards a more affordable Tesla has been forecasted as being everything from a massive success to an epic failure I personally think it will be a success since it has more massmarket appeal Critics have told me that there are already cheap electric cars in the marketplace but nobody is buying them in large enough numbers To that I point out brand strength once more Tesla has positioned its vehicles in the marketplace as trendy sexy and musthave cars for affluent customers Teslas success could potentially eat away at Fords car market share Not so much for trucks but the competition is enough to be acknowledged The fundamentals seem okay The PE is while the industry average is The PB is and the industry average is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a debtequity of while the auto industry as a whole has debt equal to equity Do I own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock Not yet but its definitely on my watch list If we have another market correction or a bear market I will be watching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>If the auto sales cycle goes into a downturn and we have a correctionbear market it could drive <span
