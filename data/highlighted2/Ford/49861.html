John Clayton who will cover our operating results Jim will provide closing comments and then open the lines for QA During QA we ask that participants limit themselves to one primary question and one followup Let me now turn the call over to Jim James E Craddock Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Thanks Toni Good morning everyone We appreciate you joining us this morning First quarter of has quickly come to a close and were very pleased with our start to the year Now that we have four months into the year we are focused more than ever on executing our plans to maximize shareholder value We remain committed to a program that does not outspend the cash flow we expect to generate or require us to take on additional debt Now lets review our key first quarter accomplishments We delivered strong production volumes averaging barrels of oil equivalent per day up versus the prior year We came in at the higher end of the Boe per day to Boe per day guidance range we provided last quarter Competitive results in both of our operating areas contributed to our progress At Gates Ranch we completed our best well todate Gates Ranch H well is currently producing at a rate of Boes per day That equates to an impressive Boe per day per foot of lateral This foot extended lateral well was competed with an enhanced stage frac design that our technical teams have been working to perfect We also successfully drilled three Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells at Gates Ranch as part of our pilot program to further test the potential of the thicker sections of the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Two of the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells were drilled in Row of the Ranch They will be part of testing the use of refrac on the offsetting Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>producing wells originally drilled in John will discuss our opportunities to test the application of refracs later in his remarks Another exciting accomplishment was in our horizontal development activities in the Delaware Basin We successfully completed three operated wells and participated in the completion of six partneroperated wells The day average IP per foot of lateral for our three operated Wolfcamp A wells averaged Boes per day outstanding result that compares very favorably to results of other operators active in the basin The performance of our wells utilizing the improved completion design is evident when compared to the current Wolfcamp A type curve Were very pleased with our progress in delineating the Wolfcamp A bench Our technical teams continue to work on improving the efficiency of all aspects of our operation As outlined in our earnings release we are reaffirming our guidance for capital and production decreasing DDA expense guidance Were still on track to spend million of capital for the year and live within cash flow On the hedging front we maintain a discipline hedging strategy and continue to evaluate opportunities to add derivative positions when pricing conditions are acceptable In our strong hedge position has been instrumental in protecting our revenue stream At the end of the quarter our hedge positions had a marktomarket value of approximately million as shown on slide Detailed summary of our derivatives position as of April is attached to the earnings press release Finally on financing and liquidity On April our credit facilitys borrowing base and elected commitment amount were reaffirmed at million and million respectively On May we had no borrowings outstanding with the full million in available capacity plus million of cash a solid million liquidity position proving excellent flexibility In summary weve begun the year delivering some great results on several fronts Progress weve made on cost efficiencies demonstrates that Rosetta can deliver differential operational performance Were focused and committed to the disciplined execution of our business and operational plan in Were closely monitoring the industry environment and our opposition with the flexibility and liquidity to respond to opportunities or adjust activity in a timely and resourceful manner We look forward to sharing our next update on our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>activities and the advancement of our horizontal program in Reeves County as well as progress on the other growth catalyst opportunities Now let me turn the call over to John Clayton for operational comments John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Thanks Jim and good morning everyone Today Im going to focus my remarks on the continued success we are seeing in our Delaware Basin Horizontal Wolfcamp program and also some very exciting results we are beginning to see with our new completion designs in Gates South I will also talk through a few of the catalysts that we are working on in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>specifically an infill refrac development plan that could positively impact both our lower and upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>plans And before I turn the call back to Jim Ill give a few comments on how we see our next quarter our full year and also a comment or two on where we are headed in So lets get started Please turn to slide number This is of our Reeves County position in the Delaware make meaningful progress with our Wolfcamp A and blue boxes are the operated wells are the red boxes are the nonoperated wells production during the I will talk in more detail about the operated wells however the general areas is turning out to be one of the best areas in the entire Delaware Basin The Billy Miner H well of the three completions It is located in the west central portion of the acre This well was completed with foot lateral and we used frac stages It had a sevenday stabilized production rate of Boe per day while the day stabilized rate was slightly over an outstanding per foot of lateral completion the Billy Miner H well and the Black Jack H well had lateral links of about feet were completed with to frac stages The Billy Miner well position and the Black Jack well is located about five miles to the east of that well Both wells had day stabilized rates of approximately Boes per day results in a very competitive Boe per foot of lateral Needless to say we are the results of all three of these latest tests Slide is a chart This chart plots the average day rate per foot of lateral completed The population of wells on this chart are our operated Wolfcamp A horizontal wells in the Southern Delaware Basin that we have completed with a slickwater frac design The wells are shown from left to right in chronological order As you can see across nearly miles of delineation we are seeing tremendous well performance that is fairly consistent at an average rate of Boe per day per foot of lateral This average compares very favorable to the results being reported by two other operators in the Southern Delaware Basin On slide number you will see the same completions averaged and then plotted on a ratecum plot against our published MBo type curve You can notice that so far the wells are performing approximately higher than the type curve something we are very pleased to be seeing Moving to the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>our technical teams have been working really hard tinkering with the completion more effective wetlaid rock In short we have been attempting to place more proppant at a much tighter cluster spacing Our latest completion the Gates Ranch H well located in the middle of Row in the southern part of Gates Ranch was recently completed with pounds of sand per lateral foot across feet of lateral On this particular well we downsized our cluster spacing to only feet and had five clusters per stage for a stage spacing of feet This well is currently producing into sales at a rate of Boe per day or roughly Boe per day for foot of lateral So in these depressed commodity cycles when some companies are cutting costs for cost to stake Im very pleased that our technical teams continue to be innovative and are investing in new ideas to further improve what is already a worldclass asset Slide number shows the location of our Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells drilled both producing and awaiting completion The well drilled in the northern most area of Gates Ranch is in some of the thickest Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>section on the Ranch which is about feet thick The other two wells that we drilled at Gates are located together in Row As you know this Row has historically been developed primarily with all lower wells So these two new upper wells were placed above some existing lower wells in a staggered pattern With that said let me explain what we are trying to accomplish with these new upper wells First one thing our LE Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pilot has taught us was that the areas that have thicker upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>performed better In the LE case they perform as well as their lower counterparts Therefore the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well in the northern most location will be testing some of the thickest Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at Gates Ranch Secondly we want to determine if it is feasible to frac an Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well that lies above two older Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells To do this we plan to test the viability of refracking the underlying lower wells immediately prior to fracking the upper wells This technique will apply stress on the lower well reservoirs which should help divert the upper well completion away from the lower wells and into new reservoir rock This is very similar to our buffer pad process that we have been using in the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>development for the past few years I would like to make a point about the refrac concept It is not simply a process to help us obtain more effective upper well stimulation it is also a method to change the orientation of the frac geometry of the lower wells and either stimulate new lower reservoir rock or more effectively stimulate the existing rock Other operators have begun testing refracs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and based on some of the data that we have been observing this application seems to be paying dividends Some refracd wells have even returned to their original IPs and even after six months to nine months of postrefrac production they seem to be producing a significant amount of incremental reserves Needless to say we are excited about testing this on our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>asset Lets now move over Briscoe Ranch where we have also had two wells drilled and awaiting completion in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>One is a foot lateral and one is a foot lateral Completion of the foot lateral will provide critical information not only by stimulating the thick foot Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>section but it may allow us to drill the remaining inventory at Briscoe Ranch by drilling across the entire width of the Ranch with one foot lateral rather than our current plans to drill two foot laterals to recover the same resource As a reminder Briscoe has some of the thickest total Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>section in the entire play at approximately feet My last comment on Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that we continue to monitor the progress of our pilot well at LE Lease in Central Dimmit County This pilot has been on production now for more than a year The crosssection on slide shows that this well was completed in the middle of thicker Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>section The updated production graph shows its performance And as you can see the upper well remains in line with its Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>offsets This wells performance is a very positive indicator for the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells that we have now drilled in the thick Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sections at Briscoe Ranch and Northern Gates Ranch So were looking forward to getting those completions underway Let me finish up with a little guidance We are reaffirming our annual guidance of million of capital and a production range of Boes to Boes per day When we originally provided this guidance we stated it would be more weighted in the first quarter and the fourth quarter of the year from both a capital and production standpoint These assumptions still hold true today Therefore for the second quarter of this year we are guiding capital to be approximately million and a production range of Boes to Boes per day For your reference slide outlines our guidance for the second quarter and full year Looking a little further down the road into we could deliver approximately production growth over our levels by spending about million in total capital In an extremely low price environment we could still experience modest production growth over this years production levels at a capital program of about million At this point it is obviously too early for me to provide more detail around our plans and we will revisit this subject with you later this year But I wanted to at least give you guys some insight as to how efficient we could be with our portfolio in a low price environment That concludes my operational remarks And as always I thank you for your interest in our operations and look forward to updating you on our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Delaware Basin activities and results on the next call With that Ill turn it back to Jim James E Craddock Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Thanks John We had a good start to with some great well results in our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Delaware Basin assets Were progressing in both of our core areas We will continue to work to further improve the efficiency of our operations at South Texas and the Permian Basin We have quality assets into the premier basins and maintain our competitive capital efficiency awestrucker structure and thats a key part of our ongoing success Before we open this call for QA as always Id like to thank Rosettas technical and business support teams for their focused approach to accomplishing the job at hand The teams commitment through these early months of has been exceptional And our first question comes from the line of Welles Fitzpatrick with Johnson Rice Your line is now open Welles W Fitzpatrick Johnson Rice Co LLC Can you talk a little bit about the costs on the H and what that new completion technique might make AFEs look at on a foot or I guess foots kind of the average goal for going forward John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Yeah Welles Ill tell you kind of how were looking at it Its very early but were not only encouraged by that first well although its only been on for a little more than a week now The second well thats coming up on a week looks pretty good too The let me back up and start from our type curve So for us in todays environment to drill a foot well with our old design which is tied to the type curve cost about million So if I use that as a starting point and I did nothing but change the completion design for a foot well it increases my cost to about million Now when I ratio that up for an foot lateral which is what this well was its about million So if youre comparing costs to lets say type curve performance its actually a increase in costs compared to the type curves I think that are in the Toni and Blakes deck So what were trying to ascertain on this is if you now look at the production uplift we are four times now its early but we are four times the producing rate today on the well when compared to the type curve and the expected production that we would have seen off of it Now we know the type curve is normalized for foot so you have to ratio that up for longer laterals and if you compared foot of what were seeing on this well to a type curve ratio to up for foot were times above that So its early but we really like tightening the cluster spacing and pumping more sand This well had pounds of sand per foot and if you kind of go back in time thats about or times the amount of volume of sand were pumping on these wells So anyway more cost for four times the production I guess is the short answer Welles W Fitzpatrick Johnson Rice Co LLC Okay Perfect And then for the followup do you guys have an initial kind of guess on a what refrac might cost and could you also use that technique that you described to just downspace within the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>back up on rows and John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Yes I didnt talk about it on the call Ill answer kind of your second comment Weve actually drilled a well on Row in between two of the older wells but we have a lower well on Row that we drilled in between two of the older foot space lower wells that I think we drilled back in So we are doing that I didnt mention it on the call Its a good project but I wanted to really emphasize not only the new completion techniques but the refracs that were going to try in the Upper Cost wise were trying to understand a little bit about the most effective way to get the fracs on the refracs converted Theres a lot of work being done now on some different products in the industry Were looking at all of them But I think a good starting point on cost is you could probably take the cost that it takes to complete a well and use that Youll save on some of the plugs but then youll get a little more expensive on some of the diverting material that were looking at So it gets you in a ballpark until weve actually done You can model just the original completion cost on a new well Although we wont be setting plugs and so forth but the diverter will cost a little bit more Welles W Fitzpatrick Johnson Rice Co LLC Thats perfect And thanks so much guys Thank you And our next question comes from the line of Will Green with Stephens Your line is now open I wonder if we could touch on the Southern Delaware I know when you guys first entered the play you were looking at first year declines that were pretty high and I thought slide was great kind of showing how you guys have actually compared versus the type curve which has been pretty good So I wonder if you could talk about how you guys are currently feeling about first year declines and EURs there at least how the type curves for the wells that are performing are shaping up John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Yeah Will this is John We used to have a plot and it probably is still on our website where we just plotted rate time against the type curve And if you look at those declines on that plot its probably out on our website the wells are produced if you look at some of those declines with the new fracs which are some that are on that slide with all the bars on it The decline seem to be a little less than what our type curve declines at Now some of these wells are pretty good now that weve increased real similar to what we did on the well were pumping almost three times as much proppant So its early but the declines I guess today if you ask were a little more optimistic about the declines compared to the type curve But Id probably reference you may be back to the rate time plot that we did I bet its on our website and then look at the actual decline compared to the type curve But I think youll see that the higher rate wells which is the one were pumping more sand on seem to have a little flatter first year decline But its pretty early and the geography is pretty broad across this area Great Ill take a look at that And then you guys kind of alluded to looking at your twoyear outlook I understand that the goal whenever you guys came out with that twoyear outlook was focus on the balance sheet and returns and really protecting liquidity With the price of crude kind of rallying here and costs coming down what it sounds like pretty well on the service side how are you guys thinking about the threshold of where you guys feel comfortable of adding activity Is it a balance sheet metric Is it something on the price of oil Is it a combination How should we think about your plans to potentially accelerate whats going to be the driver behind that James E Craddock Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Well this is Jim Good question The way we think about it again I think first and foremost is live within cash We the improvement in oil prices could give us a little increased flexibility And Johns laid out a number of what were calling kind of catalyst projects that are in that discretionary spending number that we talked about in the first quarter So well look at that Now keep in mind that were pretty well hedged And really as prices improve the component of our hedging thats associated with swaps we wont see a big change in the revenue associated with those until we get oil prices get up quite a bit higher So my thought is were probably going to be pretty close to the million weve guided to the difference the difference is I think were going to be able use a little cost savings a little efficiency to probably get a few more of the discretionary projects done than we were originally thinking three months ago John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Yeah Well this is John What I would add to it is if you look at our capital plans for the year its front loaded in Q and then its loaded in Q So if you just set an incremental savings and I think right now were in the to savings off of the fourth quarter but if you took another on the capital in the second half of the year it wouldnt accelerate a whole lot but that allow us to spin maybe million to million more and if we were able to realize another we could probably do a couple of more wells And I think our goal for that is to apply those to discretionary projects which would be these refracs in Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>because we learned so much more about our portfolio when we make those types of investments I know our Permian team is looking at refracing some of the old wells in the Permian basin that were drilled horizontal with old completion techniques just to optimize and see if theres opportunity there So we kind of look at these downturns as we may not be spending as much capital but the guys upstairs and girls upstairs that are doing this technical work have got a lot of ideas that I think we would fund with incremental savings to learn more about the portfolio Thank you And our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets Your line is now open Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Thank you and good morning Previously youve talked about defending an annual production rate of Boe per day maybe in an effort to preserve inventory for better pricing Why is Boe the level to defend and has that view changed at all when looking at the current strip that lacks much of a contango James E Craddock Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Dan I think Boe is still the number and simply put but thats kind of where we think we land with this years cash flow and living within that cash flow doing a balanced mix of projects I mean we could put more capital in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>less into the Permian and juice that production a little bit but we feel like its better to kind of follow this balanced approach And as John mentioned as we move forward in time and look at we think we can grow off of that level And as he said I mean if we spend roughly the same amount of capital were spending this year next year we can probably grow to the tune of or so off of the well be averaging this year Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Okay Great And as a followup just turning to the balance sheet with that previous question as the context where do you see leverage at the end of this year and again based on your outlook for of delivering growth on million in spending next year where do you see it at yearend John E Hagale Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President This is Hagale And what Id have to say is if you look at it just as draw on the revolver what Id say live within cash flow this year and next year so that ought to tell you that plus or minus a little bit youd think you wouldnt be very drawn on the revolver at the end of this year or next year all other things being equal And our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust Your line is now open Neal D Dingmann SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc Hey Morning guys Say Jim just a question for you I guess looking at I think for the last quarter mentioned about the three wells drilled in Gates and then you have the six in the Perm Just your thoughts I guess for mainly you were giving the sort of capital that you have allocated wellwise I guess is going to be somewhat similar as far as the direction of where that capital will be allocated James E Craddock Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Yeah I think kind of going back to what we said last quarter and then kind of updating we said for the full year we expected to do about Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells and eight Permian wells and thats completions And so far weve done wells in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>so weve got another six to do Weve done three in the Permian another five to do there And then the only difference would be there is the discretionary component and some of that could look like refracs So those dont were not counting those as unique new wells but we think well be able to allocate some funds towards refracing as we move through the program that John Clayton took you through So thats kind of the plan As John said well probably have a similar activity level in Q as were forecasting in Q and then an uptick in activity as we enter the fourth quarter Neal D Dingmann SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc And then Jim why not is it I guess is it because of the I guess just the explorations youre doing and new frac designs youre doing at Gates I guess my question would be given the great success youre seeing in the Delaware and it appears that just in todays environment theres better realizations in Delaware than the sort of gas your NGLs thats in the Gates Ranch and other parts of your Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Why not flip that and do much more in the Delaware versus the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>because of todays realizations James E Craddock Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Neal we like both areas and youre right were seeing some great results in the Delaware We have a pretty methodical approach Were still testing in both those areas frac designs but while you do see some nice realizations in the Delaware its hard to argue with a barrel a day Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well too And were also seeing very nice returns from projects like that So we like both areas We like a balanced approach here and I think well continue to pursue that Thank you And our next question comes from Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering Holt Company Your line is now open Michael J Rowe Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Hi good morning I just wanted to talk a little bit about your how are your assets your base assets are declining I think you mentioned about a base decline from kind of exit to exit previously And so I just wanted to get a sense for how is this going to look throughout the course of the year because when you look at kind of Q and Q and were seeing volumetric declines of around per quarter but youre still spending some capital to add new wells So can you just maybe talk about how the decline profile of that base changes as you get through later on during the year John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Hey Michael this is Clayton Yeah I would Ill go back and kind of mention what you had said So weve done a bunch of work at the end of last year on whats the base decline look like And coming into and going into I think those numbers you quoted were how I remember them too about a decline in the base production And then we took that same production and we went out months and then looked at the next year decline and I believe the number was and those dont change So we havent had enough history enough history behind us to make any of those adjustments and the base seems to be performing pretty well right now If you look at the decline we experienced from the end of last year into the first quarter you have to kind of go back and look at the number of wells that came on in the second half of as we turned from Row into Row and we brought on just a large amount of wells And you know when those new wells come on from a well basis not the base but just an individual well basis I think the first year decline is up in the to range And so thats those new wells that came on towards the end of last year was the incremental decline that we experienced here So that thats what gives us our as those wells will continue decline into this year and thats what makes this years base decline so steep One thing I would point out on production forecast I think Jim alluded to it both from capital and production Q ought to be very similar to Q not only from spending but also the production ranges that weve put out there And then we start ramping up a little both capital and production as we head into I will point out and its kind of background noise we had mentioned that our asset was a noncore asset Its a dry gas We divested of that property in April and I think on a Boe basis Although it was dry gas it was producing a little less than Boes a day We didnt adjust our production guidance kind of background noise Theres decline to that throughout the year but small divestitures like that we wont have those going into next year and we didnt adjust our production just because its not a big big mover Michael J Rowe Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Great No thanks for going through that And just switching over to Permian one quick question the longer term cumulative production on a equivalence basis is helpful One thing I was wondering if you could expand upon is how youre seeing oil cut trending since IP I think the your type curve has about a oil cut for the EUR so I just wanted to see if you had any kind of thoughts just on this early data around how those oil cuts are looking relative to your type curve Thanks John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President I dont know if they cut you off but Im assuming youre talking about the Permian If you look at the width of our Permian acreage its miles long so Im going to talk in pretty broad ranges here But there is a lower oil cut on probably four sections on our acreage to the far northeast We have a higher GOR in that area And then we get into oil cuts in the I want to say to range throughout the majority of our acreage As you move to the west now so as we move further west youll see on the map on slide I think it is its titled Permian Basin Reeves County its the lease map where the abstract changes so where the geometry of the surface lease descriptions up quite a bit of higher gas ratios in there So gas trends higher to the west but I believe the farthest blue line on our acreage position I believe thats the Blue Duck well and I believe it had and Im going off of my memory but I think it had oil cut And when we actually drilled that well we thought there was a possibility it would have a lower oil cut because as you go west it gets gassier And although its less than our type curve we were pleased that it was if my memory serves me right Anyway I hope that answers your question James E Craddock Chairman President Chief Executive Officer And just in case there was another part of your question there Michael If you are asking how oil cut changes with these wells over time were not seeing any variability really to speak of in oil cut over time Obviously all the wells are pretty new but we see that that oil cut holding in there pretty well John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Ill add before the next question I dont know if it was Dan or Neal about capital allocation In the Permian weve got some pretty terrific operators that offset us out here that are also trying numerous completion techniques and designs So it does help us a little bit with how we allocate capital If we didnt have them in our backyard trying some pretty good technical ideas we would have to go alone and that would probably cause us to allocate more capital but when Jim was talking I thought I would add that color to it Thank you And our next question comes from the line of Gordon Douthat with Wells Fargo Your line is now open Gordon Douthat Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you Good morning everybody Just on the scenarios you laid out Im wondering if you could provide any detail on the rig count or activity levels from a well count standpoint in the various scenarios you laid out for the next year John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President This is John Gordon The minimum commitment that we have in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is wells at Gates Ranch and Briscoe Ranch is HGP I dont have the exact well counts specifically for the cases our planning group ran I just pulled those numbers from it in prep for the call but its probably a dozen wells in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on round numbers and its probably about the same activity that we have in the Permian that we have this year because that eight wells of operated wells this year allows us to hold the leases intact So it probably goes from wells this year down to maybe wells or so forth next year is the way I Gordon Douthat Wells Fargo Securities LLC So those are your those are the minimum levels you can hold acreage Is that at those levels would you be able to grow production at the rate or what kind of growth or what activity levels gets you to those John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Right So two those levels were the million total capital level so for it wasnt surprising to us especially with the results that were getting in South Gates and we know that South Gates was going to be prolific than North Gates But when you hold the acreage positions together it takes about million And when we turn the crank on that model for we actually have modest production growth If you then allocate the same spending level that we did this year which was million so let me back up So the million tied to the into wells in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and then about eight wells in the Permian If you to the million which is the spending level we have this year thats the capital level that gets us to about a production growth off of the midpoint of barrels a day that were guiding to for Gordon Douthat Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay thats helpful And then I recognizing the strips somewhat flattens out here as you look into next year just trying to get a sense of what levels youd like youre looking for to add more hedges John E Hagale Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Were starting to look at them It curves in a little this is Hagale it curves in little bit as oil prices are going up We have not put any more on But Id say its starting to look interesting as you go out a little bit And our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors Your line is now open David Martin Heikkinen Heikkinen Energy Advisors John that walked through of the minimum spending and kind of million CapEx is really helpful One of the things that you mentioned around your discretionary spending being up with the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and refracs I was trying to think through how that fits into the range of outcomes around just kind of quarterly progression and then exit rate into into Like is there a volume sense that you can give us around just that kind of discretionary spending or is it really more defining resource and defining inventory as the objective John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Hey David Therell be volume with it Right now were trying to figure out the best way to get these not only the upper wells because were going to do the refracs at the time is get those refracs diverted So we probably wont be there was about million of discretionary that wasnt allocated and as we look going into the second half of the year we probably wont start Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>refracs until the third quarter So were not guiding towards an exit rate right now Ill just tell you the way weve got it modeled is the fourth quarters going to be a little higher than Q and Q Our spending will be up in the fourth quarter too but we dont know the exact timing of landing on the best completion technique to get that refrac diverted So we probably wont be starting it until Q So I hate to be very vague John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President with an exit rate but weve kind of stayed away from it because we are kind of trying to do what you said in your other half of your question was were trying to understand the resource with these investments And then once we do that on a smaller scale then we can apply it to a broader scale with a lot more capital in subsequent years But there will be volume associated with it and it wont show up as much on the annual as it will on the exit David Martin Heikkinen Heikkinen Energy Advisors And then with the carryover capital in the first quarter at higher level just trying to think about how you kind of allocate capital quarter in quarter out versus actual wells coming online that allow you to kind of dampen some of that decline and flatten out production is how it looks like things are flowing through Is that a kind of fair way of thinking about the fourth quarter and first quarter spend rate versus kind of the glide planning in and around your guidance for second quarter and then fullyear production Is that how its flowing through your models and just trying to get a better idea of how thats helping the second half of John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Yeah I think Im just sitting here thinking about what you said I mean thats kind of how we look at it too Jim mentioned we did Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells in the first quarter but I know that we only brought of them on And then the three wells that were talking about right here were actually first delivered in the second quarter So there is a lag John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President there is a lag on production tied the capital Sorry James E Craddock Chairman President Chief Executive Officer And then if youre talking about carryover capital from Q of I dont have the exact number in front of me but well spend because we had some capital Q capital maybe million or it was million or million that was spent in Q that was actually for stuff that was done in Q David Martin Heikkinen Heikkinen Energy Advisors Yeah Okay So thats kind of again giving you that kind of flattening into the summer before you start ramping CapEx again into fourth quarter Okay That explains things a little better This is thats helpful Thanks guys Thank you And our next question comes from the line of Chris Stevens with KeyBanc Your line is now open Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Hey guys Quick question on the new completion design at Gates Ranch is that the new standard on a goforward basis in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And also whats the average of lateral length of the remaining inventory over Gates Ranch John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Hey Chris Its John Second part of the question I think were right at about feet for the remainder of South Gates And then in North Gates I think those average about feet So thats the lateral length question Briscoe could turn into all foot laterals going forward as could LE because the width of LE lease is foot as well Weve got a wellplanned so let me talk about the design So we used to space our stages feet between stages This last well was foot between stages So weve tightened up the stages quite a bit Probably more importantly on the way I look at it theres a lot of smart guys working on this smarter than I am upstairs but we used to put a cluster of perforations every foot That well had the clusters put every foot Thats the lowest or the tightest density of perforations weve put in the well but I will not I would not say thats the standard We have a well coming up thats also going to pump foot or pounds per foot of proppant but were spacing the clusters feet apart So were still tinkering with it There seems to be a direct correlation in the amount of proppant that you pump versus well results but theres kind of a third dimension to it There seems to be a relationship at least early on the tighter you space these clusters the more effective youre getting the rock simulated So that well was the tightest weve ever spaced at foot but weve got one coming up thats at foot Chris S Stevens KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc Okay Great And if you could just update us on the recent well costs in the Wolfcamp and where you see the PV breakeven out there today John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Our latest well cost oh gosh I dont know what I dont know whats in our deck out there now but if you took a section long lateral and you pumped it with the increased proppant density were probably in the million to million range Theyre a little higher than the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And then the second part of the question what was it John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President I dont have that off the top of my head The AFEs were seeing today with the new proppant loading and all are well north of breakeven So Im not exactly sure of the breakeven right now but we may be able to follow up Blake or Toni can follow up with you on that Thank you And our next question comes from the line of Robert Alpaugh with Simmons Company Your line is now open Robert Alpaugh Simmons Company International Oh yeah just one quick question you obviously highlighted the opportunities for refracing in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I was wondering if the same opportunities exist in the Permian John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President I think theres thered be two ways to look at the Permian I think once we take and we being the industry once we pull enough hydrocarbons and volume out of the rock well change the stresses And then we could go back in later on and see if theres a refrac application So the mechanics of the refrac on changing the orientation of the second frac is what gives us unique reserves So we have to pull fluids out first But nearterm a lot of the wells in the Delaware side and the Permian weve started out being a linear gel type fluid And then it moved to a slickwater initiated fluid and then weve got some companies out there that are trying slickwater right now So were watching those results But there is the opportunity we believe in the nearterm to go into some of the vintage wells and attempt the refracs to have a more efficient completion technique But I think if you look at refracs whether theyre in the Barnett or even some of the earlier ones that are being done in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>there needs to be a year two of production first in order to get those stresses in the rock changed to go in and reorient that frac So I think there is opportunity its just not on our doorstep today unless were going in trying to effectively stimulate the rock better Thank you And we have a followup question from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets Your line is now open Dan E McSpirit BMO Capital Markets United States Thank you If I could just squeeze another one in here just on the DDA rate and guidance your footnote that favorable changes to the rate are anticipated at least with respect to fullyear guidance Any thoughts on where it could go or maybe what commodity price environment the current rate is reflecting John E Hagale Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Dan this is Hagale What Id say is whats in there now reflects the impairment we had in Q If prices stay low and we signaled this both in the K and in the Q if prices stay low there will be future impairments and those will impact it So those will impact the future DDA rate So this DDA rate for Q and for the year reflects the impairment charge that weve taken todate cant really give you an estimate for the future because its going to depend on commodity prices This is one based on month trailing commodity prices So you havent seen the full effect If prices stay where they are youre going to see further degradation of that Thank you And our next question comes from the line of Paul Grigel with Macquarie Your line is now open Paul Grigel Macquarie Capital USA Inc Hi Thanks You guys have talked about the potential for discretionary CapEx for a well or two Will there be any interest in heading to the Permian to maintain leaseholds on some of the lease expirations you guys have previously mentioned or would refrac be the more likely use of spending there John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Yeah I think if we use some of the discretionary in the Permian it would probably it wouldnt be to just drill incremental wells offsetting wells that we already know might not preclude us from going into a Bone Spring test or maybe a Wolfcamp B or C test The teams got a lot of opportunity there and we havent allocated any capital towards that in todays environment with the low price But I think the headline on it is discretionary capital goes to opportunities that we can learn from to open up our understanding of the portfolio and that would lead us to a refrac or maybe a nonWolfcamp A zone Paul Grigel Macquarie Capital USA Inc Okay And if it were between a refrac or the Permian is there a decision already been made on which one of those would be the higher priority John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President No not really There is a old well thats out there the Balmorhea well and I know that the guys upstairs are itching to refrac that because they think the rocks got tremendous potential with the increased proppant loading and the slickwater initiated frac but the decision hadnt been made Paul Grigel Macquarie Capital USA Inc Okay And then one just quick followup and apology if I missed it on the growth for under that scenario is that a fourth quarter to fourth quarter rate or a full year over full year Just wanted to make sure I had got that right John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Thank you And our next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering Holt Company Your line is now open Michael J Rowe Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Thanks for letting me squeeze back in here Just one more quick question the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the larger frac design leading to any more unexpected downtime than youve experienced with your prior ceramic design John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President No it hasnt Were still using the buffer pad concept so we still have wells shut in But now that were on a steady pace the downtime is transparent to the production Michael J Rowe Tudor Pickering Holt Co Securities Inc Okay And to be clear the budget that you have from a production standpoint is based on the type curves in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on the older completion design Is that right So that you wouldnt youre not baking in uplift that youre experiencing on these initial set of wells John D Clayton Chief Operating Officer Executive Vice President Yeah we did put without getting into too much detail we did put we call it proppant loading we did put a factor on our type curves when we went to the increased proppant north of pounds per foot This last well was pounds per foot So were obviously the expectations just to kind of a put you in the ballpark Michael the expectations on this well were probably on the high end Boes per day at this early on in the test and were double that right now So if you took the type curve that we used your ratioed it up for lateral length and then you put a little in for proppant loading youd get to that Boe per day range and were double that So that is not in the guidance that we did but I would just put an asterisk and say its still pretty early in the flow back but so far so good Thank you And Im showing no further questions at this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr Craddock for closing remarks James E Craddock Chairman President Chief Executive Officer Great Well thanks for your time this morning We look forward to visiting you again in August when well discuss our second quarter results So have a good day
