Alpha F has steadily raised its dividend yield over the past several years Analysts are projecting F with steady revenue and strong earnings As we move into earnings season for automobile manufacturers a lot of these companies are showing up in value screeners radars Recently we discussed Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU and its almost shockingly low PE ratios Today were looking at one of their competitors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F A much bigger company they have a common feature with Fiat Chrysler a fundamental lack of understanding among investors for where their revenue and admittedly limited growth is coming from Their value proposition is quite a bit different from Fiat Chryslers but in many ways just as compelling Founded years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the definition of a mature manufacturer The company has followed the rest of the auto industry through a very rough patch in the past decade and come out the other end in a much better condition and without the restructuring that companies like Chrysler and General Motors NYSE GM had to go through But now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a dependability in revenue and earnings few can match The relatively poor earnings in fiscalyear reflected some bad results on investments in affiliates and rising expenses but were quickly resolved The results and the Q that followed show that was an outlier The consensus estimates suggest that those strong results are only going to continue That FY results puts the trailing PE ratio at If the analysts estimates pan out were looking at a current and forward year PE ratio thats more in the range Either way thats a nice discount value play The dividends are the real story here though particularly its growth The regular dividend went from cents a quarter to cents to cents in just a couple of years In Q of this year the company also added a cent special dividend Putting the special dividends aside the stock is paying a dividend Thats pretty good both with the solid growth and with the reality that the strong earnings could easily support continued dividend increases If those earnings keep panning out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has little reason not to consider more special dividends or more increases in the baseline quarterly dividend When we looked at Fiat Chrysler we saw an Italianowned Netherlandsbased company whose business is heavily dependent on the US market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is as American as apple pie until you look at where the cars are going <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has invested heavily in China over the past several years so its unsurprising that the AsiaPacific segment is becoming such a huge market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Obviously Fords primary market is still the US but China has rapidly become a strong second Its also the big chance for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to grow The US auto market has long since matured and Fords market share there is locked in the range China by contrast is still seeing their auto market grow strongly and Fords market share there is just and growing And while there are ongoing concerns about the status of the Chinese economy in the near term theyre still a growing market in general As that middle class continues to grow in the years and decades to come Fords investments could pay off hugely While the upcoming earnings release will obviously be a big driver of Fords share price over the next few weeks it is the companys status as a nice incomegrowth play as well as its very low PE ratio that makes it a longterm investment With the American market hitting new highs day after day its getting harder and harder to find stable companies trading at appealing multiples to future earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is exactly that Investors looking for companies to add to an income portfolio with a good chance of raising their dividends going forward could do a lot worse than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and those looking to play an eventual rebound in Chinese growth will also find a lot to like here That the dividend remains solid until those things happen is just a bonus and another incentive to buy and hold I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Consumer Goods Auto Manufacturers Major Earnings </div></body></html>
