style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has turned in a mixed performance in the US in the first half of falling behind the industrys growth and losing some market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however is making capacity investments in Mexico and focusing on the revival of the Lincoln brand in order to tap the luxury market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has lined up a number of new cars and pickup trucks in order to pick up pace in the North American market which should help it gradually get better was a year of transition for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and this clearly reflects in its sales in North America Last year Fords sales in North America declined close to as the company focused on bringing new models such as the aluminum F truck In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also underwent a CEO transition last year However hasnt turned out to be particularly good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in North America either The company has posted mixed results in the US which is its largest segment in the continent that accounts for close to of its overall sales More specifically the US accounts for almost of Fords global sales As such in this article we will take a closer look at the companys performance in this key market and how it is positioned going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sells its vehicles under two brand names in the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Lincoln Both the brands have a lineup of cars as well as utility vehicles while the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>brand also offers trucks All the three categories are equally important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as the volume sales for each of them contributes to more than of its total sales However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has not seen a perfect year so far in the US It started off with a bang but what followed was a series of not so impressive monthly performances <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>ended the first half of the year with a sales figure of units up from last years units With three months of negative growth out of six <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not looking good for the rest of the year at first sight Comparing this with the overall US auto industry we get an even clearer picture The industry has sold million cars till the end of June This amounts to an increase of over the first half of last year Thus it is evident that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is lagging the overall market in the US so far this year as shown in the following charts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has also lost some market share over the last months It had of market share at the end of the second quarter last year which has dropped to this year In June the market share was this year as compared to last year for the same period Hence Fords performance has not been up to the mark this year in the US and this is a cause for concern as this particular market is growing at a steady pace But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is trying to make a comeback in the US by way of different strategies Lets take a look In April this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced an investment of billion in Mexico to develop a new generation of engines and transmissions The company will be setting up manufacturing facilities in Chihuahua and Guanjuato for these purposes Further on Fords priority list is the revival of its struggling luxury brand Lincoln Automotive News quoted CEO Mark Fields saying From a profitability standpoint and from a presence standpoint its really important for us to be part of the luxury market and to be there when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>customers want to step up This is an important priority for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as by sales volume the global luxury market is only of the total number of vehicles sold in the world But nearly onethird of the industrys profits come from this segment For the same reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is planning to invest heavily in the Lincoln brand In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will launch the next generation of its medium duty trucks built in America for America The truck will be launched under the series name F and will also include tractors to cover a broader spectrum The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus RS will be also rolled out in the spring of It will offer new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Performance AllWheel Drive with Dynamic Torque Vectoring In addition the Raptors nextgeneration the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F Raptor will hit the North American market in the fall of It will be more powerful and lighter in weight as compared to its current generation model As a result customers can expect better fuel efficiency figures from this model Also due to be launched in late is the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GT that will deliver a mix of performance and aerodynamics Now driven by these new launches and investments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is trying to bring about some consistency in its sales performance in the US which has been lacking so far this year A key reason behind Fords weakness in the US so far this year can be attributed to the growing clout of competitors such as General Motors NYSE GM and Volkswagen OTCQX VLKAY While GM is its traditional rival the recent initiatives undertaken by Volkswagen the secondlargest car maker in the world could pose a key threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>going forward For instance in May and June Volkswagens sales in the US increased and respectively as compared to last year In comparison as we saw above Fords growth was negative in May while it managed just growth in June This indicates that the likes of Volkswagen are taking market share away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the US Looking ahead Volkswagen will try to sustain its momentum in the US market as it has planned a multibillion dollar investment in the region For example Volkswagen is on track to invest billion in North America over the next five years as a part of its strategy of achieving million units in sales of the VW brand in the region by As such the company will be constructing a couple of new plants over here taking its total plants to More specifically VW will invest million at Chattanooga to make a new seater SUV In my opinion this is a good move from VW since the market for SUVs and crossovers in the US is growing at a fast pace For instance so far in the sales in this segment have increased so VW is moving in the right direction to tap growth in the US Thus in my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will need to step up its game in the market if it is to overcome the likes of Volkswagen and improve its market share The first half of this year has not been great for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in North America especially the US But driven by the launch of new models and investments in engine and transmission technologies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could gain some momentum going forward Since this is a key market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and contributes a substantial portion to its revenue it will have an important bearing on its overall performance Thus investors should not count on a comeback at Fords North American operations going forward despite a mixed first half of Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks
