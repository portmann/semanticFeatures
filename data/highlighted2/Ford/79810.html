class='textDiv'>Chanticleer Holdings Could Fall After Stock Promotion Becomes Clear Chanticleer Holdings NASDAQHOTR Seeking Alpha Chanticleer Holdings has risen over on the back of articles written on Seeking Alpha The author of this article has been linked to undisclosed paid promotion in the past Chanticleer Holdings has been involved with paid stock promotion in the past Chanticleer Holdings is a money losing rollup that it almost out of cash and a much needed offering will cause shares to fall Back in April shares of Chanticleer Holdings NASDAQ HOTR were trading at around on very low volume Since that time several bullish articles on Seeking Alpha caused the stock to rise to as high as on surging volume of millions of shares Author John <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wrote an article entitled Chanticleer This Stock Would Be Cheap At predicting that this stock could rise as high as due to its rising revenues and its similarities to Shake Shack NYSE SHAK which has risen by this year In reality Chanticleer bears no resemblance to Shake Shack The analogy was simply a convenient way to compare Chanticleer to a sharply rising stock Shake Shack is a high growth operator of fastcasual restaurants in trendy areas with high foot traffic such as Central Park in New York Chanticleer by contrast is a low margin operator of several disparate restaurants including Hooters chains in a variety of countries such as South Africa Australia Hungary Poland and several other European countries Unlike Shake Shack Chanticleer consistently loses money and the losses are recently accelerating substantially Unlike Shake Shack any revenue growth from Chanticleer is coming simply by buying more restaurants There is no organic growth In its most recent quarter Chanticleer was unable to file its Q on time The company reported two material weaknesses in its accounting controls and revealed that it was basically out of cash The company quickly filed a registration statement to sell stock to raise much needed cash In short there were a great many reasons why Chanticleer was trading at just and on no real volume If anything investors should have been expecting a decline in the stock due to its precarious financial position and its imminent need to raise money via a stock sale Yet for some reason author John <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was absolutely certain that there was tremendous near term upside to the stock Why An analysis of Fords past articles is revealing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has written articles covering stocks Of these stocks happen to be names which are backed by serial stock promoter Barry Honig In fact the only recent article that Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has written that wasnt on a name related to Honig was his article on Apple More details on Honig are provided below The timing of these hyper bullish FordHonig articles is also notable in that they always seem to come just as the Honig company needs to raise money via a stock sale <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>then appears with an uber bullish hype article predicting multi bagger returns just ahead of the key financing The modus operandi is always the same The stocks are small cap Honig names which are very illiquid and underfollowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>uses convenient but faulty analogies comparing his target to recently high flying mainstream stocks The implication is always that his target stock will be the next to soar <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been very effective and each of these stocks quickly soared often by more than But in each case the underlying company just like Chanticleer was struggling financially The subsequent equity offering typically caused the stock to drop substantially Then after the company had their money and the promotion ended the stock fell much further typically well below the levels from where it began If history is any guide then investors should expect a sharp drop in Chanticleer when it conducts a much needed near term equity offering They should then expect a continued drop to well below Finjan Holdings OTCQB FNJN Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wrote about this stock on January The stock popped about since then it has fallen Two days before the article was published FNJN registered shares to be sold allowing them to potentially sell the shares at an elevated price Vringo NASDAQ VRNG Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>submitted three articles on VRNG between the weeks of July and August including one where he gave the stock a price target based on a potential patent settlement with Google Three days after his third article on VRNG in the span of two weeks VRNG registered million shares at raising million Since those articles VRNG has fallen Oculus NASDAQ OCLS Perhaps the most startling example Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has written five times on OCLS going back to September Additional articles were published on February March April and March The articles suggested that OCLS could triple and had a billion market opportunity Three months after his first article on September OCLS raised million in an offering One month after the second series of articles on OCLS the company raised another million Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wrote his final article on OCLS one month after the company had registered stock to be sold Senseco OTCQB SVON Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wrote about SVON on December suggesting that a near term catalyst could cause the shares to double That day was the peak and the stock has declined since then ChromaDex OTCQX CDXC On December th Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wrote about CDXC suggesting that the recent investment by Dr Frost could double the companys valuation The stock rose in the next month before quickly plunging nd Century OTC XXII On November Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wrote about XXII suggesting that the stock could double The stock quickly soared The stock has since fallen over to levels below where Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>originally wrote about it Pershing Gold OTCQB PGLC On September th Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wrote about PGLC Mr Honig is actually a Director of Pershing Gold suggesting there was upside The stock then grinded lower after which it has recovered somewhat You can see a table with all of the names that Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has written on below and whether Barry Honig was involved In reality investors should have already been on alert regarding inappropriate promotion at Chanticleer Last year Seeking Alpha author Richard Pearson wrote a detailed expose article highlighting undisclosed paid stock promotion and small cap stocks In that article Pearson exposed a small firm called Red Fish Creative which for a fee would hire authors using either real or fake identities to write bullish articles on a their clients using a variety of financial news websites The firm was run by John Eastman The article included a table that showed that nearly every article written on Chanticleer at the time had ties to Redfish In addition nearly every author with ties to Redfish including Eastman himself had written on Chanticleer We can even see the pricing sheet for Redfish which shows the difference levels of pricing for different levels of articles The point is that Chanticleer has long been associated with under the table promotions Now that the company is desperately in need of an equity financing this latest round of promotion should come as no surprise A report from Lakewood Capital on Opko Health NYSE OPK Honig has been involved in numerous microcap stock promotions Here are some of the highlights from Lakewoods report on OPK Dr Frost has a disturbingly large number of connections to what we believe are two serial stock promoters that have each been the subject of multiple lawsuits Barry Honig and Michael Brauser who together run an entity called Marlin Capital We have found different stocks connected to Barry Honig and connected to Michael Brauser there are likely many more but this is what we could track down Only three of these companies have a market capitalization above million only one of these companies generates a profit Pyramid Oil which only makes around million per year Many of these companies have cost investors a significant amount of money and both individuals have been the subject of extensive litigation Barry Honig was also sued in January in relation to Empire Sports Entertainment EXCX by former twotime winning heavyweight champion Shannon Briggs According to one article Briggs filed a major lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court alleging breach of fiduciary duty conversion unjust enrichment and breach of contract against Gregory D Cohen Shelly Finkel and Barry Honig and their boxing and entertainment promotional company Empire Sports Entertainment Briggs claimed he was the victim of a ripoff on two fronts by his former promoters and business partners part and parcel of which includes documents in which his signature was forged Financially Briggs alleged that he had agreed to fight then world champion Vitali Klitschko for a purse of but that he wound up with a mere after he returned to the United States after the prolonged hospital stay in Hamburg To add insult to injury the lawsuit alleges the defendants deducted the cost of Briggs hospitalization from the understated purse of the bout However the story doesnt end there Empire Sports Entertainment ultimately became Sagebrush Gold NASDAQ SAGE on June with Barry Honig serving as Chairman In October Honig announced to Sagebrush shareholders that Legendary investor Dr Phillip Frost Chairman of Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc Ladenburg Thalmann Co Opko Health Inc has invested million in our subordinated debt and convertible preferred stock The company changed names once again and became Pershing Gold in March Today Pershing Gold is owned by Frost and owned by Honig Brauser had also previously been a shareholder but appears to have sold all of his shares in April A simple search of SEC filings shows the shocking number of promotional micro cap companies that Mr Honig is involved with HOTR has used paid stock promotion in the past and has been the subject of promotional articles again This has caused the stock to run up As we have seen in the past the companies that are covered by Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>quickly fall back to much lower level after the company completes a secondary HOTR will be no different Its not a stock or even close to being the next Shake Shack Its an unprofitable franchiser of disparate restaurant chains that will quickly see its stock back around share representing downside of around where it was trading before the stock rose because of the stock promotion I have contacted both Mr <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford
