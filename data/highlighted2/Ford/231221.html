Quarter conference call At this time all participants are in a listenonly mode Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time If anyone should require operator assistance please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone As a reminder this call is being recorded I would now like to introduce your host for todays conference Vice President Investor Relations Brian Begley Please go ahead sir Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for todays call to discuss our third quarter results As we begin Id like to remind everyone that during this call well make certain forwardlooking statements and in this context forwardlooking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial conditions and also contain words such as expects anticipates and similar words or phrases Forwardlooking statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain and are subject to certain risks or uncertainties which can cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements Indiscernible and our annual report on Form K particularly in Item Id also like to caution you not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which reflect managements analysis only as of the date hereof and the company undertakes no obligations to publicly update our forwardlooking statements or to publicly release the results of any revisions to forwardlooking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events Both Atlas Energy and Atlas Resources earnings release as always provide a GAAP reconciliation to the nonGAAP measures we refer to in our public disclosures such as adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow With that Ill turn the call over to Atlas Energys Chief Executive Officer Ed Cohen for his remarks Ed Thanks Brian and hello everyone Welcome to the quarterly conference call of the Atlas companies Atlas Energy Group ATLS and Atlas Resource Partners ARP Id like to say that both companies continue to cope well with the challenges of the present energy crisis and you will hear much during this call about our continuing efforts to turn lemons into lemonade that is to turn difficulties into opportunities Under the circumstances the Atlas companies are faring well but a sobering reality remains that the continuation let alone an intensification of current negative conditions constitutes a potential serious threat to virtually the entire US energy business including of course the Atlas companies Since almost all of this call will be devoted to ARP which is the most substantial operating entity in the Atlas group Im going to start with the parent company ATLS During our last quarterly call I reported that ATLS was in advanced discussions to refinance its debt on a longterm basis We have now accomplished this On August ATLS entered into an agreement for a new term loan facility in the amount of million maturing in August at an interest rate of LIBOR with a floor of plus above LIBOR To provide context at September ATLS had a cash position of approximately million and for the quarter Atlas Energys distributable cash flow was approximately million or per common unit compared to million or per common unit in the second quarter In addition to distributions from its holdings in ARP ATLS received approximately in management fees and cash distributions during the third quarter from its EP development subsidiary Atlas Growth Partners LP AGP As previously announced AGP has now filed an initial registration statement on Form S with the SEC Furthermore ATLS received million in cash distributions in the third quarter from Arc Logistics Partners which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ARCX a master limited partnership of which approximately of its general partner is owned by ATLS In October ARCX announced a quarterly cash distribution of per common unit for the third quarter and that was a increase from the second quarter and higher than the prior year comparable quarter Lets now focus on ARP Daniel Herz ARPs CEO will give us a focused overview of the company and its situation in the energy business Mark Schumacher ARPs President thereafter will report on operations and Jeff Slotterback ARPs CFO will provide financial highlights for the quarter Thanks Ed Good morning everyone It has been another challenging quarter for the energy space generally as the industry has continued to experience low oil and natural gas prices and energy stocks have remained out of favor Probably of greatest note in the last quarter is the fact that energy companies have been unable to attract new capital The public and private equity and debt markets have seized up paralyzed based on the uncertainty of the direction of commodity prices among other factors While all of this is at the moment bleak for the industry Im pleased to report that we at Atlas have built Atlas Resource Partners to weather this type of storm for an extended period of time First and foremost we have on average approximately of our projected margin protected through with additional protection extending into Our business is well positioned for this environment because of the following factors one ARP has shallow decline assets that generate stable cash flow two the company has substantial hedges with a current positive hedge book value of approximately million three our assets have very low operating costs making production profitable even in low commodity price environments and four we have an investment partnership business which provides us annual income from thousands of wells which provides an annuity stream of cash flow that is not directly dependent on commodity prices and provides us fresh drilling capital to develop our resources at enhanced rates of return Over a long period of time we have emphasized and demonstrated our focus on protecting against the downside even if that meant giving up some upside potential This approach led us to quickly secure financing back in February when capital was still available With that financing and the four positive factors I mentioned a few minutes ago I can report that the company expects to have substantial liquidity going forward You are probably aware that most energy companies are presently undergoing a redetermination of their bank lending parameters In our case a redetermination process should be complete in the next two weeks and our lead bank has indicated that we should expect only a modest reduction in bank funds available to us With respect to our current distribution ARPs board will consider in the near future the appropriate ongoing level I do expect however that this distribution will be adjusted to reflect the current environment including lenders orientation to rewarding companies that can serve their cash flow We have continued our successful work of cost reduction and savings Our production expense is down approximately as compared to the third quarter of and we have reduced general and administrative expense approximately yeartodate as compared to the nine months ended In addition to the reduction in operating expenses and general and administrative expenses our operating group has substantially reduced our drilling and completions cost in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale to over reduction while achieving even greater production results than previously anticipated As a reminder the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the only area where indiscernible As many of you know we generate enhanced returns on drilling wells through our investment partnership business from the well construction and administrative and oversight fees we charge You may remember that some months ago there was great excitement about socalled drillcos which would enable energy companies to obtain large sums of money from private equity and hedge fund sources thus enabling these companies to generate greater returns on drilling and completing new wells As you know the paralysis in funding this industry has prevented full fruition of these expectations for most companies In our case our partnership business is Atlas drillco and it actually works In the past years alone we have raised and received investment partnership funds of over billion and in the last month of one of the darkest periods in our industrys history we raised over million Please remember that even without these drillco fees we still expect at current strip pricing heads up returns in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>of over Despite the lower commodity prices in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter we have been successful in growing adjusted EBITDA I expect an even larger increase in adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter Finally as we focus on the future of ARP we are working strenuously to protect company value through strategic initiatives I am confident that as we continue our work we will effectuate mechanisms that will protect and hopefully enhance stakeholder value Thank you Daniel I am pleased to share that we had a very productive quarter especially in light of the current market challenges We executed on our goals for the period which include enhanced production run time to achieve a low decline quarteroverquarter We continued to reduce operating expenses as well as reduce drilling and completion costs We kicked off our direct investment program and strategically added low cost bolton acreage to our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>development area which will add value through our direct investment programs This market environment creates challenges and opportunities Our staff has aggressively and actively managed the more than operated wells across states to address profitability and upside opportunities Results from these efforts continue to improve our business and better position the business as we move forward I would like to take a moment to thank all of our staff for their dedication focus and execution The teams have seamlessly shifted from a development mode to a focus on preserving value Production during the third quarter was million cubic feet equivalent per day which is comprised of gas oil and liquids This is a decline quarteroverquarter Our wells had high run times as we experienced no major production downtime from severe storms flooding or third party outages A significant portion of our production for the period came from our coal bed methane or CMB fields which averaged million cubic feet equivalent per day which was in line with forecast and made up approximately of our production on an equivalent basis Our operated CBM production is a great asset and continues to have a very low stable decline at very low operating costs Production in the fourth quarter will be impacted by our decision to shut in certain of our Marcellus gas production due to market pricing and the sale of our nonoperated interest in the County Line field in Wyoming effective October which together total million cubic feet per day We expect to resume production of the million cubic feet per day from the Marcellus later in the fourth quarter These are a few examples of the actions taken resulting from our strategy to achieve stable low decline production that drives cash flow and focuses on maximizing production margins As Ed and Daniel mentioned a significant portion of our gas production is hedged at prices exceeding per MmBTU through Our oil production declined quarter over quarter due mainly to natural decline and the impact of completing new Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells offsetting our existing wells These offset production impacts caused by frack interference is temporary and these existing wells will return to production levels at which they were producing prior to the offset completion The oil production from the Rangely field was flat quarteroverquarter As a reminder this is our enhanced oil recovery project operated by Chevron This field has historically had a low decline of less than Through October this production has actually increased slightly compared to the second quarter third quarter production Similar to our gas production a significant percentage of our oil production is hedged at an average of approximately per barrel through Our production costs continue to decline The third quarter production costs were favorable compared to the second quarter and favorable compared to the first quarter Excluding our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>assets which were not in the prior year reporting and comparing like properties against the third quarter we have reduced our production costs by or million on an annualized basis I want to further highlight the impact of our third quarter operating cost reduction impact Historically we see production costs spike during the third quarter as this is generally the time of year when we see the best weather to complete maintenance projects This year was no different as we performed maintenance work on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and CBM assets and were still able to reduce total production costs for the period The teams continued to work diligently in driving down operating expenses during the quarter We have seen substantial savings in water disposal over the past few periods and we will see substantial savings on compression in future periods Water disposal costs have been reduced by approximately compared to third quarter achieved via contract renegotiations and infrastructure that we have added in certain development areas Our facilities engineers have done a great job consolidating compression and reducing the number of compressors across our operating areas Compression expense makes up about of our total lease operating expenses This is an area where we have not yet fully realized savings due to the onetime expenses related to releasing compressors We expect to see these savings more fully reflected during future periods as the terms on these rental contracts expire During the third quarter we drilled and completed the first three Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells that Atlas drilled and completed from start to finish Previous Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells were drilled during the transition services period with the former operator We have seen significant savings in the drilling and completion costs due to process efficiencies as well as vendor cost reductions The average drill time for our recently drilled wells has averaged days which has been reduced by three days compared to previously drilled wells The Jimmy H was the first well turned in line at the end of September and we have turned in line two additional Casper wells in early October These Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells are produced initially flowing up casing then flowed up tubing and later produced via artificial lift We are in the early stages of production on these three wells and are transitioning to flowing up tubing and the wells are performing in line with our expectations The average lateral length of the three wells is approximately feet and the costs are trending favorable to AFV by more than We are now transitioning to our direct investment program where we have one active drilling rig and plan to drill multiple Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells Since acquiring our initial Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>position we have successfully added approximately acres of low cost bolton acreage in the Atascosa oil window As I stated at the beginning we are focused on preserving value in this environment We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this challenging period through our portfolio of low decline low operating cost assets hedge book and the focus and commitment from every Atlas employee Thank you for being a part of our call this morning and I will now turn it over to our CFO Jeff Slotterback Thank you Mark Good morning to those joining us on the call I appreciate the chance to speak with you today To begin Id like to echo the comments of Ed and Daniel Due to the security provided by our hedge book as well as the fees produced from our partnership management business we are well protected from the continued downturn in commodity prices Specifically for the third quarter ARP generated adjusted EBITDA of million and distributable cash flow of million or per unit We distributed approximately for the period which translates into a coverage ratio of times for the third quarter Both adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow for the third quarter were approximately million favorable to the previous sequential quarter with much of that increase driven by additional margin in our partnership management segment due to the deployment of capital within our drilling partnership program We anticipate continued growth in cash flows generated within our partnership management segment in the fourth quarter as the funds raised within our partnership programs are heavily weighted toward the back end of the year Production margin for the third quarter was approximately million a slight increase from the sequential quarter As Mark indicted during his remarks we are very focused on our continued efforts to reduce costs throughout the business As a result of our teams hard work total production costs have declined nearly million from the comparable prior year quarter while lease operating expenses per Mcfv fell to for the third quarter down from in the prior years quarter This means that on an annualized basis we have reduced operating costs by around million We anticipate continued declines in production costs and lease operating expenses per unit in the fourth quarter of and throughout Turning to production volumes we generated million cubic feet of equivalent per day during the quarter which in spite of some of the operational challenges that Mark mentioned was in line with our expectations for the period With regard to commodity prices realized natural gas prices including hedges were per Mcf for the third quarter lower than the third quarter of while Henry Hub firstofthemonth prices declined or over the same period Once again we saw significant benefit from our hedge positions Approximately of our natural gas production during the quarter was protected at realized hedge prices of per Mcf for the third quarter of Regarding liquids realized oil prices were down only or per barrel to per barrel for the third quarter when compared to the comparable prior year quarter despite a decline in WTI prices over the same period Here too we were aided by our significant hedge position as approximately of our crude oil production volume was hedged for the third quarter of Our hedge book which has a fair value of approximately million has positions covering approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas production at an average contract floor price of approximately per Mcf for periods through and approximately million barrels of oil at an average contract floor price of over per barrel for periods through These positions which are almost exclusively fixed price swaps are the result of our conservative hedging strategy over the last several years Please see the tables within our press release for more information about hedges Regarding general and administrative expense net cash GA was million for the period or million higher than the second quarter of due to the timing of fundraising activities for the current year investment programs and other seasonal costs We expect cash GA to moderate in the fourth quarter as partnership fundraising continues Total capital expenditures were approximately million for the third quarter including approximately million associated with maintenance capital compared with approximately million of total capex for the prior year comparable quarter The decrease between the periods was driven by lower direct well drilling and investment partnership contributions The third quarter amount included approximately million for direct well drilling and investments in our partnership programs while the remaining costs were associated with leased acreage gathering and disposal costs and other items Before discussing ARPs balance sheet metrics I wanted to take a moment to remind everyone that in this protracted lower price environment impairment charges taken within GAAP income statements are the industry norm ARP was no exception and recognized a noncash impairment charge of approximately million during the period While significant the recognition of this amount will have no impact on our distributable cash flow or ongoing operations Moving on to ARPs liquidity position and leverage at the end of September we had approximately million of total liquidity under our million credit facility borrowing base with a leverage ratio of times We are currently going through the fall borrowing base redetermination process with our partners in the revolving credit facility While we expect only to have a modest reduction to our borrowing base we are precluded from adding additional information at this time In any event we are comfortable with the amount of liquidity we will have going forward With that I thank you for your time and return the call to our CEO of Atlas Energy Ed Cohen It was good to hear about the progress in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells that Atlas took over operations on I think you said three days drilling time you were able to cut off I was just curious were you using different service vendors Was there anything the prior operator was doing that once you got on board you obviously saw ways to correct Thank you Ed Nothing I would say was substantially different We are using what we consider a top oil rig to set surface casing down to around feet and then we bring in theand were employing multiwell pad development In doing so were able to reduce our drill time and increase our learnings welltowelltowell Were drilling roughly four wells per pad right now and I think through the efficiencies of the team were maybe tweaking a few things but nothing substantial Its just the execution and the focus by the teams I was just curious with the slowdown in activity have you actually seen equipment making its way out of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>or has most of it stayed put and been stacked locally Our observation is that there is not an exodus of equipment from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>If anything its an idling of equipment and deployment of crews and weve got ready access to infrastructure both service sector and also pipeline But the vendors are available for work and hungry for the work right now Theyre not leaving no Okay great Of course with the investment partnership business theres always that bit of a lag between announcing the program getting the checks in the door and then actually deploying the capital You know with this past years trends weve seen in commodity prices is there anything heading into thats going to be very different from what you planned for either regions youre going to concentrate one I imagine that would be one thing oilgas mix anything else to think about Sure I guess just for instance do you have any morejust as youre modeling on price do you have any more confidence in maybe the stability of oil versus gas going forward Is that informing your thinking as you think about what youre going to spend the next year Noel this is Ed again We work extensively on our budgeting aspects on an almost continual basis Were always giving consideration to that therefore I think its not appropriate to comment first because its a work in process and secondly because tomorrows answer may be different from todays I just wanted to add with regard to the investment programs bear in mind that they operate within tax considerations so we have a limited amount of time by which we have to get wells spudded and so forth and so they are not entirely related to energy factors only There are other factors involved Noel this is Daniel I would just add as I said in my remarks that our sole focus in development activity is in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale where we have a substantial position So the economics there remain very attractive on a headsup basis and even more attractive to us through our investment partnership business Thank you Good morning I had a question on the distribution policy You mentioned in the prepared remarks that you did Yes sorry about that Im on a cell phone Just had a quick question on the adjustments in the distribution policy in the near term Just curious what kind of targets youre looking for maybe there to help frame that decision in terms of liquidity leverage ratios things like that Well Sam to tell you the truth during this call we received a comment from Alan Greenspan the recent head of the Federal Reserve who was critical of Daniel for being too explicit in his comments Seriously though I think Daniel laid out the elements of consideration that will come into play and he made clear that our board is going to consider this and we will have a statement out on this if and when any action is taken Okay I appreciate it just thought Id try Then on the borrowing base redetermination it sounds like youll have that coming to a conclusion in a few weeks Just curious where you stand on the debt covenants there if you expect some nearterm relief Thank you I want to know what flexibility we have to deal with our bonds I think the last I saw the s and s theyre trading at roughly on the dollar It would seem that some channeling of our funds assuming we have that financial flexibility from the banks to retire debt at on the dollar would make a great deal of sense My impression was that we had a million basket I have not yet studied the financial statements put out but did we use any of that basket and what is your attitude towards that number one Number two you are working very hard to make sure that we have a successful recovery here What price of gas and oil do we need to be viable in your opinion on a longer term basis Any help you could give me on those two questions Id be appreciative Thank you Thanks Lee This is Ed Ill answer them in reverse order One of the nice things is that even at present prices the company is in a positive cash flow situation so we do have a good opportunity However as I indicated and as underlies most of our discussion if present low prices continue indefinitely and eventually even companies that have been as careful as our company will see their hedges run off this industry is in for a very difficult time I know from my reading of many commentators and my hearing from commentators in their public statements including you Lee that most people think that the cure for low energy prices is low energy prices and that eventually sooner most people seem to think rather than later those prices will recover But I think everybody should bear in mind and I know everybody does bear in mind almost everybody that the present situation continued indefinitely is not viable But the present situation for Atlas continued for a reasonable period of time we are in a situation where it is viable and it makes it possible for us to do some things relative to the bonds As was made clear I think in the discussion were pursuing all kinds of strategic possibilities and as soon as something is actually resolved well be out with a public announcement On that question before you go to the second question if I said to you a year from today oil was gas would remain at say those revenue numbers are something that would enable you to service your debt and do well over time I think so because as you know we are emphasizing oil production and we would eventually arrive at a point where we were exclusively an oil company on the assumptions youre making Lee its Daniel Keep in mind that our EBITDA relative to our interest expense when you reference servicing debt is over times so we generate substantially more EBITDA as necessary to service our interest expense so we feel very good about our situation and our bonds that you referenced extend out through Yes but I was just referring to the possibility of capturing some of that value If you believe were viable and we all hope that you are and thats the bet were making it would seem if you could buy back a coupon at a price that would be a good use of funds better than paying that dividend the market gives you no credit for Can you just talk a little bit about the well partnership business and how its trending so far in the second half of this year It looked likeand maybe you kind of talked a little bit in your prepared remarks but it looked like the third quarter was a little bit weaker yearoveryear How should we be thinking about that for the fourth quarter kind of broad strokes I think there are two elements to the business you have to remember One is raising funds thats a private placement situation so we cant say much about it but I think youll recall that in the last month of over million was raised This year were getting closer to December and we have no reason to expect that things will go poorly In terms of deploying the funds thats an element that there are a lot of factors that come into play and perhaps Daniel you or Jeff would like to comment on that Sure We have evolved this year to developing only the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and we recognize revenue in our well construction and administrative and oversight fees on a revenue recognition basis based on spudding reaching total depths and turning wells into line So as Ed said there are numerous factors in how we recognize that revenue and when we recognize it and because weve shifted entirely to the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that does shift the recognition of those revenues And Sean also part of the commentary that I made about expecting even greater adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter Okay thats helpful Maybe just kind of bigger picture on the partnership program you guys talked about wellhead returns outside of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>not being particularly attractive Is that something that impacts the investment profile for a lot of these partnerships I know a lot of it has to do with taxes but how are your individual investors thinking about that I think you have to remember that individual investors in a taxoriented program think primarily about taxes in our experience As the governmental units in the United States seem to need more and more revenue and taxes certainly dont go down I think our programs become certainly not less attractive As far as energy goes I think we all know everybody has a different opinion as to where things are going If youre pessimistic about energy you probably are pessimistic about energy investments Not everybody is pessimistic Sure Maybe lastly Ed can you remind us are there any major tax consequences if you suspend your distribution for a long period of time here Thanks for taking my questions guys I have a couple Weve all been talking about capital allocation and somebody else sort of asked this question already and I just wanted to ask it again When youve got bonds in the low s which offer a riskfree rate of over how do you think about allocating capital between buying back bonds drilling Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells for and paying an equity distribution Im just sort ofyou know whats the rationale at this point with the forward strip where it is paying an equity distribution when liquidity is precious I feel like Im taking the SATs and Id like to answer all of the above But seriously there is no doubt that the bonds are quite attractive Investment in wells at for us is not the same as it is for others that is its not a straightforward question because of the investment programs changing the returns and many other factors The capital opportunities that are available to us present complex and interesting possibilities and as we indicated were not deaf to this situation Were working strenuously on considering all possibilities and I think those who are fortunate enough to be connected with Atlas will be interested in the announcements that we will make in the coming days months and years Yes and you guys do have ayou are pretty well positioned and unique in that youve got these great hedge values so just kind of wondering why not reallocate the equity distribution to more Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>drilling or separately do you guys have ais that million basket is that your limitation on how many bonds you could buy back This is Daniel The basket is in connection with our second lien agreement and is relative to the dollars not the face amount that we might be able to buy back to the extent we chose to do so Also with respect to the drilling in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to highlight the point that Ed made the return is on a headsup basis Again it is not the return We should achieve a much greater return through our investment partnership business or our drillco if I may model that we use Patrick this is such a dynamic industry and this is such a changeable period that any limitations any positive aspects just about everything about the industry seems subject to change The one thing that doesnt seem subject to change is the mantra that Ive been expounding for many years although I know Ive never been able to convince anybody else in the country or almost anyone else but there is something to be said for buying low and selling high Those who follow us probably noticed that selling high hasnt been bad for the Atlas group Buying low is also probably still a good idea Good morning gentlemen Theres obviously been a lot of numbers Maybe this is for Jeff can you synthesize a little bit for us in the past youve talked about I think in the fourth quarter there would be some movement in working capital and theres potentially some seasonality or some timing with the partnerships Can youmaybe twofold one give us the magnitude historically of what Q partnership inflows and margin have looked like I went back and looked but hard for me to really tell how I should think about seasonality And two whats the working capital impact It seems like you had a little working capital inflow in the third Certainly So as everyone on the call knows and as weve guided the funds received from the partnership programs are heavily weighted towards the back end of the year so as those come in it presents additional liquidity to the business From a working capital perspective as a reminder we do book an obligation to deploy those funds as they come in and to the extent they havent been deployed so there will be an impact to current liabilities in the fourth quarter of the year I think youll see that in historical filings Can you give us the net on what the cash inflowoutflow will be for the fourth quarter between incremental partnership versus previous and then overall working capital Its hard to comment without knowing the exact number of funds raised at this point but I would expect it to be in line with previous years based on our current understanding The ATM program it looks like you used in the quarter is the plan to use similar sized and will you continue to be active in the market with similar size you did in the third quarter And then obviously youre focused in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Can you give us a sense on how you view what your running room is Obviously your capital is basically all deployed there to lets call it a maintenance level if you wanted to just spend your maintenance capital and get it all in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>whats your inventory look like at those type levels Sure This is Daniel We have within the Atlas enterprise over million worth of drilling inventory in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at current cost of drilling Within ARP specifically its over million of drilling inventory Then finally on the borrowing base I think in the last call you talked about you thought you had a little bit of cushion barring some changes at the banks What changed at the banks Maybe the strip moved a bit but anything to read into that Thank you As a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star and then one Our next question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers Your line is now open My reputation precedes me So its a bit of a dead horse thats been beaten but do you see any details around the bank revolver the redetermination and credit measures relating to that impacting your ability to monetize any of the hedge book towards the bond repurchases as previously discussed I think the comment was made as far as the partnership program that its looking in line with the previous years Are you getting any specific feedback about the focus of investors on just their yearend tax concerns or are your brokerdealers telling you that there is a broader investment concern about the energy sector Craig I dont mean to correct you but we did not make any comment about the program The only comment I made was that we dont see any negatives that would unduly have an adverse effect but we didnt make any comment about how things are going We have some opportunities but right now still doing analysis and not ready to recommend anything specifically But we are going through the budget process and there will be somethe teams will include some in there and it will be an allocation of capital Ive always loved recompletion Its probably the one investment that might be better even than buying energy company bonds today Thank you At this time Im showing no further questions Id like to turn the call back to Ed Cohen for any further remarks All right thank you very much Showing our optimism in the industry I look forward to talking to everybody at the next quarterly call Thanks
