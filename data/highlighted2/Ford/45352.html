up from same quarter last year This is our third consecutive quarter delivering sequential revenue growth and our second quarter in a row that Telenav has achieved both sequential and yearoveryear growth since we began our transition from premium mobile navigation into the highgrowth businesses of automotive and locationbased mobile advertising Our Companys vision is to become the global leader in transforming life on the go To achieve this vision we have been successfully repositioning Telenav for sustained growth by getting into much larger and growing opportunities which leverage our historical technical and business capabilities Today revenue from automotive and mobile advertising businesses contributed over of total revenue in the third quarter Now let me provide you with our strategy and progress update in our four focused investment areas First connected cars second locationbased mobile advertising third OSM and fourth LBS and big data platform first let me start with the connected car As I described last quarter the connected car will be disruptive through the auto industry Our strategy is to leverage our industryleading embedded connected navigation solution and userfriendly brought in solution to build strong relationships with our auto OEM partners In doing so well be wellpositioned to build up large scale network of connected cars with our cloud services We can further broaden and deepen those relationships by offering other valueadded software and services for strengthening the auto OEM relationships with end cars consumers Evidence of our successful execution todate is our longterm relationship with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and recently announced partnership with GM As a reference <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM combined have approximately of the global automotive market Today we are in active discussions with most of the top global OEMs with a goal to create the largest network of connected cars in the world Total automotive revenue was up quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear And the overall loyalty revenue was up sequentially and up yearoveryear We are pleased to announce that in the third quarter we had record total revenue and loyalty revenue from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>primarily driven by growth in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe We have announced in January that GM another top global auto OEM partner Launched OnStar RemoteLink mobile companion app powered by the Telenav LBS platform this is part of a broader global strategic partnership including embedded connected navigation services with GM As I have stated in prior quarters we anticipate the GM relationship will have the revenue opportunity comparable to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>As we announced last quarter we continue to work to close our previously announced award with another top global auto OEM for the China market We have made good progress towards a binding agreement and we have commenced joint product development work Within the connected car industry we have seen that the announcement of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto bring Telenav increased interest from auto OEMs who look to bring better user experiences and differentiate their connected navigation offerings from the brought in solutions The differentiation that Telenav brings to the table is the design expertise and advanced technologies to improve user experience significantly to embedded navigation systems which have traditionally had a bad reputation due to outdated map data and poor visibility We have been investing significantly in solving this target and have created industryleading innovative solutions For example our realtime map update technology which we will call true delta is helping us to earn more opportunities with many more global OEMs We continue to invest a significant amount of our auto resources into future opportunities and technologies We are confident there are many huge opportunities in the connected car space that kind of allow us to achieve significant return on investment in the long run We believe we have positioned ourselves well for the tremendous opportunities that will emerge as connected cars become smarter and more and more mainstream With already contracted OEMs well have access to more than of all vehicles produced globally and with future effort our goal is much higher As we continue to grow market share we have a foundation for us to bring more value to our endusers via car services and also bring new monetization via more targeted and driverfriendly advertising and then many other valueadded services including usagebased insurance personalized and proactive maintenance services and mobile commerce Let me now turn to another specific investment area LocationBased Mobile Advertising business In the third quarter we had a record quarter of bookings which exceeded growth sequentially We are very encouraged by the bookings and it is a direct measure of our sales productivity and the market adoption of our solution However in the March quarter we had a seasonal effect of our clients doing forward and full year planning and as a result the ad spending projects was spread over a longer period of time We also saw more of our bookings occur in the later part of the quarter As a result we reported revenue of million or of total revenue up yearoveryear but down from the prior quarter which was lower than our expectations However we expect revenue will grow significantly next quarter due to these record bookings One of the key drivers for our growth is the opportunity in the auto sector Today we have six of the top global auto OEMs leveraging our platform for targeted advertising for sales and the maintenance services In the third quarter we viewed upon a large million order we announced last quarter and in the March quarter that same auto OEM renewed with another order of over million which is a strong validation of the value it will bring to the auto OEM industry Were seeing synergistic services in both our advertising business and our auto business due to our unique positioning in the way in which we can serve auto OEMs today and into the future with the new technologies and business model Other encouraging methods within mobile advertising includes deals over has the number had almost doubled the location enabled impressions amount increased from billion in December to billion in March Our success in the locationsbased mobile advertising is based on our product depreciation which we will continue to make investments in Our mobile advertising is all about location together with intelligence from many sources of data that allow us to anticipate customer needs and wants and stay one step ahead of the decisionmaking process and makes advertising more effective Yesterday we announced that this year our advertising deal has been named a Gartner Cool Vendor in Mobile Marketing for This year was one of the four vendors Gartner highlighted as driving innovation in the mobile marketing space focusing on the use of location intelligence to effectively target customers with relevant and timely advertising and the ability to measure its impact on behavior it is considered a big honor to be recognized by Gartner as a leader in the mobile marketing field I am pleased that we exit the third quarter with record bookings in mobile advertising and we believe that our mobile advertising strategy is well aligned with the rapidly growing mobile advertising market The third area of investment is in OpenStreetMap OSM Last quarter Ive discussed in detail Telenavs OSM initiatives Let me reiterate the importance of this area of investment Recent discussions of Nokia Mapping division here have brought renewed focus on the value of maps in the market today As you know we have invested in the consulting approach with OpenStreetMap which provides a much lower cost in creating underlying data and enables more frequent updates The reason we have invested in OSM is because it provides a superior option as you look to the future of map tracing and maintenance Today we continue to invest in technologies build upon OSM which we call OSM square that allow us to automate map creation and realtime updates by leveraging sensors from mobile investors and connected cars We continue to believe that device map solutions are going to provide significant longterm technical advantage through those who control those assets As an example our connected cars will require highquality immediately refresh mapping services in order to ultimately deliver upon the promise of the selfdriving vehicle We believe there will be many other applications for OSM that will emerge in the future We dont expect significant nearterm revenue from these initiatives but it will provide significant opportunity for value creation for Telenav longterm Finally let me touch on another area of focus for investment Locationbased services and Big Data platform We continue to invest in our LBS services through our Scout product our Scout SDK product and support for our carrier business with ATT and other carriers These investments are focused on delivering highquality cloud services capabilities which we leverage for both our LBS services and our auto businesses Well continue to support these efforts at levels consistent with the requirements to maintain revenue opportunities and to develop and extend our core technology capabilities that support our other businesses As a reminder this LBS services also provide a platform to collect valuable data points for multiple user bases This first party data collection capability provides Telenav with a unique data set distinct from that available to other companies As we grow our data collection capabilities via our scalable Big Data platform through distribution of the Scout SDK and through our connected car relationships we will be able to more effectively leverage this data across our businesses As an example this unique data specifically supports our existing advertising business with differentiated insights for our clients for thirdparties Another example is were leveraging this data to provide more personalized search to our auto LBS customers such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM In summary we are very excited with the success we are having in achieving a successful business transformation as we have achieved our third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth and were confident that the foundation were building through our investment is going to provide a great future for Telenav The large and rapidly growing market of connected cars and locationbased mobile advertising along with our Companys strong early position in both nascent markets presents the Company with a unique opportunity to become a global leader Telenav is making significant investment today to become a dominant player in this target markets which will yield large longterm sustainable revenue growth While this may keep our overall operating costs higher in the shortterm we believe the size of the longterm opportunity justifies this investment level As we do this we are mindful of optimizing our cost structure and ultimately returning the company to profitable Thanks HP as a reminder this portion of the presentation as well as HPs remarks contains forwardlooking statements We encourage you to review our risk factors in our most recent Form Q on file with the SEC which set forth risks and uncertainties that may affect these forwardlooking statements Let me now discuss results for the third quarter in more detail Revenue in the third quarter was million compared with million of revenue in the prior sequential quarter and million in the third quarter of fiscal year Overall revenue grew sequentially as well as yearoveryear driven by growth in our automotive business Automotive revenue for the third quarter was million or of total revenue compared to million or up sequentially and million or up yearoveryear In the third quarter we achieved a record for royalties earned on vehicles shipped with our navigation solution which has totaled million up from million in the prior quarter This sequential growth was driven primarily by continued success with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in Europe In addition we recognized million of customized engineering fees in the quarter in conjunction with the upcoming launch of the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>SIC platform as compared to in the prior quarter It is important to note as we have indicated in the past revenue earned from customized engineering fees can vary significantly quartertoquarter and by region due to the timing of new platform launches and new feature sets Mobile advertising revenue was million or of revenue compared to million or in the prior quarter and million or of total revenue in the prior year quarter The sequential decline in revenue for mobile advertising is attributed to the combined effect of booked campaigns running over longer periods of time and bookings that occurred later in the quarter In the third quarter our largest customer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>comprised of total revenue compared to in the year ago quarter with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>truly being a global customer Telenavs navigation solution has now been deployed on vehicles across North America China Europe South America Australia and New Zealand Our second largest customer ATT comprised of total revenue compared to in the year ago quarter Total gross market for the quarter was flat sequentially and down from in the same quarter last year The yearoveryear decreasing gross margin was driven by the shifting revenue mix towards automotive which carry relatively lower gross margins as compared to the Mobile Navigation segment which is declining in revenue Gross margin within the automotive segment was in the third quarter improving sequentially from due to a larger amount of customized engineering fees recognized in the current quarter which earned relatively higher gross margins Gross margin declined from in the same period last year The yearoveryear decline was primarily attributable to a higher proportion of revenue earned on vehicles sold in Europe and China in the March quarter which have higher associated TomTom cost and lower gross margin Gross margins in mobile advertising were in the quarter up from in the prior quarter and down from in the year ago period The sequential increase was due primarily to the seasonal effect of lower ECPM cost for display ad inventory sourced from thirdparty exchanges in the March quarter while the yearoveryear decline reflects an increasing trend of higher ECPM cost for display ad inventory Excluding the effect of amortization of intangibles nonGAAP gross margin was up sequentially from Within mobile navigation gross margin remained relatively flat sequentially at Gross margin was up slightly from in the year ago period Research and development cost in the quarter were million up from million in the prior quarter and up from million in the March quarter of last year The yearoveryear increase was primarily due to the inclusion of million of product management cost in this classification in the current quarter offset by continued cost optimization efforts Recall that effective in the first quarter of fiscal year the Company is including product management cost as a component of RD expenses due to the change made effective July whereby this function no longer reports into the sales and marketing organization Previously such costs have been included within sales and marketing expenses Sales and marketing expenses were million up from million in the December quarter and million in the same quarter last year The yearoveryear decrease was primarily related to the exclusion of product management cost in sales and marketing in the March quarter of last year as mentioned previously offset by higher cost associated with the ongoing expansion of our mobile advertising sales team General and administrative expenses were million flat with the prior quarter and down from million in the third quarter of fiscal The yearoveryear decline in GA costs was primarily attributable to lower headcount related costs as well as lower cost for professional services We experienced a net loss for the third quarter of million or per diluted share compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share in the prior quarter and a net loss of million or per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal year We generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of million in the third quarter of fiscal year as compared to a million loss in the prior quarter and million loss in the third quarter of fiscal Turning to the balance sheet We continue to be debt free and ended the March quarter with approximately million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments Cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increased in the quarter by million due primarily from the receipt of proceeds from tax refunds totaling million offset by adjusted EBITDA results and other operating uses We ended the quarter with full time employees a decrease from at the December quarterend I will now turn to guidance But before I get into the specific numbers let me talk more generally about automotive As HP indicated we are quite pleased with our momentum in the automotive segment as demonstrated by our yearoveryear quarterly revenue growth of this growth story has been achieved primarily due to our global success with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and having fully penetrated all Lincoln models in North America as well as deployment across vehicles manufactured and imported in Europe and China As we look towards the future royalty revenue with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be driven by an expected higher production volumes including expansion of manufacturing capacity in China in particular penetration across more overall vehicle models in China and Europe as well as achievement of higher overall embedded navigation take rates Turning to our second top auto OEM General Motors As we have previously reported there are two principle products we are providing as part of our relationship The first product released in January relates to our cloudbased mapping and search service that is offered as part of the GM RemoteLink mobile application You may recall we have replaced Microsoft Bing Maps and search for RemoteLink We earn a onetime royalty for each new vehicle owner who downloads the RemoteLink application Our feature is currently offered as part of a three to six months pretrial to owners of new GM vehicles and upon free trial expiration as part of an optional purchase premium subscription service However our contractual delivery obligation for this service extends for years and consequently revenue recognized is currently being amortized over this extended tender During the quarter royalty billings related to this product amounted to million of which less than was amortized and recognized as revenue and the remainder is recorded as deferred revenue Revenue recognition on this product may vary depending on future usage patterns As to the more significant second GM product in embedded connected navigation solutions and as we originally announced in January of we anticipate this product will be launched by GM in our fiscal year but that this launch will be initially limited in volume Our expected revenue will be dependent upon GMs own modelbymodel and geographic rollout While we anticipate GM revenue for fiscal year to be modest we do expect that deployment of our navigation solution in fiscal year and beyond to be more rapid than what we have experienced in our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>relationship Let me now discuss selected highlights of our business outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the full fiscal year As a reminder the full guidance is disclosed in our earnings press release Our expectation for the June quarter are as follows total revenue is expected to be million to million GAAP gross margin is expected to be to GAAP net loss is expected to be million to million Our adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be between million and million For the fiscal year ending June our business outlook is as follows total revenue is expected to be million to million GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately GAAP net loss is expected to be million to million adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be million to million With that HP Hassan and Loren and I are available to take your questions Operator if you can please open the line for questions Thank you The questionandanswer session will be conducted electronically Operator Instructions And our first question will come from Greg Burns from Sidoti Company Just had a question on OSM I understand the benefit from a cost perspective and a technological perspective for Telenav for their own platform or applications Can you just give us a little bit more color on so you have the opportunity to provide incremental services beyond your platforms other parties like what would be the potential upside outside of just using OSM on your own platform So as I think we talked quite a bit before about our SDK the Scout SDK is built on top of OSM so we do have customers as we announced before both at our and thats kind of a mobile application sector they also specific of vehicles like ebikes and motorcycles those are the unique areas of our SDK they build upon the OSM can be utilized to provide navigation mapping services And so there are opportunities for loyalty payment from that service there are also other opportunities like advertising in the future Now turning to the ad business I guess youre running around gross margins now as that business scales their upside for the margin profile of that business So I think the way to think about gross margins in that business Greg is look at the nonGAAP gross margin which I believe is in the quarter and that difference reflects the amortization of some of the intangibles that emanated out of the acquisition Having said that consistent with our previous remarks we think there is opportunity for operating leverage in that business where gross margins can over the next two years can trend towards We started to see some of that improvement this quarter as well And were cautiously optimistic that we continue that we can start to obtain slightly higher CPMs on the revenue side from that business That would also be a driver for that improved gross margin Another thing I can add to that is so there are two type of inventories one is from exchange thirdparty inventory which is mainly for display ads there are also our own inventory which is more search ads or even for displays ads in the future those areas the left inventory will have high margins right now volume is relatively small but we are investing in that area to grow that items if were successful in achieving that then that will also help our margin And then lastly in terms of OpEx came in a little bit lower than we were expecting this quarter and I guess the guidance implies a little bit lower than you had originally targeted Can you just discuss what was driving that and I know were not giving guidance here but directionally how should we be look at OpEx out of the fourth quarter Sure Greg as Ive indicated over the course of the past few years weve been very focused on optimizing our cost structure and we continue to do that especially in light of the fact that one of our core business segments is declining in revenue and gross margin And so the headcount numbers that we shared this quarter actually showed a decrease in headcount while we are in fact adding headcount in some of our strategic growth areas So for example to drive our advertising business for were aggressive in hiring on the salesforce side but at the same time in other parts of the business were trying to be as prudent as we can and managing that cost structure So looking forward as you can see in my guidance there is a slight increase in the fourth quarter were just starting our fiscal planning So it would be premature for me to give any specifics around how were thinking about that cost structure going forward But and I would say because were so excited about the two large growth segments of our business we are going to be investing in those areas We will be prudent But you shouldnt be surprised if you see some slight upward movement in our operating cost structure Maybe I want to add a little more to this one I think the cost structure in the future will depend on the opportunity were gaining from auto OEMs a lot as well as we get more like deals there is some time we have to invest earlier before revenue can be realized To start on the auto segment what are you seeing on embedded take rate sort of quartertoquarter I know youre not going to give a precise number But as you look at your royalty from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>relative to either their production or their sales in the quarter do you have any sense as to how it is trending and maybe the magnitude We are seeing we believe a slight increase very low singledigits in take rates in North America which arguably is maybe a little more of a mature market in the sense that we have penetrated all of those vehicles But we see quite large divergence by model as we talked about in the past we believe that Lincoln take rates are north of the range and where weve seen some of the best successes on the lowend vehicles the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus is under the traditional <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trucks that have had low take rates in the past so we think the market opportunity of embedded navigation for the lower end of the market is especially attractive for us theres a number of factors that drive that as well here in the states and that has to do with the price point that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is able to offer that solution for as well as the fact that more vehicles are going to be outfitted with screens in the head unit for rear cameras which we think can help drive more sales around navigation Outside the US and I alluded to it in my prepared remarks we think were going to see some significant growth in China as they build more plants its still early for us to gauge what take rates outside the US might be like because we havent penetrated all of those models yet we dont have enough history but it attracts what weve observed in the US thats certainly though China and Europe in particular are large growth markets for navigation to continue to grow for us with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And then in terms of the models that youre on for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>it sounds like youre pretty much everywhere you can be in North America what about Europe and China in other words are you solely based on increased take rates and additional production or are there still some models in those regions where you can win or add that way Yes so as you all know Chinas the fastest growing auto market and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has plans it seems that are launching for the first time every six months and so those two primary vehicles that are sold in China as I understand are the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Cougar and the Mondale and we have penetrated those models and so those are kind of the drivers of volume The second half of fiscal that were in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also launching with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus so I think thats probably the next highest volume vehicle so we do expect increased growth in China commensurate with more plant capacity and higher organic take rates With regard to Europe this is really our only our third quarter and I made a remark earlier in my script that there was growth from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe Im not providing specific numbers by region going forward anymore only because therere different approaches in these regions and the manner in which they forward order for inventory fulfillment and so while in the US theres a just in time inventory approach in other geographies they will run inventory at varying levels particularly in China where theyre building more plants So at any given quarter revenue can increase or decrease and its really it may not be an indicator of really whats happening in the business generally speaking were continuing to see healthy growth in both Europe and China but were not providing specific numbers for each of those regions for the reasons I just indicated Okay thats good color Mike thanks And then last auto question as it relates to GM what is their MO in other words it doesnt sound like its going to be sort of a running switchover in the second half of next calendar year is it based on when that model when the model year for that model is released Yes so its just some clarity as Ive indicated in the past the first product a larger embedded connected relationship we expect the first launch with General Motors in Fiscal which is essentially the fall of calendar year And so our remarks there as we expect that to be relatively limited volume at the outset and then moving forward our relationship with them is initially a three year production cycle and so by the end of that three year production we think were going to have some deep penetration and some rapid growth that at the end of that tenure we think will be larger than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was at that point in time But I guess my question is is what is the methodology that theyre using is it when a certain model year starts production or is it theyre going to take it one at a time as they see fit or what is their methodology for rolling you guys out Yes so theyre decentralized in some respect because theyve operating divisions based on brand so they can vary based on that but as we understand it they are going to be launching our solution across various models that might be more mid model in tenor as opposed to the approach that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>took where they only launched our solution on the first year of a new model Thats kind of the nature and expense of the specifics that have been shared with us you know were always hopeful that can get fast forward sooner because weve developed the technology but its really a product roadmap rollout that General Motor owns and controls And it can be forward as well But were very attentive and certainly once we launched with them where we tracking that extremely closely much like we do today with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Two more quick ones from me thanks the mobile advertising business bookings you indicated was a record up quarteroverquarter Can you give us some magnitude as to what the bookings number is and then how those orders are generally recognized overtime Yes so we dont want to get into the specifics every quarter of tracking another nonGAAP metric for a number of reasons But what I would tell you is the healthy bookings that we did achieved has resulted in proving us additional visibility into the realization of our forecast and the guidance that we put out there So as we look forward for example to the guidance that Ive provided in the June quarter now that we have the very robust backlog were confident that were going to be able to attain the range of guidance that Ive provided And the good news is that healthy backlog is not only helpful in thinking about the business going forward for the next quarter but it gives us much more visibility into two and three quarters out And so what weve seen with regard to just buying patterns from our incumbent and new customers is theyre not just spending ad money with us for discrete campaign we have become more and more a part of their overall mobile ad spending strategy And so theyre committing a budgeted amount that they can spread across various campaigns that theyre still in the process of defining The good news with all of that is we have been extremely successful north of of being able to fulfill all the insertion orders that we contract with our advertisers And so generally speaking a contracted insertion order does manifest into revenue And what were seeing is thats happening over multiple quarters from an initial buy So hopefully thats helpful Let me give you a little more insight on that one Basically the booking normally last few months the length of campaign so the booking number is higher than our revenue number But it is higher but its not like several times higher So I continue with that level on other level of insights And then lastly the legacy wireless business that was a little bit softer than I had anticipated this quarter is that I mean did you have some acceleration in the rate of fall off there or was there an anomaly No I am not sure to be honest Steve and Ill go back and double check those numbers But I think they were right in alignment with my guidance so I think maybe if youre comparing to the prior quarter we did have a onetime item in the last quarter of I think about So on the surface that might have looked like it declined more but generally weve been seeing pretty consistently across all of our telecom carriers its about to monthly churn Very minimal its mostly attributable to royalty revenue growth And just add to that Greg its a little healthier for quarterly ramps than what weve seen in the past So we dont have deep insights into all the drivers on that Is it due to higher take rates we know there is more capacity coming on in China and much of that is being driven at from outside the US which I think is a good indicator but I think the point youre observing is that ramp is in the doubledigit percentages which is higher than what we typically have seen And I guess in terms of GM where are we in terms of I guess the upfront work that needs to put in on that for that partnership should we expect NRE revenues to be higher than normal next year or not Well so what we talked about GM and NRE revenue what we typically what we have said in the past is all the customized work that we expect to derive from that relationship is generally built into the peace price as part of the contract As you might expect overtime as there continues to be collaboration and new features offered there is the opportunity that there could be additional customized engineering that we might recognize in a lump sum But generally speaking all the customized engineering which were doing with General Motors relationship is built into the peace price And were flexible with all of our automotive customers some of them prefer to have lump sum amounts allocated for the upfront development work and others want to spread that over the course of the relationship and amortize it into the peace price So we try to be relatively flexible At the end of the day it is all about the ROI on the overall relationship is how we think about the business and what the business can become the relationship can become with them And in terms of Thinknear I guess you had the nice recognition from Gartner this quarter Whod you call out as some of your primary competitors in that space or some of your more direct comps Yes so the direct cost of that base is really three other companies that have somewhat similar focus of Thinknear xAD PlaceIQ and Verve Mobile are the three companies that are sort of focused directly on the space And then there is a selection of other companies that are doing different things around location but theyre not really targeting the space in exactly the same way that we are over sort of the attacking location generally in the same way that we are So those three companies would be the ones I would call out And quite frankly each of those companies has a different approach and tactic in terms of the marketplace Its still even though weve been in it for a while its still likely a very new involved in the space for the advertisers And so I think each of the companies you sort of taking a different look at how to attack that market I imagine it will converge overtime and so right now those would be the companies I would call out And this does conclude our questionandanswer session Ill turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks Great Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon And we look forward to updating you again next quarter Byebye This concludes todays presentation Thank you for your participation
