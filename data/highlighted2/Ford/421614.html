I Sold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported disappointing May sales and so did the rest of the auto industry Demand may be peaking in tandem with weakening macro economic growth and interest rates rising As may not be obvious I am a bullish supporter of Detroit Thus it pains to admit that today I parted ways with one of my longest tenured positions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F The volatile run included gains and losses a fat dividend and plenty of bashing my head in the wall to understand why the companys valuation would not rise I think the US auto market is showing signs of slowing and the US economy which generally drives demand aggregate demand is fairly weak Combine these shortterm headwinds with longerterm issues surrounding new technologies and concerns about millennial demand and I simply do not believe the riskreward is that attractive at current levels I am not generally make macro calls but as Ive mentioned before I do not believe the auto market can support demand in excess of current levels I warned in February that the auto market was starting to slump at the dealer level which tends to foreshadow weakness at the OEMs to come It appears that weakness is coming to fruition Fords sales declined yy Car demand slumped the most with total <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>car sales dropping yy Given the upward move in fuel prices one would assume car sales would at least be stable Even more troubling incentivespending industry wide increased yy Though the month was undoubtedly impact by fewer selling days a yy drop in cars coupled with a overall drop suggests that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is losing traction On the positive side demand for the FSeries remains strong However remember that the company is lapping a modest so a yy increase in FSeries sales is not as robust as it appears Sales of the FSeries do possess higher margins than average <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>vehicles but it is important to remember that operating leverage cuts both ways for a capital intensive business like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>If the company has to cut production margins could fall dramatically From the industrys perspective sales were pretty weak across the board falling yy at an aggregate level The SAAR remained fairly robust at M units but the pace is down yy and down from late s M unit SAAR GMs NYSE GM sales were down yy with a decline at cash cow Cadillac Fiat NYSE FCAU sales were up just while Toyota NYSE TM Honda NYSE HMC and Nissan all experienced yy declines The above chart is what truly makes me the most anxious about the state of the auto market Outstanding auto loan debt is making new alltime highs as it should given population growth and inflation however it is significantly outpacing both on a percapita basis Clearly some of this is due to a change in credit policy and behavior but I also believe it means we are due for some defaults Delinquencies are essentially half way between the cyclical high of and the cyclical low of at That number is up from a year ago In short I do not believe an overexpansion of auto credit is likely to cause a major economic downturn Investors fear any time the term subprime is addressed in the context of lending but subprime auto loans are not likely to cause a major shift in aggregate demand However I think the primary takeaway should be that given the amount of credit outstanding the borrowing capacity of incremental buyers is probably not very high It will be difficult for easy credit standards to drive much higher sales at this point in time I am not a macro trader but it is impossible for any analyst not to pay attention to fundamentals GDP growth was an anemic in Q of down from an already weak in Q of Measuring GDP is obviously an imperfect science and labor markets remain tight but I think it is fair to say that the economy particularly consumption is sluggish Additionally comments from the Federal Reserve suggest that tight labor markets could cause inflation which could then lead to a rate hike Higher interest rates could dampen demand for autos We havent really had a nonZIRP environment in a long time so higher rates could also cause a general recession Im not feeling particularly great about the economy On top of potential economic issues the fact remains the same that investors are universally worried about new technology Both Uber Private UBER and Lyft Private LYFT are seeing robust valuations and investors particularly those in cities where rideshare services have made owning a car less necessary are fearful that these companies will at the very least reduce the number of fleet buyers and the very worst take millions of vehicles off the road In addition to Uber and Lyft their close technological peer selfdriving cars remain an unknown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CEO Mark Fields believes it will take years to mature and another years for the fleet to turnover I believe the consensus opinion at the moment is that the change will come dramatically faster I tend to agree with Fields but markets value certainty and potential At the moment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a lot of uncertainty and a lot of risknot a winning formula The longterm future of the auto market is rather uncertain and experiencing a higher rate of technological change than has been the norm in recent decades and I havent even explored the Apple NASDAQ AAPL wild card With a nearterm peak in auto sales looking more likely as the year progresses I fear a decline in earnings for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is on the horizon The company does not trade at a premium multiple x earnings but I think shares will be harshly punished by any decline in profitability While I think the company can still generate a lot of cash at the current SAAR several metrics are pointing to a decline in auto sales At current prices I think the riskreward of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares is not compelling Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
