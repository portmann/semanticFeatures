<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And Enjoy The Ride <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha When it comes to car stocks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is an option to consider <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a worldwide company that designs manufactures markets and finances cars trucks SUVs and electrified vehicles Their vehicles are sold under <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Lincoln for their luxury vehicles To facilitate the sale of their vehicles they provide financing alternatives thru <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit As a summary <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sells cars that are well known in the industry Even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been in business since early s the companys common stock has been trending sideways for the last five years while the market has trended upward Though the last years might suggest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will continue trending sideways for the next years research is warranted to see if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is an undervalued company waiting to be discovered and priced accordingly Looking at Fords stats their PE PS net income sales growth net margin ROA and ROA are superior to the industrys Interestingly the metrics that are not superior to the industry are related to the risk they posses in comparison to the industry On the other side the metrics that are more attractive than the industrys are related to important areas of investing growth and performance ie ROE Click to enlargeFrom a technical perspective Fords share price is over the day simple moving average but not over the day moving average Though this is not a bullish indicator it can be seen that the stock crossed the day SMA recently On top of that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced on record sales for the month of February This announcement with the stock price starting a bullish pattern give credibility to the start of a run in the stock As mentioned initially Fords performance over the last years has not been appealing Not only have they performed worse than the SP they also have under performed relative to the industry Since most metrics and statistics have turned favorable for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>On the graphs below net margin return on equity and on invested capital leverage operating margin free cash flow free cash flow growth and revenue growth have improved demonstrating a better run company that is more profitable stable and efficient It can be seen that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>being in a cyclical industry is volatile in their growth earnings and capital structure In the long term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has improved most metrics Even better the variance that is seen year after year gets smaller every year demonstrating focused prudent and top notch management For those not with a background in finance it can be said that Fords products are great in general and that they have gotten better over the years When you add to this a stable dividend paying company that has operated for over years in a well known industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock is an option to consider Like any investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does present risks The company is highly leveraged in my opinion its in a cyclical industry faces fierce competition and is subject to industry shifts including EVs self driving vehicles and consumer inclination to not owning cars ie Uber Acknowledging those factors outstanding Fords valuation is cheap the company has become much more efficient their products are of high quality and the dividend yield of is decent and sustainable This makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a buy and its stock price should run up within a short time frame Source All images and information
