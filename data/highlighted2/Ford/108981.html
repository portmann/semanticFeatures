Chrysler Automobiles Making The Right Moves In Europe Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV NYSEFCAU Seeking Alpha FCAU has lost market share in Europe which accounts for of its sales in the last couple of years but the company is making a comeback this year FCAUs growth in Europe in the JanuaryMay period has outpaced the industry average by a big margin indicating that the companys strategy to improve sales is working FCAU is focusing on the premium segment by investing in the Alfa Romeo brand as this will help it generate higher margins FCAU has lined up a number of new cars going forward across all its brands that will help it increase its reach in the European market and consolidate its position For Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NYSE FCAU Europe is an important market This is evident from the fact that Fiat Chrysler got close to of its revenue from the EMEA region last year In fact this region accounted for just over of the companys overall shipments in fiscal However Fiats performance in this market has not been great in the past couple of years as the company has been losing market share For instance in Fiat Chryslers market share in Europe was but this number came down to at the end of However the good thing is that Fiat Chrysler has picked up strong momentum in Europe this year It has shown impressive sales growth in each of the first five months of the year while June sales data for Europe is yet to be declared June results for Italy are out and FCA reported a yearoveryear increase in sales as compared to last June FCAs European sales for the JanMay period were up yearoveryear to vehicles It saw doubledigit growth in out of these five months which is impressive as shown in the following charts Source Data from Fiat Chrysler charts by author In fact FCA has beaten the European automobile industrys growth by huge margins in every month except January While the industry has grown by this year FCAs sales have increased from last year In May that gap was the widest of the five months with the industry growth at while FCAs sales growth was More importantly the impressive growth in FCAs sales has lead to an improvement in its market share For example its market share was at the end of and this has now increased to for this years JanuaryMay period Over the same period major automakers like Volkswagen OTCQX VLKAY and General Motors NYSE GM have lost both money and market share in Europe Thus Fiat Chrysler has gained impressive momentum in the European market this year and it is highly likely that this trend will continue going forward Lets see why Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced last year that it will be investing billion Euros till to boost its global sales to million cars per year and multiply its net profit by five times As a part of this strategy the company will be utilizing its idled plant capacity in Italy to add jobs and rehire workers who had been suspended earlier It will also be investing money to strengthen its position in the fastgrowing and highermargin market for premium cars Thus going forward Fiat Chrysler should ideally increase production from the Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands Specifically Fiat Chrysler management expects to achieve break even in Europe this year as a result of an increased focus on premium vehicles For instance FCA will be investing billion in the Alfa Romeo brand over a period of four years to add new models Driven by this initiative the company expects that sales from the brand will go up to units annually from units in In April this year Fiat announced that it will produce two new engines for Alfa Romeo cars at the Groups plant in Termoli which has an installed capacity of more than units per year A total of more than half a billion euros will be invested in the design development and engineering of the engines and the setting up of new production lines Thus it is evident that Fiat Chrysler is doing the right thing by focusing on its premium brands in order to capture growth in the European market Fiat will be introducing various new models over the next years under different nameplates For instance the Chrysler will be unveiled in It is a compact sedan in the high volume segment in which the likes of the Honda Civic the Toyota Corolla and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus are already present Chrysler will also roll out a Town Country minivan which will be a new generation plugin hybrid vehicle In Chrysler will bring in an unnamed fullsize crossover SUV that will also have a plugin hybrid option In the nextgeneration fullsize sedan as well as a new midsize crossover SUV will be launched under the Chrysler series Under the Dodge brand name Fiat will launch a new subcompact sedan and hatchback in to compete with cars such as the Honda Fit the Chevrolet Sonic and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fiesta Fiat will also expand its lineup of the fourdoor L by launching its larger allwheel drive version by the name X Moreover Fiat will be launching the Aegea concept in Europe in November this year It will be replacing the Bravo hatchback and the Linea sedan Aegea will be partly based on the Panda minicar concept and will compete in the compact car segment with Europes topseller Volkswagen Golf In its investor day presentation for the EMEA region Fiat has stressed on delivering a premiumquality experience across all brands It will resize its dealer network to improve network sustainability The focus will be on the Jeep brand the Fiat family and the Alfa Romeo to reap the benefits of their brand equity Moreover FCA has plans to increase throughput by and market coverage by on an average for its main brands As mentioned at the beginning of the article Fiat Chryslers market share has declined slightly over the past couple of years This is because the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and Peugeot have been making smart moves in order to gain market share This can be seen in the following chart As can be seen clearly above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been able to improve its market share in Europe of late and the trend could continue as the company is fast expanding its capacity in the region For instance in February this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>completed a billion investment in its Valencia Spain operations As a result of this initiative <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been able to improve its capacity at the plant to units annually which makes it one of Blue Ovals biggest plants On the back of this plant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can manufacture as many as six vehicles at a single facility which will help it bring more new models into the market For instance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has recently introduced the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Galaxy seven passenger vehicle with other new models such as the SMAX C MAX Grand CMAX and CMAX Energi plugin hybrid electric vehicle in the pipeline In addition to target the luxury segment in the region <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is launching the Mustang in Europe This will provide stiff competition to Fiat Chryslers plan of improving its sales in the luxury segment since the Mustang is an iconic car that could create a dent in its sales Although Fiat is a midtable player in Europe in terms of market share it is now gaining market share at a good pace The company plans to make aggressive investments in capacity new models and the dealership network in order to improve its performance in this market Since Fiat Chrysler gets around of its sales from this market this will have a positive impact on its overall performance Thus in my opinion an improvement in Fiat Chryslers sales in Europe should help the company do well in the long run Source Fiat
