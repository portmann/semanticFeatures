(Uncertainty) </span>Although Fiat is a mid-table player in Europe in terms of market share, it is now gaining market share at a good pace.The company plans to make aggressive investments in capacity, new models, and the dealership network in order to improve its performance in this market.Since Fiat Chrysler gets around 22% of its sales from this market, this will have a positive impact on its overall performance.Thus, in my opinion, an improvement in Fiat Chrysler's sales in Europe should help the company do well in the long run.Source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles: Making The Right Moves In Europe Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
