I Sold Half My Digital Realty And Where I Reinvested Instead Digital Realty Trust Inc NYSEDLR Seeking Alpha Digital Realty stock has rallied considerably over the past year and now sports a high valuation combined with a low dividend yield Im cautious on interestrate sensitive stocks due to the likelihood of higher interest rates moving forward and their high valuations As a result I sold half my position in Digital Realty and invested the proceeds in more attractively valued stocks with significantly higher dividend yields REITs have enjoyed a strong rally this year thanks to the hunger for high dividend yields Interest rates have plunged to record lows with the yield on the year US Treasury Bond recently falling to The rally has been particularly strong for data center REITs like Digital Realty NYSE DLR which has absolutely been on fire Based on its July closing price of per share the stock has delivered a total return yeartodate As a value investor I get nervous about my holdings when the price rallies in a relatively short period of time based mostly on future expectations Digital Realty has benefited from growth in data centers but while it has grown its cash flow and dividends in the time Ive owned the stock the performance of the company doesnt seem to be matching the stock price rally The major driver of its stock price rally has been expansion of the valuation multiple At its current price I dont think the company will be able to meet the high expectations underpinning the rally Based on valuation concerns I recently decided to cut my Digital Realty position in half Ive redirected the proceeds into two stocks that offer much higher dividend yields and more attractive valuations REITs are required to distribute at least of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends This is why REITs typically exhibit aboveaverage yields However in a climate of recordlow Treasury yields investors are scrambling for yield anywhere they can find it Interestsensitive stocks like REITs and utilities have been among the markets best performers But their valuations look too high given their modest growth The decision to buy Digital Realty was based heavily on its dividend yield and cheap valuation A side effect of the huge rally is that the dividend yield has plunged to very low levels for a REIT Digital Realty now yields just When I purchased the stock was yielding more than In addition Digital Realtys valuation has expanded considerably Digital Realty grew core FFO by l ast year and expects another growth in at the midpoint of managements forecast These are decent enough growth rates but Digital Realty stock now trades for times FFO estimates Investors are pricing in pretty significant growth for Digital Realty but investors are paying a high price and getting a far lower dividend yield than historical averages This multiple expansion has been great for shareholders I bought shares of Digital Realty twice in for and Including reinvested dividends my total return was over Ive decided to take the profits off the table especially since interest rates are likely to rise sooner or later Based on Digital Realtys high valuation and low dividend yield I sold half my position on July for per share As a side note this was all done in a Roth IRA so taxes are not a factor Of course the decision to sell a stock is only half the equation The other half is where to reallocate the proceeds I consider myself an income investor so its important to devote the funds to stocks that pay similar or higher dividend yields Two stocks I found in my own portfolio that I believe are significantly undervalued and offer much higher dividend yields are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and GameStop NYSE GME <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GameStop are dirt cheap both trading for forward PE ratios of Their valuations have remained extremely compressed as the market is very negative on both companies outlooks In turn they both have elevated dividend yieldsI added to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GameStop at dividend yields of and respectively In Fords case investors are highly negative because of fears that the growth in auto sales is about to come to an end Indeed the company has enjoyed the benefit of low gas prices and low interest rates but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to generate great results I last wrote about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in this January article and the company has kept on trucking to start <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generated record firstquarter pretax profit of billion Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled last quarter as the company generated record automotive profit margins in North America <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also doing well abroadfirst half sales in China rose from the same period last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>currently yields and keep in mind it will also reward shareholders with the occasional special dividend The company paid a per share special dividend this year and has indicated its willingness to continue paying special dividends when conditions warrant When it comes to GameStop investors are very bearish on physical retailers as well as video game hardware The fear is that digital video game downloads will replace physical discs which threatens not only GameStops new software sales but also its breadandbutter tradein business Ive written previously about why I believe these fears are unfounded Instead of rehashing all of the reasons the article is linked here GameStop yields and the annual dividend is more than covered by earnings I believe GameStop can grow earnings next year due to new Xbox and PlayStation console releases as well as growth from new businesses like collectibles and its Technology Brands Also virtual reality is an exciting catalyst judging from the success of the recentlyreleased Sony NYSE SNE PlayStation VR units This is just one example the broader takeaway is that when a dividend stock rallies based on multiple expansion more so than earnings growth income investors can use it to their advantage by harvesting some of the gains and redeploying in stocks with cheaper valuations and higher dividend yields The current yield of a stock is the reinvestment yield that must be obtained to not lose income By selling Digital Realty at a yield and adding to my position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GameStop at an average yield above I increased my income and invested in stocks that I believe are much better value opportunities as well I still have half my position in Digital Realty but in general I believe this is a good time to lighten up on defensive dividendoriented sectors like utilities and REITs Investors have an opportunity to lock in some very nice gains in these sectors but it could be time to shift into cheaper higheryield stocks that wont be as harshly punished by rising interest rates Disclaimer This article represents
