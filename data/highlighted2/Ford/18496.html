Alpha American luxury has struggled post including Buick Cadillac and Lincoln <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced plans to reinvent the Lincoln Continental last produced in We just wrote about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F yesterday and we dont want to rehash the points we made in that article We stated that we were confident in the companys ability to grow overseas and that well gladly collect Fords dividend while waiting You can read that piece here Today we wanted to issue a brief note talking about what the company is trying to do with the Lincoln Continental which we think is a brilliant move and one that will continue to push the company forward We know that for right now the company is pushing its F and Mustang as its two flagship vehicles Part of Fords growth comes from sales of these vehicles domestically but much of the future growth is from expansion into places like South Africa India and China Queued up for after that the company is reloading its Lincoln line to supplement its two new vehicles and also to open up exposure to overseas buyers that may be interested in the companys luxury offering The news today was that Lincoln will reintroduce the Continental In recent years Lincoln has mostly sold upgraded versions of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cars with little difference beyond the design and some added features The Continental is officially a concept vehicle but something very much like it will go on sale next year according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F And the production car will also be called the Lincoln Continental making it one of only two Lincoln models along with the Navigator SUV to have a name instead of letters like MKZ or MKC The interesting thing is that Lincoln here in the US isnt even necessarily synonymous with luxury anymore It was a brand that was lost along the way like Chrysler and thrown into the pile of failed auto ventures after the financial crisis Many investors including ourselves were happy to see names like Lincoln and Buick potentially on the chopping block We thought their offerings were dated their names were tarnished and that automakers would benefit from moving forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has found some success revitalizing Lincoln by making drastic design changes They started this after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>found its footing by using the crisis as an opportunity to remake the brand design and the vehicle design What we have now is a far younger crisper and stylish Lincoln Lincoln stopped making the Continental back in Since then the company has undergone a significant change to the branding and the imaging that they have been semi successful with Heck they even got Matthew Mconaughey to star in a well received commercial about their new SUV line We think that reintroducing the Continental has several benefits to it We think it marks the continued rebirth of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>name and brand to a number of younger generations While some consumers that were fans of the brand likely never dissented from it the lot that shunned the brand during the crisis will start to notice that things are again picking up It allows high margin access to overseas markets specifically China Luxury items sell well in China just ask Apple or Burberry With a Chinese eye on American luxury Lincoln should help the company roll out its plans of continued growth overseas in China and places like India where the company recently broke ground setting up a production facility What model is better to do this than the classic American continental We think its going to help a global shift in how people think about luxury automobiles While GMs NYSE GM Cadillac brand has a timeless feel to it especially because of its ageless logo and cool factor Buick and Lincoln havent done well to keep American luxury on the map Buick is undergoing a shift to a sportier vehicle but we believe the brand is stuck spinning its wheels Lincoln has a real chance to reignite a spark for those who consider luxury to only be European This can help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>obviously but it can also help the US domestic auto sellers grow quicker overseas One thing is for sure Lincoln needs some help Lincoln sales dropped in February to and Cadillac sales fell to It is a guessing game whether the two huge American car companies will soldier on as they try to get an even modest part of the luxury market The news was actually worse than that Lincoln avoided a slaughter because of the sales of its MKC which reached Since the model was not for sale last year for February <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gets to make a comparison to zero On the plus side as well if it can be called that Lincolns beast of a sport utility vehicle SUV the Navigator sold units up from in the same month last year Aside from that Lincoln still has a model line that is disintegrating Unimaginably Lincoln sales could drop to as low as a month It could take a couple of quarters but were preparing to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for our dividend portfolio this week for a couple of reasons The yield of is attractive while you wait The global growth strategy is working even if slowly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to be our preferred way to invest in the US auto market Heres a piece on why we have a target over You can read why we wouldnt touch GM here We may add <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares at any point in the future Source <span style='background-color:
