of shortterm issues There is something big going on in the semiconductors space HSBC doesnt have a strong balance sheet Stocks discussed on the indepth session of Jim Cramers Mad Money Program Thursday June Cramer reminded viewers that thinking long term is important There is a lot of focus on shortterm issues at Wall Street like Brexit The technology companies are changing the way we live and their innovation is impacting investor portfolios Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is a classic example of such a company that is both worshiped and feared Everything from retail to connected car to semiconductors to web services is impacted by Amazon I cannot believe how many companies out there literally exist to do nothing but make other companies competitive with Amazon said Cramer The next company in the list is Facebook NASDAQ FB which doesnt have to pay for content as users create it and advertisers want to use it This is a business model many companies crave for How can Alphabet GOOG GOOGL be left out from a list of innovators This is one company where people are more excited about what it is working on rather than its advertising revenue People get more excited about its upcoming projects like driverless cars The oddest of all the companies is Twitter NYSE TWTR No one can stop talking about Twitter since everyone is on it to check what is happening and people are wondering who will bid for it after Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT acquired LinkedIn NYSE LNKD They speak of Twitter as if its some diamond in the rough that is sitting in the ground and the only thing you need to do is get it out polish it and make it worthwhile is to get rid of the companys current management It might as well be the last diamond mine left to grab said Cramer Did Micron get its groove back The stock was up after receiving upgrades from Susquehanna and Nomura and according to Cramer this is the beginning of something good It looks to me like a major turn could be unfolding with not one but several product lines doing better he said After two years of going down its two products ie DRAMs and flash memories are seeing price increases The consolidation in the industry did not impact prices as PCs were in a secular decline Now inventories have been worked off and you could get a radical upswing in pricing that would give Micron much higher earnings said Cramer The upgrades from Nomura helped the highgrowth companies like Applied Materials NASDAQ AMAT Broadcom NASDAQ AVGO Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Texas Instruments NASDAQ TXN and Micron Cramer thinks Western Digital NASDAQ WDC and NXP Semiconductors NASDAQ NXPI are better plays on Internet of Things However when Micron and Western Digital catch a bottom in pricing thats not going to go away in days Thats why I think both stocks are buys for at least another he added Its not just the tech companies that are innovating in Silicon Valley but companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are also bulking up their technology to create the car of the future Cramer interviewed Fords CEO Mark Fields to find out what the future of cars will look like Fields mentioned that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is in a transition mode to become a mobility company keeping its core business intact It is moving into the ridesharing taxi business which is estimated to be worth T The car of the future is not just about getting people from point A to B but about human progress reducing traffic and congestion reducing accidents and impacting quality of life for millions of people <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also working with cities to create smart parking systems According to data of wasted fuel is consumed in looking out for parking and reducing that wastage is a top priority <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is integrating new technologies into the cars of today The companys sync and communication and entertainment platform is entering into its rd generation and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects to grow from M synced vehicles around the world to M by the end of the decade Cramer question Fields on the announcements made by Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Fields said Our combination is an auto and a mobility company and we think that makes a lot of sense for us But were not in a race to make announcements We are in a race to do whats right for our customers and whats right for our business Fields was excited about the car of the future What I am most excited about here is the innovation that is going on The innovation is who we are as a business going back to Henry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>he added <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is working on technologies that include connected vehicles Internet of Things and autonomous driving capabilities He also said that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a leader in plugin hybrid cars and a full of its nameplates will have electrified options in the future The company has also entered into a partnership with Amazon that allows Fords technology to connect to the cloud Fields also gave an update on sales by mentioning that North America is hitting the benchmarks but the US is lagging behind mainly due to the Takata OTCPKTKTDY airbag recall Europe is recovering modestly while China continues to be under gross margin pressure Latin America sales are weak but Fields is optimistic for the long term Cramer went off the tape to review privately held Robinhood an online brokerage firm that allows investors to buy and sell stocks for free He interviewed coCEOs Baiju Bhatt and Vlad Tenev to find out what lies ahead They explained that the entire trading is electronic and the new infrastructure makes the trading cost virtually zero This allows the company to offer its services for free and make money from the interest in customers accounts Robinhood is able to make money even during times of low interest rates and is more profitable as the rates rise of the companys M customers are firsttime investors HSBC NYSE HSBC It shouldnt be owned anyway as its balance sheet is not strong Twilio Pending TWLO Having Facebook as its customer helped Twilio move strongly higher However its still a small company and cannot be compared to unicorns Jim Cramers Action
