style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>likes to highlight borrower credit quality in its presentations The company has always loaned to high quality borrowers yet the finance wing still lost billions in Borrower credit quality wasnt the real problem in Operating leases were the problem If lease risktaking is similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is set up for much larger losses in the next recession according to company guidance Fellow Contributor Patrick Gunn has done an excellent job highlighting Fords NYSE F unique balance sheet situation and debt load along with the answering the questions of how and why the automaker has made the moves it has within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit the companys financing arm There isnt anything particularly concerning offhand to most investors After all the practice is common among automakers as well as with other equipment manufacturers such as Deere NYSE DE and Caterpillar NYSE CAT Why businesses engage in building these financing wings is easy to understand Paying cash for these large purchases isnt always easy and the United States especially as a society is built upon debt Having a controllable inhouse financing business often means a profitable side venture for the parent company and a seamless way of increasing sales bridging the often difficult gap of linking consumers with a willing lender The party line from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>today is that loans are being issued to quality borrowers minimizing overall risk Lending volumes are up and average FICO remained in the range in both and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pegs the risky part of its portfolio at just marking the vast majority of loans as high quality Credit metrics continue to improve such as day delinquencies falling y y Everything is sunshine and rainbows of course When does corporate management ever indicate otherwise These might not be the facts that investors really need to know however It might surprise shareholders to learn that it wasnt borrower defaults that drove the vast majority of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credits losses during the last recession The loss that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit undertook in likely isnt a surprise to many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>ended up hiking reserves for credit losses by B that year as otherwise healthy consumers began to default on their traditional automotive loans Chargeoffs repossessions and reselling cars is costly However if that was the only driver of losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit would have just broken even for according to management But the total loss was much greater for that year B What gives Leases are the answer to that question <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had to take a B impairment charge on its operating lease portfolio due to the steep decline in used vehicle auction values along with hiking depreciation rates by M on existing leases to reflect the new operating environment What drove those losses When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gets a car back from a lease the company generally dumps them in the used car auction market While they leave a little margin on the table that way it is the quickest and easiest way to move large volumes of vehicles When happened and demand appetite among auction buyers fell off of a cliff <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bean counters essentially got caught with their pants down The company had estimated it could sell a large volume of the cars it had leased during the boom years for much higher prices than reality ended up allowing Big losses followed as the company had to adjust everything down This is incredibly important While it is easy to point to consumer credit metrics for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and their propensity towards issuing high quality loans even during the depths of the recent downturn consumer defaults on debt obligations arent the only way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit to lose money and in fact werent the major driver of losses during Further confounding investors it is difficult to paint a picture on what assumptions are being used by management in valuing their lease portfolios <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors can draw comfort from a variety of metrics regarding borrower credit quality but where can they draw comfort on the internal assumptions being used on lease issuances The information simply doesnt exist Managed receivables today under <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remain slightly under and levels but this number has rallied off the bottom in after the industrys sales began to return Managed receivables are also not quite comparable as the company shifted Jaguar Land Rover and Mazda financing to other providers after the recession Operating leases made up of Fords managed receivable exposure in before the company dealt with multibillion dollar losses Today a number that has been trending back upwards after dropping initially following the big losses the company endured of managed receivables in were operating leases As far as the risk goes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has provided this handy sensitivity analysis in its most recent K For every miss on future expected auction values <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would be dealt a M hit to depreciation with higher than expected returns customers opting to buyout their lease rather than return the vehicle also driving losses That is painful What did <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>guide in before the big losses A change in auction values would drive just M in operating losses At December if future auction values for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credits existing portfolio of operating leases on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles in the US were to decrease by one percent from its present estimates the effect would be to increase the depreciation on these vehicles by about million That should worry investors In a nutshell this means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is even more predisposed to multibillion dollar lease losses today than it was in provided its risktaking assumptions on leases are similar to that period If history repeated itself losses would likely approach B potentially a bigger figure than that Did the company learn its lesson There isnt a real way to know the companys internal lease assumptions unfortunately Long story short just because the company deals primarily with prime loans doesnt mean that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit cant be dealt massive losses again in another downturn Defaults are just one part of the puzzle and may not be the primary one that investors should be concerned with Is this a reason to sell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>today I dont think so not by itself But it is worth highlighting past results here to help investors ask the right questions of management in order to make sure they are managing lease risk properly By owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors essentially own an automakerbank hybrid Profit potential is higher but investors need to practice more due diligence than they might
