Sales Highest In A Decade But Investors Wont Back Up The Truck <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Mike Young Young Research Group clicks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to deliver doubledigit US sales growth in September The growth is broad based and seems to be accelerating Last month I predicted that US auto sales would be very strong for the month of September and thats exactly what we got yesterday with the big three automakers all delivering doubledigit growth Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU was the weakest of the three with sales inline to slightly below expectations but notching growth and making this the th month in a row of car sales growth for the company GM NYSE GM was the belle of the ball just obliterating expectation with growth versus the expected by most in the industry And finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F continues to be the fastestgrowing of the bigthree growing a phenomenal year over year for the month while analysts were only expecting Going through Fords sales data we see that the increases in retail sales were broad based with passenger car sales up SUV sales up and trucks up In fact the retail vehicle sales numbers provided the company with its best September performance in years In addition the Fseries vehicles sales which represent almost of all vehicles sold and comprise the bulk of Fords revenue continued to accelerate from the strong results last month increasing a whopping and serving as the key driver behind the truck segments overall growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>vans also reported phenomenal growth at making it the best September commercial van sales since and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>SUV sales achieved the best September results in years making this the second month in a row the company has achieved this feat I believe there are three key drivers behind Fords and the other car manufactures strong US sales growth this month The first is Labor Day Or more specifically the fact that Labor Day weekend was included in September this year which is extremely rare instead of being included in August sales as it normally is This provided a huge albeit onetime boost to this months sales growth This is an important point to keep in mind when looking at the results as Labor Day weekend is a huge sales weekend for car manufacturers and dealers The second key driver is low oil prices which translate to low gas prices for consumers Keep in mind the average price per gallon is now across the nation as the energy sector continues to struggle with an oversupply of oil As a result we continue to see a large increase in sales specifically in the larger vehicle segments like pickup trucks and SUVs among all of the bigthree not just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>For example Fiat Chrysler saw its Jeep brand lead the way with a yy increase for the month of September Finally ultralow interest rates mostly driven by the Federal Reserves low interest rate policy are also helping to drive US sales with financing so cheap what consumers are willing to stretch themselves There was speculation the Federal Reserve would start to raise rates last month but ultimately decided to keep them unchanged continuing to provide a tailwind to the sector Low rates and easier access to credit will continue to drive demand as evidenced by a recent University of Michigan consumer sentiment poll that showed of households surveyed believe it is a good time to buy a car because of low interest rates Given all the positive numbers coming out of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the past few months investors have to wonder why the stock is not trading higher but instead seems to be stuck around share All of the drivers I have listed above could be taken as negatives but when you think it through doesnt explain the stocks performance For example September got a onetime boost from the inclusion of Labor Day weekend so the numbers could be probably are inflated But looking back at August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also crushed yy growth expectations WITHOUT the holiday weekend sales so we can be pretty confident in the trend Cheap gas may be pushing sales of larger vehicles higher but many analysts see oil prices remaining low for at least the medium term Furthermore consumers are paying less for gas not just because of cheaper oil but also because the fuel efficiency on many larger vehicles allow them to get much better mileage Finally while interest rates cannot remain low forever the Fed has been slow to raise them and will do so gradually especially after todays disappointing jobs report One issue that could be dragging down the stock is international sales especially China Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not as huge in China it does have a significant presence and clearly growth is slowing in the Asian region along with other emerging markets However Europe continues to improve and may provide enough of a boost to offset this slowdown And the US market continues to be on fire Overall this was a stellar month for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sales and the September auto sales rate was the highest in over a decade Furthermore the industry as a whole is potentially on track to beat its alltime record for total sales from with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well positioned to capture a significant portion of this growth Yet the stock continues to trade around x earnings and provides investors with a dividend
