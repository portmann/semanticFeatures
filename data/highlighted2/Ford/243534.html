About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company F By Carl Surran SA News Editor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F workers narrowly voted to approve their new fouryear labor agreement after receiving tallies from plants in Dearborn Mich The Detroit Free Press reports that the Dearborn truck plant with more than workers voted in favor which apparently was enough to carry all of the Local union to passing the vote and in turn ensuring the entire contract was ratified <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the finalDetroit automaker to reach a new national agreement after GM s deal was ratified Friday following a twoweek delay Gee I guess working together unions and responsible management can come to agreements without demonizing each other A good lesson to so many who post in union articles in SeekingAlpha who cant help but demonize unions Good for you <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and UAW Many union jobs are also shipped overseas when labor costs get to high It takes a joint effort between labor and management to recognize what is best for the financial health of the company I read an article last week which said the younger workers in this contract didnt think the thousand signing bonus was enough Should have upped my shares before the agreement but I thought the Union side would have struck down the proposalo well maybe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will brake the barrier again soon The flaws with unions are the same with any collectivism whether it is communism socialism progressivenism etcwhen you are paid the same as the guy next to you regardless of whether you work twice or half as hard as he doesproductivity always suffers tis the nature of man This is why everything unions touch usually end up going bankrupt at some point Automakers steel teamsters airlines governments etc and do a lousy job servicing their customersTeacher unions are probably best example of this CIm glad this is over it appears Jimmy Settles had to go down to Dearborn and tell the membership a no vote is a lose lose proposition Word was if it didnt pass we would have re voted on the same proposal and if that didnt work a strike The senior UAW leadership understands whats at stake but didnt do a good job selling it until the th hour There is nothing wrong with the work ethic or skill set of the average worker The problem is the mentality I wonder if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should drop the nepotism in their hiring practices and start vetting the employee candidates of their choice not the unions The apple falleth not far from the tree and I think we had some bad apples The outcome was exactly as I predicted modest raise strong cash bonuses and a road map to full pay within contracts It turned out it was even richer then that Yet I was still surprised at the difficulty in passing it and it does not bode well for future contracts I really like your comment about the nepotism it is a serious problem in many public owned companies where mngment by passes knowledgeable experience rich employees and bring in thier completely inexperienced family and friends most uaw workers recognize very quickly they have zero chance of promotion and that they will allways be just the help whos opinions arent important or recognized the actual problems with these companies lies at the top and middle mngment levalsthose that perform the actual product assembly quickly become uninspired and demoralized I agree with ivan above Once the UAW committee signs the agreement the outcome is in the hands of the UAW leadership If they fail to get ratification its their problem not Fords Im glad to see that the UAW leadership did their job I own a lot of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock With the FordUAW contract settled I will sit back and watch the billion plan in factory upgrades and expansions that will create or preserve jobs in the US unfold over the next years If management is smart they will use a large part of the billion in upgrades to replace the never satisfied union people with more robots The average assembly man is screwed either way Google robonaut Its a NASA machine that is slowly but consistently becoming as dexterous as a human <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM has already moved much of their supply chain to mexico or other cheap labor markets and whats left will be overrun by robonaut or This is not because of evil heartless management either this is because technology does not stand still and if you arent good at the STEM fields you will be obsolete within years max If my children arent talented at making others laugh then i hope to god they get into engineering school Otherwise they wont be able to afford moving out Jobs moving to Mexico and the head democrat bringing illegals here as fast as he can to take jobs from Americans in their own country Did union rank and file vote for that While Im certainly not a Union supporter congratulations are deserved here The UAW leadership and all their members negotiate and approved a contract without the usual animosity that saddled past negotiations Both sides should be proud that they made a contract that should help and not hinder the company for the next years Well done Congrats <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors that was a close one Jimmy Settles did a good job on the contract for his members the tough part was getting the young guys to realize it Not holding my breath on a positive stock price blip for this If recent past is any guide Good F news seems to causes its stock to go DOWN Lets hope that with these news the stock
