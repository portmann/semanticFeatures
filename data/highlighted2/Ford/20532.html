style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company which we are very happy to have here at the keynote lunch position It is one of the leading automakers progressing well through a long transition its got a long way to go Like a lot of other automakers it did hit a few speed bumps last year with some recalls and some incremental costs from the F launch but that is going very well and now appears solidly on track to benefit the Company in the second half of this year That launch as well as many others on the horizon continues to put forward at the top of the heap on refresh cycles and ultimately adjusted margins in North America Now we are looking for the success to be repeated in other regions around the world where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is growing fairly rapidly like China and recovering in Europe and dealing with some of the stress in South America We also are looking forward to how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will ultimately deal with their partners in the labor contract negotiations this summer with the UAW I dont think well get too much news on that today but thats an important thing to watch in the future Today we are very happy to have from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Joe Hinrichs Executive Vice President and President of the Americas Joe I am sorry Joe joined in December of at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at the Van Dyke Transmission Plant in Sterling Heights Michigan But he has been in a number of positions at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>most I think importantly is Group Vice President of Global Manufacturing and Labor Affairs and if you think about two things that are incredibly important about whats going at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>right now it is manufacturing as they transition to fewer and fewer platforms and ramp up their global manufacturing efforts as well as the labor affairs that are on the horizon this summer So Joe has got not only great experience in his current position in the Americas but knows a lot about some of the key issues that are going to be upcoming at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And with that Id like to invite Joe Hinrichs to the stage Thanks John and good afternoon everyone Enjoy your lunch please and well get going As John said we are proud to be here today and thanks for the opportunity to have us Let me talk a little bit about an update on where we are within the One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Plan specifically in North America and South America which ultimately I am responsible for as President of the Americas Ill come back at the end talk about our planning assumptions and key metrics and then give a few closing remarks and then of course valuable QA session at the end So give yourself time to think about those tough questions for John As you know our focus is to remain on our One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Plan It served us well over the last several years As Mark has come in clearly one of the things weve talked about is accelerating our work around the world and the One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Plan thats been the foundation of our business for a better part of almost eight years now Weve been talking a lot about product excellence with passion You saw that I think you saw anything about the continental concept with Lincoln that we unveiled today and yesterday and Monday throughout the week here in New York And an important part of our business of course is innovation with whats going on in the industry and whats going on all around us and bringing that thinking around innovation every part of our business So these are all the kind of our key focus areas that served us well and will serve us well In September at our Investor Day we talked about our longterm objectives These are consistent with what we showed in September and that is globally what we are trying to achieve and where we are working through to get to for the top five in sales we are currently six as you probably know Whether its a more balanced regional and segment profits of course our strong business in North America we want to keep that going while improving our business in other parts of the world operating margins of plus globally in and great returns for our shareholders and then highly regard about all our stakeholders Its becoming more and more important in our industry whether its partnerships going on with suppliers or with others even competitors but also clearly with our union partners and governments dealers everyone are in the business Remember I certainly remember them well and with all the recession we did here in North America but a great turnaround story as you know We did get to plus percentage margins in and with a record billion profit in When you look at with a stronger industry there are really two reasons why that number dropped to billion We signaled it was going to happen it was a transition year for us With major launches in North America including the conversion of the F and the lot production that went with that and we also had about billion worth of recalls last year which you are very familiar with So when you add the transition in the F and the recall they kind of have an explanation for what happened in When we think of as a great opportunity and Ill talk more about that in a little bit But weve been very focused on watching our structural cost watching the margins of our business while growing appropriately with the industry and with segmentation and very reliant upon our new products and whether its the F or the Transit Van or the Mustang or other new products that we have coming into the marketplace To keep that lineup fresh which we want to be if not the fresh its one of the freshest in the industry in the showroom which we know leads to good profitable growth So our priorities in North America havent changed If you heard me speak before in the last couple of years these numbers at least the word havent changed We need to continue to deliver profitable growth All three of those words are important for the delivery aspect for the profit aspect and then as the growth aspect and we expect to have market share growth this year We havent seen that yet in the first quarter because of the timing of our launches and of course especially F but also the Edge and the timing of where we are in that cycle But we have great expectations for strength especially in the second half of the year when we get to full volume with our launches and our products So we are working very hard and accelerating our quality improvements Ill talk a little bit about that We are very pleased with the progress we are making there Our develop and launch outstanding products launch has been a big part of our business Certainly launches in North America historic and record number for us in our year history in that regard But seven more launches in North America this year including important products like the Lincoln MKX and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Edge the all new Edge and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Explorer and the G VVDR Mustang and of course not noted in that seven is the F launch in Kansas City which is a sound launch and a big important part of our business We are focusing a lot on the Lincoln brand a lot and well talk a lot about that We can talk more about that in a little bit and then controlling our cost as we grow our business which is historical then when the challenges in our industry is lot in the car space while our business is growing If I look back of where the sales rates have been in the last couple of years weve seen tremendous growth as you know from in the US from to to we had nearly a million or million plus unit growth And we dont expect that level of growth to continue this year but we do expect some growth Our forecast is remember ours include the medium and heavyduty trucks so our forecast is million to million cars for the full year In the industry for the full year if you look at we were it looks like Mark is going to come in around again with the medium and heavy number And there we are racking up the numbers today as they are reported which is a strong industry Remember last year we had a industry because of how about February January last year so the comps yearoveryear will top But the industry is still strong and transaction part is still strong as well So we are pretty much in line Hope that kind of growth we are expecting in the industry and a lot of thats being driven by retail demand You can see the retail star down below Strong retail growth replacement demand and also new demand as the economy continue to improve Of course very important part of our business and very important part of how we look at the business is pickup truck sales and of course with our great new F out and this is a look back at where weve been in the last several years on both housing starts and pickup sales We know there is a strong correlation between the two and there is still room to run on housing as people know and so that voice that could up the pickup truck business for the next several years to come with the housing market continues to grow which we expect it to do Now there have been some offsetting factors with the oil market in the US dropping up all segmentation dropping up a little bit with the rig counts and et cetera but the real gas prices have more than compensated for that So its still a healthy environment for trucks seeing that in transaction prices and in the overall volumes So our US market share thats how we expect to grow this year We lost about a point of share last year A lot of that was like six tenth of that was F related and because of the limitations we had the balance that we are giving out between pricing and volume but we had a fixed number of vehicles to sell and that transitioned from our old model to our new model it has gone very well its been timed very well and our manufacturing launch has gone extremely well So we were on this one year journey almost between summer to summer that we have to manage to maximize the margins and the revenue loss selling down and converting over to the new one In the first quarter this is through February of course if you looked at our numbers in March we are still racking up the numbers but our sales were down total in March but that was due to fleet sales because we are not delivering really F to fleet customers yet as we fill up the pipeline and we see strong retail demand for the F Our three customers are waiting They know they are coming in the second quarter We timed it that way So there is no lack of demand but its certainly a lot of interest in the trucks at the retail level At the same time the Edge launches in the first quarter and we didnt have a lot of Edge deliveries to fleet or in some cases to retail as well So thats why we are looking forward to the second half of the year and most of our launches are based on the first half of the year including Edge and Explorer and F If you look at I mentioned that one of the key priorities we are going to make is on our quality improvements we had a significant improvement last year in June in the JD Power Initial Quality Survey and we went above industry average from the bottom quartile the year before but dramatic improvements in the brand this represent the mile year versus mile year and we can see that that gap to bestinclass dropped by about almost So we saw significant improvement yearoveryear I dont have the data with me because we are not ready to share it yet but I can tell you that mile year progress continues and we are seeing significant progress in our mile year quality results so far as well Thats significant for two reasons one you can see the gap to bestinclass to mile on TBWs things have gone wrong have decreased significantly and we are seeing significant improvement in our mile year on that subject and because we had major launches last year Historically we havent delivered significant quality progress while we had major launches So the teams worked really hard to bring those two together and I am hopeful youll see a lot of good data coming forth in that We are at all time best levels on quality in the North American system today both on warranty and on things gone wrong So encouraging signs and hopefully more to come This is a product slide we show at the business review every Thursday morning and the green represents just a reminder on what we launched new last year and the blue is what is launching new this year and just going back for a second youll recognize a lot of those name plates from F to Mustang the Focus and Explorer and Edge and Expedition and Transit We have a medium duty truck coming later this year as well A big part of our portfolio is changing over the last year this year In fact more than half of our sales in this calendar year will be products thats all new in the last months So you can see the transition we are going through and the opportunity that presents because best part wins in the marketplace if its well executed of course which we are pretty proud of that as well This is the F if youve been living in Iraq you didnt now we have a new one As you may have heard actually its also have aluminum body I will say that we are really proud of this truck Its one of our major awards now Its won just about almost every major award in North America and the consumer acceptance of the truck so far has been outstanding and the truck the mile year turn in days in March and the lot turned days in February and the lot days in January Its turning much faster than we expected at a much higher mix which is great And we are also seeing selling demand so far mile year Thats why the F series sales need to be very strong And if you look at the launch itself again lot of questions on this Dearborn truck is up to full volume IT has been now for over a month Its full production three crews running at jobs and everything that we are looking for and the quality looks great Kansas City Assembly Plant is still on its launch curve Its on three crews and we expect it to ramp to full production over the next couple of months in the second quarter Weve been shipping for quite sometime out of Kansas City and we are looking forward in the summer getting our inventory levels up to levels where we can start to really run after the market and excited about that So so far so good in the F launch and the consumer acceptance for the truck has been great and the sales have been very strong so far as well Now a little bit on the marketing update because you dont see this I mention all the time Just to give you a little feel for the impact F has in our business and just how much interest it generates We got million video reviews from different sources on YouTube and otherwise on the F just think about that for a second Our demand metrics remains very strong Over million online build and price wed still take the time to build and price to truck may not buy but they are still interested in it So that is great and an additional requests for information from our dealer network So you can get a sense for as to what that looks like We sold F Series in March just to give some perspective here of what these numbers look like As I said we are turning I gave you the March number its actually days again In March we have our new mile truck with about clearly less than of our sales represent and it still continues to climb up as the inventory gets out there And the mix has been very strong and the transaction prices for F or in total or F Series in total were up over in March over last year So you can see that the rich mix is dealing and the demand in the new truck We are also very excited about the new Edge which is being launched as we speak up in Oakville in Canada Its a great all new product Its a little bit longer more leg room in the rear great new engine the liter ecoboost engine for the sport version This is part of our most technologically advanced sport product weve ever built It has almost all the features we can think of Very exciting product and we began shipping those in March So starting to arrive in dealership and we had a good month in March on the Edge sales They were driven by the old model of course but we are very excited about this new product and getting it in the marketplace We also have assessing on the Explorer I dont need to tell you how important Explorer is to our business We sold over million of them since we started the Explorer in the s and our Explorer sales in March was very strong Demand for the Explorer for the last this segment and the SUV segment seems to be very strong Weve been prioritizing increasing production capacity in Chicago for the Explorer in the last couple of years Weve been building more and our inventory levels are rising which is allowing us to sell more which is why we are seeing so much growth in the Explorer sales A very strong business and we are very excited about this especially the platinum version which is good for the Explorer again high end We have seen continued highend content on these SUVs need to grow and we are very excited about what Explorer is going to do for us as new liter ecoboost engine at the ecoboost offerings plus the sport version So very excited about this product and very important to our business Weve been talking a lot about performance especially in Detroit and ourselves We kept the DTA figures and we certainly got lot of attention for that as well since January But this is just a representation of some of those great <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>performance products and this is really important to the brand when it talks a lot about innovation and a lot of our new technologies lot of our new development can first show up on performance vehicles whether its carbon fiber tub to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GT whether its carbon fiber wheels in the GR and Mustang and whether its what we are doing on aero and light weighting of aluminum structures and et cetera And also it brings a different kind of customer to our brand On the FZ product Focus is the FZ of the buyers of the buyers are new to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And weve done some research and on our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>performance products the customers who buy a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>performance product half of them buy a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and thats vehicle for another vehicle So you can see the passion that brings to the brand We are very excited about these products We have the new Rafter coming out next year We have the Mustang Shelby GTR which is a Mustang on there Of course the GT there is only going to be on the year So a wait line but thats the focus We are showing it for the New York Auto Show and not on this show but we also introduced the Focus RF going to be coming to the US next year and in the stand here in New York so if you want to see that So lot of great news here coming forward Of course this week here in New York we spent a lot of time talking about Lincoln And Lincoln is a very important part of our future As you know the luxury part of the industry is growing its growing fast as the average industry overall The fast part of the business generally speaking around the world and we have a lot opportunity and a lot of heritage with Lincoln but lot of opportunity So our focus on Lincoln is around really three main priorities A distinct brand what is Lincoln going to stand for and how can it be different to the consumer both in their experience and in the product So we talk a lot about that this year Unique and compelling product We just unveiled the continental concept its been very well received this week The fourth of the four new products that committed a few years ago to Lincoln and then really working hard on superior try and experience to make sure that people get a chance to really experience Lincoln in a new way in the Lincoln way they were talking about both in China and elsewhere Lot of good opportunity for China as well as weve just launched Lincoln in China in the fourth quarter of last year Weve been on a journey and we think its going to be a journey with an investment in the future but also its going to take time to get Lincoln where we wanted to be This is just a little bit of reminder of where we been in that journey already over the last couple of years And when you look at it we have a steady plan to not only reinvent Lincoln as a brand but also have the right product portfolio and the consumer experience for that If you look at the same product class I said you before on Lincoln also a lot of new products coming for that brand as well where the MKZ which is all new last year which is incremental volume to the brand its been helping grow the retail sales increases The Navigator was test in last year and its been selling extremely well over the last several months actually exceeding our expectations It was up another or something in March in last year and then MKX all new coming later this year which we are very excited about This is the MKX As youll recognize its great proportion very excited about this product and importantly a great new version of the MKX in a high volume segment for the luxury industry There is the continental concept If you go to the show Id encourage you please to go to Lincoln stand and see it We are biased of course but I think its a beautiful car that also embodies where the frontend feature is going to be for Lincoln Weve been working hard on the next generation where Lincoln goes as of design and you can see a lot of design elements here Very excited about this vehicle both inside and out and it does takes Lincoln to a whole new level of the experience in the vehicle and the design DNA both in and out So very excited about this product and very important to the Lincoln brand both here in North America and in China So just to summarize here in North America a few key takeaways the industry is strong We are forecasting some growth this year but importantly as you look at the first quarter results transaction price to build to be strong in the industry So its a good sign of a healthy industry where you are seeing a little bit of growth and good transaction prices Of course in North America we are focusing delivering the launches following the launches and then getting our inventory in line to be able to grow in the second half of the year Ive talked about our quality actions We are very pleased with the progress we are seeing there and we are making sure that we have our focus on that So we have a strong business going forward We do project strong margins to continue We talked a little bit about North America and Ill talk about that at the end of my presentation First quarter does reflect the impact of our launches Edge launch so it was down a lot in the first quarter and the Kansas City Assembly Plant being down a lot transitioning to the new F So our margins and our progress this year will be impacted by the timing of our launches especially in the first quarter and we are maintaining a lean cost structure and of course working hard on the Lincoln plan you are seeing that in the product portfolio and the retail sales growth that we are seeing in Lincoln So good times to be in business in North America and we are really excited about what looks like for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Lincoln in So thats North America Now lets talk about the other end of the section a little bit in South America So this is a bit reverse of what we saw to North America We had a strong line of straight quarters of profitability in South America For those of you forgot those already very strong business for us As you know the world changed in the economic environment and political environment certainly in South America Weakening currencies high inflation in many cases high interest rates and trade policies or currency policies and balance of trade that are also impacting industry And if you look at the South American industry in the first quarter our estimate was down yearoveryear in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year Brazil was down and Argentina was down So you are seeing significant industry reductions in the first quarter versus they were last year Essentially this is where we thought we are going to be coming into the year So a lot of pressure on the business Currencies have weakened even further to people are projecting If you look at the Reais in Brazil its weakened even further than people were even projecting maybe three six months ago So a lot things going on down there and well talk a little bit about that This is a snapshot of the business environment you know it well I already talked about it a lot A lot of things providing headwinds to the business in South America So our challenge and responsibility is to manage the business quite profitable as possible We got to take advantage of the business that we have in front of us I mentioned the industry numbers in the first quarter but our market share in South America we project is up percentage points on a basis of to Thats significant improvement in market share in South America in the first quarter driven largely by our performance in Brazil and Argentina and largely by the new cars thats been very well received and its been doing very well Ill talk a little bit about that in a second Our strategy in South America given the macroeconomic environment is you see that is the One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Plan but also frankly to we sit that down the hatches and get through the storm We are seeing significant improvements in quality and our new products have dramatically improved the fuel economy of our products in South America Weve been implementing the doubleproduct strategy So now pretty much across the lineup in South America we have global <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>products which we are doing very well as indicated by the market share growth and it helps the brand as a longterm growth We are working hard on the revenue and market share given the economic environment and the political and industry dynamics going on down there And watching our footprint in our cost base as much as we can And of course importantly managing currency risk and balance of trade between the countries you know weve deconsolidated Venezuela and wont be reporting that in our numbers any more We are watching very carefully what goes in each of the integral countries so to make sure that we know where our balance of trade is and also where our currency and risk is and it makes volume to the currency This is the same chart the BPR chart that we showed for South America You can see last year the KA the green on the upper right was the major launch very important product for Brazil and the rest of South America We also import some of the Mustang and some heavyduty trucks but I want to talk about we launched the heavyduty truck again Brazil very important truck actually down there And we imported Transit into the market down there This year is a big launch Focus especially on the Focus which is made in Argentina We are also exporting to South America the Explorer and the Edge from North America and in few markets the F But the big launch this year is focused as KA was last year This is the KA you look at the all new KA has been a leading seller in Brazil since we launched it most months been a top five selling car and its led to that market share gain I talked to you about We are seeing significant market share growth in South America yearoveryear in a very pressurized market given the dynamics but very strong acceptance of the vehicle Im very excited about what it means to our future This is the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus which is the kind of embodies the brand in South America Its a higher end car as you can appreciate in those markets and it really crafting kind of great looks and lot of technology This is a very important car to us in South America to help establish the brand EcoSport and Ranger also very important to us down there as well A few key takeaways for South America You know the macroeconomic and political situations are challenging they are fluid and they change rapidly and so our team down there led by our President Steve Armstrong and the team down there everyday dealing with a little bit of uncertainty in change but we are working very hard to make sure our capacity our inventory and our volumes are lined up So we dont we get ourselves in trouble there We continue to launch the One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>product which is certainly a critical part of our plan I already mentioned the Venezuela and longterm we still view South America as a very important part of the business an attractive business region As I told you nine figures of profitability good returns to the company I get through where we are today The question is how long it lasts and but the good question and also at least making sure that we have a business model that could sustain us though during this time period In Venezuela now going on frankly I didnt talk about it much because until we get dollars we dont buy parts And so we dont have parts we dont sell vehicles and so its been a very depressed industry given the dynamics of the dollar availability in Venezuela So lets go back and talk about This was the guidance we gave for the business units and our key metrics for They are unchanged which is good news its talked about on April We still expect higher profit in North America and operating margins in the to range We are off to a good start South America we felt it will be substantially improved for the base of almost billion loss last year I will say that as I mentioned that the industry has been down more in South America in the first quarter then we were to project it given the plan and currencies have weakened even further and we planned for launching in South America very carefully Europe will be improved results we project it to be a lot but you can see as the primary in our loss last year AsiaPacific profits will be higher this year versus last year Our interest expense will be equal to or higher than last year and of course profits which is the great part of our business will be equal to or higher than last year So reconfirming the guidance we have given for the total profitability to be in the million to million range excluding special items and the breakup by the business units as they are described here If you look at importantly both for when we did the fourth quarter earnings call we showed the slide in the last in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>University we showed the slide in the right one that reinforces to our colleagues and all our investors and all the folks associated with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we do expect our profitability a conversation of our profits in will not be consistent with our typical year The green line kind of represents historical and the blue represents kind of directionally where well be in As I told John these are not the scale so dont try and do the math and dont try and get your ruler out and figure out whats underneath the curve Weve already said that this year will be more profitable than last year So you can understand we dont want to give out too many hints Its abnormal because of the timing of launches not just in North America with fully the F and the Edge launch has impact first quarter but also in AsiaPacific where weve been where we are launching a bunch of new plans in the first half of the year including which Mark was there to open the last two weeks and also the new plant And a lot of new investments and a lot of new growth in products and in plants in the first half of the year So that also affects whats going on Also a reminder that for we expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be comparable with similar but we do expect that rates to vary by quarter So you can see that in the slide here and in the first quarter to be higher than the run rate for the full year So we wanted to reinforce that with everybody out there So they can make sure their models are working correctly Lets talk about planning assumptions and key metrics We do expect the US influence earlier to be about million First quarter is off to around that kind of start as we look at it high s will be the math I think is going to come in for the first quarter We do expect our revenue on the automotive side to be higher than with the growth we expect to see here and also around the world Our operating margin to be higher than what it was last year our operating cash flow to be higher and of course pretax profit as I said earlier is equal to or higher and the corporate profits already talked about So a strong business and a strong environment for most parts of the world And just reaffirming where we think things will turnout for We think is going to be a really strong year for us and really have the opportunity to be a breakthrough year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>coming off of With the global launches we had last year especially the here in North America sets us up very well especially with our launch timing this year for a strong year especially in the latter half of the year both in North America and in AsiaPacific and so thats the plan Next slide here if you look at just in summary our plan hasnt changed which is great where we are all working on accelerating the development to deliver the plan Our longterm objectives havent changed We are very excited about the future We had our challenges and there is some uncertainty and there is some newness in the street that makes so exciting and also provides an opportunity An opportunity for those companies like ourselves to innovate and learn and grow and to be a part of the solutions for not just the industry but for our consumers and for our economies and for our governments and we are excited about that future and we think that our plan is focused well to be able to do that to adapt and also be part of the solution to the issues and ideas that are out there And we look forward to of course delivering our framework to be able to deliver and execute the business So thats a quick run through the One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>story for the Americas A tale of two different continents to be sure Exciting times in North America and exciting times for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Lincoln at the same time in South America we are working through the challenges and looking for the opportunities to prevail for not just the nearterm goals but for the medium and longterm And with that John if we may we can go to questions Ill kick it off with the first question The pricing environment in the US continues to drive the upside particularly at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which is a really really good thing I am just curious if you are looking your products and your strategy and your capacity utilization level how long do you think that will last How long you can hold on to that and also because it has been so good it seems like you guys are really pushing mix a lot of these platinum series vehicles a lot of the Explorer So thats part reflects that mix but its very profitable actions that you are taking and we are trying to how you think about where pricing and mix can go because it seems like it just continues to surprise the upside Yes thanks John Its an important part of our business We do focus very much on profitable growth and the margins that go with that Where weve been constrained F series lately and some of the SUV products weve been working very hard to give content with valueadded to the consumers that also provides the opportunity for more up scaling on the series and the mix and the opportunity to grow the revenue So its for the good example Edge is another good example that and certainly F series has shown that on the F launch as well Because when you are constrained we are obviously worked to break those constraints to a certain extent because thats important and weve been seeing that weve been increasing capacity on Super Duty on Explorer we are working hard on F and of course we have to get to the launch the scope of the increasing capacity But the industry has been in some respects out running the capacity and so weve been a the same time looking at mix and looking at our pricing to make sure we are optimizing that full equation And as youve seen throughout the last year even where weve been constrained weve been working very hard on making sure those transaction prices are healthy and it can get even healthier As we look at holistically we dont just chase share we dont just chase margin we are trying to balance that equation But we definitely are looking at in that way and one of the ways to do that is to give the customers who want that even more content which then provides more revenue and we are seeing especially in the SUV side that opportunity has been very strong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Platinum and we are very excited about that as well as what we are doing with the Explorer If you havent seen the Platinum version of the Explorer its outstanding and thats new we dont have a Platinum version of Explorer today Ill jump in for a quick one and the move to aluminum my crew its been a recent phenomenon and its a very big move From a manufacturing side can you share with us anything that your team would learn positive or negative on the production side on some aluminum end F has there been any surprises on the cost side the pricing been great but we dont know much about the cost side and then maybe the customer talks you held with your dealers is there an excitement about aluminum and now that gasoline prices are a lot lower that changed any of the dynamics of demand of that vehicle Sure let me just startup saying that the launch we have not awarded the launch of the F has gone extremely well and we are proud of that product both in the consumer standpoint but also from a manufacturing and quality and engineering standpoint The from a manufacturing standpoint I would say we learned a lot from Dearborn which we are able to incorporate in the Kansas City and the Kansas City launch has gone even better than the Dearborn launch because of those learnings Weve been very pleased to see the well I say the manufacturability of the F I think I was quoted in January saying the truck builds well which is in the manufacturing term which means it doesnt it isnt difficult but on the on the line that some vehicles are harder to build and others and the teams are now getting job of making sure that we can do that Theres been a lot of learnings on the stamping side to be standard we dont talk about that a lot But stamping aluminum in high volume is very different than forming metal sheet metal or the steel And as many a learnings on the stamping side has been on the buying shop side of riveting and bonding and everything else which has been important learnings for us because of the dynamics of aluminum respond differently as you can appreciate than steel So thats the difference in learnings there which has been great I would say on balance both Dearborn and Kansas City launch faster than I expected they would which has been great and bodes well for the future of my learnings We have over patents on the vehicle more manufacturing related so we are excited about that The consumer acceptance has been great you remember that was even the poor gas prices started dropping we were selling a lot of times talking about the capability of the truck that was enabled by taking the read out And thats an very important part of equation it was always as fascination on what the fuel economies are going to be because its aluminum and the light weighting But equally important to the truck customer was the capability that came with that light weighting and thats been an important part of the class leading payload the great acceleration the stamping distance the maneuverability of the truck and how it drives and thats the feedback weve been getting People are so pleasantly surprised at how easier its to drive and thats where that comes from the light weighting and what it feels like the drive it and that was the very important part of our strategy all along of course we didnt expect fuel economy be where fuel prices to be where they are today to be honest couple of years ago But the reality is for truck buyers that capability was always paramount and they want better fuel economy which we are also giving them So the other thing that people are realizing is that let me take all that weight out you get the benefit of weight out you get the benefit of fuel economy savings no matter what you do And there is always this debate on is it highway is it city is it and our truck because the weight came out always you get the benefit no matter what you are doing long something if you are going up the hill if you are what you are doing so thats the feedback weve been receiving Theres been very little apprehension around the aluminum from what we get from our dealers So aluminum noise we are on about what insurance rates would be and what that they been pretty comparable as these people see now weve been selling them for several months And so that has kind of died down and people are very excited about the truck and again they are turning about as quickly as we can get them in there So so far so good Thanks so we have the same question to GM this morning again I would ask you Regarding contract renegotiations or new contract negotiations with your suppliers the annual price downs that you are getting lets say in the last few months is that the same that you are getting in the last several years Is it better or is it worse and are there any trends maybe by region or by products that you can talk to I would say I can just speak to honestly to North America South America is at a different environment right now but in North America I would say there is nothing demonstrably different from where weve been as far as cost downs and our TVM activity our total volume our working with supply bases to come up with ideas to reduce COGS And what we are seeing there is consistence I would say its I would use the word I would use of course commodity prices have come down So in conjunction with that we are seeing lower commodity prices and so if we have commodity price negotiations that are obviously different than your cost down you are regular kind of a cost improvement initiative which are pretty consistent So we do have a lot of new products So when you go through a launch you are going to leave yourself with a period where you dont make it much change at all because you want to stabilize the product and then you once you get through the launch you work with the supply base and your own engineering group to work with the crossselling opportunities So we are about to embark on a pretty busy stage in that regard because we had so many new launches but thats not different because its more abundant and difficult So I have to say there is not much difference as far with the supply base other than commodities being lower on most commodities and thats a different dynamic Yes yes right either that of the F both There is a lot going on I mean when we look at where you are positioned versus a company like Chrysler I mean obviously you have a lot fewer entrylevel workers So there is going to be a debate of whether you get to raise your entrylevel penetration or they get to lower their entrylevel penetration or just goes away I am curious what your thoughts are there The union repeatedly to us highlights the fact that theyve made a lot of concession since and at this point they need to win for their membership So I am just curious what you think that might look like from what we hear its about to raise so something in that ballpark is what we have heard so Im curious what youve heard there And then thirdly whether you disagree with or agree with our idea that pensions could potentially ultimately be on the table and this round negotiations or ultimately in the future so to tie those off and remove that risk given really the risk of increased longevity or life expectancy that it may go up dramatically as signs really ramps up particularly with stuff like immunotherapy So of course you have negotiations this year are an important part of the plan for this year Just a couple comments first of all now this start backwards on the pension side of things as you know weve been working on salary over the couple of years of derisking our portfolio and we were starting to see very strong benefits from that and we are starting to see probably good results from that So weve been working on derisking our portfolio on our own and want to continue to do that Well thats the negotiations play out where they may but certainly we are very comfortable with how our pension strategy is working for us and we are seeing benefits from that In regards to the negotiations themselves there has been a lot of rhetoric and a lot of speculation on where the issues would be and where the priorities would be I just make a couple comments First of all if you look into Dennis Williams comments and you are listened to the company comments certainly understanding that for the investment levels to continue and the great job growth numbers that weve had in the US to continue we have to maintain a level of competitiveness that makes sense And so we will all work towards that and whatever that looks like Thats number one because the outstanding for those sales are from history that dont repeat it There is a lot of cycles in this industry that we are all well aware of and weve all been through So its in all of our interest to avoid those cycles at least with the dramatic ups and downs of those cycles in the future And clearly the entrylevel compensation of the entrylevel employees and the percentage of the entrylevel employees is something thats getting a lot of attention and Im sure that we can get a lot of conversation in the negotiations Its too early we dont talk many numbers or any directional things at this stage at the point where we are about getting more heavy in the summer But clearly we got to be open to listening to each other to find out the solutions can be but we all have the same interest which is ultimately to have a competitive business that can go over and compete so that we can continue to invest in the US and support the business here Everyone have the same interest at heart Interestingly just to call out Dennis was very clearly called out the desire for patent bargaining in and so how that looks and what it means for the fall will be something we all look together on but ideally some of those discrepancies that exist because of the bankruptcy at two of our competitors will set themselves out as part of our patent bargaining process At the end of the day I keep reminding people that what we did together while the master restructuring it works And everybody is benefiting from that The jobs weve created in the US in the over per employee of profit sharing in lump sum our employees have our UAW employees have gotten in So if it dont get balanced that we all have to work with but we have to remember how we got here and why we got here and then what we do about it going forward And I am looking forward to the discussions and listening to where the opportunities are to keep our business competitive and also to be where would be the investments going forward At the same time we understand that we are ready with the big part of the restructuring took place in North America so I know that personally I was involved in all those negotiations and well make sure that we have a business going forward that meets our expectations that we talked about but also meet the expectations of our employees as well I have a quick balance sheet question So as credit investors we try to look at like what optimal liquidity on when your competitors brought out a billion cover that was right for their company How does your team think about what optimal liquidity on the balance sheet is and how do you kind of weigh investor sense of it share buybacks rather to again investment grade profile because it certainly circular in nature Just kind of curious about where you are in the cycle Sure well first of all we said very clearly that we want to remain investment grade status through any economic cycles so that is an important part of our planning and part of our scenario We do a lot with leadership our CFO we do a lot of scenario planning looking at different scenarios and making sure that we can have the right kind of liquidity If you remember one of the things that separated us from GM and Chrysler in was our liquidity And making sure that we have ample liquidity to get through cycles is a very important part of our business planning And in this industry as you know when the industry turns or the economy turns especially in North America you can burn through a lot of cash So we do a lot of scenario planning to protect for any kind of scenarios to make sure that we are we are comparable with our cash As you know weve given targets where we start debt levels to be and where they are going to be going forward and at par level than have been historically given the health of our balance sheet And we talked about the funding of our pension plans which is also very important and the derisking nature of that So we look at all these things in context together and of course we have been increasingly rewarding our shareholders with dividends which has been an important part of our strategy and weve been raising the dividend over the last several years And weve always said that well continue to look at what that means So weve kind of tried to balance all these things very well but its also very important to leadership team that we have the liquidity available to protect our the viability of our business which is the product plan Because we learned and saw the benefits of being able to continuing to keep our product plan heavily supported with liquidity and cash in the downturn and came out with healthier business because of it with a fresh showroom and gain share and we had a very profitable business So thats kind of how we think about it We do a lot of risk planning and risk scenarios But we have been rewarding shareholders and weve talked about the willingness and openness of doing that in the future As you remember Bob showed a chart or a slide in the Investor Day about talking about if the future goes out the way we expect it to that we will have opportunities to look at other opportunities to use our capital But investing in the business for growth globally and making sure that we have the product pipeline full and fresh is a priority and certainly the derisking and funding of the pension plan has been our priority as has been the debt reductions which youve seen and then importantly that growing contributions to our shareholder have also been priority So weve looked at it in a very balanced way of making sure that we have liquidity for the future in any scenario And I think with that to stay on track were going to wrap it up and
