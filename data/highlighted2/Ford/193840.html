style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is starting to get inventories of its new F in line with demand This should substantially benefit earnings going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F the iconic US carmaker has several good things going for it First of all it survived with the collapse of the American auto industry without the need for a government bailout which is a testament to the companys management Secondly it makes the countrys most popular vehicle The new F continues to see very strong demand and is selling well Taking these factors into account the stock should be trading in line with the market but it currently sells at a significant discount to major indices This leaves plenty of room for multiple expansion together with improving results The days that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was woefully incapable of satisfying the soaring demand for the new F seem to be largely behind us Some analysts considered this lack of inventory a major issue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>However being unable to keep up with demand is certainly better than having inventory exceed demand leading to a pricing edge among other things With the two plants pretty much online <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems like it can roughly meet demand for the countrys most popular pickup truck While its probably not yet quite at the level of inventory it would like to see September F sales came in very strong retail sales up a whopping while the Fseries sales on the whole were up Deliveries of were very close to the mark analysts were hoping for Getting the F back online is of supreme importance to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as the vehicle makes up a very significant portion of Fords bottom line Indeed during the supply shortage as well as the retooling process things were tough on Fords earnings fullyear EPS down around yearoveryear Things are looking up this year so far though with a big beat in Q and fullyear EPS consensus of around Moreover in the nick of time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>largely resolved a labor dispute that could have led to a potentially very costly plant strike in Missouri As such truck deliveries are likely to keep ticking up According to a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>spokesperson inventories stood at around units at the end of September up from at the beginning of the month So far the market doesnt seem particularly impressed with Fords ramping up of the F production Over the last three months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock is down about roughly in line with the broader market I feel like investors are not giving the company enough credit for its future earnings potential Even on a TTM basis the stock looks inexpensive trading at around times trailing earnings Currently analysts are looking for EPS of around This puts the stocks PE ratio at a jaw droppingly low Even for fullyear the ratio looks excellent at roughly Moreover the PEG ratio of indicates that this growth is inexpensive Although more expensive than GM on both a trailing and forward PE basis I believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will recapture much of the market share it lost in the light truck segment as inventories build up to better align with soaring demand As such <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>looks like the better option to me at the moment As Fords F production ramps up to meet unabatedly strong demand the companys outlook for the next few years looks good if analyst estimates are anything to go by Staving off a potentially disruptive strike at its Missouri plant it looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to keep building inventory over the next few months The stock is moreover cheap not only on a trailing basis but especially looking at forward multiples which suggest the market is not giving the stock enough credit for its future earnings potential We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do
