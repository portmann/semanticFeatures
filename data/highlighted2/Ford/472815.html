<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor released weakerthanexpected nd quarter earnings on Thursday The auto company further said that its guidance is at risk which caused Fords stock to crater I discuss what to do after Thursdays massacre What a blow for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F shareholders yesterday The auto company which investors still hold in high esteem for its high grade dividend shocked investors on Thursday when it reported weakerthanexpected nd quarter earnings that sent the companys shares into a tailspin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors are used to the occasional emotionallyfueled drop but yesterday was a new experience for many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shareholders for sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares crashed after the earnings release slumping percent after the company not only underperformed analysts earnings expectations but also said that its guidance is at risk Usually guidance warnings dont go down well with shareholders and thats exactly what played out yesterday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors nd quarter earnings picture really wasnt that great to be frank The auto company said that its net income declined million yearoveryear to billion Fords adjusted pretax profit of billion a significant number took a hit too slumping million compared to the nd quarter of last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors revenues however increased billion compared to last year and hit billion a reflection of strong sales in the United States At the end of the day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor earned share in adjusted profits a decline of share YY Importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor missed the consensus adjusted earnings estimate of share by a wide margin Investor sentiment took a hit yesterday not only because of weakerthanexpected earnings but also because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor said that its guidance is at risk which of course was a negative catalyst for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares What investors ticked off was this sentence from the earnings release Expect another strong year of results and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>committed to full year guidance of company pretax profit and operating margin equal to or better than last year however company now sees risks challenging achieving guidance So to recap Weak earnings missed consensus estimates challenged guidance Investors do have a point being worried about Fords earnings trajectory over the short haul after yesterdays fairly direct guidance warning but I dont think that the US is headed for a major correction in auto sales at this point Further as I have explained in my last piece about the auto company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor A BuyAndHold Strategy Does The Job if you are in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>name for the dividend the best course of action is probably to not do anything right now Thats right Take a deep breath sit back and gobble up a few shares on the cheap Why check stock prices every day and buy and sell and be worried when one can just sit back and collect a solid dividend Based on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors closing price on Thursday the companys shares throw off a percent dividend yield Stick with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and collect a nice dividend from a SP company Investors took it to the chin on Thursday thanks to lowerthanexpected earnings and a shaky guidance but the company is still pulling in billions of profits and the dividend is quite safe in my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is a buyandhold company where daily price swings really dont matter all that much Importantly investors best course of action is to remain calm at this point Better yet buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor for long term income generation If you like to read more of my articles and like to be kept up to date with the companies I cover I kindly ask you that you scroll to the top
