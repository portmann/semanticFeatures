<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Can Overcome Problems In China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Fords sales in China have dropped as of late as the overall auto market in the country has taken a hit due to a variety of reasons The drop in commercial vehicle sales in China along with pricing pressure on Fords models could create shortterm weakness for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however should do well in China as it has just a market share in the country which means that it can gain share over rivals to increase sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is focusing on smaller cities in China by planning to open of its dealerships in new cities this year which will allow it to combat slowing sales to some extent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is improving the presence of its luxury brand in China by over times a good move considering that the luxury market is expected to outperform the overall market Chinas economic slowdown regulatory restrictions the stock market rout and various other factors have contributed to the decline in vehicle sales in the country which boasts of being the largest automobile market since In fact for the first time in over a couple of years this years June saw a yearoveryear decline in new car sales Additionally in July retail deliveries fell to million units This was the lowest level of deliveries in the past months Also passenger vehicle sales in China declined to a month low All these numbers indicate that Chinas auto industry has hit a roadblock which is bad news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F as the company sells almost of its global wholesale unit volumes in the country As a result of the slowdown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been forced to revise its forecast for industry sales in China to million to million vehicles which is less than its earlier expectation of million to million units that it had set at the beginning of the year In July while sales across the industry fell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and its Chinese joint ventures sold vehicles in China a decline of from the prioryear period Fords sales had declined in June as well by following a rise in the month of May Thus for the January to July period of Fords sales figure in China is down as compared to last year This indicates that the efforts of the automaker to push its sales in China are not working as a result of the ongoing downturn The drop in Fords sales in China is a reason to worry for investors since the country accounts for a substantial portion of the companys sales as mentioned earlier Additionally sales of Fords commercial vehicles in China which account for of its overall sales in the country are not in good shape either According to CEO Mark Fields Weve seen commercial vehicles actually come down more the past year than other vehicles which is a bit of an indicator to us Now slowing sales of commercial vehicles are one of the indicators that point toward an economic downturn This is because a slowdown in spending in the manufacturing and industrial segments leads to a drop in demand for CVs Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is facing pricing pressure in China as dealers are finding it difficult to move units in the current downturn For instance last month the company was forced to cut the price of the Explorer SUV to the tune of in China Even then there is a possibility that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>might not be able to move the needle much in terms of sales since buyers are holding on for more discounts Thus Fords prospects in China appear to be bleak as the company might see a decline in both unit sales and margins But in my opinion investors should not miss the bigger picture <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still a small player in the Chinese auto market It commanded just of the Chinese market last year This means that even though the Chinese auto markets growth has stalled <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can still grow its sales in this market by winning market share from its rivals This is the reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is bringing new vehicles into the Chinese market apart from increasing its capacity For instance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is increasing the number of Lincoln dealerships in China to next year as compared to in a bid to tap the longterm growth in the Chinese luxury car market As Market Reports points out the market for luxury cars in China is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of until At the same time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is tapping smaller cities and urban centers in China in order to improve market share As a result the company will open of its new dealerships in China this year in these smaller cities as they are growing at double the rate of bigger cities This is a smart move from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in my opinion as the company will be able to benefit from broader growth of the Chinese market by not restricting itself only to big areas for growth Though the Chinese auto market has hit a roadblock of late <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is taking steps to overcome the situation in a smart manner Also the fact that the company holds a small market share in China is a catalyst for it as it can snatch market share from its rivals This is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking to tap growth in the smaller cities of China in a bid to keep its boat steady in the current environment Hence in my opinion investors should not be discouraged by the recent downturn in the Chinese market as <span style='background-color:
