style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expected to report Q earnings on October EPS is expected to nearly double on a yearoveryear basis Through the first half of October <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F shares have bounced back and now sit above the level once again Despite this shares of the automaker are still down about year to date as investors have remained skeptical over Fords earnings power and future prospects On October <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will become the second of the Detroit Three to report Q earnings and investors will be examining the quarters results alongside managements comments Of the analysts reporting to Yahoo Finance the average estimate for Fords Q sits at in EPS with a high end of and a low end of If the automaker hits this mark it will provide a near increase over Q s EPS of Surprisingly despite the volatility in auto stocks over the past few months Fords Q EPS estimate has mostly stayed in the to range for the past days On the top line analysts are calling for billion in revenue with a high end of billion and a low end of billion With Q posting billion in revenue hitting the analyst average would represent a yearoveryear gain and even hitting the low end would still post a gain This is a sharp contrast to General Motors NYSE GM which is expected to post a yearoveryear revenue decline although GM is also expected to see a strong EPS gain Market participants tend to be forwardlooking so the most important parts of Fords Q report may actually come in managements comments and guidance Weakness in China and Latin America has pressured shares of major automakers and while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has less China exposure than rival GM investors will be eager to hear managements outlook and plans for this region Additionally investors will be looking for Fords comments regarding returning Europe to profit The region has been a drain on overall profitability for the past several years but Jim Farley head of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe gave a bullish interview on the region in October after nearly breaking even in Q Investors may also get more information from management regarding performance production and expectations regarding the new aluminum body F The move to aluminum for Fords highly popular truck was seen as a major risk but demand has appeared strong so far this year Management may also add comments regarding the new form of aluminum Alcoa NYSE AA is developing for the model thats supposed to be easier to form and more durable While on the subject of aluminum management may also give hints regarding expansion of the material into additional pieces of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>product line In addition to the valuation many investors find <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares attractive because of their dividend currently yielding just over While I expect the automaker to raise its dividend in the future as profits continue to grow a dividend boost appears unlikely to accompany the Q report Based on Fords pattern of annual dividend raises the next yettobe declared dividend will likely be higher however <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>typically makes such an announcement at the beginning of the year rather than alongside Q earnings While I believe a modest share buyback could benefit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shareholders I do not expect one to accompany the Q report This is because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has shied away from buybacks in recent years and the voting control of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>family effectively prevents activist investors from successfully pushing for such measures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>like GM is expected to report sharply higher yearoveryear EPS but is expected to see revenue growth in contrast to a revenue decline forecast for GM Investors will also closely monitor managements comments for regional strength as
