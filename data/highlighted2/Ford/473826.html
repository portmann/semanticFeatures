increased but management has not altered its forecast Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F fell more than after the company reported disappointing second quarter profits Sales increased beating expectations by billion but EPS came up short by Deliveries fell slightly from to as the company lost market share in all regions except North America Global market share now stands at versus last year But it was the profit figures that worried investors most Due to rising incentive programs in the US and increased competition in China automotive operating margin fell from to After several years of strong growth the US car market appears to be softening and manufacturers have responded with more aggressive promotions and discounts to protect share In China pricing pressures have increased as well due to slowing demand and new product launches from competitors Fords share of the Chinese auto market fell to in Q down from last year Management warned of excess capacity and pricing pressures when formulating its outlook at the end of last year but conditions have gotten worse than expected Despite admitting that risks to the outlook have increased management has not altered its forecasts for FY We think sales and margins for will show littletono improvement over last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still believes that FY automotive revenue automotive operating margin and automotive EPS will be better than or equal to last year Figures and show the outlook for each segment and the assumptions built into those

#A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had a strong first quarter and seemed to be on track months ago The problem is that demand was not as robust as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>anticipated in many of its markets in Q nor pricing as strong and the company now believes that the second half of the year will be much weaker than normal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>warned about excess capacity and pricing pressures at the end of last year when discussing key factors impacting the auto industry Excess Capacity According to IHS Automotive an automotive research firm the estimated automotive industry global production capacity for light vehicles of about million units exceeded global production by about million units in In North America and Europe two regions where a significant share of industry revenue is earned excess capacity as a percent of production was an estimated and respectively in In China the auto industry also witnessed excess capacity at of production in as manufacturers competed to capitalize on Chinas future market potential According to production capacity data projected by IHS Automotive global excess capacity conditions could continue for several years at an average of about million units per year during the period from to Pricing Pressure Excess capacity coupled with a proliferation of new products being introduced in key segments will keep pressure on manufacturers ability to increase prices In North America the industry restructuring of the past few years has allowed manufacturers to better match production with demand although Japanese and Korean manufacturers also have capacity located outside of the region directed to North America In the future Chinese and Indian manufacturers are expected to enter US and European markets further intensifying competition Over the long term intense competition and excess capacity will continue to put downward pressure on inflationadjusted prices for similarlycontented vehicles in the United States and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry In Europe the excess capacity situation was exacerbated by weakening demand and the lack of reductions in existing capacity such that negative pricing pressure is expected to continue for the foreseeable future Generating growth in weak pricing environments requires growing volumes but this is difficult to do when demand slows The domestic auto industry has grown at a rapid pace for years and there is no longer much fresh demand left It is therefore unlikely that the promotions taking place across the auto sector will spark any material increase in demand Economic conditions remain weak around the world with GDP growth in many markets lower than what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had built into its FY forecasts The companys expectations of benchmark profitability in North America growth in the Middle East and Africa and higher profitability in the Asia Pacific driven by growth in China dont seem realistic Operating margin in North America fell from to year over year and while the company is on track to meet revenue guidance thanks to a strong first quarter flat volumes and continued pricing pressures throughout the remainder of the year will prevent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>from showing much if any improvement over last year The situation is similar over in China where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has relied on discounts to maintain market share Q represented the first loss in AsiaPac in quarters and China was largely responsible It is odd that management revised its risk profile to the FY outlook Figure without adjusting its forecast Management now believes that the North America Middle East Africa and Asia Pacific regions are all at risk for meeting expectations Figure Global car demand has slowed and excess capacity is a problem Pricing will continue to be a headwind and Brexit will likely weigh on sentiment throughout the year Management acknowledges that conditions have gotten worse and that risks have increased but the firm has not budged on guidance We expect sales and margins to come in at the low end of expectations and show littletono improvement over last year Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate
