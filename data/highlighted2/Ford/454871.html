<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company A Good Dividend Investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trades at substantial discount yields Dividend is easily backed up by cash flow I thought it would be a cold day in Hades before any US automaker could be considered a buy for longterm income investors The big US automakers have been limping along for years if not decades but the Great Recession was enough to finally send General Motors NYSE GM into bankruptcy several years ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F made it through that difficult time restored itself to profitability and has come out pretty strong In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reinstated its dividend and has been slowly increasing the dividend since then Today Fords dividend yields and shares trade at just over times earnings Sounds like a great price for such an iconic company and valuable brand right This article looks at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and its prospects as a dividend investment Auto companies are a very particular asset class in my opinion During relatively good times in the economic cycle like these the company generates plenty of excess cash During recessions those earnings tend to disappear For an illustration of this look at this earnings chart from FAST Graphs Courtesy of FAST Graphs Earnings represented by dark green shaded area As you can see earnings evaporated in and also in both during recessions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>like the other automakers is a cyclical business However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also carries about billion in net debt and operating margins are low usually somewhere between and This is a highly capitalintensive industry not to mention one with a unionized workforce In this case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>operates like other capitalintense regulated lowmargin industries such as utilities The difference is that utility companies have pretty consistent returns even in bad times Automakers come with a good deal of economic sensitivity Have a look Auto sales can drop significantly depending upon economic conditions US domestic auto sales Courtesy of Macrotrendsnet This combination of capital intensity lowmargins and economic sensitivity is probably why automakers trade at such low multiples and offer high yields Investors rightfully fear that dividends will go away if recession strikes As an automaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does very well In my opinion it has the strongest brands and bestrun operations of the big three For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was the only one of the big three not to need a bailout in Fords cash flow and balance sheet have steadily improved too Over the last twelve months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generated billion in free cash flow after capital expenditure Dividends were only billion so there is a big cushion there Moodys also upgraded Fords credit rating last quarter and the credit rating is now Baa two notches within investment grade status <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also doing pretty well on the year Operating margins expanded to with North American margins improving to So far on the year automotive sales volume is up and revenue is up The Lincoln brand performed the best with a increase in sales volume spurned by continued Chinese interest in this luxury brand North America continues to account for over twothirds of all automotive revenue Management expects sales this year to continue their strong trend thanks to global GDP growth expected at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is in a capitalintense cyclical industry with relatively low margins This I believe makes the stock a lessthanideal investment for income investors Even still Fords dividend is good for now and the stocks valuation is quite cheap even by its standards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>averaged times earnings and right now trades at just times Thats a big discount and dont forget the yield I believe there is a lot of upside for capital appreciation in addition to that nice dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is just too cheap and generous to completely ignore So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a worthy buy for dividend investors here but I would exercise caution due to the industry itself If history is any guide cash flow and earnings evaporate when times get tough and the dividend could easily follow suit If you are interested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>feel free to follow me on Seeking Alpha I intend
