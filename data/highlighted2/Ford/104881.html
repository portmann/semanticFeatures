style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has made an impressive comeback in Europe consolidating its number two position and outpacing the industrys growth so far this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been cutting its losses in Europe at an aggressive pace with its loss expected to go down to million this year from billion last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a strong pipeline of new vehicles to be launched in Europe this year including the iconic Mustang along with facelifts which will help it sustain the momentum Fords investment in plant capacity in Spain will allow it to churn out more types of vehicles from a single point thereby helping it reduce costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has made an impressive recovery in Europe in the past couple of years Back in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was struggling in Europe on account of an economic crisis which had decimated the companys profitability in the region due to weak vehicle sales But things have changed for the better as Fords sales in Europe have increased just over in the past two years Now European sales account for close to of Fords overall wholesale unit volumes Thus this is a key market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which is why we will be taking a closer look at Fords performance and position in Europe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is performing very well in Europe this year It has shown positive growth in each of the first five months of Overall it sold vehicles in Europe till the end of May an increase of over last years units sold for the same period In comparison the growth of the auto industry in Europe so far this year stands at up to May Thus it is evident that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is outpacing the industrys growth in Europe Fords robust performance this year is the result of strong demand for its allnew and updated models that it has launched recently For instance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>launched the allnew Mondeo late last year This upgraded version is selling well with a rise in sales yearoveryear Meanwhile the new Focus ST model contributed units to sales in May an increase of from last year Additionally the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fiesta has remained the best selling small car of Europe over the last years and the trend is continuing this year too as sales are up by than last May Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has done well in the commercial vehicle segment as well clinching the number spot among the bestselling commercial vehicle brands in Europe yeartodate In this segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has expanded its Transit range of vehicles that now includes the Transit Transit Custom Transit Connect and Transit Courier Fords total commercial vehicle sales were up in May and yeartodate and the company now holds market share of commercial vehicles in Europe an improvement of percentage points over last years first five months One of the big reasons behind Fords success in Europe is that it is selling in higher value sales channels which include private retail and fleet segments These together accounted for of its passenger car sales in the first five months of the year Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is making the right moves in Europe by improving its sales and market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was losing its hold on the European market year after year since In its market share was while at the end of it was down to For the next two years it remained flat showing signs of a possible trend reversal This year the company seems to have made a comeback as Fords market share has jumped to for the five months of This is shown below In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is ahead of everyone in Europe except Volkswagen OTCQX VLKAY which is slightly ahead with a market share of at the end of Q The next two competitors are a safe distance behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and have lost market share this year while the American automaker has improved Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could consolidate its second position in Europe going forward In fact even Volkswagen is losing market share in Europe this year while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is gaining This is shown below Sales of vehicles in Europe have rebounded with strongerthanexpected volume growth More importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has outpaced the industrys growth However a profit still remains elusive for the company in Europe The main reason that Automotive News Europe cites is the heavy fixed costs and huge price reductions required to sell higher volumes in the continent Additionally there is excess capacity for automobile production in Europe This has added to Fords costs and reduced pricing power In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had lost billion in Europe from to but the good thing is that the trend is improving The company lost billion last year and expects to lose another million for Thus it is evident that the Blue Oval is cutting its losses in Europe at a good pace In order to consolidate its position in Europe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has invested billion in the continent beginning with Spain in It has cut its manufacturing operations elsewhere in Europe and reduced the workforce to combat losses This investment has helped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>set up a manufacturing complex in Valencia Spain which is key to its restructuring efforts This plant will have a capacity of making units per year which is one of the largest of all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>facilities It will have a flexible line to accommodate different vehicles this year Thus at a lower cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to churn out more quantity and types of vehicles in Europe with the help of this plant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe had already announced earlier in that this is going to be one of its busiest years in terms of new product launches The company is going to launch a range of allnew as well as facelifted vehicles this year For instance the all new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Galaxy seven passenger vehicle will hit the European market somewhere in the midyear Other new models that would go on sale include the allnew SMAX C MAX Grand CMAX and CMAX Energi plugin hybrid electric vehicle that launches first in the Netherlands In addition the allnew Edge SUV will go into production in late The allnew <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang will be sold for the first time in Europe after completing years of existence In fact customers have already ordered the new version of Mustang that goes on sale in Europe this summer Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be flooding the market with a number of models this year apart from facelifting existing models and this will allow the company to sustain its momentum in this market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has made a tremendous comeback in Europe on the back of new model introductions and a smart restructuring Looking ahead the company has a strong pipeline which will help it get better in Europe Also the companys restructuring is leading to a drop in its losses in Europe Thus in my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will continue getting better in Europe going forward and since the market accounts for more than a fifth of its sales it will have a positive impact on its financial performance Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Why The European
