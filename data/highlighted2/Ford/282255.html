The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Lansing Michigan October Photo taken October LAS VEGAS Big automakers have spent several years watching their stock prices drift while the valuations of upstarts such as Uber and Tesla soared This week the automotive empire struck back at the wouldbe disruptors of its centuryold business model On Monday General Motors CoGMN said it would invest million in ridehailing company Lyft its most aggressive move yet into a future where ondemand ride services threaten to replace auto ownership and robots could unseat human drivers GMs move and others underscore Detroits determination to battle Silicon Valley for dominance of clean urban transport <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor CoFN used this weeks Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to announce that Toyota Motor CorpT the No global car maker will use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>software to connect smart

and Volkswagen AGVOWG_pDE promoted their effort to design autonomous vehicles using mapping technology not from GoogleGOOGLO but from HERE a European mapping company the German luxury car makers bought last year This weeks events mark a turning point in the power struggle between auto and tech companies analysts and industry experts say At stake executives say are potentially trillions of dollars in revenue from selling both vehicles and mobility services ride sharing car sharing connections to mass transit travel services repair work and access to valuable data on what consumers do with and in their cars Automakers may need major stakes in such emerging industries to replace potentially massive losses over time in traditional auto sales to individuals The tension will increase These areas automotive and tech are converging and now will hit head on said Jeffrey Owens chief technology officer of big auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc formerly part of GM The winners are those who create some of the disruption themselves GM executives say that is their aim The automakers CEO Mary Barra used a speech at CES to unveil the production version of the Chevrolet Bolt an electric car with a mile driving range that GM said it will start selling within a year at about The Bolts estimated range and price matches what Tesla the Palo Alto electric car maker has been promising for years a practical rechargeable car for the masses Teslas repeated delays in delivering its second luxury vehicle the Model X crossover raise doubts about whether Tesla can quickly match the fresh competition from GM Tesla said on Wednesday it plans to unveil the design for the Model in March and start selling the car in Model is on schedule Tesla spokeswoman Khobi Brooklyn wrote in an email Wednesday The Bolt is also the first GM car designed from the start to be attractive to car sharing services Pam Fletcher executive chief engineer for electric vehicles told Reuters in an interview The Bolts interior is as large as a midsize cars with the flat floor allowing passengers to easily exit on either side of the car Drivers sit high and have more visibility and the car can download a drivers personal settings for radio and displays and change when a different driver uses the car GM can benefit in another way from promoting the Bolt to ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft Selling electric cars to individual consumers has so far yielded meager sales for GM and other mainstream automakers But the economics of using an electric car for urban and suburban ride sharing are better and sales to ridesharing services could help GM meet electric car sales mandates that will be ratcheting up over the next several years in California and other states seeking to crack down on greenhouse gas pollution GM plans to promote the Bolt as a small crossover utility vehicle or CUV aligning it with one of the hottest segments in the global car market At FordChief Executive Mark Fields said the company will allocate more capital toward ventures designed to capture a share of a market for transportation services beyond building and selling vehicles Its not chump change Fields said in an interview of Fords mobility investment plans without saying how much The investments wont come at the expense of the companys core business which derives most of its profits from sales of big <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pickups and sport utility vehicles Fields has signed off on spending billion to develop new electrified vehicles by including gaselectric

compact LiDAR sensor that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will use as the eyes of its new generation of autonomous cars When selfdriving cars hit the market they may do so in the form of lowspeed electric vehicles designed specifically for ridehailing companies in central cities said Xavier Mosquet managing director at Boston Consulting Group Within two years he said you will see smallscale experiments in a number of cities around the world In the past automakers wouldnt have been much interested in such ventures Then Uber came along garnering a value from investors estimated at billion after a round of funding in July roughly equivalent to GMs market capitalization as of Tuesday Ubers investors believe the companys promise of dropping the cost of rides on demand expanding the market for such services and developing services built on customer data represents a rare opportunity Uber envisions autonomous cars that could someday replace its hundreds of thousands of contract drivers The San Francisco company has gone to toptier universities and research centers to build up this capability Teslas soaring stock value the company was worth about billion this week even after a recent skid in its share price also jolted executives at established automakers Tesla bulls including Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas say the company is well positioned because of its roots in digital commerce and the technology of its cars to be a leader in developing autonomous transportation on demand services But Jonas in a recent report cautions that as of now like all major car companies Teslas business of selling humandriven machines utilized less than of the time is not sustainable Whether big carmakers can move fast enough over the long run to avoid getting left behind as digital disruptors such as Uber Tesla Motors Inc or Alphabet Incs Google pioneer new markets wont be clear for some time Its clear now however that the industry takes such threats quite seriously Automakers not Silicon Valley companies are the leaders in selfdriving car technology patents a study by the Intellectual Property and Science Division of ThomsonReuters found this week

from ridesharing and other service businesses will require automakers to overhaul their corporate structures said HansWerner Kaas of McKinsey and Co You need new management systems he said Automakers also need different kinds of employees Toyota Motor Corp this week announced it has hired a team of robotics engineers including the former head of Googles robotics efforts James Kuffner to lead a new
