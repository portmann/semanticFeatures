class='textDiv'>Fords Global Struggles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Seven regions around the world mark Fords global footprint How is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>faring around the world and where do they need to focus their energies for the future With seven regions accounting for the bulk of Fords NYSE F worldwide sales the companys performance in these core markets are critical to the success of their sales and marketing strategy as well as their profitability in each of these regions Lets look at what kind of market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>enjoys in each of the regions they operate in to gain an overview of whats going well and where and what isnt and why Based on the data above lets attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff see who the movers and shakers are and hopefully arrive at a snapshot of the most important regions of focus for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In past articles on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Ive typically concentrated my research on financial performance in core markets to identify all the reasons I thought that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock would turn around and start heading North Now that this is actually happening despite the negativity in the market about peak auto and other theories that never really panned out I think its the right time to do a forward look on Fords markets across the world At this point I must throw out a disclaimer of sorts Comparing market shares in different economies with different political systems government biases towards local players and several other factors makes it a hard nut to crack Ive attempted to zero in on the markets where I think a concerted effort by Fords product marketing sales and distribution strategies in those markets will yield far higher gains than what I see to be secondary and tertiary markets In terms of sales as well as market share the United States is obviously their hero of their sales happen there and they own close to of one of the most competitive automobile markets in the world Sales however is only one side of the story in a segment thats still growing at globally future market share is what the game is all about and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>US has been losing more than a little ground in that area Since their most recent peak market share of in theyve lost basis points Considering a market size of million cars in thats a drop of units over the fiscal Small yet significant in this crucial market Fords need of the hour in the US market is to protect their market share at all costs With car sharing on the increase interest rates threatening to gradually increase over the year and the strengthening dollar affecting overseas revenues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>must divert the bulk of its attention to its home market and prevent market share erosion that may come from any quarter For example while EV market share projections are largely a guessing game at this point one source puts estimates at around of the automobile market share in the United States The source also cites population migration tax credits the need for cleaner transportation and carsharing as some of the key drivers of EV sales Even if the EV market share is only a fraction of that by then any kind of significant move by Tesla GM or any of Fords EV competitors towards a massmarket EV with a battery range of miles will start nibbling at ICE sales at a faster rate And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to be prepared to handle that encroachment Another reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to protect market share like a lioness protecting her cubs is the fact that North America is its anchor right now of global sales are from the United States and it is Fords most profitable segment by far As of February <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems to have been doing that job right and has shown a twomonth increase in market share to about This is the kind of performance they need to keep showing month over month in order to keep their biggest earner intact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been making several entries into China from as far back as with the delivery of a Model T to its first buyer in China Since then there has been a rich history that culminated in the opening of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor China Ltd but the company has been serious about the Chinese market only since During that time theyve gone from new entrant to one with an enviable market share thats continually expanding With that extensive a history with the PRC they should have been the market leader by now but theyre trailing behind others that came into the country after them Hyundai being just one example Granted the Chinese market has been growing steadily and profitably for them but at million vehicles sold it still represents less than of Fords overall sales and of US sales That enviable now seems like a mere This is the market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should push to the forefront in the coming decades as it keeps US sales on an upward trend or least holding steady since many suppose we are in a peak auto period You can see how big of an impact China sales have on Fords stock price On March <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was at a recent high of but fell again to the current after reports of a decline in sales for February over February Of the average performers in Fords geographic lineup Europe stands as a perfect example of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>putting every possible effort into making a unit go from red to black <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe has been bleeding money for a long time and it was only in the final quarter of that the turnaround happened Ive written extensively on this in my earlier articles and Europe is poised on the threshold of making a big peace offering to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this year for its earlier lapses in profitability Theyve already grown their sales by in against an industry average of so theyre still ahead of the game Besides theyre already the numero uno in the commercial vehicle space and have executed some very effective costsaving strategies in manufacturing over the past year In Britain they had two strong years in and but seem to have dipped in promises to be a good year with the first two months showing signs of market share expansion I see as their makeorbreak year in the UK Theyll need to pull all their resources together to replicate the success they had in and then go beyond Theyve already got two passenger models in the Top bestsellers in the UK and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Ka is all set to launch this year and compete in the supermini segment that is popular in the UK Of interest is the fact that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fiesta is UKs top selling car for the seventh year running as of Germanys market share for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as of the first nine months in is an indication of the tough competition they face in that region with local automakers like Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY market share Mercedes OTCPKDDAIF Audi OTCPKAUDVF and BMW OTCPKBAMXY Despite the backlash from Volkswagens big emission debacle the German automaker still dominates the German market by a wide margin The Great White North offers a market share similar to the United States but with sales of under the market itself is only slightly more than a tenth of its Southern cousin Even in that relatively small market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>doesnt seem to be able to hold its position since it has lost about basis points on market share Fords Fseries and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape have a sizable presence on the roads with the Fseries in the clear lead On the whole things arent looking too good in Canada so in my humble opinion it gets to keep the average joe tag for now Brazil and Argentina market shares are growing well but with under half a million in sales and the entire South American unit in the red by about million for FY things dont look very promising Fourth quarter sales for example drastically dipped on the prevalent recessions in these countries both for a number of different reasons but equally hit Despite the bleak outlook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has handled the situation admirably For example they didnt follow suit on price cuts like some other automakers did just to keep assembly lines running and inventory moving What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>did helped them preserve their pricing power despite the market share loss towards the end of the year which offset the market loss share by million a million increase over the previous quarter In regards to pricing they are now in a better position to take advantage of it once the political and economic situations in South America resolve themselves and this painful thorn in Fords side is removed Not that I think its a total writeoff mind you but looking at the figures it would seem that Mexico is more ideally suited to be a lowcost production country than a highgain sales market Between and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has lost basis points in the country Of course the entire market is only worth of Fords overall sales but its still a significant loss To counter their sales losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is now investing heavily in production which is already a contributor to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NAs capacity By they intend to more than double the annual production with a capacity increase of units From a sales perspective Im pretty sure North America could be even more profitable without having Mexico included in their fraternity although I couldnt find any specific break out of Mexicos earnings versus net income Thats why I feel Mexico is one Real Dud they can do without but only on the sales side From a production perspective it will continue to be a gold mine until wages play catchup with the rest of their North American segment The outback offers a different outlook for the company but it almost seems that theyre carrying on as if nothing happened over the past few years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Australia which was originally one of the first markets to produce its own cars first in the form of the Falcon which was fully designed in Australia from and then models like the Territory In May <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Australia announced that after years it would stop making cars That was the first indication of the problem and the reasons cited were uncompetitive manufacturing costs and lackluster sales That endgame is already happening and Australia will once again become a sales outpost as far as major automakers are concerned after a long period of being one of only countries capable of building a car from the ground up including design As you may have noticed from the first table in this article the companys share of market in core countries has been on the decline since which seems to have been a magical year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Australia has followed suit on that pattern having lost nearly percentage points since then Entire sales volume for Australia stood at or of global sales Yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is optimistic about Australia as has reasons to be For example the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Focus RS has a waiting list that stretches into mid the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang is booked for up to orders of two variants the EcoBoost and the V the new Mondeo the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>ST and the Rangerbased Everest SUV will all make their entrance as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Australia production winds down at the Geelong and Campbellfield facilities in addition theyre also promoting their Mountune upgrade kits for the Fiesta ST and Focus ST <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Australia showed a loss of Am dollars mm after tax for the financial year This followed a loss of Am in and a total loss of Am over the preceding five years Some may view my opinion as overly optimistic with regard to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but it only mirrors the companys own perception As weve seen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>doesnt give up easily It has been and continues to fight for every market that resists its efforts On the other hand theyve let crucial markets like China slip from their grasp when they had the opportunity for high penetration So much so in fact that they now have to claw their way back into recognition past stalwarts like VW and GM not to mention the impending EV wars that will erupt all over the PRC in a few short years the signs of which we are already seeing with companies like BYD and Kandi Technologies taking the lead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>now needs to focus its efforts on its biggest markets holding firm in North America and penetrating deeper into China leveraging everything they can in the average joe segments and making hard decisions on the duds Despite everything thats happened to its stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has stood steady on its strategies around the world innovating where it needs to consolidating where the situation demanded and always keeping an eye on profitability I believe theyve gone through yet another test of their resilience and that they will go a long way There is already a clear inflection of stock price action and the outlook for the company seems as solid as the yearold foundation it stands on If you thought this was a good read please follow me for lots more on technology companies and other majors in the automobile retail and
