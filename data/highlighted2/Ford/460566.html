Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is finally gaining strong momentum in India this year as its sales have increased from last year on the back of an improvement in aftersales service and parts availability Despite launching just one new model in the past year Fords India sales have increased over in the first half of as against last year By expanding the parts distributor network and making part prices transparent on its website <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has managed to strike a chord with Indian customers who are finicky about after sales A hike in salaries of million people as a result of the Seventh Pay Commission will increase purchasing power in India thereby leading to growth in auto sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is getting ready to tap the growth in the market by bringing out new Indiacentric products such as a midsize sedan to target the fastgrowing segments of the market Fords NYSE F stock has remained essentially flat for the past five years and I believe that the companys ability to break past the range barrier depends on its international prospects While investors tend to focus on Fords prospects in China the Indian automobile market also represents a great opportunity for the Blue Oval <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been gaining market share in India which is the good news for investors as India is the worlds fastest growing major economy As compared to Fords global operations India is a very small market at present This is because it sold slightly more than units in the country last year as compared to its total sales of million units globally However the opportunity in the Indian car market is huge as it is the fastestgrowing car market in the eight biggest auto markets overhauling China and the US This is the reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has buckled up in India and improved its performance drastically in In the first half of Fords domestic sales have increased over the sales achieved in the first half of the last year The company saw one month of singledigit growth three months of doubledigit growth and one month of more than growth over the last six months More importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>grew faster than the industry over the six month period and thats crucial As a result of this rapid growth Fords market share in India has gone up from just at the end of last year to at the end of June More importantly Fords sales have been growing quite consistently in India over the past few months and consequently in the month of June the automaker registered its highest ever domestic monthly sales for yet The domestic sales for the first half of were units while they were units for the same period last year Talking about total sales in June including exports <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>India sold vehicles in the month of June as compared to vehicles in June Exports grew to units from units for the same first half period yearonyear It looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has better understood the needs of the Indian customer which is why without launching just one new model in almost a year the companys sales have increased rapidly The Indian buyer is highlyconcerned about the service network parts availability and maintenance costs Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has worked on these fronts of late and this is leading to results For instance in June <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expanded the distributor network of its Genuine Service Parts by appointing Khodiyar <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Parts as the exclusive distributor for Gujarat Daman and Diu Silvassa By doing so the company has strengthened its distributor base in key western areas of the country Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>plans to expand its parts distribution network soon into West Bengal Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh Assam and Punjab in the next phase which will further improve its aftersales service This is bound to increase customer convenience as they will have an easier access to fairly priced highquality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Genuine service parts which will strengthen the brand Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>covers only Delhi Tamil Nadu Karnataka Kerala Maharashtra Goa Andhra Pradesh Telangana with its parts distribution network Thus the company is going into overdrive as far as the parts distribution network is concerned which is a good thing In addition the recent introduction of the Parts Price Calculator on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Indias website is a feature that will allow customers to know the cost of all major fastmoving parts of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>vehicles This will give customers transparency about potential costs and will play an important role in the purchase decision Moreover the company has also reached sales and service facilities in cities across the country in April as it inaugurated new sales and services facilities several cities and towns Under the threepronged brand transformation strategy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also focusing on manpower development apart from introducing new products addressing the cost of ownership perception and delivering a differentiated experience to its customers Along similar lines the company has inaugurated its first independent technical training facility for the North region at Manesar Gurgaon and also partnered with Industrial Training Institutes in Hyderabad and Sonepat to establish Automotive Student Service Educational Training ASSET Centres It seems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has garnered some early accolades on its way to brand transformation in India Its total sales from Indian operations jumped impressively in June as discussed above thanks to the companys new plant in Sanand and its focus on improving after sales Unsurprisingly Anurag Mehrotra executive director Marketing Sales and Service at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>India is quite optimistic about the recent macroeconomic and political developments in India He says The recent announcements of Seventh Pay Commission along with the prediction of normal monsoon and scrappage policy are keeping the industry optimistic about future growth Nearly million central government employees and million pensioners will benefit from the Seventh Pay Commission and this should act as a tailwind for the entire automobile market in India This is because with a rise in pay almost million people will have increased spending power which will complement the low interest rate environment prevailing in the country However the competition is fierce and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will have to make the right moves to continue its stellar growth Its recent launches such as the Figo and Figo Aspire have received a rather lukewarm response in the market This was a big setback which was an outcome of trying to cater to segments that were no more open to new entrants These launches have been in segments that opened up between and To correct this basic flaw the company needs to focus upon the more premium segments and introduce bigger hatchbacks or midsized sedans like Hondas City and Hyundais Verna The company does not have a presence in these segments However three years ago the company did not have any car to offer in the compact SUV segment and then later delivered the EcoSport which turned out to be a winner Hence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is quite capable of coming out with winning products in new segments In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to bring a premium hatchback to compete with the likes of Hyundais Elite i and Maruti Suzukis Baleno both of which are extremely successful and also a sedan to lock horns with the likes of Honda City These new launches could just prove to be those necessary elements required by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to complete the ongoing process of brand transformation as the hatchback and the midsize sedan segment are the big volume generators in the country accounting for of sales combined The good news is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems to be focusing on these segments to come out with new products for India For instance it has been reported that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is developing a new sedan codenamed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>B for the emerging markets More importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been said to be taking inputs from engineers in India to develop the incoming model which is the right thing to do As reported by Indian Autos Blog For the Indian market a newspaper report stated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>India will invest around Crores on a new RD Center in Chennai Tamil Nadu and that the first project for this center will be the B For India though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would be interested mainly in the sedan bodystyle which will pit it against the Honda City Maruti Ciaz and the VW Vento primarily Therefore it is evident that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is training its sights on volumedriven segments in India that will help it gain more market share going forward In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is following the right strategy for the Indian market First the company is laying the groundwork by improving its service and aftersales Second it is working on new products to target the fastgrowing segments I believe that this strategy will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>tap the fastgrowing Indian market in the long run and grow its sales Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I
