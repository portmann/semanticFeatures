(Ford: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The Eagle <b>Ford</b> assets could be sold off if PXD wanted to put more capital into its Permian program and further strengthen its balance sheet , but that is not necessary and why break something that is n't broken . (Ford: Uncertainty) </span>As noted in the June Investor Presentation, PXD is spending $460 mm on its Spraberry/Wolfcamp infrastructure.This indicates -to me at least- that the company's Permian operations will be ready for development mode and the company must think the money is better spent in the Permian in its long-term outlook.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The large infrastructure investment in the Permian instead of more D&C capital towards the liquids and gas rich Eagle <b>Ford</b> could also just simply be part of the company 's desire to become more oily . (Ford: Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company currently produces approximately 46 mboed ( oil production around 19,000 bod ) in the Eagle <b>Ford</b> . (Ford: Uncertainty) </span>PXD's balance sheet is in good shape with a debt-to-capitalization ratio around 20%, an undrawn credit facility of $1,500 MM, $326 mm in cash, and an expected $725 mm pre-tax gain to be recognized in Q3 2015 upon closing the Midstream sale.The company carries an investment grade rating.According to the June Investor Presentation PXD is expecting operating cash flow of $1,600 mm this year, so outspend from the $1,950 mm capex program will be funded from cash on hand and proceeds from the Midstream sale or credit facility.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>PXD is expecting greater than 10% total production growth from this year's capital program, with the Permian assets predicted to grow at more than 20%. (Uncertainty) </span>This outspend is being internally funded by cash on hand and funds from the EFS Midstream sale.This leaves PXD with a little cash to spend.In my opinion PXD will have the opportunity to bolt on assets in its 'core' area or redeem outstanding notes of $455 mm, $485 mm and $450 mm that are due in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Depending on market prices for crude, NGL's and natural gas, 2016 spending will probably be in line with operating cash flow in order to safeguard the balance sheet. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Another thing to keep in mind is that Pioneer appears to be an excellent JV partner given its JV's with Reliance Industries in the EFS and Sinochem in the southern Wolfcamp (Permian) play, so if needed, the company could find a JV partner to help fund its operations. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The company estimates there may be as much as 11 BBOE resource potential and 20,000 drilling locations in the stacked pay intervals of its Permian acreage. (Uncertainty) </span>This leaves a lot of room for growth and explains a relatively higher EV/1P multiple.On a comparative basis PXD trades at 7.35x EV/EBITDA (ttm for all), compared to 3.6x for Devon, 2.62x for Chesapeake, 5.55x for Continental and 6.6x for EOG.This makes PXD one of the more expensive companies, but again, it is expecting good production growth and is able to access capital at a cheaper rate than some of its cheaper peers.(Data is from Yahoo Finance ) When compared on a flowing barrel comparison PXD sticks out with a measure of $108m/boed.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Devon, Chesapeake, Continental, and EOG have varying levels of: $47m/boed, $27m/boed, $99m/boed, and $90m/boed, respectively (calculated on my own). (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>The larger value for PXD isn't a huge surprise as the company is expecting 10%+ growth for 2015 and is already trading at higher multiples than its peers on other variables- which always leaves the risk of further selling if crude continues to dive. (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>Pioneer has a book Price/Book ratio (mrq) of 2.28 compared to 1.16 for Devon (NYSE: DVN ), .59 for Chesapeake (NYSE: CHK ), 2.67 for Continental Resources (NYSE: CLR ), and 2.47 EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG ).PXD has the ability to substantially increase its reserves in the Permian as it continues to de-risk additional zones and drill new areas.The company is making smart long-term decisions and investing in infrastructure at a time when commodity prices are low- allowing it to breakout drilling when prices rise.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe it is important to keep an eye on earnings from the mid-cap companies such as Parsley Energy, Diamondback Energy, and RSP Permian. (Uncertainty) </span>These Permian pure-plays are concentrated in the area PXD is making large investments in and they can act as a barometer of price realizations, take-away options and general the health of the basin.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If prices continue to average below $60 a barrel, I believe the company will slow its capital spending in 2016 to better match operating cash flow. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If prices do average below $60 a barrel for the rest of the year the stock will have trouble finding buyers and might continue its slide. (Uncertainty) </span>Concerning the big picture, it is also useful to keep an eye on the majors and where they're buying shale reserves."The report ( Goldman report ) indicates that global oil majors own just 5 percent of total U.S. shale oil resources.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Goldman believes that shale production has the potential to double by 2025. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Brooker argues that it is likely that majors will take this opportunity to increase their exposure to U.S. shale at historically low prices." (Uncertainty) </span>In the same report Goldman estimates the majors have around $150 billion in firepower for M&A as the industry consolidates.Goldman put PXD in its Top 7 U.S. Shale Oil Buyout Targets along with EOG Resources , Continental Resources , Cabot Oil and Gas (NYSE: COG ), Noble Energy (NYSE: NBL ), Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC ), and Range Resources (NYSE: RRC ).Bigger players such as Exxon (NYSE: XOM ) have been leasing/trading acreage in PXD's core area in the Permian as recently as last year.Insiders have been selling over the past year, though.When insiders begin buying shares or if crude and liquids prices begin to trend upwards, I will be a buyer of PXD.Source: A Peek At Pioneer Natural Resources In The Downturn Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: I plan to start a position in this stock within the next 6 months.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
