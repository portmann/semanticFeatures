#A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is estimated at a barrel The model implies a specific range for Carrizos overall breakeven price On Monday Seeking Alpha published an article suggesting that one of the strongest largest by market cap shale producers was not likely to grow production at current commodity price levels Through this analysis I also came across Carrizo Oil Gas NASDAQ CRZO which I noticed as it is operating very near the highlyprofiled companies in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>EOG Resources NYSE EOG and Chesapeake Energy NYSE CHK Although conventional wisdom has been decreeing that the smallscale producers will be left to rot in the downturn of the commodity cycle I was intrigued enough by the companys strong acreage and production to calculate just how well it can manage through the lowprice storm First and foremost it is worth noting that Carrizo possesses drilling rights to Net Acres in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Net Acres in the Wolfcamp Net Acres in the Marcellus Shale Net Acres in the Utica and Net Acres in the Niobrara The companys acreage accounts for the majority of its proven reserves with its MMBOE Million barrels of oil equivalent trumping all of its other plays combined What makes this so valuable is that the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also the companys most economical play with an average breakeven cost of a barrel WTI Unfortunately Carrizos costs which fell for drilling in Q and for completions in the same period are not consistent throughout each of its operations meaning to find an accurate breakeven price a fullscale model would have to be developed Before examining this model we must first illuminate the economics of individual plays and the companys debt after all this is what is supposed to be crushing the small caps isnt it As aforementioned Carrizos Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>assets are its bread and butter as MMBOE of the companys proved developed reserves of its MMBOE comes from this one play With its assets in Gardendale maintaining a breakeven cost of per barrel and with over of its locations in the area boasting a breakeven cost of a barrel or less according to the companys latest Investor Presentation the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>play remains the most economical and conducive to both medium and longterm growth Carrizo estimates it has proved undeveloped reserves of MMBOE and probable reserves of MMBOE in the basin Should the company report production numbers for Q that far exceed its guidance I expect the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to have been the catalyst as would have shone through even the near week lows in oil prices In the Niobrara the companys reported average breakeven cost is a barrel but a concern here is that approximately of its locations have a breakeven cost estimated at a barrel Although overall the company has a considerably low breakeven cost for the play as a whole its high range suggests that production growth is increasingly unlikely and unprofitable at current levels Growth may manifest itself over the long term in the Delaware Basin where the company plans to test its acreage this year and then manage its option to acquire an additional Net Acres accordingly This should be particularly encouraging for investors because while other companies are struggling to maintain current plays Carrizo sticks to a forwardlooking vision while staking out new plays Now future growth assuming higher oil prices and low breakeven costs in its primary play certainly sound attractive but one would imagine that this level of activity would result in excessive debt debt that would be excessively difficult to pay off amid low commodity prices Surely Carrizo is not debtfree but the company has no borrowings due until million about a third of Carrizos total debt with another third of its debt being due in and the rest in As the company holds no nearterm debt the price declines can be managed appropriately without the fear of a bankruptcy as analysts have argued is the fate of many smallcap producers Still in order to justify any investment in Carrizo an investor needs to examine how the company is set to perform at every oil price level To calculate this I created the following model based on expense data provided by the company to investors Before drawing any conclusions one must recognize that the listed Nat Gas and Crude Prices represent realized prices for the company which were and of NYMEX prices in Q respectively I did this to consolidate for the omittance of hedging effects in the model to calculate unrealized prices and their effects on Net Profit one simply needs to multiply the listed oil price by assuming the lowend range of the companys Q guidance in the worstcase scenario and the natural gas price by also using the lowend of the companys guidance for realized prices All expenses take the highend of the companys guidance and all production numbers used the lowend of the companys guidance While this seems very unlikely as costs fell within Carrizos guidance last quarter and production exceed the highend of guidance as a result of robust Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>output it was done to provide investors with a margin of safety and knowledge of the numbers in the case of a worstcase scenario Although I discounted the effects of hedging Carrizo has secured itself well for the rest of the year as it has collars on about barrels a day with approximately ceilings and floors Q Earnings Call The effects of hedging have been omitted from the model to give an investor an idea of how its assets perform at every oil price without this benefit nonetheless the hedges are a positive that add value to the company that will be addressed later on All profits and expenses represent fullyear fiscal numbers One final note on the model is that every increase in natural gas prices corresponds to a increase in oil prices although this type of commodity price correlation is very unlikely it provides for the best insight into how the company performs at various levels when the movements are uniform with each other Examining the above chart gives a pretty clear idea about what level of oil and natural gas prices the company needs in aggregate to generate a positive cash flow between per MMBTU natural gas realized prices and for natural gas and between and for WTI oil My calculations using the lowend guidance of probable price realizations converted to unrealized prices suggest that Carrizo needs per barrel prices for oil and per MMBTU for natural gas to turn a profit in the most pessimistic scenario for realizations production numbers and expenses all before the impact of hedges After we observe the impact of hedges which management has placed in a disciplined fashion we see that Carrizo Oil and Gas has a net breakeven price closer to a barrel if we still take the lowend of managements production guidance and highend of expenses guidance As we only are seeing oil move below a barrel this past week for the first time in months I am confident that the company is currently well positioned to manage oil price volatility A final calculation I found intriguing is using the Net Profit at realized oil prices of over million for fullyear to calculate an earnings multiple currently with a market cap of billion assuming Net Profit of yields a PE ratio of about for Given that this discounts hedges and takes into account the worst of managements forecast for the rest of the year and considering the amount of growth left in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and perhaps continued cost reductions and even the Delaware Basin this makes the company appear very attractively valued for investors expecting oil to recover to above a barrel As the model shows however if WTI continues to trade at the a barrel level Carrizo will struggle immensely to turn a profit but will not face serious financial troubles unless the downturn becomes
