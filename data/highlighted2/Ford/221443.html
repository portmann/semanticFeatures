President Thank you Kelly and good afternoon to everyone Murphy Oils consolidated results in the third quarter of were a loss of billion which equates to per diluted share thats compared to a profit of million or per diluted share a year ago The third quarter results included noncash property impairments of billion which after tax has amounted to billion charge These impairments were attributable to significant declines in future periods oil prices which fell by as much as per barrel at quarter end compared to three months earlier The impairments were not related to reductions in the companys reported reserves Adjusted earnings which adjust our GAAP numbers for various items that affect comparability of earnings between periods was a loss of million in the third quarter of down from a profit of million a year ago This decline in adjusted earnings was primarily attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales prices in the current year Our schedule of adjusted earnings is included as part of our earnings release and the amounts in this schedule are reported on an aftertax basis Companys average realized price for its crude oil production fell more than per barrel in the third quarter compared to the prior year This amounted to a drop between periods in oil prices Natural gas prices also were weaker in the third quarter compared to the prior year with average North American gas price realizations dropping per Mcf or a decline of Realized natural gas prices offshore Sarawak also fell by Sales prices continued to be soft in October and therefore revenues continued to be under pressure as quarter four prices remained significantly below prices a year ago The company continues to address its cost structure by aggressively reducing both operating and administrative cost By yearend we anticipate a reduction in staffing levels compared to a year earlier At September Murphys longterm debt amounted to approximately billion of total capital employed while net debt amounted to just over at the end of the third quarter At this time Ill turn the call over to Roger for his comments Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Thank you John Looking back a solid operational third quarter following highlights stand out Our company remains in a favorable financial position with a healthy balance sheet its flexible take advantage of opportunities that arise both in onshore and offshore With major pullback in oil prices weve been able to maintain our netdebttoEBITDA ratio at less than Subsequent to the third quarter we hedge for and currently have barrels per day in WTI contracts at an average price of per barrel On the cost side we continue to make significant improvements in reducing both operating and GA expenses on a yeartoyear basis We continue to review our portfolio as we still have many levers remain to reposition the company going forward Were currently reviewing the value of various midstream assets in North America Were enthusiastic about the new area that we recently formed into offshore Vietnam We expanded our Vietnam footprint with the new block and a highly prospective oil prone Cuu Long Basin Our partnership group was successful in testing our first well and we are working to increase acreage in this prolific area In the Gulf of Mexico we drilled the Dalmatian South We like what we see here as it has commercial hydrocarbons in two separate zones Currently the well is being completed with first production expected early next year In Malaysia we achieved record average daily gross production for Sarawak gas at million per day In addition we drilled the Merapuh and Marakas wells with positive results and process of evaluating both In our onshore business the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale continues to outperform expectations where we delivered new wells online in the third quarter plus the Montney production continues to be above plan Our third quarter production is just over barrels equivalents per day Were increasing our annual production guidance to a range of barrel equivalents per day to barrel equivalents per day Over the course of the year weve increased the midpoint of our production guidance from barrels equivalents todate to barrels equivalents per day almost increase In operations were pleased with the ongoing efforts were making on cost reductions Our lease operating expenses for the third quarter excluding Syncrude is per boe showing a reduction of from the third quarter of More importantly we are posting a reduction from full year on LOE In Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale our third quarter operating expenses are just over per boe This represents over reduction from the second quarter of this year On a cash margin basis we are just over per barrel equivalent in third quarter and are per boe for nine months ended This compares very favorably to our peers and has been a staple for Murphy for a long time due to our oilweighted diverse portfolio In production the positive production in Brent to barrel equivalents a day for the quarter is attributed to Sarawak oil and natural gas sales performing better above planned performance on base decline the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale new well volumes exceeding plan due to EUR increases and completion performance and higher natural gas production from Montney Looking ahead to the fourth quarter production guidance is estimated to be barrel equivalents per day Our third quarter actual production is higher than our fourth quarter guidance due to higher risk SK natural gas nominations and planned downtime natural well decline in the Gulf of Mexico and significant reduction in the number of completed wells in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale More importantly we are maintaining our CapEx of billion some below last years level when taking into account the selldown in Malaysia In Western Canada our natural gas production in the Montney in the third quarter was over million per day Weve been successful in implementing fracture techniques from our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale work to the Montney and our new completion design with increased sand concentrations continue to confirm our BCF EURs Also we continue to have positive results on our refract pilot that is under way in some older tougher wells In Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale were especially pleased with our results for the third quarter for production average over barrels equivalent per day We brought new wells online in the third quarter and were planning to deliver wells in the fourth quarter for a total of wells this year A program has been frontloaded as prior disclosed Production for full year outlook is now expected to exceed barrel equivalents a day which is above production We continue adding to our total remaining resource into play by downspacing wells drilling longer laterals and optimizing completions to name a few We now estimate that our total remaining resource has grown to over million barrels and this growth even takes into account the total review of our resources from a price perspective We successfully drilled our first Austin Chalk well in Collins County and were hopeful Hopefully well be moving this play concept westward to our Catarina area This would add a third horizon to our upper and lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale locations We drilled the first of three well appraisal pilot and are currently analyzing core and logs to better understand the reservoir properties Our Karnes Austin Chalk appraisal well has a very successful flow rate of barrel oil equivalent per day We look forward to continuing to test the Austin Chalk play in In Malaysia we achieved record average daily gas production in Sarawak of MMcf a day We successfully drilled too shallow water Sarawak oil prospects the Merapuh and Marakas wells had positive results where were evaluating development options These wells are in the Block SKA area adjacent to our successful Sarawak oil and gas developments The Murphy operated PausKelasa well failed to encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbon and was expensed as dry hole in the quarter Offshore Vietnam we signed the farmin agreement in the shallowwater Block and the prolific oil prone Vietnam Cuu Long Basin Two discoveries have been made in the block Murphy participated in the drilling and testing of the LDVX well which successfully tested two prospective zones Were also working with PetroVietnam to advance our footprint in the Cuu Long This new block entry was made possible by our longterm relationship with our partner and our significant position and successful operator in both deepwater and shallow water Malaysia In the Gulf of Mexico production for the quarter was over barrel equivalents per day at liquids We spud the Dalmatian South well during the quarter Were now completing the wells we found commercial hydrocarbons with over feet of zones and we expect first production early next year Field development work on the nonoperated Kodiak project continues where the first of two wells have been drilled and completed to plan and modification of topside facilities and subsea execution is under way Were currently progressing the sidetrack of our Thunder Bird well to plan and all of our current Gulf of Mexico projects can withstand lower for longer prices Looking at the drilling program for the fourth quarter in the Gulf the nonoperated Solomon well which is currently projected to reach total depth sometime in the fourth quarter has been included in our dry hole exposure for the fourth quarter We planned to finish off the year with an oil exploration well Senyum located in Block H Malaysia Thats a nonoperated well to appraise our oil linked gas discoveries in Brunei At this time we have two deepwater rigs under contract at Murphy These contracts expire in one in February and the other in November With continued low commodity prices were experiencing an expected reduction in our CapEx program and uncertainty about whether working interest partners will agree to participate in drilling programs were considering all options Our current contractual commitments to the end of the term for both rigs equals million In financials Murphy has been able to maintain our investment grade BBB bond rating maintained our dividend policy through the year with current yield of We have billion available under our current revolver We have over billion of cash abroad with marketable securities And we achieved the netdebttoEBITDA of less than Production for the fourth quarter is estimated to be barrel equivalents a day Again weve increased our fullyear production guidance at the range of to equivalent per day Capital expenditures remain unchanged from previous guidance and are currently forecast to be billion And to close in my comments today I would like to leave with a few points Murphy continues to have financial flexibility and strength Weve greatly lowered operating and GA expenses over the course of the year and cost reductions remain a priority Our entry into the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale has been extremely successful addition to Murphy over the past few years and weve built an excellent highperforming team now producing around of our total volumes in just over four years We like most peers continue to see efficiencies in cost reductions in drilling and completion activities across all of our operating areas Our Gulf of Mexico projects generate sound economics at current prices And over the quarter we have participated in many positive well results from the Gulf of Mexico to shallow water Malaysia and to Vietnam in a very high rate well test in Austin Chalk area of Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale We continue to execute on all cylinders in a tough commodity environment And like to now open it up the phone for your questions So thank you Thank you And well take our first question from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey guys How are you doing here Just a question for you Philosophically I know earlier in the year you guys talked about moving away from some of the exploration activity I guess you guys were announcing that youre farming in to a block in Vietnam here is a sort of a new area I guess is this not really seeing in sort of exploration It sounds like theres some existing discoveries or do you guys just see this as lower risk exploration Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer I think we see it as a little bit of both Leo We have had a pause in our exploration When I say that its primarily related to the big million plus big wells in the Gulf of Mexico theyre very expensive at very high day rates But were not opposed to entry into lower risk opportunities It was clear to us that the block did have prior discovery zone I mean we entered into the block and participated in delineation of all the discoveries That delineation is going very very well Were very excited about it Were talking about when we have you have two types of wells in the world the big Gulf of Mexico West Africa new entry type wells and you have lower risk opportunities in a place like Vietnam where you can drill a well for million and have million barrel to million barrel type prospect So on an F basis of an FD perspective thats a very positive thing And this is about our strategy This is about our company We do work internationally We are a big major player in Malaysia We have a strong relationship and a very strong reputation in Southeast Asia Our expertise in shallow water development there and across other acreage in Vietnam is the reason we were able to get into this block And its very favorable but I do not consider it to be entry in a place somewhere very similar geology What we need to do very similar areas of operation very similar cost very similar well design and a place where we work nearby and something were focused on in that area But I consider it not a new big wild entry into far off place yet Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay Can you give us a little more color about this exploration well youre drilling in Malaysia towards the end of the year And you also mentioned another well in Brunei which I guess is not up can you give us a little more color around those Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Yeah we have commitment wells in our business We do not have commitments usually in the Gulf as you anticipate So weve had these and these are again lower cost wells The well in Block H has moved up in our schedule from what we thought prior Its a big world out there on rig contracts and theres an opportunity for us to be subsidized and drill a very lower cost well in that part of the world So if youre in the game for a long time on both sides of the rig equation Ive been in at that business a long time and we have an opportunity to drill well cheaper due to that and its a very nice well to drill Its probably a million barrel mean type project near the Conocooperated Kebabangan area of Block H It would be different from the Block H wells we drilled in the past from an exploration basis and totally different from our shallow flat spot gas amplitudes in which weve had enormous success So were going to drill that well Its part of the million to million net to Murphy Its disclosed in our costs here in Kereta where weve been a nonoperated smaller partner of Brunei Weve had several successes there in a row This is a continuation towards that commerciality of flowing LNG into Brunei We do have the right type of partners there meaning people that are across the value chain of LNG and I consider it also to be at lower risk lower cost opportunity which is what were looking for not the big rank expensive wells at this particular time Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay thats helpful and I guess you guys also mentioned that you had two recent successes at Sarawak on the oil side Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC I dont know if I can pronounce the two names of these wells They both begin with an M Could you give us a little bit more just color around there I guess it sounds like youre still appraising them Would these be wells that potential could come online in the near future like What else can you tell us about those Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Well its called Merapuh and Marakas If you live over there five years or six years you can say it really easily Leo like me So theyre both nearby structures near two very nice fields Merapuh is a major part of our gas project in SK Gas and the Marakas well is a western feature to the west of our south axis platform that does it very very well Marakas is a deeper section I mean higher pressure deeper section that was successful and we have to take those pressures and see how were going to delineate that with the platform It is not a event This would be out in time and it will depend on capital allocation next year as we go through what you can imagine a difficult budget cycle The Merapuh well found extensions of some prior gas that we produced today in Merapuh and another structure so we proved downdip gas there and some updip oil opportunities both of them were million barrel type thing We probably drilled both wells for less than something million dollars Its going to fit in well with our nearby development Some are working on it and theyre successful Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay thats helpful I guess you sort of went through the math in terms of saying that your fourth quarter production was going to be a little bit lower than Q Leo Mariani RBC Capital Markets LLC I know you had some maintenance in the third quarter Just to be clear expecting some incremental maintenance in fourth quarter or is this more of just sort of risking and the fact that youre saying your nominations for your SK Gas are likely to be lower Could you just maybe explain that a little better Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Well SK Gas is a place so much weve had a very very good year Its a place where we planned on being million a day and we got up close to million a day this quarter Its a record quarter for us It is a situation with many many fields fiddling into a very large incredible LNG facility So theres ups and downs of nomination Were known as a swing producer there and a very reliable swing producer with very high uptime Again it facilitates our strong relationship with Petronas But things come and go there as to impurities of other fuel such as nitrogen HS and the management that makes hard to predict the guidance for that field Its one of the issues around our company We have very high cash flow per barrel metrics but with that becomes just not as simple as an onshore situation Leo So we have to risk what our nominations will be there We do have some downtime at that facility operated by Petronas that weve been notified of in November December Also the same situation with our gas associated gas that comes off TK and we have some downtime in the Gulf at Front Runner and then we have to repair some things and we have some decline in some of our wells in the Gulf because were not really adding any wells there until early in and this year and this quarter was a very good quarter for us and all those combined into that Well take our next question from Peter Kissel with Howard Weil Peter Francis Freeman Kissel Scotia Howard Weil Hi Good afternoon guys and thanks for taking my questions Maybe just going back to Vietnam here to start with Roger can you give us a projected spend rate over the next couple of years for that asset Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer There is an extension involved with the block and were just on the tail end This well happened in September Pete and were working with them on that Its possible we could have an exploration well there This is a pretty complex commerciality field development plan process at PetroVietnam Were used to that working with Petronas in Malaysia Were talking about probably spend on that in the range and not next year very aggressive there in my view but were very excited about this field here Peter Francis Freeman Kissel Scotia Howard Weil Got you Okay And then Roger I know youve been pretty actively looking at a lot of different MA potential this year Does the decision to go into Vietnam a bit more aggressively change your stats a little bit or are you still pretty actively looking for other assets elsewhere Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Oh no it has nothing to do with that Im not at liberty today to talk about the cost but its a type finding cost number and FD number on this project of about to thats pretty good Its not incredible CapEx for us We have a lot of cash if you will in Malaysia through our subsidiary arrangements of moving money in that situation This has nothing to do with our incredible focus on both offshore and onshore opportunities today but we want to have value We want to have return for our shareholders and were constantly working three or four of them with a full team of people and well continue to do so Peter Francis Freeman Kissel Scotia Howard Weil Got you Okay Thanks Roger Maybe one quick question for John too With regards to cost youve had a very successful year of lowering your costs And just wondering how much more is there to go from here both on the OpEx side and the CapEx side Is it in the to range thats still likely or something a bit bigger or less than that maybe Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Its Roger I was preparing for that one Pete I thought with somebody else but glad you called in today You know you have to look at first off you cant look at Murphy quarterly on LOE Weve made big change from yeartoyear because we have offshore operations and subsea maintenance We dont have just one singular place where we work And I think the real thing as you know were looking at this year without Syncrude and probably getting out into very close to I dont believe we can keep the trajectory of taking it to right now But our big growth in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to be looking at a continue trending down and for all of next year thats a big move from the last two years three years Now with that said Im very proud of getting to these levels We have an organization incredibly focused on lowering these costs but we cant go on forever to Pete here in our business with an offshore business and an onshore business Were very happy about where its headed and on a yeartoyear basis I think its quite possible Peter Francis Freeman Kissel Scotia Howard Weil Okay Great Thanks Roger and congrats on a good quarter Well take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo Roger D Read Wells Fargo Securities LLC Im well I hope you are doing the same Hopefully that Blackberry is not causing you the trouble this year it did last year Roger Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Roger youve got to get off that story Roger D Read Wells Fargo Securities LLC I always thought it was a good one because I know exactly how it feels Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer I moved on to an iPhone Im going crazy with technology Roger D Read Wells Fargo Securities LLC All right all right Well its a different tone anyway Hey kind of following up on the MA question before I know you dont want to get into the specifics of the property but what are you seeing in terms of cost bidask spreads Has there been an increase in the properties that are available to look at in terms of data rooms that sort of thing Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Theres just everything of the above there You have some public situations You have private equity situations You probably have a vision of more of return of their multiple than probably be able to offer the returns we would like The Midland area is very very frothy Delaware getting a little better Id say Offshore opportunities in the Gulf are the key ones for value adds And were expanding a little bit across North America to make sure weve touched every place for value and not necessarily focused I think were not quite as singularly focused as we were before And like I said to Pete here I mean we have a certain criteria were looking for and we execute on that and keeps on going And when we decide we cant make a return we have a process of looking at the NAV or the rate of return of investment Roger on strip And a price recovery deck that we have We have four price decks here at Murphy And when we feel we cant get to the strip or some level of return I would like then we move to another and we will continue that process and Roger D Read Wells Fargo Securities LLC Sure And in terms of the return you would be looking for on one of these acquisitions to the extent you can share with us what would be the hurdle rate for something like a meaningful transaction Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Im really not going to probably say that Roger You anticipate some level of return on a price recovery deck that would have to be far in excess of cost of capital And the reason you cant just say exactly what it is because its more complicated and that depends on the reserves that would be what are those price for those barrels do they have flow in production that you could have some level of CapEx without earning your capitalization of the company and just a list of issues that would have different types of terms for different types of things Roger D Read Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay And then just my last question In terms of the cash thats overseas that you could repatriate can you remind us what the potential tax leakage on that would be John W Eckart Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Okay The tax leakage on that is not that great We have foreign tax credits that would offset almost all of it If we bring money home from Canada if we do that theres obviously a withholding tax associated with that you cant get out of It is a creditable tax against the US taxes owed But youd likely be out that at a minimum and really theres not that much leakage otherwise at the present time Well take our next question from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse Edward George Westlake Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC Broker Good afternoon So congrats on the operational performance I mean I guess the key focus is the cash flow outspend I mean youve got a balance sheet but obviously prices are low People will worry about it So youve got a CapEx for this year of billion Youve talked about potentially dropping rigs Maybe walk through what are the big deltas that you see from this year to next year I appreciate you may not want to give a specific number but what should we be thinking about Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Yeah Ed Im probably not going to be the leader in that and I had a bet around different ways people would ask that question Obviously we at Murphy kind of when youre looking at WTI deck and of course youve got to take that across all your netbacks and natural gas deck appropriate that et cetera Were looking at cutting CapEx significantly I dont think that will be a surprise Then we have to look at that CapEx as to what will happen with production We have been working through a lot of that issue recently a long range plan determining where we wanted to allocate capital Then we get through our quarter issue here to close out you guys and its our next focus and we as usual approve our budget in December But itd be significantly reduced And when we do do that well look at it and do it We have several factors there dividend policy wed like to maintain what will happen to production and we can I do feel that we are in a were not saying flexible in these highlights et cetera We do have flexibility We have liquidity and ability to handle world in and in and make our commitments and our dividend And that includes projections we might would have on production that we probably arent sharing here today So I feel our liquidity situations and the levers we have there are adequate to handle this and were taking that to a real high level of review at this time Edward George Westlake Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC Broker Okay And so then coming to the rig comment you made in the opening remarks you said one rolls off I think in spring and one in November and considering all options how much are you spending if you say drop both those rigs what would the impact be of that Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer The way it works in an offshore environment today its just around million a day to run a rig and if you have the day rate of the rig is to and you stop paying the other half and you have about the same level of CapEx That is a very poor return and one Im not happy with but I do not want to take this as an opportunity to drill rank wells and add more CapEx probably Im not interested in situations where our carry partners and help them and loan money to them Im not interested in that The deepwater world is one that doesnt go well at and we take all that to account you just start looking at the options and there are many and we have different types of people who want to take nonworking interest in some of our partners We have people that offer us some level of a wildcat exposure at an appropriate level of risk for us because the rate of return of paying it off is not good Ed as you would know So we are looking at all those things but when I mention the liquidity in the and world and our dividend and where what happens with our net debt and our debt to cap all these factors take into account the worst case scenario in that situation and Im not concerned about liquidity on that front Edward George Westlake Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC Broker Okay And then final question again you may not be able to answer Midstream monetization in Canada and other infrastructure any sort of rough ballparks I guess in terms of how much cap do you think you could raise Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer No but I consider it significant and we continue to work that Were not a company that throws around MLPs and it does all this wild stuff all the time So were taking a measured approach at that Were very pleased with how thats going and it would be a termination of the terms and conditions and how thats going to go And it too would be another liquidity situation that I have not factored in in the discussion I just have with you a few minutes ago Edward George Westlake Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC Broker Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Really just going to where were going to do BD on this Ed is when we have were going to announce it and setting up these visions of what would be a good EBITDA multiples really not where Im headed today Edward George Westlake Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC Broker Well take our next question from Paul Cheng with Barclays Hey guys Good afternoon Roger I know that youre not going to talk about the budget yet but can Paul Y Cheng Barclays Capital Inc No Im actually not asking the budget Im asking that what is the CapEx that you need today based on the current market condition If you want to hold the production flat and have the same similar asset mix What the CapEx look like Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Asset mix isnt going to change overnight Its pretty similar sales very good everything is going well I dont have that number exactly calculated because were in the middle of our budget Paul I would anticipate like or so Paul Y Cheng Barclays Capital Inc Okay And thus I presume that is including some form of exploration expense or that exploration will be on top Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Were trying to have exploration limited in the world but certainly Paul As I mentioned earlier there are commitments that you have when youre in this business international oil and gas business you do have some level of commitment And were working to be on a committed basis only and it would be much less spend in and were working on that right now Paul Y Cheng Barclays Capital Inc And on the Midstream monetization or strategic review from a timeline standpoint at this point is it going to be driven primarily by the market condition or that is based on that how quickly that you guys will go through all the analysis Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Oh its complicated We have to have the appropriate person everyone do business with They have to be happy with us We have to get those terms and conditions We then have to have it approved by our board and really Im not in a real bond to do it I dont have to do it and Im not probably at liberty to discuss a timeline because Im not in a hard spot Paul Y Cheng Barclays Capital Inc I see Final one in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>if were looking at your best sweet spot based on your current drilling program How long the prospect inventory can last Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Till Im well and going Paul probably at wells a year for year to years or more no more than that years Our next question comes from Guy Baber with Simmons Guy Allen Baber Simmons Company International Im good Good afternoon everybody Roger I wanted to talk a little bit more about the performance which was impressive and apologies if I missed this But do you have an estimate of the split between the cost gains and efficiencies you have achieved which you might be classified as or which you might classify as more cyclical versus what is more structural and the result of what Murphy specifically is doing differently Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Any GA here is not continuing event So Guy its significant though of staffing by the end of the year is very significant that would be both employees and contractors and all types of changes around the company And we would not want to see that continue for another next year but we have not got the full estimate of that in this type actions recent to Murphy very recent over the last few days and we need to put that into our budget process but we are looking at we do know that last year we spent million on GA and this year were in our internal work around million and then we will have and we do know that the staffing thing is in mid million per year and well have a full help to that to our side and we are very much significantly down from a couple of years back On the operating expenses I mean we like I said earlier in the call we made incredible improvements there Its driven by a lot of great performance in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale a lot of work in the offshore as well a lot of sharing of helicopter sharing when things go difficult many people work together to lower the cost and Im very pleased with how my staff has performed in that Its incredible job for us Were incredibly focused on it because were trying to get to cash flow CapEx parity of and every penny counts and thats how were working it And when you work on things with the good people I have you start seeing the results Guy Allen Baber Simmons Company International Thats helpful Thanks Roger And then focusing in on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>youre now running three rigs there which is down from four last quarter and the production was better than we had expected this quarter In a to world can you just talk about the priorities which will govern the way you think about managing activity levels there over the next year Is it about the returns of that specific play or is it more about the portfolio and cash flow CapEx parity and you having flexibility there So just your high level thoughts there would be appreciated And then if you could help us out with what the implicit effect might be on the production profile that would help as well Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Well we have a lot of flexibility around production Like I said earlier I dont have that finalized and probably not going to be the leader in that pack with the year weve had here We have some really good wells to drill in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale A based pricing we have a lot of wells are rate of return and I think thats pretty decent And if oil prices are we have many wells to drill at rate of return incremental going forward I dont like to do work that way but this does help when youre allocating capital So were going to be allocating capital on the best areas that deliver the best return on that incrementally We also do not need a lot of rigs to protect our acreage thats different than it was in times past and well have to do some big capital allocation study and were in the middle of doing so about protecting acreage versus protecting efficiency The reason we have such efficient operations weve been running same numbers of rigs for a while now with the same teams So if you go forward to zero to two to three to four to zero its hard to do that So its almost a situation of allocating capital to remain some level of efficiency And were really trying to get to preparing for lower prices here from a cash flow CapEx parity over other things because we cannot continue to outspend our CapEx and wake up one day and be with the credit of other people we have very good credit situation today debt to cap and we dont want to wake up with it like to norm and not have done something or looked or attempted to do something to add value to our shareholders So were in the middle of all that and obviously the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale will be a key part of capital allocation I think today billion CapEx of our CapEx in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale is million and were going to be at that percent or more as we could CapEx because this is a very valuable asset for us Its going extremely well on everything you can imagine thats known in shale business We at Murphy have that ability as well and were proud about it and it too has incredible flexibility because if things were to get worse you can reduce it you can add to it You wont have the efficiency when youre jumping at but its a very nice thing to have a company of our size and I think very very material Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank Ryan Todd Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Maybe one quick followup on I mean the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>performance was impressive on the quarter with actually growing sequentially with fewer completions can you talk a little bit about what I mean you referenced better productivity of the wells high EURs some enhanced completions can you talk a little bit about some of the things that youre seeing in the wells how sustainable you think that is and what sort of confidence that gives you I guess in terms of maintaining better production levels in Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Well weve recently done a big study and Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale started over with all of our PUDs all of our proven locations and our reserves Were doing very very well in reserve Im very pleased at that trajectory where I think this year will end We had some gas acreage in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale that weve taken off the table of course and weve made some big changes in EUR As I walk through a couple of the fields I think significant Karnes where is a prolific area there as you know Ryan We used to think that an acre spacing well would have about a EUR And now we pull that to but were at acre spacing So thats an enormous change in resource both in upper and lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale Tilden would be the same way Were doing a lot of work with longer laterals there bigger sand Today from back to were talking about the same situation where EURs continue to improve there probably not as much as Karnes but the big improvement for us is Catarina which is our most western area which is a very organized we went ground floor here so we dont have the perfect giant sections of land but Catarina is very very organized from that perspective And we have improved the EURs there We have three big ranches there One area from a day equivalent EUR to over with less spacing And then another area from to over again with less spacing And another area from to So this is enormous change in an area that we drill wells for only fourpointsomething million dollars This is a big deal and that we may not have it all modeled in yet but our trajectory and where were headed there its very very positive in my view Ryan Todd Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Thanks That was very helpful And then maybe if I could one more I guess from a little bit of a strategy point of view I mean I think one of the concerns that people have had with Murphy has been maybe depth of resource and what would drive in an oil price recovery what are going to be the assets or the resource thats going to drive when the growth again when you return the planned offense as opposed to defense And I guess as you think about that and you think about the resource that you have in your portfolio what would you see The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is clearly going to be one but what would you see as kind of resource that will be the kind of the driver to the next leg of growth for the company And I guess in that context and how does MA fit in terms of either complementing or competing with that resource for kind of the next cycle of Murphy Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Well I mean clearly when we do MA we look at how it affects our long range plans and how it increase our income our cash flow per share and every type of metric including RoverP I think when youre speaking in a nice way about the RoverP its very frustrating to me the RoverP here has been eight for a long time Its going to be eight for a long time but from an oilweighted perspective were probably fifth place out of peers If you take the RoverP thats really through the oil Were very limited Well probably be the lowest NGL RoverP player and very very low on natural gas Thats quite frustrating to me because this view that we dont have any locations If this year in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale were going to drill operate about wells down there bring online wells then we probably have locations to go so this idea that Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale is not material for a company that has million barrels approved and now a resource size remaining of million barrels its mindboggling to me and its very wellknown how this project models But outside of that I mean places like Vietnam we have focus areas that are very tied around where we want to work We want to bring that focus tighter projects like Kodiak Kodiak Vietnam and things from Gulf are available to us that are not large MA change your entire capital structure type deals but theyre very helpful on adding barrels We do have the floating LNG coming online Malaysia is going very well I didnt mention but we took a core there in a well this quarter to continue to confirm our outstanding resource available and were partnered with a leading LNG player in the world in Petronas which is a big deal So small things like Kodiak big ones like Vietnam MA on top of all that but we do not have a collapsing RoverP in this company If you take a look at the long range plan of the company we do not significantly drop ever our RoverP We just dont have the because they dont have a lot of gas to make it So I think its a misnomer a bid about the resources we have and we probably need to do a better job of outlining those resources thats hard to do that In two years when the oil price collapsed twice Thats not the time to go out set expectations when you lower CapEx you had the wrong expectation it doesnt work well that way So its hard to get into that vision that youre asking in these incredible volatile oil price times If you want to maintain balance sheet to do transformational things in the company you can easily outspend and grow production and end up not having a transformational change thats very easy I can just pick up the phone and do that So decided not to do it that way at this time Ryan Todd Deutsche Bank Securities Inc Thats great I appreciate your thoughts And maybe I mean I guess its I mean its safe to say to you that theres probably more resources than the market gives you credit for But maybe one last one on that Is the Gulf of Mexico and there is a lot of youve had some recent successful wells there And as you think over the next couple of years as is the play that I think its probably a little bit harder for us to model out How do you think about production in the Gulf of Mexico over the next couple of years Have you tie in these wells Will this effectively hold production flat Will it drive moderate growth or moderate declines How should we think about that Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer If we could get partners to participate in our wells that had ability and income do so and cash flow we could grow production there and thats hard to deal with at this particular time We have some really nice low risk opportunities there like Medusa where we placed two wells on line and doing very very well So we have some additional locations there It will be a matter of an oil price recovery However tiebacks like Dalmatian South and various other things the tiebacks from the Gulf of Mexico are right up there with returns you have in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>if you take full cycle into account meaning the drilling of the well the pipeline et cetera These things are very economic We need a higher oil price Ryan to get into facility building big exploration successful things or where we can enter into a well or enter into the things going forward during this unique pullback because we have the balance sheet to be able to do so Those need oil to be a little higher so if you have a higher vision of oil you can participate into the Gulf and many many favorable projects today So our ability to operate there work there and long history of being there and have our business so that way its very advantageous for us right now So we have great Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale business going and we are executing incredibly well on Youve got to keep in mind we built this team for years Its incredible And we are then able to look at those opportunities We have a longstanding deepwater team where were not exploring today but factor is how do we get comfortable in changing staffing to do that again another day when oil prices recover if we choose to do so But theres a lot of opportunities in both and were very advantaged to able to look at both of them and I dont know if many people have that Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James Pavel S Molchanov Raymond James Associates Inc Hey guys You talked about your entry into Vietnam as an exploration opportunity are there any components of your exploration portfolio that you are considering not staying in or either divesting or simply exiting in Pavel S Molchanov Raymond James Associates Inc Okay Fair enough Let me try it this way given the diverse scope of your kind of geographic footprint and the different host country relationships or have you noticed more willingness on the part of governments and NOCs to improve the fiscal terms for you guys specifically or if you want to talk about the industry in general Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer I found that in Southeast Asia Petronas is such a leader there that the physical terms are very similar Weve been very successful We directly understand it Thats going fine I think that will come It takes a while for a I have a lot of experience with NOCs It takes a long time for them to have through their government to change these situations I think it will greatly improve into next year probably So I believe thats coming and we at Murphy are really trying to focus down on those places And were doing so and thats why we will have the exits that we will talk about when theyre exited And so I think were doing all the things to my question that we probably should look at and we are and I believe that the NOC help will come but its not exactly documented today But clearly everyone in the industry has to make a change around everything theyre doing when oil prices used to be Today theyre Pavel S Molchanov Raymond James Associates Inc But specifically in Vietnam were you able to get better terms than you think you would have gotten lets say months or months ago Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer No I doubt so Like I say were but I think we have incredible relationship with relationship We found the terms to be very similar to shallow water in Malaysia Were very familiar with how they work I consider them fair They incredibly changed of late It takes a long time to do a deal like this So it takes longer to do it than oil price recovery takes So were very happy about it Its a block that had success on it This is not some new entry ranked wildcatting block in the middle of nowhere This is totally after this one the bigger oilfields anywhere in onshore its discovered in the s by Mobil This is a billion to billion type resource They may come to barrels a day in area of Vietnam This is the key crown jewel of Vietnam and were very fortunate to be invited to be in Brian A Singer Goldman Sachs Co Your op costs have seen some royal quartertoquarter swings but as was highlighted here there was a consistency of strong cost performance here in the third quarter When we look at the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production cost at the rest of the US at Canada exSyncrude sub is this the new ceiling and base case where costs come down from here And if your production declines in places like the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>or elsewhere how would that have an impact on the unit op costs Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Well and I think in the onshore were doing very very well in that regard I mean looking back to Im talking about just the LOE Brian not the taxes and all that Its different aspect this as you know Last year around This year in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale looking at or so for the year all yearend because we had some higher costs pull over into the first quarter And next year were probably looking at and change thats really good I think in Canada we make incredible OpEx improvements at both Montney and Seal Seal of course very challenged from a price perspective And so the onshore areas I think are good The ups and downs are in an offshore business you have to model it Brian a little bit to get that value And so weve had a good year in offshore especially in the Gulf and that it will come You have subsea inspections intelligent piggings of pipeline and it makes the quarter a little bit jumpy in that regard But overall as a company I think that were in like I said earlier in the call were looking at it probably is a record here of LOE and were looking at right around or all of here of all of our business Weve probably done a lot of that heavy lifting and that would account for if there are levels of production dropping of whatever due to capital which will be the range over the next few months that can handle that in my opinion Brian A Singer Goldman Sachs Co Thats great And shifting to the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and then I had a followup on one of the earlier questions You have this push versus pull budget versus deficiencies is there a minimum level of completion cadence that you see as needed per quarter in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to retain a minimum level of efficiencies and should we expect that production to decline Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Well I mean obviously if you go to answer your question Ill say you need to keep two rigs running and if you have to drill wells and that probably lead to one frac spread and you can always pick up other ones as needed Were not a company with a lot of drilled uncompleted wells I think we only have Im not a guy that build up hundreds of those things I dont believe thats appropriate thing to do with capital And so with that said I mean obviously wed have production decline Brian if you go from to to to there would have to be a decline which is as your firm speaks about often which should lead to which I guess your firm doesnt believe but it would lead to an oil price recovery I would hope And our final question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Yeah I hope youre well Roger I just had a couple of youve been through several permutations of the options and youve talked about transformational deeper resource inventory than you get credit for et cetera et cetera I just had two questions for you One was to be considered a merger of equals with someone else is it transformational deal and the second is would there be the potential for you just to take Murphy private Thanks Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer Well I mean those are unusual complex questions Paul That the complete Board of Directors of Murphy in which I am one we have not in my view if you look at my desk today piled with papers I do not have a merger document there nor a going private document So my focus is to its real hard with these big price collapses We had a very difficult budget last year coming from a tough one again this year make him stand about trying to get to cash flow CapEx parity and going from there is my focus today over mergers in that effect that will always be available to any publicly traded company of course but its not a focus I have today to be honest I understand And so the clear frustration youve got is that the share price is low and the multiple is so low How do we change that Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer What would change that by continuing to when youre in when you get back to cash flow of CapEx parity and do that first and continuing to focus on cost you can only go so far with that but were going keep working on those two matters and we do have singles and doubles here that weve been hitting Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer I think were back doing that again Its pretty big gross type resource were touching this quarter Dalmatian million each for shallow water well significant well in Vietnam And so weve got some things going our way there Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer And we feel like were pretty wellpositioned But in my view today we have to maintain balance sheet that we have And at some point I suppose there will be a time when we try to do MA and have return for our shareholders and we feel were unable to do that anymore and we could look at other things So I feel a lot good about where we are in a pretty poor price environment and were working on that is the answer Paul Yeah Appreciate it Roger Thank you very much Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer And that concludes the questionandanswer session Id like to turn the conference back over to Roger Jenkins for any additional or closing remarks Roger W Jenkins President Chief Executive Officer We appreciate everyone calling in today with some active questions today I loved been participating with you and I think we did have a good quarter And well be back
