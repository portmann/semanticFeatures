class='textDiv'>Pumping The Brakes On Realty Income To Take A Spin With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Realty Income has been immune from market dips for quite awhile now I am not in the position to close my eyes and hold I am trading out Realty Income for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for greater earning potential In the parabolic run the market experienced in the first quarter there are a few companies that have been immune For example every time Ive looked at the utility sector it has been more expensive than the previous time I looked at it The same could be said for the consumer sector Pepsi M and the like are moving more and more out of my price range Also I own a company that is prodigiously overvalued At the current price Realty Income NYSE O is trading at over x its most optimistic Funds from Operations forecast for And has been very adequately pointed out this is unquestionably high in relation to its peers Much has been written in recent days regarding what to do regarding this company sell it do nothing sell some Ive mostly ignored it all though that short thesis was rather amusing What eventually made up my mind of what to do was continuously staring at this Yes Realty Income has been very good to me Yes innumerable retirees depend on it for monthly income The company has trademarked the name The Monthly Dividend Company for crying out loud However with all that being said dedicated to one position is simply unhealthy The way I saw it I had three options First would be to sell it all and collect the massive gain to deploy elsewhere Second would be to turn off the dividend reinvesting so that the monthly income would not be purchasing more overvalued shares but would instead come in cash so that I could look for other opportunities Third since this is in a retirement account options are off the table would be to continue to do what I had done think that since I bought Realty Income to provide me income and nothing has changed regarding that I needed to do nothing more I bought it for income I should hold it for income For a long time I was firmly in the camp of the third option And this is exactly the right course of action to take in my opinion provided my portfolio is constructed exactly as I want it However since I have shared multiple times that I am looking to double the position size of my portfolio the more time that passed it made less and less sense to me to hold onto a position that is prodigiously overvalued when there could be some amount of it sold off to initiate another position to further diversify my portfolio I held my Realty Income at two different cost bases one at and a larger piece bought a little later at Finally after much contemplation I sold that first piece of Realty Income on at for a gain Of course the question immediately becomes What are you going to do with the money Despite the ubiquitous nature of The Big Three I believe I could reasonably posit that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has quite the open road ahead of it The global automotive industry accounts for trillion per year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has roughly of it Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has the bestselling vehicle in the United States for the th year in a row But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is devoting billion for electric cars through tripling its number of autonomous vehicles this year which will result in the largest fleet of fullyautonomous vehicles developing FordPass developing partnerships with IBM and Amazon an integration between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cars and the Amazon Echo and a litany of other things all in the hopes of getting their beak wet in an annual trillion transportation services market that has largely been untapped Theres been talk of an emerging middle class for years There are a number of ways to play it Apple NASDAQ AAPL in case all these people have aspired for iPhones or iPads or Archer Daniels Midland NYSE ADM to handle the uptick in protein that a better diet will require Yet another way to play this would be to buy an auto company with the idea that this emerging middle class will inevitably purchase vehicles While this middle class is emerging I would maintain that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is outperforming General Motors NYSE GM and Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU right now In fact its margins are such that Fords operating income has consistently been higher than GMs even though GMs revenues have been higher than Fords every year Yes it is true <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company does not make the fabled CCC list However it has increased its shareholder payouts every year since However in spite of this the dividend is not at a level that is so stretched that it takes up the majority of EPS or Free Cash Flow Personally I like the dividend to be under of free cash flow The fact that it has only broken once since is a feather in the cap for expansion as well as for cushion But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is in debt up to its eyeballs It certainly appears that way A cursory glance at the numbers shows Fiat Chryslers debttoequity ratio at LT GMs at LT while Fords comes in at an astonishing LT Obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is obviously more leveraged than the other two of the Big Three right Not exactly Theres one important thing to remember The old Chrysler Financial is now TD Auto Finance The old General Motors Acceptance Corporation is now Ally Financial NYSE ALLY However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit is still an integral and strategic part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company with no signs of change So in effect to get a truly comparative picture between Fords debt and that of GM or Fiat Chrysler Fords debt needs to be bifurcated between what belongs to the automobile segment and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit segment When this is done automotive debt as a percentage of automotive assets takes a remarkably different shape At year end the more manageable auto debt by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could be completely paid off with billion still left in the bank Going back to Fords loans are on average to borrowers with a FICO score far out of the reach of subprime As a side effect of this the overday delinquencies and losstoreceivables ratios check in at and for respectively in the lower part of the historical range for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and not financially meaningful True just like the other two of the Big Three <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is intrinsically linked to the United Auto Workers Union There was a time when a unionized workforce was enough for me to shy away from investing in the company for fear of protracted labor disputes and strikes and such However if I do this then I am writing off becoming an owner of now only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GM or Fiat Chrysler but also Caterpillar NYSE CAT Boeing NYSE BA Honeywell NYSE HON Cummins NYSE CMI Verizon NYSE VZ United Parcel Service NYSE UPS Norfolk Southern NYSE NSC Waste Management NYSE WM and even Disney NYSE DIS as some of their workforce is unionized as well So I could completely write off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as an investment or realize that only of Fords salaried employees are represented by unions and they just ratified a fouryear collective bargaining agreement in during which labor costs will rise by less than per year Barring something unforeseen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be the next company I add to my portfolio The question becomes at what price The current PE of x earnings seems to be an attractive range Not only this but if I estimate that theyll be able to grow free cash flow at over the next years fair value comes in rather close to here discount rate I continue to hold Realty Income and dont foresee liquidating my position However due to its frothy valuation I sold it to take advantage of an opportunity to add a company whose current yield will add roughly to my FTM forward twelve months income add roughly basis points to my yield on cost and get a little further down the road to my full portfolio allocation all while increasing the potential for higher growth rates in the future Disclosure I am not a professional investor and as such
