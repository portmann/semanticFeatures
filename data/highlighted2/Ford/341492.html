style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>posted a increase in US auto sales during February compared to January which came in well above competitors After a slow month in January the Mustang FSeries and other SUVs saw a superb month boosting sales numbers as well as average transaction prices The company certainly faces challenges in but given the strength of the automotive industry and the weak valuation I am optimistic on Fords <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F announced February US vehicle sales of K up a whopping from the same month in This large increase came in well above the and estimates from Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds The increase was refreshing to Fords shareholders after a mediocre start to in January Furthermore the company increased its average transaction price at almost double the industry average due to the continued success of its larger vehicle offerings After January in which many auto companies were blaming the East Coast snow storm for lackluster sales Fords increase came in well above other competitors as the overall industry average posted a increase This impressive month for the industry comes on the heels of a record that saw million vehicles sold surpassing the mark of million Competitors such as Honda NYSE HMC up Fiat Chrysler NYSE FCAU up Nissan OTCPKNSANY up and Toyota NYSE TM up posted solid increases while General Motors NYSE GM fell and Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY fell saw decreases Furthermore in the critical pickup truck market Fords FSeries posted a increase which is a positive indicator of the companys future The model is coming off a busy where it underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model and has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure its manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like its competitors in the first half of However the company reached full production in the second half of and was credited for its late surge in Showing its resiliency even with the supply issues the model was awarded the title of Americas bestselling pickup for straight years and the bestselling vehicle for straight years with over trucks sold in Another concerning figure from the February sales report was the continuation of a sluggish start for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang Despite reclaiming the title of US muscle car of the year in by selling over Mustangs compared to only Chevrolet Camaros In January the Mustang saw a decrease compared to an increase by the Camaro while in February the Mustang saw an increase compared to a increase to Camaro In line with the impressive gains made by the FSeries the rebound from a lackluster month for the Mustang is a positive indicator for Fords This slow start to in addition to other possible threats such as the overall health of the US economy the upcoming interest rate hike and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry are weighing heavily on investor sentiment If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession it would definitely have a major impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Furthermore with an interest rate hike announced in December it will likely force the automotive market to reach its limit Additionally with new companies working to produce technologyinfused vehicles such as Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL it is important that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stays ahead of this curve and doesnt fall behind when it comes to technology use

current SP PE ratio of Additionally the company provides investors with a dividend yield of almost While the sluggish start and rumors of a domestic auto sales ceiling it is certainly positive to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>post such great results in February Furthermore with this low valuation I do not see anything in the near term that should weigh heavily on the companys stock and expect the recent rebound to continue Given this low valuation and the longterm optimism with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Im extremely encouraged by the US sales results I am excited about the companys future With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to report stronger topline and bottomline growth going forward in I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and expect the industry to post results similar to Furthermore I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford
