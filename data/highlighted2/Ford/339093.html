News For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Bears <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Bears of both US automakers have been vocal about consumer financing worries This has moved Fords stock markedly lower while the business shows no signs of letting up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F may have just offered us one of the best buying opportunities that we are going to see in the company for quite some time going forward And at todays stock price we still think there is a reason to be bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>if you are a long time dividend oriented investor There has been much doubt over whether or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors NYSE GM are going to recover from the abyss that Mr Market has put them in over the last few weeks as the broader markets have sold off Both companies have been smacked lower on fears that subprime auto lending is a primary driver of the business and that sales saturation in key areas most notably the United States has hit a peak The latest data out of the US refutes that however We take exception to the financing assertions as well pointing out that both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors have only noted in their earnings reports that they are pulling modest levers for incentive selling and aggressive financing We do not think that we are anywhere near the levels that we saw in which is the argument that many investors are trying to make But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bears have an even bigger problem and that is that the cold hard sales data continues to refute their case on a week by week month by month basis Throughout our bullish sentiment on the company we have been checking in with key monthly metrics like European auto sales and domestic auto sales as well as registration data from several countries to try and make sure that our case continued to hold water on the forwardlooking basis We realize that you can only get so much from backward looking conference calls and so we watch this data on a monthtomonth basis to make sure that we dont see any alarming changes to the downside that may show us that the bookcase is stumbling As for domestic sales theyre extremely important and are the backbone of the company Gauging US sales is arguably the most important metric one could look at while the company works towards profitability in other geographies So with regard to a slow down we have seen nothing of the sort Instead we continue to see bullish data with the latest being Februarys US sales data which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>crushed From Seeking Alpha Sales growth by brand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to Lincoln to units Sales growth by model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fiesta to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fusion to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CMAX to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang to <span

style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Edge to Lincoln MKX to Lincoln MKC to Lincoln Utilities to Fords average transaction price YY to via KBB All the while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to see its core backbone of sales in the United States stay firm and robust While this is happening we know that the company is spending significantly in other geographies to try and get the name set up on a global scale Last quarter we saw some signs of progress as for the first time several countries outside of the US showed profitability or numbers that were close to profitability As this bottom line swings in that direction we expect earningspershare to be above expectations for the next few years and we think this will make a point to investors that the stock is undervalued at todays levels And so we are going to continue investing based on this data We continue to believe that Fords dividend which you can lock in at well over right now offers a fantastic opportunity for those looking for longterm investing We also pointed out in our last article a method in which those worried about auto financing can put on a pair trade Essentially you can go out and short CACC which is one of the key players in automobile financing and go long the automobile companies If you are still worried about the subprime auto risk you can put on a pair trade by going long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and by shorting Credit Acceptance Corp an idea that has been tossed around on social media over the last few days CACC is a company that provides automobile dealers financing programs and related products and services that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers It advances money to dealers in exchange for the right to service the underlying consumer loans and buys the consumer loans from the dealers and keeps various amounts collected from the consumers In other words CACC backs all of the auto finance indsutrys loans and would make for a great hedge to short if you are a nervous investor regarding the subprime lending happening in the auto sector Regardless we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bears have a big problem and that is that the data continues to not be on their side Fords guidance for this year was bullish and they met expectations when updated guidance on our last conference call We know that automobile manufacturers traditionally tend to get a lower multiple because of the cyclical nature of the industry but we believe the international backbone that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is starting to put together will give it diversification that will help it whether the cycles over the course of the long term Disclosure Iwe have
