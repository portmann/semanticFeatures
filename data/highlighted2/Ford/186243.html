airplane manufacturers Hexcels products are enjoying a secular increase in use Precision Castparts Corporation NYSE PCP was one of my favorite companies and just as shares were really starting to get cheap Warren Buffett had to spoil the party The stock seems like an unusual pick for a man who built a career buying companies that are easy to understand But you dont need calculus to recognize the attractive economics of PCP First off a passionate CEO who has a reputation for aggressive cost cutting runs the company They also have an attractive position in the value chain of aircraft manufacturing Aircraft manufacturing is a bit like car manufacturing being the final producer is a tough business characterized by low margins Boeing NYSE BA for example has an operating margin of just Thats better than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F which ekes out operating margins Usually the most profitable companies in the car business supply essential inputs to the final manufacturer The same is true in the airplane business PCP which supplied highly engineered components to airplane manufacturers had operating margins of But the appeal isnt limited to high margins The company operates with high barriers to entry Since safety is paramount airline manufacturers need to trust their suppliers nobody is building airplanes with parts supplied by any old schmuck Because relationships are long term manufacturers are unlikely to switch suppliers once one is picked Another benefit is that demand is set by regular maintenance schedulescreating a steady order flow For these reasons the airline parts business is one of my favorite industries to invest in With PCP going private are there any similar opportunities available today One of the best Ive found is a company named Hexcel Corporation NYSE HXL Hexcel is a manufacturer of highly engineered structural material that is used to build military and commercial aircraft wind turbine blades and some consumer goods such as skis and snowboards It is one of the worlds largest producers of carbon fiber and composite materials According to the company Hexcel materials are used on virtually every commercial and military aircraft produced in the western world Their materials are also used to build satellites and satellite launch vehicles highspeed trains and ferries cars trucks tennis rackets and golf clubs Anytime a combination of strength and lightness is needed Hexcel materials could be used Notable planes that use Hexcel materials include the Boeing and the Airbus A XWB The A XWB in particular is a heavy user of carbon fiber materials By weight of the plane is composite material and this contributes to the aircrafts high performance lightweight and fuel efficiency Hexcels material sales for the A XWB and Boeing increased more than in compared to Both aircraft have a deep order pipeline which will creates steady future business A XWBs pictured below Hexcels materials are designed to last the entire life of the aircraft so maintenance is not an important driver of growth Instead growth is driven by the replacement rate of old planes The replacement rate is less tied to the general economy than you may think The retirement rate of civilian aircraft is determined in part by regulatory agencies It is also influenced by the desire of airlines to improve fuel efficiency and payload capability Below is a chart showing the general uptrend of annual deliveries of aircraft by Boeing and Airbus Currently the combined backlog of orders at Boeing and Airbus is planesthe largest backlog in history Every generation of aircraft especially military aircraft uses more composite material than the previous replacing heavy metals Aircraft began using a meaningful amount of advance composites in the s Then the Boeing entered into service with composite materials One of Boeings newest aircraft the B entered into service in with over composite materials by weight Hexcel refers to the expansion of the use of composite materials as the secular expansion of composites Since composite materials reduce weight increase performance and boost fuel efficiency the secular expansion of composites should continue well into the future Financial Results and Expansion Plans Hexcel is nothing if not steady Sales and operating income have grown every year since as the graphic taken from their latest annual report shows One note about salesthey are very concentrated with two customers In and of sales were to Boeing and Airbus respectively In net income rose while adjusted earnings per share grew They spent million to repurchase billion shares and initiated a quarterly dividend Hexcel has fairly large capital expenditures but they are investing to expand production to meet bustling demand From to today they tripled their fiber carbon production capacity They plan to double it again by In they invested million in expanding capacity HXL currently trades at an PE multiple hardly a demanding valuation Business is steady net income sales and operating income are growing and are underpinned by organic growth I consider the company a buy since its products are enjoying a secular increase in use and because it trades at a fair valuation Plus the current backlog at Airbus and Boeing is the largest everequal to over aircraft or nine years of
