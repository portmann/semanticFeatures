dividend increases are planned over the next three years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is projected to grow earnings annually over the next five years yet the company trades at just times forward earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F is the type of stock that is hard to find in this frothy market a highyielding growth stock that is undervalued Due to a decrease in earnings shares have lagged the market significantly For the one year period the stock has managed a return while the SP has gained just over With the introduction of the new F other new models and a strengthened balance sheet with plenty of cash for dividend increases and share buybacks investors seeking value growth and income may want to consider picking up some shares while they are still cheap With robust projected earnings growth over the next five years shares may not stay cheap for long At the heart of my bullish opinion of the stock is the launch of the firstever aluminumalloy body pickup truck the F Sales of this highlysought after truck have been robust This line has been Fords bestselling vehicle year after year The Fseries has been the bestselling vehicle in the United States for years and the countrys bestselling truck for years The iteration in no exception In January the FSeries had its strongest sales month since which was the best sales year ever for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Sales of the pickup are so strong that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has not been able to meet demand The trucks are only staying on dealer lots for an average of days as opposed to an average of days for fullsize light duty pickups Earlier this month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>began production of the F at a second plant in Kansas City The company recently invested billion to expand and retool the plant to accommodate production of the F This is in addition to the Dearborn Michigan truck plant where to date all of the new models have been produced This second plant will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>meet the strong demand In a press release Joe Hinichs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>president for The Americas stated With production starting at Kansas City Assembly we are better poised to start meeting growing customer demand for our pickup The F will be a huge driver of revenue for the company going forward and now the company appears to be equipped to meet the booming demand After an abysmal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and analysts expect much improvement I believe the current share price reflects the pessimism of the recent performance as opposed to the forthcoming growth the company will experience If we look at the stocks current value relative to future growth expectations it is clear that the current share price does not reflect Fords promising future At first glance a PE of nearly times earnings may imply that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is fairly or even richly valued If we look however at next years estimated EPS of we get a forward PE of The stocks average PE for the last five years has been so it is trading at about its average If we apply the companys projected fiveyear EPS growth rate of to the estimate we get projected EPS of If we apply the current multiple of to this earnings figure we get a share price of or roughly a premium to the current share price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>spent billion between and to reduce its debt fund pensions and strengthen its balance sheet The company is expected to now begin using this cash to reward shareholders Stern Agee analyst Michael Ward who has a oneyear price target of a share expects <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to spend billion over the next five years on debt reduction and pensions but close to billion on dividends and share buybacks Over the next three years the dividend is expected to hit cents This renewed commitment to returning value to shareholders bodes well for the companys future share price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>increased its quarterly dividend by in January As a result the stock currently yields based on an annual dividend of cents and the current share price of roughly Based on EPS of cents this equates to a payout ratio north of At first pass this would be a red flag If a company pays out more than of its earnings in the form of dividends then the company is giving shareholders more money than it is making While that is not the case here it is a high payout ratio This is really not a concern Again if we consider the companys improving outlook the current payout ratio becomes irrelevant I believe a more accurate picture is to look forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>obviously has a lot of faith in its future considering the company just upped its dividend in January If we look at the cents in terms of next years projected earnings of we get a payout ratio of which is much more palatable Assuming that the forecast is correct and Fords dividend reaches cents in three years and the third years EPS are that would represent a payout ratio of only The fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is willing to increase the dividend during a time when earnings are down speaks volumes as to managements confidence in future earnings projections One of the major causes of the slowdown in Fords business has been its overseas operations Slowing economies and currency valuation impacted the bottom line significantly The company in its fourth quarter report gave its business environment overview In short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking for the global economy to expand by led by the US and China They are predicting global sales of approximately million units The company believes that European business will improve due to improvements in that regions economies The report also noted that Russia and South America will continue to be a drag on results but that South America will see improvements Finally the company is forecasting a pretax profit of billion to billion in Wall Street seems somewhat optimistic about the companys nearterm future as well Analysts expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to earn EPS in the current year and then EPS in Analyst expect a increase in earnings this year as opposed to the for the industry and a paltry earnings growth for the SP Next year is when the Street expects <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to separate itself from the crowd The company is expected to grow EPS compared to for the industry and for the SP Most importantly analysts expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to grow earnings at an average annual rate of over the next five years This metric alone implies Fords stock is substantially undervalued The following chart illustrates just how undervalued <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is relative to its expected growth and the expected of its industry sector and the overall market As we all know the auto industry is cyclical and sales and profits can all but disappear in an economic downturn Much of Fords optimistic outlook is dependent upon continued economic improvement in the US and Europe as well as continued robust growth in Asia South America will most likely continue to be a drag on Fords results Currency concerns most notably the strengthening dollar and weakening Euro could also limit Fords recovery in Europe Other unknowns such as the publics rejection of Fords new models or a massive recall could greatly impede Fords ability to reach its growth targets <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems to be moving in the right direction The new F is selling faster than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can make them but the new Kansas City plant will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>meet this demand and fatten the companys bottom line <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>launched new models worldwide last year which should help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>regain lost market share The company has spent billions to shore up pensions and pay down debt and is now ready to return cash to shareholders as evidenced by a recent dividend increase Fords shares are undervalued at current levels but with annual projected EPS growth over the next five years they probably wont stay cheap for long The stock should be trading at to a share within the next two years representing a premium to the stocks current price Patient investors can earn a dividend yield while they wait for share price appreciation Source <span
