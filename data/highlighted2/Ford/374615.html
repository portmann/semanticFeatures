Attacks Fords Golden SUV Child Will It Impact Fords Bottom Line <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is unusual in that its mainstream SUV outsells its mainstream sedan unlike companies such as Honda Nissan and Toyota With Fords unusual dependence on the Escape SUV comes exposure to new competent competition Being part of the worlds fifthlargest automaker Kia has sold unusually few Sportage SUVs in the past in relation to its mainstream sedan the Optima To change this in a major product offensive against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Kia is now launching an allnew Germanydesigned Sportage which looks like Porsche Macan If Kia can move its SUVtosedan ratio from to or better like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>it stands to add annual sales in US alone threatening the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape When we think about Fords NYSE F sales success in the US market the Fseries trucks come to mind At in the Fseries constituted of the companys unit sales That Fseries dependency is legitimately impressive of course but also begs the question What about the other of Fords sales Given that the F series is what most people consider to be a large truck that other is mostly cars of which crossovers and SUVs are a part In the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape became Fords bestselling nonF series passenger vehicle outselling all other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sedans hatchbacks SUVs and crossovers If you include the Lincoln sister model the MKC this phenomenon becomes even more accentuated and the Lincoln MKC grew an astounding in the US in The fact that a crossoverSUV outsells sedans and equivalent models is somewhat unique to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Whether at Toyota NYSE TM or Nissan OTCPKNSANY sedans such as Camry and Altima outsold their SUV counterparts RAV and Rogue in In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is indeed in an unusual position It has become dependent on this one particular crossoverSUV model more so than its competitors who still sell more of their equivalent sedans instead On the one hand thats a blessing and a reflection of how superior the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape model has become in the last year Anyone who has driven the model year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape will testify to its superior driving dynamics including steering and handling Auto critic Steve Hammes put it the best in this video review On the other hand the success of the Escape is also making <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>more sensitive to new and improved smalltomidsize SUV competition As I just found out the greatest threat to Fords success story comes from Kia OTCKIMTF the company closely linked to Hyundai OTCHYMLF OTCHYMTF In Kia launched a model year Kia Sportage model which was praised for its exterior design but was not otherwise really competitive with what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been offering in its outstanding Escape most recently In Kia sold only units of the Sportage in the US approximately onesixth as many as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape and Lincoln MKC combined But this is about to change An allnew Kia Sportage will start to arrive in dealerships this month March Consider this While the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape outsold all other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sedans and equivalent in the US in including its direct sedan counterpart the Fusion the Kia Sportage didnt come close to equaling its sedan counterpart the Optima US sales of the Sportage were only onethird of the Optima in This means that if Kia manages to mimic Fords success with the Escape it stands to triple sales of the Sportage SUV This increase might come from Kias own Optima sedan but logically it could also come from the relative crossoverSUV sales leader the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape Yes I know the Honda NYSE HMC CRV and Toyota RAV slightly best the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape in absolute sales numbers but notice the word relative as in relative to their sedanequivalent sales To find out I took the allnew Kia Sportage out for some spirited driving over the mountains and into the deserts of the American West As it turns out this allnew Kia Sportage was nothing like its predecessor Nothing at all For starters it looks a lot different The front of the car now looks a lot like the Porsche Macan which is a much more expensive car starting at The Kia sells for only fully loaded When I tried to equip the Porsche to a similar level I ended up at although Im sure its not possible to line it up perfectly to the millimeter against the Kia In addition of course the Porsche has a more powerful engine horsepower instead of and naturally it offers faster acceleration Still this Kia Sportage is a major step up in looks and sophistication in a way you would never have thought of a Kia product in the past The seats and seating position were perfect Right after the Kia Sportage I jumped into an Audi Q for a few days and thats obviously a much larger SUV but with a price similar to the Porsche Macan Guess what The Kia seats and seating position were better than in the much more expensive and larger Audi Q SUV Similar to the other most recent Kia models the instrumentation is also supremely easy to use The infotainment system is a simple touchscreen no overload of buttons knobs and interface concepts to remotely navigate the screen That horsepower engine two liter four cylinder is good but I didnt think it was any better than the one in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape and it doesnt match the best from VWAudi BMW and Jaguar Land Rover It also drinks gasoline The fully loaded version that I drove is rated at MPG city MPG highway In comparison you can get much larger SUVs that consume equal amounts or slightly less of gasoline Volvo XC MPG city MPG highway Mazda XC launches soon with MPG city MPG highway And the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape achieves MPG city MPG highway in its equivalent fully loaded AWD trim with the liter turbo That said that was also the only flaw I found with the Kia Sportage In every other measure it matches the classleading <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape It even offers Android Auto NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple CarPlay NASDAQ AAPL right now whereas those capabilities arrive on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape only later in calendar year With a very diversified vehicle portfolio as with some other large automakers the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>portfolio includes both laggards and outperformers In recent years the Escape small SUV has been one of Fords success stories Its made it more dependent on this SUV than any of its major competitors who still have sedans as their bestsellers It is therefore critical for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to not lose its grip on this golden child in its SUV portfolio There will be other vehicles in Fords portfolio that underperform In this context this unprecedented offensive by the worlds fourthlargest automaker seeing as HyundaiKia was larger than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in poses an exceptionally welltargeted attack on Fords golden child If Kia can follow Fords relative SUVsedan pattern it would add units per year for the Sportage part of which it stands to take away from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as described above This small but not the smallest SUV segment has become the industrys fastestgrowing and it already has many excellent competitors I view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Kia to now have the two best products in the field with many others right behind including Mazda Hyundai and the segments bestsellers from Honda Toyota and Nissan If you go check out the allnew Kia Sportage you will see why it has a chance to narrow the gap with the segments bestsellers in terms of the sales column Its a design like none other and with an interior to match I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is
