operator today At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Monthly Sales Call All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise After the speakers remarks there will be a questionandanswer session Operator InstructionsThank you Thank you Stephanie Good morning everyone and welcome the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>May sales call Today were joined by Mark LaNeve <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Vice President US Marketing Sales and Service and Bryan Bezold Fords Senior Economist Diving in and taking a look at the numbers Looking at early morning data we estimate industry sales including medium and heavy trucks totaled about million vehicles for the month of May This number would translate into a decline of about producing an industry SAAR in the mid million vehicle range for the month At retail we estimate that the overall industry came in at about million vehicles which would translate to a May retail SAAR in the high million vehicle range This is likely about lower than last year due to a four weekend month in May of this year versus a five weekend month for May of Taking a look at some of the segment trends small SUVs I mean what can you say they just continue to grow and May wasnt any exception to that They represented more than of the industry retail industry for the first time ever This is about a point and half higher than the segments strong performance at this time last year The other standout segment continues to be full size pickup which represented more than of the industry in May and this was about a point higher than a year ago This time of the year is no generally so favorable to SUVs and pickups as they tend to be more second half performers but certainly were seeing a lot of strength early on for both segments The spring months historically though are more conducive to car sales but the midsize sedan segment came in at just under of the industry in May and thats about two points lower than year ago So were still continuing to see a lot of rotation out of cars into SUVs Finishing things up small cars are operating at just a little over of the industry and were down about a point from this time a year ago So with that Im going to turn things over to Mark And Mark is going to give you some more color on what happened at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the month of May Great Thank you Erich and good morning everyone Hard to believe its June already and we all appreciate you being with us on the call today Lets get into some of the numbers At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company our sales for the month totaled vehicles representing a decline versus a year ago We estimate our performance was better than the overall industry average while showing a improvement in average transaction pricing relative to a year ago which shows good pricing performance in the market continuing Largely a big chunk of this is due to stronger mix of SUVs and trucks FSeries in particular produced another strong increase up last month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Vans had their best May sales results in years while Lincoln continued its momentum delivered its sixth straight month of sales gains thanks to its new product Lets first go a little deeper into pickup trucks and in vans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>FSeries totaled pickups for the month This brings our yeartodate increase for FSeries to over yearonyear with pickups sold through the five months making it our best start in a decade Truck segmentation has been favorable this year As Erich mentioned were wellpositioned going into the second half Commercial vans have been a strong story for us that continued in May and continue to work in conjunction with FSeries to drive our overall Built <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Tough truck sales even higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>commercial vans had their best May sales performance since I think graduated high school I graduated in Okay So we had our sales performance in with vehicles sold Trend continues to come from our Transit van that reported increase over a year ago with vans sold Plus with our all new F and F medium duty which achieved a increase with our overall truck sales again as I mentioned up And with our FSeries and our vans in addition to the strong retail performance these products in particular have led the strong yearoveryear gain in both our commercial and government business We saw that in May and weve seen it steadily all year long We had strong commercial and government increases both May and calendar yeartodate Getting into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>SUVs weve sold so far this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>brand SUVs through May Were having a record just like FSeries a record first five months start to the year with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>brand SUVs up The new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escape hit dealers last month helping to boost the Escape sales with Escapes sold last month and anytime were over Escapes thats a strong month for us The stronger Escape sales were seeing for the Titanium up level model which is turning on dealer launch in just days Titanium is our top model in the series and represents about onethird of Escape sales Moving on to Lincoln and other really strong story we saw a increase in May Were getting excellent sales of our allnew Lincoln MKX which was up in May with vehicles sold Through May calendar yeartodate Lincoln sales have increased and thats compared to a luxury segment thats been relatively flat this year So strong performance from the Lincoln brand And were particularly pleased that how well were doing in the coastal areas of the country thats the boost in part to the new Lincoln MKX where sales are up in our Southeast market area and showed an gain in the West market area We are just starting to roll out the new Lincoln MKZ looks great and we look forward to tracking its performance throughout the year along with the allnew Lincoln Continental that will come later this year which were all excited about So thats a quick look at May And Ill turn it over to Bryan for an update on the economic front Thanks Mark and good morning everyone US economic conditions particularly the household sector remained broadly supportive of industry sales at the current run rate Todate the labor market continues its gradual recovery producing both job and income gains for households Although the price of oil has risen over the last three months it still remains at a low level with retail gasoline prices still down on a yearoveryear basis And consumer confidence is at a level consistent with continued economic growth The second estimate of first quarter GDP showed growth at a annual rate down from in the fourth quarter but up from the initial estimate of Weakness in investment and exports partially offset growth in personal consumption spending and residential construction This highlights the contrast between a relatively healthy household sector and a business sector that was negatively impacted by a strong dollar and low oil prices in much of the quarter Of course first quarter GDP growth is a backward looking indicator at this point in time Some more recent incoming data includes the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index which rose to an month high of in May as consumers view of both present and future economic conditions improved The share of respondents supporting that it was a good time to buy a car was up percentage points to which was the highest since January The labor market continues to generate improving job and income growth that is supportive of household spending New claims for unemployment insurance have risen over the last month but to a low level with the fourweek moving average of new claims at Average hourly earnings rose yearonyear in April continuing a gradual upward trend weve observed over the past year and a half During April on an inflation adjusted basis disposable personal income rose and personal consumption expenditures rose for March Every major indicator of housing performance including permits starts and in home sales new home sales and existing home sales improved in April as compared with March The May manufacturing PMI rose points to staying above the expansion threshold of for the third straight month As Erich mentioned earlier we see the May SAAR in the mid million unit range in line with our industry guidance of million to million units including medium and heavy trucks Thank you Bryan So taking care of some housekeeping items taking a look at the gross stock for the month of May May cars we had cars in gross stock trucks utilities giving us a total for the month of vehicles This translates into day supply Comparing that to April of we had cars trucks SUVs giving us a total of vehicles translating into day supply Comparing the number to May of a year ago gross stock for cars was trucks were and SUVs were and that translated into a total of vehicles this gave us at a time days supply Taking a look at our fleet for the month if we take a look at our fleet as a percentage of our total sales for the month of May fleet was of our total sales commercial represented government represented and daily rental represented of our total sales for the month of May Comparing this to May a year ago fleet as a percentage of our total sales was commercial was government was and daily rental as a percentage of our total sales was last year Turning to calendar yeartodate if we look at fleet as a percentage of our total sales calendar yeartodate through May of was commercial was government was and daily rental was Comparing this to May a year ago calendar yeartodate fleet as a percentage of our total sales was commercial was government was and daily rental was So with the housekeeping items now out of the way Stephanie were going to turn things over to start answering some questions And we will take first block of calls from the analysts please So look I just this tends a little bit the production question if indeed you are kind of tracking I guess you said like I think you said mids on a total so call it like low s So you are kind of flat to slightly down I think yeartodate But inventories on the other hand are up And I know that you still have like a weird comp issue potentially from the FSeries from last year so may be some of that But does that position you to have to adjust production at all either this quarter or how does that calculation or consideration work Is that may be something you only decide to do once we are through the summer selling season or are we in a position where we might have to kind of taper off production just given it seems were coming at a little bit slower than may be people thought Thank you Pat Without getting all the details that weve covered on numerous calls about the difference in our inventory position on FSeries in particular versus a year ago when we were ramping up and of course this year we also have the Super Duty that were converting over through later in the year so were carrying a little bit of additional inventory there We are always going to adjust supply to demand were on record saying that thats the way were going to run the business But if you really look at the macro numbers the industry is up actually SAAR wise if it comes in at at couple hundred thousand units over a year ago so it is up marginally And the year the way played out last year was SAAR strengthened throughout the gear actually ran at in the first quarter and ended up with for the year So we think were in good inventory position certainly would rather have available inventory across our dealers in the various configurations especially with FSeries and our vans which are complicated products than to be short as we were much last year And so we like where we sit right now but we will always adjust the demand based on market conditions Any color on the SAARs this month was there any unusual factors to have come in a bit weaker than last month and bit weaker than expectations and may be any color in particular on the Memorial Day weekend thats lower is that potentially a factor on the weekend Colin Memorial Day weekend was pretty strong I mean we closed the month up pretty strong had a good last weekend call it four five days Friday through to the close yesterday across really cars trucks and SUVs You have the calenderizatin which had affect between April and May April was a five weekend month and May was a four weekend month I dont want to over talk that or over think that But May a year ago you have was five weekend you had Memorial Day on the fourth weekend which as we know is a strong selling weekend and a week later you close the month which you always have a big weekend when you close the month I am not reading too much into the April May the April ran a little stronger And May from a SAAR position versus a year ago little weaker but some things happen when you are into a very strong industry And we closed really well And do you expect the SAAR to improve in the second half of the year You mentioned that happened last year is that part of your expectation Im not the economist in the room but Im the sales guys so Im an optimist So obviously were hoping for improvement in the SAARs We work our way through the year That is exactly what happened last year The economic backdrop I talk with the dealers about this all the time When needs would be low its still low unemployment interest rates gas prices when needs would be high its still high consumer confidence the housing market is nowhere near to historic highs average age of the vehicles on the road is still over years average age of pickups half of them on the road are over years So lots of reason to believe that weve got a very strong industry to run at Okay And lastly any color on your performance in the car segment Do you think you lost share there and any rationale maybe it was pricing in that segment more aggressive than normal any color there broadly Our market share on Fusion has held very steady going back really time Ive been in job which is and has been incredibly steady Segmentation of moving passenger cars into SUVs and into some extended pickup trucks is now very strong fiveyear trend with no indication of slowing down anytime soon So the passenger car side of market is getting hit by segmentation trends which are really consumer preference trends And to some extent that really plays into Fords wheelhouse because were incredibly strong in SUV and truck and van part of the market The first one on crossovers I know weve seen a tremendous mix shift from cars to crossovers Im just wondering if you could comment on the competitive dynamics within the space It seems like a very saturated and fragmented market And we have more capacity coming on line weve already seen some pricing pressure emerge I mean I think Q pricing was down So do you see anything which could keep prices steady in the segment near or midterm and I mean does mix get any richer what helps that segment I think Dan that consumer preference right now is whats really driving the segment If you think about in a very simplistic level with crossovers SUVs you get the higher eating ph position you gave great visibility you get great utility generally speaking very good all weather performance which is important to many customers great safety features And now not that long ago customers had to make tradeoffs in terms of fuel economy ride and handling characteristics technology some safety features And now in our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>SUV lineup they dont have to make any of those tradeoffs You get excellent fuel climb we have all the technology And so we see this as a continuing trend Our research indicates that baby boomers age prefer these vehicles At the same time the millennials starting to eventually get married and have families they prefer these vehicles So we think that there is great buoyancy currently in the market thats obviously showing up in the numbers and that continues for a number of years And splintering and leading into new segments is always happens in the car business And we think that were going to continue to see new segments emerge with more SUV type characteristics versus more crossover characteristics And were on record at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that were going to be entering with overall new nameplates in the SUV category over the next four years So we plan to fully participate in that growth Okay Thank you And then one followup just on the pickup side obviously very strong pickups for large very strong ATPs for large pickups And I think your ATPs are not far off your historical highs as best as I can tell Just wondering in terms of F would you say that your mix is normalized where youd expected Any sense of today what your mix looks like versus three F changeover visvis high level trim vehicles or richer mix variants such as crew cabs Great question Last year we ran an incredibly rich mix with the start up of the allnew F So we are to a large extent at a much more normalized level But in general over matter of several years not just the previous F to the current weve seen increasing consumer preference for higher content load feature load in the vehicles and higher trim series So its slightly higher than I would say over historical five sixyear pattern But last year was just abnormally high mix just based on the cadence of the plants coming up on which configuration they could build which were early on largely our King Ranch and up level variant and up level vehicles Just two questions First I was just curious I mean I dont think its impacting you that much but it might be to some extent these stop sale orders that are going across the industry for the kind of airbag and potentially some of the recalls Just curious what kind of an impact you think thats having on your sales or really more importantly overall sales and if you maybe benefitting from that It sounds like its almost to hickey on total sales from what were hearing And then the second question is as we look at the BEA adjustment factors for calculating the SAAR it seems a little bit wacky because if you look at the seasonally adjusted yearoveryear change in sales it sounds like its going to be about flat And last year the SAAR in May was and now were talking about on a light vehicle basis Now were talking about light vehicle SAAR thats going to be close to or just above million units So its kind of really deflating the month in a sort of an unfair way it seems So just curious if you could comment on the stop sale and what you think is going on with BEA seasonal factors On the second part Ill let Erich comment on the overall SAAR but I can tell you that itd be impossible for me to quantify <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>certainly for the industry and even before the impact of all the activity thats related to the Takata airbags I could tell you that we discussed with our dealers frequently because our desire is to make sure that we answer customers questions that we take care of our customers that we have really strong notification policies in place and do everything possible to remedy those situations out there So our dealers do a heck of a job on whats been an uncomfortable situation for the industry where we continue to try to take care of these issues as quickly as we can I dont know Erich if you want to comment on the SAAR Sure In terms of the SAAR we see somewhat of the similar thing that youre seeing John I mean SAAR is not perfect as you well know So if we just take a look at the industry and where it is running before we got on the call we were chatting a little bit and we look at yeartodate the industry is up about is what we believe its up about yeartodate over a record year of last year So we still think the industry is quite healthy Thank you Stephanie were going to take one more call from the analysts then were going to change over to the folks in the media please Good So I just had a quick housekeeping question I apologize if I missed it before but just kind of wondering can you give some color with regards to the large pickup ATPs for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the industry and maybe some incentive trends that have been progressing for that segment as well Sure We can do that So if you take a look at the overall industry Justin the industry in terms of incentive spend on a yearoveryear basis is up about to And if we take a look at it sequentially compared to April this is up about so not really material If we look at the ATPs it tells a bit of a different story The ATPs seem to be doing quite well So for the industry its up about overall for the industry And sequentially of course the data isnt seasonally adjusted but sequentially its down just a skosh about or so When you take a look at got to get my FSeries here in front of me if you give me just a moment So if we take a look at FSeries incentives were up about last month versus May of and approximately its about per truck compared with April FSeries incentives were up about If you take a look at our average transaction prices they ran at about per truck last month and that was down just slightly compared to April by about So what youre seeing in some of that on yearoveryear basis is that last year at this time we had virtually we were are running on fumes on FSeries stocks So we had really pulled back on our incentive spend And thats what youre seeing in the yearoveryear change That concludes the analyst portion of the call Well now be moving into the media portion Operator Instructions Your first question comes from the line of Christina Rogers with The Wall Street Journal Hi guys Thanks for taking our questions I was wondering Mark can you talk a little bit about the cadence to the month I mean did you see kind of showroom traffic start also in pickup or vice versa I mean how did that play out And also are you hearing from your dealers that they are having to do a little more to kind of attract shoppers into dealership are you hearing any kind of step up effort from that front from your dealers Great question Christina The month was a lot like every month they are all competitive One of the things about this business you miss it when you leave it which I did for a couple of years is its a hypercompetitive business So there hasnt ever been a month thats felt like easy street ph to me in indiscernible some years I could tell you that But the month played out fairly normally was steady through the first part with a strong Memorial Day close I think typically for the industry do a pretty big chunk of the business in the last seven eight days of May depending where Memorial Day falls last year being exception because it felt in the fourth week And our dealers are continuing to compete We talk to them extensively about what we need to do get better particularly on our overall customer experience and simplifying our configurations and our offers in the marketplace making it easier to shop online But Ill get to the answer to your question I am not trying to avoid it Is always been competitive and were always striving to do better on behalf of the dealers and our customers Not anymore so than I would have seen in the months of that business job Its been really competitive And youll see may be a little more where there will be some regional incentives that will pop up where little bit more regional activity where competitors might be attacking certain geographic area we do the same thing frankly on a selective basis but nothing abnormal to what Ive seen for the past a year and a half Hi good morning I saw in your car inventory numbers that youve given gone from in February down each month since than three months in a row down to meanwhile your car sales have gone down quite a bit as well How are you doing that I guess is that just how much youve cut production in some of those models or are you spending more from Hermosillo and Flat Rock to other markets or how are you doing both at the same time Nick its more a matter of the segmentation that were seeing so far this year is pretty much what we plan So its not a matter so much matter of cutting production is where we are running our production facilities more or less to the plan which was weve increased shift of our overall production increased in utilities and trucks and planned lower levels on cars And you might have to make some tweaks here and there based on near term sales but there hasnt been anything and you havent seen from us any kind of dramatic adjustments This has been planned for through a very extensive process And segmentation is played out pretty much as we predicted may be little weaker in CD cars and little stronger in some of the SUV and truck categories but pretty much as we saw the as we saw the market and weve put a business plan together say six months ago Okay And when you look at those car segments and incentives in there I know theyve gotten high in the industry in some of those segments How do you approach that when you dont want to be incentivizing people away from your SUVs into those cars necessarily but you still want to keep those cars moving We have a very purposeful process driven by a high degree of analytics in terms of our overall incentive spend which is part of our whole pricing or market equation And we try to be competitive for each of our car lines on transaction price MSRP our APR offers to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit our leasing programs to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit with a market basket of key competitors and we strive to be competitive and be very efficient in the marketplace but provide great value for the customers and thats the way we do our business and plan our incentive spend And were going to continue to do it I just want to ask sort of a little bit of a step back question During the recession Alan Mulally added cars to the lineup and now you have difficult times selling them I am just wondering if your lineup is in balance with the market or if you have too many cars in the lineup Keith primarily from a volume standpoint were focused on Fusion So I think if you look across the industry thats I wouldnt call it too many cars in lineups We have Fiesta and we have Taurus that are important vehicles for us but operate more in whats become niche part of the markets And we have very competitive car lineup But however many years ago when they were filling out the portfolio I mean things changed So we really like where we stand with cars but we are very happy with where we are positioned from both the portfolio and favorable opinion and just what I call power market presence with our SUV truck and van lineup And right now thats what consumers want So thats where were leaning in in terms of future additional products at least in the nearterm because as we said were going to be adding four SUVs in the next four years Hi guys Thanks So one last question sorry its another question on segmentation Im just interested and whether you think that the volumes were seeing in the car segment we just had a fall Is this suggesting a new normal in the years ahead the level that were starting to see The best way I can equate that Megan is roughly five years ago six years ago passenger cars were about of the overall industry Last year I believe they were this year its looking like close to Do we see that rate of decline slowing a little bit Yes But we dont see it stopping I can tell you that So however that ends up equating into the monthly numbers is how its going to equating into monthly numbers were going to continue to try to compete and gain share in passenger cars But certainly in the end the consumers are boss and theyre deciding where they want to put their hard earned dollars And were certainly going to put our investment and lineup our portfolio that way Thank you very much Stephanie and its pleasure working with you today And thank you everyone for joining the call Well look forward to talking to you again next month when we report June sales And until then everyone have a great month Thank you very much Thank you This concludes todays conference You may now disconnect Copyright policy All transcripts
