no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in F over the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to work toward international profitability in key markets like China India and Europe Company announced yesterday it is moving out of Japan and Indonesia This is not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>calling it quits on international expansion its the company being strategic and focusing on the areas that matter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is a company that we have been watching for the better part of the last year We have continued to make the bull case over and over that the company is going to be able to ramp up its bottom line after it begins to successfully complete some of its international expansion efforts The company has spent the last few years making serious efforts to expand into places like Europe China and India which are largely populous areas where the company can produce the volume necessary to turn a nice profit In places like China not only is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investing in factories and infrastructure but they are also pouring money into investments for the next line of smart vehicles including a commitment of over billion made in for this purpose In places like India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is simply working on creating a low cost smaller vehicle at a lower price that you can use to penetrate Indias automobile market China wants high class luxury and technology in their vehicles and India just wants a method of transportation for the lowest possible cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been tailoring their advertising and product especially in China to reach the target markets and appeal to each countrys citizens Here in the United States <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a wellknown American automaker They are known for being in operation over years they are known for their signature F series trucks and Mustangs and most recently they are known as being the only auto manufacturer that did not take money from the bail out in International expansion is extremely important Its one of the only ways that we think the companys going to be able to boost its bottom line We think the company has nice saturation domestically in the United States and that sales in the US continue to act as a great backbone for the company that is trying to spread itself further across the globe What this told us is that the companys moves outside of the United States are going to directly predicate whether or not the company can be a more profitable entity than it is now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shareholders have been waiting for a long time to see the stock move out of the range but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been unable to do whats necessary to make this happen and in what seemed like an act of semi futility regarding the stock they issued a special dividend recently This was just after we commended the company for conserving capital and spending it on investing in itself Regardless it was in the news this morning that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is moving out of Japan and Indonesia Many on social media were quick to point out that this looks like a very negative headline that was indicative of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>contracting globally We think that this is anything but When it comes down to it the amount being spent in these two countries versus the resultant sales that were being generated made it obvious that the automaker was going to have to make some tough decisions This Reuters article lays out the inefficiencies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will exit all areas of business including shuttering dealerships and stopping sales and imports of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Lincoln vehicles according to an email from Asia Pacific President Dave Schoch to all employees in the region viewed by Reuters Product development carried out in Japan will be shifted elsewhere Unfortunately this also means that our team members based in Japan and Indonesia will no longer work for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Japan or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Indonesia following the closures Schoch wrote in an email regarding the decision that was sent to employees on Monday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>one of Detroits big three automakers follows in the footsteps of General Motors Co GMN which last year decided to stop making GMbranded cars in Indonesia with the loss of jobs amid intense competition from Japanese rivals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>began operating in Japan in and has dealerships in the country employing people Last year it sold around vehicles in Japan and held a share of around percent of the imported new car market In Indonesia where it entered the market in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a staff of and sells through franchised dealerships Last year it sold around vehicles taking a percent share of the total new car market in a country struggling from economic slowdown In Indonesia without local manufacturing theres just really no way that automakers can compete in that market and we do not have local manufacturing said a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>spokeswoman based in Shanghai confirming the content of the email What are the three most important things in becoming a global profitable automaker Location location location Cutting the outside fat off of Fords international operations is one of the most important things the company can manage while trying to expand into other geographies We definitely dont see this as the end of the company expanding globally but we do see it as a strategic shift for the company to focus on the geographies that are going to make it the most money Again this means renewed focus on China India and Europe There are more than enough opportunities in each of these three markets to help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continue to be a international powerhouse Spending associated with these locales should start to finally tail off in the coming quarters as promised investments are made and delivered and the outlook for these geographies should simply be on production and sales We said in a previous article that we were not too worried about Chinas stock market collapse affecting sales afford vehicles Many of the indications we got so far this earnings season from people like Howard Schultz at Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX are that the Chinese middle class consumer is in better shape than the stock market makes it look We continue to listen to earnings commentary and have not found anything yet overtly negative about the Chinese consumer that will give us worry in China Not to mention that Fords performance in both China and Europe have both been decent You can look at our last few articles on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>here where we have laid out some recent sales metrics that the company has posted to end At todays levels we would be happily reinvesting our dividends from purchases made at a higher cost basis We said in our last article that we would be looking to add shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>once again to our portfolio and we may do that as soon as this week The yield is safe and continues to look attractive and we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock will see an upswing again Until that time we have no problem reinvesting are dividends and gobbling up shares at lower prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>made it through and we are confident that they will make it through this correction we are having to start Tagged Investing Ideas Consumer Goods
