style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>introduces the redesigned Taurus overseas The Taurus once American commonplace in the world of automobiles is looking to make a comeback in densely populated China where theres a demand for American luxury Large sedans being sold in China today are luxuries and there is a gap there between luxury brands and popular brands Thats where were aiming this car at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>China Chairman and CEO John Lawler source The legacy of the Taurus goes back years It was once the sedan to own in the US before it was dethroned by the Camry If you dont want to take our word for it flip on a couple of old episodes of any s or s TV show Tauruses were everywhere They were also the vehicle of choice of most bad guys a true sign that youve made it big and have become the generic option for your country Were once again focused on the Taurus not because we think its going to dominate again in the US but because of what it could possibly do for our investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F by becoming popular overseas This works into the same plan that we laid out as to why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could be trying to push the Lincoln Continental overseas We think it marks the continued rebirth of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>name and brand to a number of younger generations While some consumers that were fans of the brand likely never dissented from it the lot that shunned the brand during the crisis will start to notice that things are again picking up We think its going to help a global shift in how people think about luxury automobiles While GMs NYSE GM Cadillac brand has a timeless feel to it especially because of its ageless logo and cool factor Buick and Lincoln havent done well to keep American luxury on the map Buick is undergoing a shift to a sportier vehicle but we believe the brand is stuck spinning its wheels Lincoln has a real chance to reignite a spark for those who consider luxury to only be European This can help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>obviously but it can also help the US domestic auto sellers grow quicker overseas Over the weekend at the Shanghai Auto Show <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>debuted its new Taurus sedan The days of the gas guzzler are slowly fading here in the US While in the US bigger cars like the Taurus and the Lincoln Continental have fallen out of favor and been replaced by gas friendly smaller vehicles and luxury SUVs big cars still need lovin too and theyre getting it in China Heres the stats on that from a Reuters article According to research firm IHS Automotive Chinas market for large sedans has overtaken the United States with sales of around million last year topping the million sold in the US By IHS expects that gap to have widened to million large sedans in China and million in the US A number of our past pieces have speculated that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to find success with the Lincoln luxury brands and bigger vehicles in China This represents killing two birds with one stone for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>theyre breathing new life back into American luxury vehicles and theyre entering the globes most densely populated country in doing so The target audience in China is going to be upper class citizens who seek American luxury and business people looking to travel with a conservative design in spacious quarters So far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been meeting the goals its setting for itself and investors in China They met expectations in And have continued to show promising results You can read more about the companys auto sales domestically and internationally by looking through our catalogue of articles over the last few months here Theres also such a huge opportunity for growth in the Asia Pacific market this chart from shows you how meaningful growth in either Asia South America or Europe could truly be for the business These profit centers when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gets them working will be what bring the stock up over the resistance area the stock is holding At a yield we have all of the patience one would need to wait for Fords plans to play out China just represents one part of Fords business thats going to continue to expand via global footprint We think coupled with the companys new investment in Mexico and continued brand prestige in the US good things are ahead for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Recently we wrote about Fords continued investment in itself and innovation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>makes conventional and hybrid <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fiestas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fusions and Lincoln MKZ models in Mexico We were happy with the companys plans to continue developing in Mexico Mexico is a big part of Fords business They started investing there in where its central Mexico plant was pumping out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fiestas The advantages of doing business in Mexico are the cheap labor trade agreements and no need to cross oceans to get there Over the weekend those plans were finally confirmed by the company We are long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F and consider the stock to be very undervalued in both the short and the longterm With a yield of we dont mind keeping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in our portfolio while we wait for the catalysts that we think are going to drive it higher The stock has been a futile exercise to be invested in but we think thats all going to change when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>gets things going globally The Taurus unveiling combined with investments in innovation overseas show that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is on the right track We like the dividend yield but would be remiss if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was focusing too much on giving back to shareholders here We want them reinvesting in the business The new F is going to show shareholders and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>followers exactly what innovation can do for a business As weve repeatedly said we know that the bottom line is going to suffer in the short term But we trust that the rising capex is going to be indicative not of a short term pop but of a long term reestablishment of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as a global presence hopefully one that will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continue to be a sound investment for lifetimes to come not just the near future during a market top We added <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to our dividend portfolio two weeks ago We dont mind collecting the companys attractive yield while we wait for the rest of the market to see the value we
