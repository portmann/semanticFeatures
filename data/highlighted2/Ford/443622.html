Pool Short Volume Just Quadrupled For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Although most stocks were down in the wake of Brexit on Friday not many saw spikes as high as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in dark pool shorting The volume of dark pool shorting in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was x normal on Friday If you were unfazed by Fridays drop in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F consider the automated email we received from SqueezeMetrics that day Looks like there was some unusual dark pool activity in some of the tickers you follow Dark pools for readers who may be unfamiliar with the term are private exchanges where institutions trade shares without the transparency of public markets This enables them to place large block trades away from frontrunners and other predatory traders on public exchanges Seeking Alpha contributor SqueezeMetrics elaborated on how dark pools work and why investors should pay attention to them in an article earlier this year Seeking Alpha In The Dark After seeing that email from SqueezeMetrics I signed on to their site and pulled up the chart below The red part of the histogram represents the volume of dark pool shorting and you can see how that spiked on June th A question that may come to mind for readers is whether this was in some way related to Brexit after all most stocks plummeted after the vote Thats true but bear in mind that dark pool short interest didnt spike for most stocks on Friday We follow dozens of widelyheld stocks on Squeeze Metrics and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was one of only two to see a large spike in dark pool interest that day the other was Citigroup NYSE C which had a x spike If youre long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and are still generally bullish on it but you want to limit your downside risk in light of the spike in short interest well look at two ways of hedging it over the next several months below If youd like a refresher on hedging terms first please see the section titled Refresher On Hedging Terms in this previous article of ours Locking In Gold Gains Were going to use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge FB below but you dont need the app to do this You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if youre willing to take the time and do the work Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app an additional piece of information youll need to supply along with the number of shares youre looking to hedge when scanning for an optimal put is your threshold which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purpose of the examples below weve used a threshold of If you are less riskaverse you could use a larger one All else equal the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge Here are the optimal puts as of Fridays close to hedge shares of F against a greaterthan drop by midDecember As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value A couple of points about this cost To be conservative the cost was based on the ask price of the put In practice you can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and ask The threshold includes this cost ie in the worstcase scenario your F position would be down not including the hedging cost The threshold is based on the intrinsic value of the puts so they may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near term when the puts may still have significant time value When scanning for an optimal collar youll need another number in addition to your threshold your cap which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly One starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge you dont think the security is going to do better than that anyway so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that We checked Portfolio Armors website to get an estimate of Fs potential return over the next several months Every trading day the site runs two screens to avoid bad investments on every hedgeable security in the US and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return For didnt pass though so we used the potential return implied by the median month Wall Street price target shown below via Yahoo Finance which was about As of Fridays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of F against a greaterthan drop by midDecember while not capping an investors upside at less than As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the put leg is the same as in the optimal puts above so the cost is the same or of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was or of position value So the net cost of this optimal collar was or of position value A few notes on this hedge Similar to the situation with the optimal puts to be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls in practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask So in reality an investor would likely have paid less than when opening this collar This hedge may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near future due to time value for an example of this see this recent article on hedging Apple However if the underlying security spikes in the near future time value can have the opposite effect making it costly to exit the position early for an example of this see this article on hedging Facebook Facebook Rewards Cautious Investors Less Sometimes optimal collars eliminate most or all of the cost of hedging Not so here If you have a higher risk tolerance and a more modest potential return estimate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>you may want to try scanning for a less expensive hedge by using a higher threshold and a lower cap Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
