</span>is a significant area to understand for natural gasoriented investors In this article I dig into the governments data regarding production and forecast what output should look like by yearend What I discovered is that if something doesnt change fast we should see production fall materially in the region this year which is bullish news for investors In the past Ive written articles regarding the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the oil production trend that weve seen coming out of the region However I have yet to analyze the amount of natural gas to come from the area and to see what the production trend of that commodity should look like moving forward Now after having the opportunity to dig into the data from the EIAs Energy Information Administrations Drilling Productivity Report and after recognizing the massive drop in rig count in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Ive concluded that if nothing changes fairly soon we can expect a significant drop in output throughout this year a move that should be bullish for longterm investors in this space Located along the southern and eastern portions of Texas the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the thirdlargest region for the production of natural gas in the US behind the Marcellus and the Permian and the secondlargest for the production of oil behind the Permian As one of the most prolific regions in the industry it has commanded a great deal of attention and investment from companies extracting these products but as the price of both oil and natural gas plummeted over the past year and a half the drilling activity there has fallen like a rock In the image below you can see where the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is located relative to the six other major energyproducing regions in the country In the table below you can see that time hasnt been so kind to the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>especially when stacked up against rivals like the Permian and Haynesville both of which have seen their natural gas output rise between December of and what the EIA Energy Information Administration believes will be the production level of each area in March of this year Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report If you think that these declines are bad wait to see what the picture looks like moving forward However before I get to that I need to touch on the core assumptions I had to make to get me to my final conclusion Using historical data from the EIA I previously forecasted in my Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>article regarding oil that rig counts will fall by seven units per month Ive had to make some adjustments due to recent news but I am sticking to that starting with a total of units for the month of February and moving down in the months to come I know this may sound like a harsh assumption but given the current price of natural gas its only a matter of time before more rigs come offline The next assumption I had to make regarding the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>involves the change in drilling rig productivity over time In the graph below you can see the historical trend that rig productivity has taken on a monthtomonth basis Overall there seems to be a great deal of volatility here but the general path has been toward lower improvements in productivity almost every month since last May with the EIA forecasting the MarchtoApril productivity level at Recognizing the significant disparities that can exist however I will use an estimate of for now with the intention of lowering that in the future if the EIAs forecasts turn out to be accurate Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report Finally I had to make some assumptions regarding decline rates in the region In the graph below you can see what the picture has looked like for every month since January of data doesnt go back any further than that Right now the trend seems to be moving higher into the upper range but Ive had instances in the past where the EIA has revised these numbers lower a month or so out Because of this uncertainty I will look at a conservative scenario whereby decline rates will average each month a moderate scenario whereby they will average per month and a liberal scenario whereby we can expect decline rates to be per month Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report Now that we have these three base assumptions its possible to create a realistic forecast regarding the future of natural gas production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In the table below you can see the results of my analysis which indicate that regardless of which of the three scenarios I adopted natural gas production in the region should fall quite meaningfully thanks largely to my forecast for rig counts in the months to come If the EIAs data is accurate and my assumptions are spoton investors should anticipate production in the region to come out to between Mcf per day and Mcf per day by December of this year Source Created by author with data from the EIAs Drilling Productivity Report In the next table you can see what this looks like when you stack my estimates up to what happened in December of Based on the data provided the conservative scenario should see production fall by about yearoveryear Meanwhile the moderate and liberal estimates yield expected declines in total output of and respectively Right now Mr Market is very bearish regarding natural gas but I have a hard time understanding why Yes we are experiencing a bit of a glut at the moment though I believe those fears have been overblown but production in some key areas should take a heck of a beating if rig counts continue to fall andor if rig productivity levels dont soar sometime soon One of the main areas to watch for clues regarding future output is the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which is likely to experience some of the most significant declines Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article
