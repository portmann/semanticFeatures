Oil Prices Will Continue To Drive US Auto Sales Seeking Alpha Low oil prices and low gasoline prices have left consumers with more discretionary spending This is leading to more miles driven and higher US auto sales US auto sales have been skewed toward higher light truck volumes Since these vehicles carry higher profit margins US automaker earnings are likely to continue to grow Shares of GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should trade higher thanks to favorable auto trends Both companies trade with low PE multiples and both pay attractive dividend yields Tesla Motors is more likely to be hurt by lower gasoline prices as there is less incentive to switch to an electric vehicle Plus Tesla is already expensive and risky Over the past months the dramatic decline in oil prices has led to material shifts in the global economy One area that should see significant growth related to lower oil prices is the US auto market Today were going to take a look at three major US auto makers to see how lower oil prices should affect sales Lower Gasoline Prices And US Consumers Its hard to overstate the importance of the longterm decline in the price of oil High levels of production from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries coupled with shale oil and gas production in the US has caused WTI crude oil prices to drop more than from a high above to the current level near While the relationship between oil and gasoline prices isnt always perfectly correlated low input costs and high gasoline inventories has caused the price of gasoline to decline alongside oil Lower consumer spending on gasoline has acted as an unofficial stimulus program giving US households more flexibility with their budgets Initially lower gasoline prices did not directly lead to additional retail spending Economists believed that consumers were instead using their gas savings to pay down debt and increase savings But recently new data has pointed to some key changes in consumer habits which show that savings at the pump are translating to changes in consumer behavior For starters lower gasoline prices has led to a new record high for miles driven by Americans This is important for auto manufacturers because a widespread increase in mileage should lead to more wear and tear on existing vehicles on the road which ultimately should boost demand for new cars and trucks At the same time lower gasoline prices have left more cash available for consumers to buy new cars And that cash is showing up in auto sales this year It is important to note that light truck sales have been particularly strong This makes sense because with lower gasoline prices it is cheaper to own SUVs and other vehicles that fit into the light truck category Consumer taste appears to be transitioning to this category of autos thanks to lower operating expenses Of course truck and SUV sales are more profitable for US automakers because these vehicles typically carry higher gross margins So today automakers are enjoying a trend of higher sales and a product shift towards highermargin vehicles This trend has the potential to drive stronger profits and higher stock prices over the next several years Below are some thoughts on three key US automakers in light of this important consumer trend Shares of General Motors NYSE GM have rebounded sharply over the last few months thanks to a deferredprosecution agreement with the US government GM paid million in fines on top of about billion in costs associated with the companys ignition switch fiasco While this issue was a dark mark on GMs reputation both for consumers and investors It now appears that GM will be able to put the issue in the rear view mirror Over the last several quarters GM has been able to increase gross profit margins thanks to stronger consumer demand for SUVs and light trucks In the third quarter GM posted the strongest gross profit margins seen in two years With a dividend yield shares of GM are attractive to income investors And the company currently sports a forward PE of just which should make shares attractive to value investors as well Based on strong US demand for highmargin vehicles a cheap valuation and a healthy dividend yield I expect shares of GM to continue to rebound Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F are not quite as cheap as General Motors With a forward PE of investors are paying more for every dollar of profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generates Still the valuation is relatively cheap if you expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to maintain its market share and benefit from growth in overall US auto spending While value investors may prefer GM over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>thanks to GMs lower forward PE dividend investors should be pleased with Fords yield Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been steadily increasing its dividend payment each year If this pattern holds true the company will increase its dividend again starting with the next quarterly payment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has not yet announced its first quarter dividend but the probability of a dividend hike is high <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is my second favorite US auto investment opportunity only because GM has more of a catalyst for trading higher the deferredprosecution agreement However both major US automakers are attractive income opportunities A third US automaker for investors to consider would be Tesla Motors NASDAQ TSLA The company has posted admirable revenue growth over the last three years which has led to a devoted fan base among investors However while I respect Tesla as a company and the cars they produce I believe that Tesla shares are far too risky to own at the current price Analysts currently expect TSLA to earn per share in and this estimate has been steadily revised lower Assuming this projection is now accurate investors are paying more than times forward earnings to own this company And if analyst expectations continue to be revised lower the multiple may turn out to be even more expensive Tesla will not likely benefit from lower gas prices In fact future sales may actually be hurt by lower costs at the pump because there is less incentive for consumers to switch to an electronic vehicle Meanwhile other luxury brands such as Audi BMW and MercedesBenz are introducing electric vehicles that will compete directly with TSLA Given the strong dynamics for the traditional US auto makers and the risk in TSLA shares I believe GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>make for much more compelling
