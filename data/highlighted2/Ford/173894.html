class='textDiv'>Fords SUV Segment Will Be A Catalyst In China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Fords sales in China have dipped this year due to an economic slowdown in the country and the stock market crash but the company is making a recovery <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however has arrested the slowdown in its sales in China in August by almost half as it has added new SUVs to its lineup which is a smart move The SUV market in China jumped in the first half of the current year in July and in August which is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is bringing new SUVs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however might face competition from Chinese and Japanese players who are trying to capture more of the market by offering incentives Stimulus measures worth billion and interest rate cuts will help bring the Chinese economy back on track acting as a tailwind for auto sales and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The Chinese economy is going through a very tough phase as its growth is expected to slow down to another low this year In Chinas economy grew at the slowest pace since and the trend is expected to continue in as the economy is expected to slow down to a year low in This years stock market crash has left Chinese consumers with less cash to spare and they are forced to lower their budgets drastically Decline has been the story of every industry in China including automobiles which has affected all the key car makers including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F China is the largest automobile market in the world since But growth has now stalled with new vehicle sales declining for five straight months until August Sales of passenger vehicles dropped to million units in August and they have shown no growth for the first eight months of the current year Japanese car makers such as Toyota NYSE TM up yeartodate and Honda up yeartodate are the only ones who have bucked the trend of slowing sales in China On the other hand American manufacturers have borne the brunt of the slowdown with General Motors NYSE GM sales growing just and Fords declining by in the first eight months of the year The local Chinese brands have benefited from this slump in the sales of American brands as they reported a rise in combined sales in August and a combined market share of Many analysts attribute this recovery by the local Chinese players to their strong exposure in the SUV segment The SUV segment is still more than alive in China with sales jumping in the first half of the current year followed by a increase in July and a improvement in August This is one key area that will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>make a comeback going forward In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been able to pull back its yearoveryear sales decline from in July to in August This is a result of Fords moves to tap this key growth hotspot of SUVs in the Chinese market because the company has recently rolled out new SUV models that it has readied specifically for China Taking a cue from the growth trend in the SUV segment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has brought three new SUVs to China to benefit from the growing demand of this segment in the region The new SUVs introduced by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in China include fivepassenger and sevenpassenger versions of the Edge These vehicles are being manufactured by Fords Changan Joint Venture In addition an SUV under the Everest nameplate is being manufactured by the JMC venture and has been recently introduced in the country More importantly the Everest which is based on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Ranger pickup platform is capable of going offroad as well giving buyers more utility and expanding Fords reach in rural centers All in all by adding three new models to the lineup along with the Kuga Explorer and the EcoSport <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>now has a complete lineup of SUVs that can satisfy every type of buyer in China More importantly since SUVs generally command higher margins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is doing the right thing by tapping this market as it will allow it to overcome the slowdown in the Chinese market Fords new SUVs will face competition from domestic players that are flooding the market with cheaper SUV options and gaining market share rapidly Further the Japanese companies also have a strong level of cost competitiveness as compared to the Chinese which could be a negative for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Also after the Chinese equity market has lost close to of its value since midJune Chinese customers have suffered a serious blow to their purchasing power People have started deferring their plans about buying their next new car Under this tough market situation dealerships and manufacturers are forced to offer discounts and other incentives in order to help prop up sales They are offering attractive incentives such as subsidized insurance zerodown financing interestfree loans and higher tradein prices in a bid to lure car buyers back to showrooms As a result vehicle deliveries in August climbed as compared to July At the same time retail deliveries also increased to million units reversing the decline seen in the last two months Although these incentives have helped avoid a decline margins are coming under pressure now Prices of SUVs too probably will continue to drop as competition intensifies according to Macquarie The SUV market is will act as a key growth driver for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in China going forward This is why Fords strategic initiatives and expansion into the SUV segment can translate into higher profits in the medium term But competition from the Chinese and other Asian players will be a big hurdle for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>unless it can sustain its margins while fighting this war of incentives But at the same time investors should not forget that the Chinese government is taking steps to prop up the economy For example the government is carrying out stimulus measures and plans to inject around billion into the economy in the next three years At the same time the Chinese central bank has slashed interest rates five times since November and this has brought some stability to the market Thus we should not assume that China will remain in a state of slump forever and the governments moves to improve the economy will play a key role in enhancing the purchasing power going forward Hence in my opinion Fords investments in the SUV segment in China will bear fruit in the long run and help the company improve its overall financial performance as the country contributes to its sales Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article
