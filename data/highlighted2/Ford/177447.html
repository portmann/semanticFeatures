money where their mouth is should consider LEAPS which carry slim time premiums Bullish <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F investors are calling for big moves in the automakers shares citing strong sales low valuation and growth potential While most investors focus on common shares those willing to forgo the dividend can get about to leverage on <span

the auto industry but there is still a lot to like with the companys shares Shares trade at only x est earnings x est earnings and x est earnings giving the company a valuation more appropriate for a struggling company The company is also strong at a fundamental level reporting a increase in US August sales despite a later Labor Day this year This is partly due to newly refreshed models and partly due to a fall in gas prices boosting sales of higher margin SUVs and pickup trucks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shareholders also collect a dividend which among the highest in the auto industry and only slightly behind that of General Motors NYSE GM Bullish investors have made cases for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares rising to once investor confidence returns and performance continues to improve While such a gain is ambitious it would only require <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares to earn a x earnings multiple for its est earnings or x est earnings Such a valuation is well below the market average and could be reached if investor confidence builds around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Despite the potential for strong gains Fords inthemoney LEAPS trade with very small time premiums The call for January trades with an ask of giving it a time premium of only based on the Friday close at Between now and the expiration date of the January LEAPS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will also pay per share in dividends assuming the current rate continues If <span

be expected to pay per share in dividends by the expiry of the previously mentioned LEAPS In a bullish scenario where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares reach the mark by January the common shares would provide a gain of with dividends included But the January LEAPS would gain providing nearly three times the returns of the common stock Even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares only make it back to their week high hit last September the LEAPS would gain while the common shares with dividends factored in would provide gains of only With a high target price of and an average price target of analysts also view these levels as reachable during the course of the January LEAPS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>faces risks for being a cyclical company tied to the economy and profits could take a hit in a downturn While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has less exposure to China than

they could provide much greater returns for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bulls they also carry more risk than the common shares If the share price stagnates over the next year LEAPS holders would lose the time premium and miss out on the dividends If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares slide the leveraged nature of the LEAPS would also compound losses

shares yet LEAPS still trade with thin time premiums In my opinion this makes them an attractive investment for risk tolerant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bulls looking to capture greater returns from this automaker At the same time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>common shares still offer attractive upside and are worth considering for dividend
