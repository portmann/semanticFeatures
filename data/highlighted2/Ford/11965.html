Carrizos Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production being profitable in the current oil price environment the company has held its ground on the stock market this year Energy investor T Boone Pickens is of the opinion that oil prices will make a strong comeback enabling Carrizo to take advantage of low production costs Carrizo however faces certain fundamental problems such as a huge debt and a weak cash position But Carrizos focus on cashflow rich assets will allow it to overcome the weakness in the balance sheet in the long run Despite the drop in crude oil prices this year Carrizo Oil Gas NASDAQ CRZO has held its ground on the stock market as the following chart shows This does not come as a surprise since Carrizo has been able to improve key financial metrics such as revenue cash flow and earnings per share in a challenging environment The reason behind Carrizos resilient performance is not hard to find The company operates in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale where the economics of oil production are favorable even at low oil prices In fact according to Carrizo chief executive Chip Johnson We estimate that more than of our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>drilling locations are economical below per barrels Now Brent crude is currently trading at around a barrel which means that Carrizos production is still profitable despite the recent drop in crude oil prices Going forward an improvement is expected in the pricing of oil According to a Newsmax report that contains energy investor T Boone Pickens thoughts on the oil market Legendary energy entrepreneur T Boone Pickens doesnt think the bad times will last for black gold In an interview with CNBC he predicted a price of by yearend and to within months A plunging rig count in the United States will help spark the rebound putting supply and demand in better balance Pickens explained The rig count totaled last Friday down percent from a year earlier and percent from a week earlier according to Baker Hughes Thus as oil price picks up Carrizos economic production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will allow it to improve its margin performance in the future and accelerate earnings growth further In such a scenario it is not surprising to see why Carrizo has been increasing its production despite weak oil pricing For example Carrizo drilled gross or net operated wells last quarter bringing the total to gross wells and net wells In addition it upgraded some of its rigs in order to enhance extraction efficiency In addition Carrizo is developing its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale acres on a combination of feet and feet spacing of which drilling inventory is based on feet spacing Additionally it is down spacing its remaining Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale acreage to feet which will approximately add another net locations to its drilling inventory These new additions at Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>combined with its ability to produce low cost oil will enhance Carrizos performance going forward By way of these moves Carrizo is increasing its oil reserves and extraction efficiency and such initiatives will come in handy when oil prices start picking up In addition Carrizo also operates in Utica shale where it recently brought online its second operated well the Brown H in Guernsey County The well displayed encouraging results producing more than barrels of condensate per day Moreover Carrizo has also drilled two new wells in the region that will be brought online after April However the company will restrain from drilling more wells in the Utica until and unless oil prices improve Now this is a smart move as reducing drilling activity in certain areas will help Carrizo optimize its production and lower costs As a result the company has decreased its capital expenditure budget by this year But the good thing is that despite lowering its capital expenses in a significant manner Carrizo estimates a jump in production this year This indicates that the company will produce more barrels of oil per day at a lower cost and as oil prices pick up this will have a positive effect on Carrizos margins However investors should not discount the headwinds that Carrizo has to face At present there are multiple factors that could decide the direction of crude oil pricing First in spite of an oversupplied market OPEC has maintained its stance and has refused to cut back production Second the company has really weak fundamentals Carrizos cash position is very weak at just million while the debt is way bigger at billion In fact Carrizo has a high debtequity ratio of while its current ratio stands at just This means that the company will have to bear the brunt of high interest expenses and if crude prices dont pick up soon Carrizos balance sheet position might get worse But then Carrizo is generating strong cash flow as the second chart above indicates Additionally the company has reduced its capital expenditure this year and this will also have a positive impact on the cash flow Moreover as oil price is expected to improve in the future as different sources point out Carrizos financial performance will get better Hence despite a weak fundamental position Carrizo looks like a good investment due to its economies of production Source Economic Production In The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Makes
