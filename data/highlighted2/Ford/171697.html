the last month has been on the state of Fords operations in China and India due to the overseas market volatility This week we check in on Fords domestic progress The companys two most important domestic sales pieces Mustang and the F continue to impress We are long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the long haul We continue to follow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F as it crawls out of the muck of the financial crisis and tries to forge forward as the leading US automaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has advanced over the last seven or eight years beautifully while rival domestic automaker General Motors NYSE GM has had major trouble in both the press and with regulators We have long preferred <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to General Motors however with General Motors under per share we now own both companies in our longterm dividend portfolio Fords recovery has been fantastic while the new GM continues to struggle and trades at lows vastly underperforming the SP since coming out of bankruptcy We continue to track global and domestic auto sales for both companies in order to make sure that on a monthtomonth basis our bull case for the companies continues to at least move in the right direction For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we have seen these results and we are happy with them We have reached the investment conclusion that a good domestic backbone combined with strong global profitability will eventually be the two items that can take Fords stock and begin to move it upward again in the interim however we are DRIPing shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and were happy to sit on the shares and collect the dividends while the company continues to execute globally Of recent weve done a lot of focusing on Fords operations in China and India for obvious reasons Asia has been in the news over the last two months due to the market volatility and due to Chinas economic woes and we have been tracking Fords progress and the comments of the management to make sure that this major part of our thesis for being long the company continues to hold up So far what weve seen is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>moving its strategies to fit the mold it needs to in India and a management team that continues to think that things are on the right path in China Its also important that we keep in check how the company is doing domestically Our domestic case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is focused mainly on its new F series and its new Mustang offering Both of these models are selling very well and actually selling in excess of predicted demand here in the US As the foundation for our long thesis in the company its important that we continue to see these type of positive headlines from the company here in the US Its been good news on both fronts as the Mustang recently beat out the Camaro as the bestselling domestic sports car closing the most recent chapter in an important rivalry for both companies that existed more than years After years of competition the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang now rules in the US The sports car has also outperformed the Chevrolet Camaro which is one of the biggest achievements for the automaker However the sixthgeneration Camaro has just entered the market and competition is doomed to go onto another new level once again Last month in August sales of the sixthgeneration Mustang rose significantly to percent This proves that the sports car has established its worth in the US now only time can prove how it performs in the rest of the world The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang is currently sold in the US for a price of and can be preordered in Australia for a starting price of Our research also led us to several new articles that seem to think Fords F continues to hold promise in the US This rounds out the two most important factors of the domestic case to us Business Finance News stated about the F <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF has reported record sales for its Fseries trucks a strong indication that Fords last year gamble is reaping benefits for the US automaker The automaker introduced a massive implementation program in August last year converting the steelbodymade popular Fs to aluminumcoated body However the company faced hefty costs in the process of shifting to aluminummade trucks and the question is Was it all worth it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>initially had to close the truck assembly plant at Dearborn resulting in a fall in production <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had earlier on derived about of the revenue from its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trucks according to marketwatch Moving away from steel lead to high disruption costs and a fall in sales as demand outstripped constrained production The company estimates that due to production issues it will not be able to entirely fulfill demand for the new truck The company estimates a shortfall of about units per year As a reminder the company is also coming off of fantastic August auto sales numbers Month after month the company reports good numbers domestically but it does little to move the stock The stock will move we believe only when the bottom line improves For August the company saw strength in its SUVs Mustang sales Lincoln sales and Fseries The product line domestically continues to be robust and in demand This follows several articles weve written tracking the strong demand of the Fseries and the managements continued bullish commentary that is pointing to stability in sales in key areas like China as well as continued growth in the US which makes up the backbone of Fords revenue We stated in a past article that we see this as a positive sign for the US economy and the strength of the auto industry as a whole which appeared to be strong in August across the board US auto sales were the strongest in any month since July The annualized selling rate in August was million vehicles according to Autodata Corp well above expectations of million The six largest automakers in the US market all beat the sales forecasts of industry analysts with Toyota Honda Nissan and GM reporting declines that were not as severe as expected Domestically it appears that the bull case is still very much intact for the short term even though we take a longterm view on the company We continue to think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is an attractive buy here due to its valuation which at gives it a pricesales of x a PEG ratio of and a forward PE of just which is low even for an automaker The companys consistent yield which is not at risk remains a great reason to add at lower prices or continue to DRIP shares while the price of the equity sinks Disclosure I amwe are long F GM MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am
