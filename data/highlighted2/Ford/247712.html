considering a new buyback program The companys cash flow after CapEx is not high enough to cover the higher payout to shareholders than in Cash flow after total investments is deep in red leverage is rather high It would be better to strengthen the balance sheet The pressures from competitors will not decrease on the contrary A strong balance sheet will be a key advantage in the future Several days ago the CFO of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F Bob Shanks mentioned the possibility of a share buyback see this for more details Returning money to shareholders is surely a good thing but only if the company really has enough money to return This may seem like a trivial observation but I know several companies which play out large dividends or have a buyback program while their free cash flow is minimal or even negative Usually this is a road to high indebtedness a severe problem in the future Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>really in a situation where it should give shareholders more money Smart Buybacks Cash Flow After CapEx Is Already Fully Utilized Carmakers are often not able to cover their cost of capital and their free cash flow is weak Looking at the cash flow statement of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we can see it was able to significantly increase its operating cash flow in but largely due to a movement in working capital Thats nice but it probably cannot be a sustainable trend CapEx is far below the operating cash flow but it is steadily growing Last year the company generated cash flow after CapEx of approximately billion about billion if we eliminate the effect of working capital In it was nearly billion and in it was about billion Dividends amounted to nearly billion in and the company bought its own shares for a total value of less than billion Overall nearly billion was returned to shareholders in which is about the same level as the standard cash flow after CapEx reached in the period In other words if we take the cash flow after CapEx as a key metric there does not seem to be room for an increased payout to shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Deep In The Negative After Total Investments If I look at the total investment figures the picture gets even less encouraging as far as valueenhancing buybacks are concerned These investments amounted to billion in and billion in Therefore the company has invested significantly more than it earned from its operations In other words it earned nothing for the shareholders and creditors On the contrary the creditors had to give the company more money the debt increased by billion last year Still <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>already returns money to shareholders via dividends In the first nine months of this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was able to increase its operating cash flow significantly to billion see second table above CapEx stayed essentially unchanged at billion Other investments are again high and after total investments the company is once again deep in the red These other investments are mostly represented by receivables related to financing and leasing These investments cannot grow indefinitely and in the long term it may be more relevant to focus only on cash flow after CapEx and not cash flow after total investments Nevertheless the other investments currently consume a large portion of the companys cash flow and the result is clear if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wants to pay additional money to shareholders it has to increase its leverage or significantly increase its operating cash flow which brings us to the last key point How indebted is the company Total longterm debt including the portion that is due next year now stands at about billion as of Q Cash is at billion and the net debt should therefore be close to billion EBITDA reached almost billion Based on these figures the ratio of net debt to EBITDA is higher than seven This is a very simplified calculation and we must not forget that carmakers are to a large extent financing companies Still the above together with the overall development of indebtedness indicates to me that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does not exactly have a conservative capital structure For comparison Volkswagen OTCQXVLKAY has a netdebttoEBITDA ratio of close to and Toyota NYSE TM close to Based on the above I would not be pleased if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>started with a new buyback program without significantly and sustainably improving its operating cash flow andor reducing its investments It seems to me that more value could be created or at least preserved if the company went in the opposite direction if it focused on strengthening its balance sheet The situation in the automotive sector is not going to improve in the foreseeable time the companies will continue to choke each other and only those with the strongest balance sheets will survive or those with the governments willing to support their balance sheets But thats another discussion And Please Do Not Believe The Myth Of Value Creation Via Higher EPS I would also like to have one general remark Sometimes we can read or hear that buybacks create value because they increase the EPS This would be a unique free lunch but it really does not exist Repurchases do reduce the number of shares and hence with unchanged earnings they do increase the EPS But at the same time they increase the stock risk and thus the required rate of return Therefore in the most common scenario the buyback just moves us from a situation of lower EPS lower required rate of return to a situation of higher EPS higher required rate of return And the overall effect of this financial engineering may well be negative especially for relatively highly indebted companies
