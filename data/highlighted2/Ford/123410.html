after releasing new products and increasing capacity When the Chinese economy recovers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be in a better position to take advantage of the expanding market for automobiles Positive comments from Fields and other management will clarify the companys expectations for the rest of and emphasize the new product launches and momentum While sales in China for the month of June decreased they rose for the month in Europe This outpaced the growth of the overall market as Fords turnaround plan in the market continues to gain traction Executives had previously been aiming for a profit in the region in but Russia made them take a step back and push profitability to However the strong turnaround could see the company break even this year and eliminate a drag on the companys profitability New models including the Mondeo and Kuga helped the company increase its market share in Europe to The new version of the Mondeo is basically a European twin of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fusion and its sales have increase since being released compared to a year ago The auto company is continuing its push of introducing new models in the region during the rest of the year including the Mustang It will be released in Europe for the first time this year and should continue the companys momentum in the region After turning around its operations in North America a clear success story operations in Europe appear primed to join it The companys restructuring efforts have been successful leading to better profitability and the push of introducing new vehicles to the market comes as the company opens onehundred modern stores by years end to go with the onehundred it has already opened The

of discounts for up to for the truck leading to speculation that demand was not as high as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had expected Obviously discounts like these are par for
