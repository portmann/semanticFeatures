future Why are Facebooks acquisitions centered around specific areas like chat photos and video In my last article on Facebook NASDAQ FB WhatsApp Facebooks Next Platinum Mine I spoke at length about how their monetization plan for the messaging app is key to the companys growth into the next decade If you look at the numbers its obvious that Facebook and WhatsApp are neck and neck in terms of active users with the latter edging past the parent company on the mobile front WhatsApp is a mobile application after all and that was one of the things that made the acquisition an attractive one for Facebook It can now leverage this enlarged mobile user base for future monetization But thats only part of the story We still havent discussed what part the other adopted sibling Instagram plays in Facebooks future Facebook proposed to buy the photosharing application company for billion on April although they ended up only paying million for the purchase The member startup had million users at the time of buyout The companys latest round of fundraising before the acquisition valued the company at around million so why was Facebook ready to pay a premium to buy the company In a Forbes article by JJ Colao back in he applauds Facebooks move to buy Instagram but essentially tags it a futile effort by a Top global company to quell an uprising that it saw as a threat to its own capability While I agree that the threat to photosharing that Instagram posed to Facebook might have been a real one I think the real reason the acquisition went through at a premium was because Facebook wanted to control that specific market Every company does it Why did Google GOOG GOOGL buy YouTube in for example Was it because the thenemployeestrong company was a threat to its own capability of serving videos to search engine users Hardly The billion acquisition was a move to dominate the usergenerated video market and YouTube was the fastest growing player at the time Looking at the Instagram acquisition in light of the Whatsapp one its clear at least to me that Facebook is interested in two things To own the largest online user base in the world for both desktops and mobile devices To monetise that user base by leveraging the skill that theyve already exhibited in that area A third area that is of interest to Facebook is to be on the top of the trending list and Instagram certainly made that happen for them For all these reasons I believe Instagram is the best deal they have made to date Whether WhatsApp will be their next platinum mine remains to be seen but theres definitely a lot of gold in them thar hills where Instagram is concerned When looked at from the perspective of Facebooks future revenues with Whatsapp I think Instagram will actually take them closer to their monetization goals in a shorter period of time At this size Instagram has already raced past one tired bird NYSE TWTR which has been flapping its wings hard since early last year but still hasnt managed to gain altitude on stock price Twitters decline is a unique story because management still doesnt think that external threats that are the root cause of the companys slide Interim CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Anthony Noto saw some stock gains after topping revenue expectations at the Q earnings call last year for example but rapidly lost ground after Noto iterated that meaningful user growth would not come for a considerable time Since then Twitter stock has dropped like a rock from around at the time of the Q call to at the time of this writing I know personally that Twitter is trying everything to increase its revenues and user engagement because I was a regular user of Twitter Ads until about three months ago When a company starts giving money away for free you know theyre trying a bit too hard on the customer winback retention and acquisition fronts Case in point is what Google is trying to do to make up lost time in its race against Microsofts Office which is already the top office suite on the cloud offering in the world If youre worried about switching to Docs because you still have an enterprise agreement NASDAQ EA with another provider well cover the fees of Google Apps until your contract runs out GoogleforworkBlog Instagram on the other hand is strong on user base as well as revenues The year after Facebook bought the company it started including advertising as part of the networks regular feed If WhatsApp is money in the bank for Facebook Instagram is money in its wallet Right now Facebook doesnt break out the numbers but the day is not too far away when Instagram will be reporting standalone revenues According to eMarketer Net Mobile Ad Revenues for Instagram worldwide were estimated at million for and expected to more than double to billion this year other sources put revenue projection at million The estimate is over billion and is expected to bring in an eyepopping billion With a growth estimate of between and yearoveryear you can see why I think Facebook will soon start breaking out Instagrams revenues as a separate line item This is the potential Facebook about to enjoy over the next few years but theyre not stopping with just creating a separate ad network About a week or so ago Instagrams blog post announced that the company has brought advertisers on board over the past year Whats making that number even more interesting is the fact that of them are from outside United States This is a segment that Facebook has been trying to crack for a long time because of the ad revenues on its own network comes from North America and Europe I covered this in detail in my article Facebook Has A Problem With this new announcement from Instagram you can bet that Facebook is going to leverage this in any way it can and it already has as Ill show Facebook proudly announced recently that it has over million active advertisers people who have advertised in the last days Thats a growth of over last years million Some say its not sustainable at that rate but I see something else Instagram has of its advertisers outside the United States The latest data shows that of Facebooks advertisers are also located outside the United States That means the online advertising space is expanding to include more and more people from developing markets Granted the ARPU average revenue per user for these markets is still oneninth of what it is in North America but with a growth and penetration potential far greater than NA can boast I think it will mean significant additions to Facebooks top line over the next few years Investorspeak Instagrams Potential To say that Facebook will leverage Instagrams ad network aggressively is a given Adding advertisers to the existing million may not seem like a big contribution at this point but with Facebooks ad revenue already beyond the billion mark and Instagram expected to hit that in the next years the combined pool of advertisers ad revenue and user base by that time will be mindboggling And thats not even considering WhatsApps contribution when they do start monetization there which I think they will before the year is out Facebook is already giving its million advertisers a convenient way to reach Instagrammers Their selfservice ad offering now extends to the photosharing network as well as you can see below Instagram and Facebook let you reach customers where they spend their time And thats on mobile In fact one in five mobile minutes are spent on Instagram and Facebook togethermore than the next mobile platforms combined So what does that mean to advertisers By advertising across both platforms you have more opportunity to reach your customers When you select Instagram and Facebook for the same ad campaign well optimize delivery across their combined audiencewhich can make reaching your customers more efficient Even more running ads across both platforms together provides comparable or better performance for website clicks website conversions video views and mobile app installs compared to running ads on Instagram or Facebook mobile News Feed separately blogbusinessinstagram So this is the moat that Facebook is now expanding around itself by adding more companies into its fold They will continue to monetize existing acquisitions and keep actively looking to buy even more startups and relatively more established companies that have proven their effectiveness An important point to note here is that social media is now trending towards usergenerated video sharing and I dont mean just another YouTube phenomenon There is a flood of video content on the internet today and Facebook recognized the need for more tools that promote visual content Thats the real motivation behind acquiring Instagram and I believe thats the motive behind their new acquisition Belarusbased Masquerade its their answer to SnapChats acquisition of Looksery This is the age of video selfie content and Mark Zuckerberg wants in on it As Instagram and Facebook keep the revenues coming in from textandimagebased content WhatsApp will follow with chat penetration and Masquerade may well be their video gold mine over the next two years and are going to offer some nailbiting quarters for Facebook In my older article I argued why I thought the companys valuation was too high for my taste and I still think thats the case They have a long way to go before they can justify such a high valuation Theyre making all the right moves and theyre bringing in the numbers but Im not confident that the valuation will hold water beyond a reasonable level despite the successes Ive described above As to what is a more realistic PS ratio the next four quarters will tell FB PS Ratio NYSE TTM data by YCharts Thank you for reading my work I
