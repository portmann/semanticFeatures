<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Will Get Better In The US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Fords performance in the US in August was ahead of expectations as sales of its pickup trucks gathered impressive momentum with the FSeries crossing the mark for the first time in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will improve the capability of its pickup trucks and lower costs by building engines inhouse while moving production to the US from Mexico will help it save logistics costs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will foray into the small pickup segment by bringing back the Bronco and Ranger trucks a smart move as this segment has shot up so far this year Fords NYSE F shares have been under pressure in as the uncertainty in the Chinese market which accounts for almost a fifth of its sales has weighted on the stock However investors seem to be missing the bigger picture In the US which accounted for almost of Fords wholesale unit volumes last year the company is on a roll This is not surprising as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is making the most of its impressive growth in auto sales in the US which outperformed remarkably in August Vehicle buyers in the US almost bucked the concerns expressed by many that August will see a decline in sales due to one less sales day a delayed Labor Day weekend and wild fluctuations in the equity markets Light truck and car sales dropped only units from last Augusts million Analysts were already confident that the seasonally adjusted annual rate SAAR will be above the million mark and may even go up to million in August But the actual SAAR for light vehicles rose to million and surpassed all predictions Driven by financing incentives low fuel prices and optimism about the economic recovery auto sales in the US hit their fastest sales pace in years One prediction by industry experts that proved right was that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will report positive growth for August despite concerns regarding the overall economy But they had expected the company to report only a fraction of a percentage growth However when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>actually reported its sales results for last month it became clear that the new F is gaining impressive traction In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported a increase in August sales to light vehicles as its trucks and SUVs were in demand More specifically the FSeries trucks were the key drivers behind Fords growth For the first time this year the FSeries crossed the truck sales mark in a month translating into a increase in retail sales Looking ahead it is highly likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to sustain this impressive growth momentum in its truck sales as it is coming up with new strategies to target this fastgrowing market Trucks have been Fords primary growth drivers in the US The company has sold light trucks as against cars through August this year Thus it is natural for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to concentrate more on this segment Earlier this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was struggling in this segment due to low inventories of the F but things have changed for the better In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects its pretax profit to grow by as much as this year with the resumption of the full production of the F In ideal circumstances the FSeries comprises of nearly onethird of Fords sales in the US Thus the return of F to its normal inventory and sales levels will now allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to implement its pending plans regarding strengthening its mediumduty and small truck lineup Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced its plans to replace the existing Cummins liter ISB engine in the new versions of the F and F trucks with its own Power Stroke V engine which is designed and built inhouse As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to save more costs by sourcing the engine inhouse Moreover the production of both these new trucks was also meant to be moved from Mexico to the United States <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has completed both these transitions recently and rolled out the first Americanmade F and F models off the line at its Ohio assembly plant in Avon Lake The company is also offering an option of a gaspowered a segment first liter V engine that produces horsepower and ftlb torque In fact with this transition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has now become the only one to design and build its own diesel engine and transmission mechanism for mediumduty trucks which will act as an advantage for the company going forward Trucks and SUVs are in such strong demand in the US that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems compelled to use all its truck building capabilities and target every sub segment of this market As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is planning to make a comeback in the small pickup truck market in the US with a new version of the Ranger The small pickup truck will most likely be manufactured at a factory in the Detroit suburb of Wayne Michigan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also negotiating about making a new small SUV that goes by the name of Bronco Now small pickup trucks are not new to the US During the s small pickups were highly preferred by buyers because of their lower prices reasonable mileage and the ability to carry light loads But as a result of an improvement in the fuel economy of bigger more loadcapable trucks like the F small pickups in the US went out of vogue However in more than units of small pickup trucks have been sold through July this year up from last year Hence this is the reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is mulling introducing the Bronco and the Ranger in the US once again after halting their production years ago Fords outstanding sales in August talk volumes about its strong strategy Looking ahead it is likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to sustain this momentum as it is targeting the right growth areas of the auto market in the US Thus I think that Fords strong performance in August and a strong pipeline going forward will play a key role in helping the stock make a comeback since the US is a key contributor to its sales Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
