<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Is More Than Just A Great Income Stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a stunning yield but also has excellent profit growth potential An increasingly green focus product development export potential and a growing domestic economy are clear catalysts to push its financial performance and share price higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>offers excellent value for money and with sound finances looks set to reverse recent declines in its share price Its hard to believe that while interest rates stand at basis points or lower and the SP has a dividend yield of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has a forward dividend yield of This puts it into the upper echelons of highyielding stocks and for incomeseekers we firmly believe that it remains one of the best opportunities out there Clearly the yield figure includes the recently announced per share special dividend and assumes that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will maintain quarterly dividends at the same level as last year ie per share per quarter during the course of With Fords most recent guidance stating that it expects revenue operating margins and earnings for to be equal to or higher than their levels and dividends being covered more than twice by earnings last year there is scope for further rises in shareholder payouts even if the companys profitability remains at a similar level to last year Looking ahead we think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has the potential to deliver significant improvements in sales and profitability in the long run due to a number of key catalysts One example is Fords continual innovation which allows it to maintain its competitive advantage over sector peers For example it recently announced that startstop technology will be fitted to the EcoBoost version of the bestselling vehicle in the US Fords F pickup This should help to boost the green credentials of the vehicle and strengthen Fords F sales outlook among more environmentally aware consumers which has the potential to positively catalyze its financial performance moving forward Of course this is the latest change <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has made to become viewed as a more sustainable and environmentally aware business It has also revamped its supply chain to include multiple renewable materials for use in production vehicles and with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>being ranked first in Interbrands list of the best global green brands as recently as we think that the companys sales outlook is positive especially as more consumers shift to greener vehicle options In addition the outlook for three key regions in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does business is also encouraging and could prompt increases in Fords profitability over the medium term For example US vehicle sales hit record levels in and this trend is due to continue in while in Europe a policy of quantitative easing helped lift new car registrations by last month Furthermore in China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>posted a sales rise of last year and this bodes well for its considerable investment in the country where it has ploughed investment into new plants and also returned the luxury Lincoln brand to showrooms On the topic of export potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is in the process of rationalizing its global footprint and recently announced that it will pull out of Japan and Indonesia We think this is a prudent move and will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to focus resources elsewhere with its export potential being evidenced by the launch of new global products in And with Fords relatively new exposure to the Middle East and Africa offering exceptionally high growth potential we think that a mix of upbeat domestic sales plus improving export sales will have a positive impact on Fords top and bottom lines in and beyond Thats even when the prospect of an appreciating dollar is factored in On this topic with US interest rates having risen in December and likely to continue their rise over the medium term Fords debt is likely to come into sharper focus On the face of it Fords balance sheet is highly leveraged with total debt of bn at the end of When Fords net assets of bn are viewed alongside this debt figure many investors may feel that Fords financial performance will suffer dramatically from higher debt servicing costs and that investor sentiment will weaken in the coming months However with bn of Fords total debt being from its financial services arm Fords motor company debt levels remain much more prudent and equate to a debt to equity ratio of We think this is a manageable level and that Fords balance sheet risk remains acceptable And while investor sentiment towards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains weak as evidenced by its share price fall of in the last year we firmly believe that in the long run its share price will mount a strong comeback With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trading on a forward PE ratio of versus for the SP and a price to sales ratio of it offers considerable upward rerating potential With clear catalysts including a high degree of innovation an increasingly sustainable brand that resonates well with customers huge export potential an improving US economy and a sound financial footing were bullish on Fords longterm prospects And with it yielding and having tripled dividends in the last four years we think its a great income stock but will prove to be so much more Disclaimer This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned nor should it be considered financial advice These are only the
