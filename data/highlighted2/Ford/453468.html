business operating nicely overseas While the entire market has worked itself up into a hissy fit about the potential of a crisis in Europe and the potential for a financing bubble in the automotive sector <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F continues to keep its head down and execute New information out on Thursday morning of this week gives us a excellent crosssection

international expansion is going to be the key to unlocking value in the company stock price Given the results we received yesterday it looks like the company remains on the right track especially in
