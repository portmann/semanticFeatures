style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares have languished in recent years I think the recall and monthly sales issues are transitory Automaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has been a hotly contested stock in recent years The company continues to make lots of money during the bull cycle in auto sales but for some reason investors arent showing the stock any love The companys shares have languished in a range for years now and are currently just above the midpoint of that range in the mids Ive been a bull on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for a while as I believe the new models <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has launched as well as its very cheap valuation are catalysts for a move higher That hasnt happened so far so in this article Ill take a fresh look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in order to see if it is still worth holding or if perhaps it is time to abandon ship To do this Ill use a DCFtype model you can read more about here The model uses several inputs including earnings estimates which Ive borrowed from Yahoo dividends which Ive set to grow at annually and a discount rate which Ive set at the year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of We can see the model has produced a fair value that is very close to the current price but in this instance that is on purpose Ive taken Wall Street analyst estimates for and and entered them into the model but if you look closely Ive manually entered in Fords EPS growth rate after The point of this exercise was to work backwards into whether or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is worth holding at this point so instead of working out a fair value like I normally do I decided to figure out what is being priced into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares right now That can then give us an idea of whether or not those expectations seem reasonable As you can see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares are pricing in absolutely no EPS growth after at present Basically even with a risk premium of which is very high for a stock like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares are currently pricing in flat EPS after I find that to be ludicrous and as such I still think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares are very cheap I cant see a reasonable scenario where this could happen and that is why I think those holding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should keep the faith So if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is so cheap why isnt it moving up I think there are two things that are holding the stock back right now First the companys sales numbers May and April have been rocky The fact that automakers sales numbers come out every month instead of every quarter means investors have more realtime information but it also means the stock lives and dies on the numbers each month introducing undue volatility <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has posted some very nice sales numbers in the past few months but it has also disappointed investors at times as well I think focusing on each months numbers is a little shortsighted when the longer term picture is so bright The new F series is selling very well and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is showing strength across the board Im not worried about a month or two that arent quite as strong as perhaps they should be since the ramp up in new models is still happening The overall outlook for Fords sales is very good and focusing on short term returns on the massive investments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has made is imprudent in my view Over time Fords sales will normalize at a higher level and that should remove this negative catalyst from the stock The other problem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has is that it is issuing an enormous amount of recalls of late In fact just in the last month it has issued no fewer than seven new recalls here here and here and that is never good for any company Automakers issue recalls all the time as it is part of doing business but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been recalling cars at a very rapid rate This has caused some angst among investors as recalls all carry a cost but apart from that those of us that are long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>worry about the perception of quality among consumers Recalls tend to elicit a negative reaction from consumers as they rightfully should because you want your car to be safe and reliable and constant recalls erode that confidence This is something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>must improve going forward if it is to reach long term sales targets That said I still think those two issues are transitory and that investors are focusing on the wrong issues Fords sales momentum is still solidly higher and it is making lots of money It is slated to grow EPS at a double digit rate and yet the stock is trading for times forward earnings That is a ludicrous multiple for a stock that has so much going for it from the long side since times earnings is usually reserved for companies that are shrinking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a very long way from that and if you think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can beat long term EPS growth perhaps it is for you And by the way the stock is now yielding so you can get paid a very large dividend while you wait that sounds pretty good to me Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Pricing In
