when he was caught on video smoking crack on multiple occasions during his term died Tuesday after a battle with cancer As the Canadian Press writes in its prepared eulogy a man simultaneously adored by his fans and abhorred by his foes as his scandalpacked term as mayor of Canadas largest city propelled him to international infamy has died <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>succumbed to cancer Tuesday months after doctors discovered a softballsized malignant tumour in his abdomen his family announced in a statement A dedicated man of the people Councillor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>spent his life serving the citizens of Toronto said a statement from his family The diagnosis in September came less than a year after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>confessed to smoking crack while in one of his drunken stupors and forced the mayor to withdraw from his bid for reelection in favour of running for councillor in his westend ward He won in a landslide despite three years of headlinegenerating notoriety that included slurs against minorities and lewd public innuendo about his marital sex life on top of his admission after months of denials of serious crack cocaine and alcohol abuse Those who knew <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>describe a man whose loyalty to family and friends was as unshakeable as the support he received from the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Nation segment of voters inspired by his rougharoundtheedges ordinaryguy persona Hes very loyal to his friends He has a big heart is the way former Liberal MP John Nunziata a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>family friend put it He doesnt throw his friends under the bus The loyalty was reciprocated His family stood steadfastly by him through his scandals and then through the dark days of his illness A significant segment of the public also continued to breathe life into the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Nation Fords brother Doug <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>who picked up the mayoral candidacy torch after the cancer bombshell placed a respectable second in the October municipal vote a sign many said of his brothers enduring popularity Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked recently about the popularity of US presidential hopeful Donald Trump invoked the populist approach taken by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>whose antielitist rhetoric resonated with many people even as he staggered under the weight of the crackcocaine scandal and derision from those opposed to his public vulgarity There were a lot of people who didnt get it Trudeau said of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>But he tapped into a very real and legitimate sense that people had around who politicians were <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>who kept a photograph of his late father taped to his mayors office computer revelled in his everyman persona The selfdescribed ordinary guy drove his own car to work every day albeit a luxury SUV and railed against downtown elites and a gravy train he said needed derailing at city hall He was grudging admirers said the consummate retail politician who had an uncanny knack of making people feel that he really cared about their plights Yet whatever his political accomplishments his time in office became known for its sordid explosion into an unprecedented political circus that quickly became an international story Fuelling the circus were drugs and alcohol followed by denials confessions and apologies Secretly taken cellphone videos were leaked resulting in blaring headlines not just in Canada but beyond The first apparently showed him using crack and uttering slurs against minorities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>claimed to have no idea what it was about Other videos and audio recordings followed He spewed profanities made offensive comments about women The high school football team one he had proudly coached for years dropped him Top aides deserted him or were fired An extensive police investigation turned up links between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>known drug dealers and gang members His friend and parttime driver Alexander Sandro Lisi was charged with extortion apparently as he tried to retrieve the crack video That case is ongoing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>narrowly survived a legal attempt to have him booted from office for conflict of interest on a technicality However council stripped him of almost all his power Yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>backed up or egged on by his councillor brother and with the undying support of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>faithful blustered his way through it all People lined up almost halfway around City Hall at one point to buy a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>bobblehead He was mobbed like a rock star wherever he went He revelled in the attention Even a twomonth stint in rehab became in his words awesome First elected as a councillor in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sparked controversy almost from the getgo Oriental people work like dogsTheyre slowly taking over he told one council meeting He consistently voted against AIDS funding or other social and arts grants He ranted about a war on cars and spoke out against cyclists Increasingly however his comefrombehind election as mayor in began unravelling Exstaffers described a man by turns illtempered and weepy one who could not resist the bottle even while behind the wheel of a car Latenight TV comics lapped it up The mayor became a household name in Canada and a recognizable name in farflung parts of the globe Asked in October how his mayoralty would be remembered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>laughed Itll definitely be remembered he said with rare understatement No ones going to forget it Ultimately it was the rare aggressive large tumour in Fords abdomen that caused the circus tent to come crashing down Surgery and a repeated regimen of chemotherapy took its toll He lost his hair He soldiered on at times unable even to climb a set of stairs he battled pneumonia he became a fixture at city hall in his red track suit all evidence of his mantra that a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>never quits On election night in he praised his brother before vowing to return to fight for the citys top job in the next election Few doubted he would make good on the promise given half a chance Funeral arrangements have not been made but a large turnout is likely as is a period of lying in repose at City Hall Jack Laytons flagdraped coffin sat at City Hall following his death in and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>then mayor paid his respects To him funerals are mandatory when it comes to friends Nunziata said Tue Overfed Tue Neil Patrick Harris I would vote for him over Obama or hillary Hell Id vote for a dead Rob <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>over Obama or hillary Tue Niall Of The Ni He was only a year older than the Tapette and deserved to be prime minister one day a lot more Tue Fish Gone Bad I am taken by how his large size is actually pretty normal with the standard American diet Eating refined foods makes people fat gives them cavities heart disease diabetes and lets them suffer with cancer Tue greatbeard That and the fact humans have been getting cavities for years Other than those items he was somewhat close on his other generalities Tue daveO Oh yea waaay up in Toronto Just miles by road from Niagara Falls Only about across the lake Why they probably still eat seals and whale blubber up there Those wacky Canucks Tue CounterPartyVice Tue bknob Once again a black page has been ripped from the book of political history by the random hand of death Tue MANvsMACHINE Tue Dominus Ludificatio Tue Thoreau Oh hell the Chris Farely of politicians has left the stage There goes the TrumpFord ticket Just imagine it for a moment Tue bluskyes What sickens me is that all the fuckers from the local news that ripped into him constantly will wax poetic with sickly sweet tomes about their relationships with the man Especially Olivia Chow She needs to be force fed dog shit until her abdomen ruptures Tue pulladan Tue MASTER OF UNIVERSE Tue CPL A big guy with a big heart He will be missed for helping clean up Torontos crack problem one rock at a time Going to guess theres going to be a proper wake following Tue greatbeard I dont know I lived around scotch drinkers most of my life Never really a problem except for the rare exception none that I actually knew of OTOH I lived in a crack neighborhood for a few years Unmittigated hell Tue Overfed All thanks to your benevolent lords and masters who deem what you may or may not ingest If you dont own your own body you are by definition property Slave Tue KCMLO Correct At least us Americans are conditioned from birth that legality equates to morality and class Therefore people of low legality are also of low morality and low class If alcohol is your weapon of choice youre good because youre essentially legal but venture on to any other recreational chemicals deemed unworthy by your FDA overlords and you are scum Tue Dark Daze Ahhh the Canadian way We dont assassinate our politicians we just let them take care of themselves Good riddance Maybe his brother and Herr Harper will follow his lead Tue Niall Of The Ni How many of Robs doctors do you suppose were from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Nation Tue Toxicosis Really That fat fucker did it to himself Chronic alcoholic cocaine crack pot user gluttinous consumer and all around self abuser He was a bullying sociopath who felt himself repugnantly special Why the fuck would anyone miss a man of this poor and shitty character to represent a city of citizens speaks volumes as to where our society is headed as a whole Self inflicted toxicity rarely ends well and nature took its course Sad to see this fuck go not on your life Tue juicy_bananas Tue moonmac Tue Davidduke Tue Niall Of The Ni I foresee a lot of long and drunken lunches will be taken at Queens Park and on Parliament Hill on news that God in his mercy has been pleased to take Rob <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>home Robs death removes any threat he still posed to the restored House of Trudeau in Ottawa and the Queer Mafia in Queens Park Or so they hope When God wants to humble a fool he answers the fools prayers May the Lord grant that Rob <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>rest in peace and bless and keep Renata and their children Rob <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was a flawed human being with burden of demons as we all have to varying degrees But to date I have never witnessed a politician more dedicated and committed to his constituents Say what you want about the guy but he gave a damn about the people he was elected to serve and SERVE them he did Tue youngman Tue Volaille de Bresse I dont know I lived around scotch drinkers most of my life Never really a problem except for the rare exception none that I actually knew of OTOH I lived in a crack neighborhood for a few years Unmittigated hell Tue gaoptimize Ill bet he killed his gut flora years ago and his immune system had nothing left to give Each of us gets cancer every day The question is Can you fight it before it grows and spreads Tue daveO Right Then add the fact that
