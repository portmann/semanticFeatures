Virginias PVA CEO Baird Whitehead on Q Results Earnings Call Transcript Seeking Alpha Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Penn Virginia Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call At this time all participants are in a listenonly mode Later we will conduct a questionandanswer session and instructions will be given at that time As a reminder this conference is being recorded I would now like to hand the conference over to Baird Whitehead President and Chief Executive Officer Please go ahead Karen thank you very much And Id like to thank you for joining us today for Penn Virginias first quarter conference call I am joined today by members of our management team which includes John Brooks our Chief Operating Officer Nancy Snyder our Chief Administrative Officer Steve Hartman our Chief Financial Officer and Jim Dean our Vice President of Corporate Development Prior to getting started Id like to remind you of the language in our forwardlooking statements section of the press releases as well as the Form Q which were filed last night And as was the case in the last quarter we are using a slide presentation which is out there on our website that we will go through simultaneous as part of the presentation First slide slide two we have made some significant accomplishments during this first quarter some of which I would like to highlight Overall production in the quarter was higher than the fourth quarter was higher than the first quarter of which excludes any divested production Our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production continues decline we reached record levels again in the first quarter It was higher than the fourth quarter and higher than the first quarter of We were extremely busy on the completion side of the first quarter We work through our inventory of uncompleted wells As a result of the eight rig drilling program we had much which we were active doing much of the second half of last year and as a result our volume response production volume response has been strong With wells completed over the past moths we feel that we are successfully derisked the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>across much of our acreage and have achieved excellent average results Based on all the flowback and production indicators we have our confidence level continues to increase that the Upper and Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are acting as separate reservoirs that we think can be developed separately or probably more appropriate in a lot of cases offset and stacked and developed simultaneously from the same pad Our CapEx program is now almost lower than Steve will get into some more detail concerning the CapEx program a later on And despite this decrease in CapEx yearoveryear we continue to guide towards total company production increase of to for the year with a larger increase occurring during the first quarter of this year with relatively flat production during the final three quarters of As I stated in the press release while continue to increase production our primary focus has been on cutting well costs and improving our operational execution This has been extremely important to the company and John Brooks will highlight and demonstrate how our execution has much improved As pointed out in a release we stimulated over frac stages over last two quarters at almost operational success rate We have achieved about a cost reduction from the early in the fourth quarter of and expect to further per well reduction beginning almost immediately Also our unit operating expenses including direct gathering processing and transportation and production taxes have all decreased In addition direct expenses are expected to decrease further based on some recent steps we have taken especially in East Texas Despite the recent improvement in oil prices we continue to be focused on maintaining healthy levels of financial liquidity and simultaneously focused on drilling our highest return wells in this lower cost environment Our liquidity at the end of the first quarter reflecting the revised warrant based and the first quarter spending was million Steve will give some additional details concerning our borrowing base and revised covenants a little later on Next slide our production for the first quarter was barrels a day equivalent of which barrels equivalent was from the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>by itself Again as I stated previously our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production was up from the fourth quarter and up from the first quarter of Including the benefit of our strong hedge position first quarter product revenues were million or almost per barrel equivalent We are also making progress as I stated earlier in reducing our production costs which includes direct gathering processing and transportation and production taxes which decreased by or per barrel equivalent to per barrel equivalent quarteroverquarter The IP rates for the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells completed since the fourth quarter averaged barrels a day equivalent with the corresponding day rate for the appropriate wells of little over barrels a day equivalent The well IP rate increased to barrels per day from barrels per day while the day well rate increased from to In addition we continue to feel more confident overtime of the potentially of the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>across much of our acreage Over the last Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells drilled and completed the average IP and day rates were and barrels equivalent per day And I just want to point out the if you compare it to the day rates of all of our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells which was It just confirms that these wells the initial decline rates are flatter on the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and clean up over a longer period of time Slide four gives a lot of detail concerning what we hope to get accomplished for our strategy in Most important is to preserve our financial liquidity which was million at the end of the first quarter and remain within our leverage covenants which have been substantially relaxed through It is important for us to manage our high spend for the year and the focus on cost control and drilling activity and related spending will be the single most important action we can take to manage this high spend We have further reduced our lease acquisition budget considerably from last year when we spent almost million At this time lease spending will be held to a minimum and approximate million and primarily be allocated some to some key leases we want to acquire based on recent well results In spite of the reduction in CapEx yearoveryear we still expect pro forma production growth of to We will invest our CapEx dollars in our highest return development areas which include our Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with almost midteen returns expected based on a flat per barrel oil price and gas price The Shiner Beer Quad with nearly returns and the Gonzales Peach Creek and Rock Creek areas with returns of just over due to the lower drilling and completion costs and higher oil content As I stated earlier we expect further cost reductions of about under which scenario the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Shiner Beer Quad returns would increase to almost and our Gonzales returns would increase to approximate One thing we wish to remind folks of this is that our well cost in addition to drilling and completion cost include almost for any related surface facilities to take care of processing and separating our oil and gas for many flowback or produced water And with that Ill like to go here and turn the call over to John Brooks to give you some more details as far as our operation Thanks Baird Im going to flip over to page six which starts the first quarter operational summary We maintained our significant core land position of approximately net acres Its a highly contiguous position that we substantially derisked with drill bit over the last five years And with our ongoing success in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and given our reduced pace of drilling activity we have an ample drilling inventory in both the upper and lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which allows us to high grade our drilling program and optimize returns Also they are highly contiguous nature of the acreage also gives us operational advantages related to the gathering of the oil gas and produced water in flowback water As Baird mentioned we grew our total Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production by yearoveryear and sequentially While overall production increased yearoveryear performer from sale of Mississippi assets of sequentially We continue to have operational success across our asset base in both the upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as well as the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In the first quarter we pumped stages with an almost success rate with the plugnperf operations and coil tubing drill out Weve performed the high operational execution level now for both the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of We also averaged in excess of five stages per day during pad stimulation operations As you can see from the charts on the right side of the slide we made significant progress in reducing well costs and operating expenses All of our drilling rigs have now been retrofitted with PSI fluid ends on their mud pumps yielding an additionally psi of hydraulic advantage which allows for further rate of penetration enhancement This is reflected in our average footage per day growing from feet per day to feet per day which is about increase in overall average ROP And this greater footage drilled per day is one of the primary drivers were producing the drilling portion of our capital cost During the first quarter we completed and turned to sales Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells significantly reducing the inventory of wells generated by our prior acreage program Of these wells were completed in the upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And we accomplished this with minimal operational issues or delays and concurrent with a focus on reducing average well cost which are decreased by approximately since early fourth quarter with completion cost decreasing by approximately onethird in drilling costs decreasing by approximately In addition to reduced service cost weve altered and optimized the design of our wells On the drilling side weve redesigned the wells to minimize the setting depths of surface casing and intermediate casing Also in our threestring wells weve not only significantly reduced our intermediate casing but weve also transitioned to using waterbased mud in the intermediate section We started a pilot program of this earlier back in and are now seeing the benefits of being further along that learning curve On the completion side our optimized stimulation design now incorporated foot stage link versus our previous foot stage link Weve also reduced the amount of proppant per stage by from pounds to pounds And using tighter lateral spacing allows us to achieve an optimal stimulated rock volume with slightly fewer stages less proppant mass at lower cost while maintaining excellent well performance We have preliminary data from these recent wells in which we have pumped less proppant whereas the initial potential along with a day rates are similar to those in which larger volumes of proppant were pumped A good example of this and how well this completion design is working can be seen on our RBK pad The RBK pad has four wells with a staggered offset lateral placement in both the upper and lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with lateral spaced normally feet apart in plan view and stimulation designed around our current design parameters of foot stages targeting pounds of proppant per stage All these wells had initially wellhead pressures in excess of PSI air after coiled tubing drill out of the frac plugs Implementing choke management weve taken a very conservative approach to flowing these wells back starting at force and slowly increasing the choke size up to force The upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells behaved very differently from the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells The oil and gas rate steadily increased concurrent with a more prolonged dewatering period for the upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells While the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells reached peak oil and gas production more quickly with less loadwater recovery The upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells also have a higher gas oil ratios and higher pressure in the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the RBK pad These elevated initial flowing pressures more aggressive choke management may have yielded substantially higher IPs but we believe this more conservative approach peers to be achieving the desired results of preserving reservoir energy maintaining higher production rates longer in reducing the early life decline rate Were targeting an additional per well cost reductions over the rest of the year But we are extremely pleased and with the rapid improvement in our cost structure given the commodity price environment our well returns remain attractive On seven and eight we graphically show these cost improvements which are primarily on the completion and stimulation side but also with a significant improvement growing cost Our facility cost remained fairly constant But as you can see and as I mentioned we have identified approximately another per well in additional savings during Continued improvements in reducing the number of days on location will drive additional drilling savings not only in rate of penetration but also in minimizing nondrilling time or flat time such as eliminating a wider tip in the intermediate whole section changing our wellhead equipment to reduce rig time after we cement production casing as well as continued improvements in pricing on casing and rentals On the stimulation side we self sourced our guar and KCL substitute We continue to see improved competitive pricing on those two items specifically along with an overall decline in stimulation costs Previously we had discovered using trigger tows subs in favor of tubing conveyed perforating with coil tubing But improved engineering of some more recent trigger tow sub designs has strengthened the value proposition So we plan to reinitiate using trigger tow subs in the second half of the year Continued coil tubing efficiency gains and further price reductions on other nonstimulation completion rentals and services will also be key to continued efforts of reducing total well cost On pages and we have summaries of IP data for most recent upper and lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well results both of which continued to perform well across our acreage position Results of these wells and the wells drilled over the past five years are used to generating what you see over the next three pages which are the type curves that we are currently using On page is our Gonzales County type curve per frac stage which is where we have drilled wells over the past two years The purple cloud you see in the background is the actual range of well results The yellow squares are the average monthly rates of these well histories and the red line is our type curve projection which as you can see is a very good fit as we try to make our projections match our history On page its the Shiner Beer Quad type curve We have drilled wells in this vicinity over the past two years and we will essentially complete our Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>development drilling program in this area over the next few quarters although the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains a promising target for this area In the last type curve page on page is our Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>type curve We have drilled wells over the past months which form the basis of this type of curve You will note that the shallower decline that this play has demonstrated and that was one of the primary reasons were very excited about our Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>play Lastly and certainly of great importance are the rates of return in each of these areas which Baird touched on earlier This charge assumes the additional of cost savings are achieved in the type curves we just reviewed along with the oil to price deck for gas Assuming we continue to identify in highgrade our drilling in these three areas we feel very confident about achieving a return as shown on this page Okay Thanks John and good morning Continuing on with the financial slides starting with our updated capital allocation shown on slide We are raising our capital guidance for to a range of million to million This is a million to million increase over our initial guidance we gave in February The primary driver for this increase is a million carryover from the capital program specifically when we are running eight drill rigs and three completion spreads in the fourth quarter For our first quarter program our wells have been coming in at our anticipated lower cost which includes an average million cost savings per well as John explained earlier We also have a million increase in our anticipated drilling and completion capital related to a slightly higher net well count in our overall program These wells will be coming online at the end of the year so there isnt a volume impact Its more of a benefit to s program This increase was offset by a million to million decrease in facility GG and other costs and a million to million decrease in our land spending This capital will be largely frontend loaded with about of the capital being spent in the first half of the year and about of the capital being spent in the second half of the year As you can see on the graph on the right we are focusing development dollars in our lowest cost highest return locations in Peach Creek and Rock Creek These are the string wells in Gonzales County We are also investing in Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>model wells paired with a Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>location and we are finishing our development in our Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Beer Quad area Production growth with this program pro forma for the sale of our Mississippi assets in would be to We will move onto the next slide and update our guidance Total production guidance for the year is reaffirmed at to BOE per day We changed our production mix slightly which isnt shown on this slide but is in the guidance table in the press release We now expect slightly higher oil volume offset by slightly lower NGL volumes due to our emphasis on the Gonzales County well locations Natural gas volumes are unchanged For the second quarter we expect total production to be relatively flat to slightly higher with the range of to BOE per day Our lease operating expense guidance is unchanged from February Our gathering processing and transportation expense should be lower because we are delaying startup of the oil gathering systems to the fourth quarter Remember thats a noncash flow impact just a change in geography on the income statement between realized oil price and GPT expense Our production and ad valorem tax guidance is unchanged as is GA expense Our DDA expense estimate is slightly higher mostly due to CapEx program costs Our adjusted EBITDAX guidance for is reaffirmed at million to million Our WTI oil price estimate is in the second quarter in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter We are estimating million to million in adjusted EBITDAX for the second quarter Our capital expenditures for the year are million to million as I discussed For the second quarter we expect million to million that would imply million to million for the second half of the year For our liquidity we expect million to million to be drawn on the credit facility at the end of the second quarter Our borrowing base was reaffirmed at million which exceeds our previous guidance of million Including million of letters of credit our liquidity is expected to be million to million at the end of the quarter With a lower capital program in the second half of the year we expect most of our borrowing will be behind us and we will be spending close to within cash flow We expect our credit facility balance to be million to million at year end The one more thing I want to mention on guidance starting in the first quarter of this year our effective tax rate was reset at essentially We expect this to continue for the remainder of Its fairly technical to explain but we had to set up a valuation allowance which is like a reserve against our deferred tax asset on the balance sheet The asset didnt go away but we can continue to increase it by continuing to take an income tax benefit against losses Basically how it works is we realized the income tax benefit and then it is immediately reserve against the asset and the benefit goes away on the income statement So please just be sure to set your effective tax rate for us at in your models going forward On the next slide we summarized the terms of our spring redetermination and amendment of our credit facility As I mentioned we redetermined our borrowing base of million which is million higher than we anticipated We also restructured and loosened our total debt leverage covenant For the second quarter of through the first quarter of our permitted leverage will be For the second quarter of the permitted leverage steps up to then through the remainder of the permitted leverage goes up to We will likely refinance the credit facility by yearend But in case we dont the permitted leverage then steps back down to for the first quarter and then thereafter Our total debt leverage at the end of the first quarter was Taking the midpoint of guidance we would expect our leverage at year end to be around So you can see this amendment gives us quite a bit of breathing room if oil prices remained low We also now have a senior secured debt leverage covenant set at At the end of the first quarter that ratio would have been calculated at if it had been in place We also have a provision in the amendment that says that we will now be allowed to pay cash dividends on the Series A and Series B convertible preferred if our total leverage exceeds In that scenario we would be required to pay the dividends and common stock On the right side of the page you saw this last quarter its just a reminder that we have no upcoming debt maturities Moving on to the final side we discuss our hedges We have about to of our remaining production hedged as follows barrels of oil per day is hedged for second quarter at a weighted average floor price of thats about to of our total oil production We have barrels of oil per day hedged for the third and fourth quarters at a weighted average price of and thats about to of our oil production Some of these hedges have a lower put struck at as shown on the slide where we lose incremental hedge protection below that price but we still receive protection between and the weighted average floor price We have barrels of oil per day hedged for at a weighted average swap price of and there are no lower puts in The graph on the right shows the cash we would expect to receive at various oil prices At flat oil price we would expect to receive a million in and million in For our pricing assumption we expect to receive a million in and thats included in our adjusted EBITDAX guidance This will help you calibrate your models So the hedges are performing as designed We received million in the first quarter which includes the December through February hedge settlements paid in the first quarter We received million in April related to the March oil settlement and we received million in May related to the April oil settlements And that concludes the financial slides Thanks Steve Thanks John And Karen at this time I would like to head and open it up for any QA please The Gonzales EURs seem to have jumped up a little bit to from I know you put I think its one extra stage on there But could you maybe talk to what you are seeing thats moving those up And specifically if thats a tweaking of the terminal rates or more kind of IRR applicable near term rate We have not tweaked the terminal decline rates They have remained consistent than anything we have shown Its just uptodate information We have drilled some very good wells in Gonzales County One thing that we continue to see and its not unlike anybody experienced everybody else has is you take some frac kits on some of these wells And the Gonzales wells tend to rebound and actually improve in a lot of cases over and above what they were doing if were the frac it So I would surmise that the increase in EUR is just because of updated information and performance issues Welles Okay Thats great And then I apologize I couldnt find the well on HPDI I believe you guys were doing your first Eastern Lavaca well on the acquired acreage what was the name of that one Well here we have not filed the result of those There is an upper and lower on the same pad We have not filed the results to disclose yet Ive got a couple questions One I mean it does look like the second half of the year is largely around cash flows in term of cash flow and capital spend If you keep those capital levels into kind of relatively flat does that keep can production stay relatively flat at that level It drops somewhat it would drop somewhat and actually takes us probably it would drop yearoveryear If you look at it on a quarter basis it would tend to flatten out going into Yes I mean we tend to decline of course with the reduction in activity as the year progresses and with that activity level progressing into production would remain fairly flat yes All right And then maybe switching tunes That RBK pad I think John talked about was that your first stacked Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on a pad And then are you all finding any correlation of better well performance if you complete both at the same time an upper and a lower Well this is the RBK is the first time weve done four of these like this Weve got two up and two down And I think weve got a lot of other paired laterals but this is probably the best days that weve seen What it looks like we are achieving is with the tighter well spacing and the way those laterals are placed is we can get a lot more bank for the buck with lower proppant load So what weve seen that along with the choke management is that these wells have maintained their pressure very well Couple this I think were probably very close to a calendar days having at least two of those wells on production And at that point there were still have PSI on the wellhead So the production rates have remained strong And if we were to take a more aggressive approach we could have probably gotten a lot more eye popping IP But it seemed like this was the more prudent course of action to maintain that production longer and achieve a lower decline rate And one other tidbit Brian just to add on to what John said these four wells unlike most of the wells we had drilled across our acreage the laterals were drilled actually in the north south direction whereas most of our laterals are drilled in the northeast and northwest southeast direction So these wells have done as well if not better start the direction preference would be on induced track So I am trying to say is as you go to Lavaca County it tends to some extend approve that direction doesnt mean a lot of as far as well reserves and will help probably develop better our overall lease business because not all leases are created equal as far as configurations go No thats good And one quick one if I may I think in the past you talked about maybe twothirds of your acreage having Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>potential These wells or so that you all drilled how much of that acreage have you all derisked Is it the majority of it or do you think its still twothirds Can you maybe elaborate there Yeah I think you said least twothirds I mean were still feeling our way around on trying to identify the sweet spots in the Upper We dont have that clearly scoped out at this point in time But as we get some additional wells drilled this year we certainly will get those sweet spots identified like we have sweet spots to identify for the Lower So it is productive It leads to across twothirds of our acreage if not more But yet to be determine exactly where all the sweet spots appear to be in the Upper I cant say that typically as you go west to east it appears the Upper because of the pressure tends to get somewhat better The better wells we have drilled in the Upper tend to be in Lavaca County If I could ask a question on I think you all addressed this on reducing the proppant load into these wells And when you look at it I think my numbers are about right but you guys are currently thinking somewhere between to pounds per foot And previously it looks like youre using somewhere between to pounds Youre seeing better results with less proppant It kind of goes against what were seeing elsewhere Do you have any opinion or color on this Well I think what weve seen in the past is when we were achieving those higher proppant loadings that you mentioned we were having to used quite a bit more hydraulic horsepower And if I had to guess at it or speculate I would think we were probably getting a lot more frac linked with those higher treatment rates in same volumes instead of the complex geometries that you hope to achieve in an unconventional play To achieve basically I guess more of a shattered glass approach to the shale than a long transverse facture thats just simply parallel to the wellbore So I dont know if that answers your question but I think thats the inference of what weve been able to see is that we can on the tighter spacing the lesser amount of proppant seems to be where weve located the sweet spot is where the treatment should be Okay So basically youre not communicating with the nearby wellbores as much as you were before effectively is the benefit of doing the smaller proppant load Is that right I think its more of just the geometry of the stimulation Stimulation has changed from having a long a single frac plane to having the complex fracture geometries that breaks up the rock in the near wellbore region Okay Okay Fair enough And then when you look at lateral lengths going forward should we think about the plus range is where you guys are looking at because youre focusing a little bit more on Gonzales where your highest returns are I mean do those tend to be longer or shorter laterals There is going to be some shorter laterals in Gonzales County but not a whole lot of them are going to be material shorter And probably the shortest lateral we would see would probably be around foot or so But there is also going to be some proppants in there as well So its going be a mix Okay Okay So somewhere around there Okay All right And the last question I have is when you look at your leverage obviously youve got enough cushion within your covenants as they were adjusted When you step back and look at your overall leverage and where prices are right now and where that leverage goes to into what are the odds I mean do you guys feel comfortable with that leverage moving into Are there ways you can improve that Are you looking obviously youve talked about asset sales before equity is always on the table Can you give us a little bit of a discussion on what youre thinking as you move into Scott this is Steve Yeah were very comfortable with the leverage where its at right now The banks have been very supportive of us as you can see from the amendment that they just unanimously passed So were in good shape with our leverage going into As I mentioned in my spoken remarks at year end We still think is reasonably healthy compared to our peers What could we do Its the usual things that we could look at and well continue to look at anything that we need to during the year But as asset sales as JV partnerships its the various capital markets debt equitylinked equity all the usual things that we would be looking at But as of right now we think were in pretty good shape and we just want to make sure that we have all of our options opened to us Good morning guys Baird or just for you John was wondering with the three rigs are you going to be focused could you just let me know for the rest of the year and times you enter where you plan on running most of those or is that just going to be kind of all over It will be all over Neal Id say youre going to see us continue to tweak our program and try to do as many in Gonzales County as we can because returns are so much higher but that in combination with the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and identifying and exploiting those sweet spots in the Upper that we have taken care of or find so far we probably be the basis of the most of our program moving forward into So a bit different I was looking back at that I think its in December when you had all four down kind of in that very call it South Central Shiner area I guess more of them now will be up towards further North up towards the Peach Creek now given the new results youve been seeing Okay Okay And then wondering looking at those type curves that John went over John I guess for you or again for Baird just how the choke programs between Upper or the Lower is there anything different youre doing there or is it just the nature of the wells why youre getting that much flatter decline when Im looking at that Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>type curve Well we are being a lot more conservative on our choke management especially where we have the higher GORs I think it makes a difference It may not give the highest possible IP but it does arrest the early life decline is evidenced by improvement in the day rates So preserving that energy is really important especially in the higher GOR areas Got it And then just lastly I think it was maybe even two quarters ago I know just Baird on this call mentioned the lower well cost that youre seeing or service costs I should say John just wondering I know I think it was two quarters ago when you had a bit higher sand costs when you had to redo contracts and such have some of those things either the sand or just the takeaway in general some of those things costs come down just as this market has as capacity has increased They have the cost have come down On completions side though probably of our cost reduction is due to pricing the other is the design optimization So that improvements kind of split between what how we design the wells and then how the markets pricing with the goods and services Hey Good morning everyone Thanks for taking my call Baird just to verify roughly what CapEx level in say drilling and completions budget could keep production relatively flat with the second half production Okay Looking at some of the recent wells where you had the roughly excuse me decline in day rate on a BOE basis but at the same time the oil rate kicked up about that same percentage level on a day rate Whats the rate of return impact on that tradeoff there Clearly the increase in oil is more of a benefit to decline in NLGs or any associated gas because of the relatively pricing But I cant quantify the differential associated with increase in oil as far as it effect on rate of return I dont know what the answer is to that Okay Thats fine And lastly this might be for Steve any indications on what the borrowing base could move to at the next redetermination say if oil stays current neighborhood of a barrel Not yet its still a little early wed have to wait and see what the banks come out with their price deck in the fall But I dont I wouldnt expect it go up but I dont know where itll be from there Just to give put it in perspective we came down from the fall to spring and you know what prices did during that period So hopefully therell be some stability in that market Baird maybe for you can you just maybe talk about a little bit on the pushback on increasing the share count and can you remind me is that share count increase needed in order to issue equity or do a convert at this point Well it would be required if we decided to do some kind of equity offering I mean we as Steve mentioned earlier we want to keep other options open The issue we had we didnt have the requisite votes in order to get it passed And theres a fairly high threshold on order to get the share authorization approved we need two thirds So we will reconvene our annual meeting tomorrow and see if we get the vote But thats the answer thats where I can answer that question at this time Sure And I guess I dont know if you can provide this but is there something that some of the well call them hold outs are looking for in terms of increasing the share count or is there one item of pushback that theyre saying Can you give us a little color around that in terms of how are they thinking about not authorizing that Weve already had conversation with shareholders and weve received their input I cant say theres any single comment we received back But weve made a significant efforts to talk to some of our shareholders over the recent week or so Fair enough I guess maybe in terms of MA I guess a lot of folks have been thinking about second half of this year potential picking up how are you guys kind of thinking about that at this point either participating or anything along those lines I am sure you guys saw the metrics from is that a deal is that something you guys from evaluation standpoint find attractive at all Well considering the I didnt I havent stated the deal per se considering the premium received Id say it was attractive What effect it may have on Penn Virginia I have no idea As we have stated in the past if somebody approach to us we certainly would listen and consider doing something But at this time our best strategy we think is to figure out how we are going to get through this current market and market conditions and product pricing conditions and continue to grow the company and build value thats day in day out our most important objective at this point in time I think that makes sense Maybe just kind of lastly maybe for you Steve How are you guys kind of thinking about potentially layering hedging for just kind of given the run up in the strip Have we kind of reached the point where the economics make sense to maybe layer in some collars or anything along those lines or how are you guys approaching that When we are looking at our hedging program we are predominantly looking at Its portfolio hedged for Id say when the market has been touching its probably starting to look a little attractive To your point we can be locking in some reasonable returns at that level protecting cash flow And so weve been considering that both swaps and callers Thanks Good morning everyone Most of my question have been asked and answered just a couple maybe for Steve The zero tax rates should we also assume now or at least for now for for modeling purposes All right And then just one other question I was disconnected for a couple of minutes And I dont know if this was touched on but what was the backlog of fund completed wells either with the end of Q or currently if you have that I think we had around uncompleted wells and going into the first quarter if I am not mistaken Steve Thanks for taking my question In terms of the choke that Neal was talking about before Obviously you guys have said youre running a tighter choke on the Marl How much of this is strategic I think its what you were getting at in terms of where prices are versus at a barrel when you are in Gonzalez County you turn on the fire hose If youre looking at a steep contango in the forward market what do you think about strategically trying to fit that into No Sorry we are approaching from the standpoint is just better management of reservoir characteristics and reservoir energy There could be some benefits from product pricing and contango as far as oil prices are going up over times But we are looking at more or so in the shortterm management reservoir pressure and energy versus Southern America or two to three years China road If that answers your question Yes Thats perfect And I guess also in terms of efficiencies that you guys talked about in cost down I mean and you were talking about maybe as a possible hedging price I mean if we look at say we could get million barrels of oil production I mean still at if you can only do EBITDAX margin youre coming up a little short obviously on a breakeven for that million lets say breakeven CapEx level So seems to me to be kind of where you would think about hedging assuming that there is no more cost downs So I guess from my perspective what do you think you can drive EBITDAX margin to from the cost optimization side to kind of bridge that You were sort of saying in that but I think what you are saying is appears to be the better price to hedge at I think its going to take a combination of hedges and further cost reductions because we think we can make do we think we can make further cost reductions on these wells We do I mean we mentioned the And I think well keep plugging along if find some ways to do things better over time whereas we get the cost down maybe another million no guarantees in trying to predict how much further we can gets cost down But that in combination with the or oil price we will have a very significant effect on returns on this well So I think to is probably fair way in which we want to layer in some additional hedges whether there is swaps or in all probability try to push some colors in place that will give us some upside In terms of the comments that were made earlier too about the frac geometry youre referring to like the zipper frac that you guys have talked about in the past in terms of shorter laterals with better results Yes Everything were doing almost everything were doing I wont say everything but almost everything we are going right now were multiwell pads and simultaneous fracking ie zipper fracs Just for Q whats the difference between the million CapEx you talked about in the tax in the guidance versus the actual million number reported Okay So put it another way for the full year versus the million to million number you talk about what should we expect in terms of an actual cash outflow I think it will probably smooth out because in the first quarter of course we were paying a lot of bills that we incurred in the fourth quarter So I think a lot of that our working capital adjustment is already work that into the numbers No I think if you look at the revolver guidance that we gave and try to just line up your working capital Right Got it On that so even if there is not a borrowing base reduction your liquidity is going to be in the million to million range year end Is there a minimum level of liquidity you want to keep Because presumably in Im sure pricing will be another cash burn so not super tight yet but it certainly could be higher I cant say that there is an exact minimum liquidity number that we are targeting Its going to be all in contacts with oil price and whats going on with the whole company and the market But as of right now for were looking forward into the year end We think that we are in good shape And as I played out in my remarks we are very front loaded on the capital programs so for the second half of the year we are pretty much spending within cash flow So I think thats where we are focusing our attention right now and we will see how things are going towards the end of the year Tom I just want to add one of the things We have our ability to adjust activity further if maybe but at this point time we do not have plans do that All right Anyway just to conclude we remain confident with what were doing I mean we have improved our operational execution significantly since the middle of last year Some of the issues that we reported in the quarter past we think are behind this us is evidenced by the high success rate were having on the completion side And were going to do everything we can to keep our cost down and reduce them further We think thats the most important thing we can do And we are not going to stop The reduction of cost continue to maximize our investment returns and managing liquidity although hand in hand of course With that look forward to our next quarter call and give you some update as far whats going on with the company new Thank you very much Thank you Ladies and
