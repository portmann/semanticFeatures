Fords Ship Sailed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Despite operations performing better than expected over the past few quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still trades at a very low multiple The last few articles on SA have questioned whether or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is worth investing in here After a year and half of being bullish we step back to ask whether or not a long term investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still warranted We have been reading the latest commentary on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F here on Seeking Alpha and wanted to step back and take a look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as an investment going forward Our previous articles about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have all centered around the companys performance and how the companys international expansion we think will help the bottom line and eventually move the stock price higher In recent news one of the metrics that we have been following very closely for the last year and a half European auto registrations again posted good numbers for April despite <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>losing a little bit of marketshare <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F car registrations to units in April according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association Overall EU registrations YY to units in April driven higher by doubledigit growth in Italy and Spain Registrations were up in Germany and in France While the loss of marketshare is to be noted this still forecasts a boom in automobiles overseas in key countries for Fords international expansion All in all good news Our investment thesis for the last year has generally been focused around these key metrics that we get about once or twice a month We have been following them closely taking into account small aberrations that are normal through the course of business and we continue to think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is executing well both domestically and internationally The last few articles on Seeking Alpha have talked less and less about the companys performance over the last year and more about what the future is going to be holding for the automaker Granted this is the best way to look at publicly traded equities but we think Fords strong track record since the crisis in paints the picture of a company that is versatile and does what it needs to in order to adapt to its surroundings and flourish as a business That should not be ignored The disconnect comes from somebody that looks at the companys valuation and sees that it is trading between x and x next years earnings F PE Ratio Forward data by YCharts There are two scenarios when a company is trading this cheap Either it is an unbelievable bargain or it is trading this low for a reason With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we think it is a mixture of both and we are not afraid to keep longterm capital in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as an investment going forward from this point First you look at the fundamental business The business is in arguably the best shape it has ever been in the companys history The company has made a successful transition to aluminum with the F its trucks and SUVs continue to drive record sales both domestically and overseas and the companys comprehensive effort to roll out to other geographies has taken hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is starting to turn a profit in international locations albeit barely and that is the first step to diversification that repels economic cycle downturns and adds further profitability As we have said prior despite the auto market looking like it is entering a bubble the average age of a vehicle on the road is still at alltime highs and at over years Those two metrics tell us that this automotive cycle could generate higher than expected sales while we do agree that the quality of credit that is being extended needs to be looked at Obviously when we are at the end of a shortterm economic cycle the quality of credit terms deteriorate in order to push through sales We presented in the past a pair trade by going long F and short CACC to short the finance bubble while at the same time having the benefits of being long the company that is paying the dividend F Dividend Yield TTM data by YCharts And that is one of the reasons that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as an investment doesnt bother us if it goes sideways We are pleased with the companys ability to allocate capital prudently managing it between returning to shareholders and investing it in the companys international projects <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has invested billions in Mexico and China over the last to years because they know those densely populous areas will be key to the companys global success At the same time management has not forgotten the shareholders and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to yield a dividend that is now at If the stock stays parked or even if it moves lower we suggest taking these dividends and reinvesting them if you have a long term multiple year outlook on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as we do Our plan is to hold our shares through this coming shortterm economic cycle move and to continue to allow shares to collect dividends while we reinvest them no matter where the price moves from here Back to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as an investment If you were looking for a shortterm gainer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not the best place to look As a matter fact if you were looking at anything over the course of the shortterm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may not be the stock for you However if you have a multiple year outlook and remain confident that the company can execute internationally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may be a great place to park a nominal amount of capital that you can use to take advantage of a great yield The story is that we are waiting for Fords management to execute internationally and the company is paying us to wait Knowing the pedigree of management and the companys track record for the last seven or eight years we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still a good place to have some capital invested I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Consumer Goods Auto
