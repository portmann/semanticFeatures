We Think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Is A Strong Buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Fords strategy is very sound and offers clear catalysts for profitability and share price growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has huge income appeal and has scope to increase dividends at an impressive clip Investors in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F have a lot to be excited about right now For starters the companys retail automotive sales are at their highest level since after a strong September in which the company posted a increase in US sales versus the same month last year Furthermore the release of the allnew F pickup truck is likely to stimulate sales growth even further in the coming months and years It remains the biggest selling vehicle in the US and with an aluminum body and a more efficient engine option available is likely to appeal to an increasingly green US consumer For example of sales of the F last month were of its EcoBoost engine and looking ahead it would be of little surprise if an upward trend in this regard continued This could cause an upgrade in Fords earnings numbers and also improve investor sentiment moving forward In addition to allnew engines <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also focused on staying ahead of rivals when it comes to sustainability with the company topping Interbrands list of the best global green brands in Examples of its commitment to sustainability include a partnership with Heinz NASDAQ KHC to investigate the use of tomato fiber reinforcement in sustainable composite materials as well as Fords biobased portfolio which now includes eight renewable materials for use in production vehicles This focus on sustainability is likely to resonate well with an increasingly environmentally aware consumer thereby strengthening Fords degree of customer loyalty and positively catalysing sales in the long run Meanwhile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also expanding its global reach with the release of new models in countries outside of the US Certainly the US economy is growing at an impressive clip and this is likely to act as a positive catalyst on Fords profitability and share price in future However the European economy is also strengthening thanks in part to the ECBs adoption of quantitative easing Therefore Fords decision to launch new global products around the world in appears to be a sound one with aggressive product acceleration in Fords newest region Middle East and Africa having the potential to boost its top line in the coming years And while the Chinese economys growth rate has slowed Fords decision to launch the Lincoln brand there opens up a new sales avenue for the business which should provide additional diversification as well as higher sales and profit Meanwhile Fords decision to invest a further m in its latest assembly plant in China means that it is committed to what is likely to be a major growth market for the business with a rising middle class set to push demand for Fords vehicles northwards This therefore is likely to have a positive impact on the companys share price As well as a sound strategy and clear growth potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also offers excellent income prospects For example it currently has a forward yield of and it has rapidly increased dividends per share from zero in to in the last year This though still represents a rather modest payout ratio of around which we feel provides a sensible balance between rewarding the companys investors and also reinvesting for future growth Of course a higher payout ratio could be warranted but with earnings per share forecast to rise by in it seems likely that Fords dividend will remain hugely appealing with US interest rates set to remain low and the SP yielding just over Therefore we believe that investor sentiment and Fords share price will move higher due to its considerable income appeal on both an absolute and relative basis Based on its forward price to earnings PE ratio of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>appears to be very cheap when compared to the SP It has a forward PE ratio of and so we think there is vast scope for an upward rerating to Fords valuation over the medium term In terms of potential catalysts to push it higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has strong bottom line growth forecasts for remains a topnotch income play and its business strategy seems to be very sound Of particular note is the updated version of the F which is due to become a bestseller Fords sustainability drive which is likely to improve customer loyalty and its aggressive growth strategy outside of the US all of which we feel have the scope to push the companys share price higher moving forward Disclaimer
