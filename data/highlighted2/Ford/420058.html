style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a ton of debt but not really Their longterm debt is actually a cash generating machine and is pretty similar to what youd want in a bank They only really have billion in debt which is easily covered by cash on hand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is one of those companies where the stock and the company just dont seem to play ball on the same court Despite recordsetting results the stock price languishes and just cant get any traction Investors are frustrated and rightfully so Unfortunately there is not just one aspect of the company or the auto industry that is keeping the stock price low Bearish investors point at the SAAR peak auto subprime auto loans and even the possible disruption from ridesharing services and electric vehicles Internal to the company investors point out the over billion shares pension obligations union contracts and the insane amount of debt Im not here to explain away the bearish issues Ive dealt with the subprime concerns here and here already but I can offer some information about that terrible debt that gets brought up time and again After all Im guilty of grossly misunderstanding the debt and I want to spare others the embarrassment I felt Many investors may use Morningstar to do some research and of course the balance sheet is a great place to get a picture of whatever company you are looking into This is where the trouble starts Starting at the top things look really great The company had over billion in cash at the end of their last quarter Heck they could buy Tesla NASDAQ TSLA at a very generous premium and still have some left for snacks for the board room Short term debt at just over billion doesnt look bad either And then down a little further it happensdo my eyes deceive me Is that over billion in longterm debt Yes it is but my fellow investors your eyes do not deceive you the consolidated balance sheet does You see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>operates its own internal bank This bank known as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit is a huge strength for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor it allows them to finance their vehicles at attractive rates to qualified customers and provides flexibility to dealerships to maintain a healthy amount of new cars on the lots <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit even brought in billion in profit before taxes in not too shabby Unfortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>must account for those loans on their vehicles somewhere and it naturally winds up on the balance sheet as a longterm debt That longterm debt is the managed receivables of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit which just so happens to be billion On the surface this is enough to scare away the average investor For computers that aggregate information and robotrade on that information it can make the stock a nogo <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>only has billion in automotive debt or debt we would normally count against a company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit even maintains a balance of cash to protect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor from delinquent loans <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit is selffunding and selfliquidating a remarkable strength to have in the loan business If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>were a bank it would be an attractive investment It has a large portfolio of high quality loans at attractive rates spanning in time from months A rising interest rate environment even stands to benefit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as well by increasing the potential yield on their loans and easing pension obligations as treasury notes increase in yield as well Heavy regulation helps protect their assets and offers an incredible barrier to entry When we compare <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to banks there are a lot of similarities Lets look briefly at Wells Fargo NYSE WFC a highly respected and sought after large US bank Wells Fargo has about billion in cash on their balance sheet and billion in longterm debt For Wells Fargo though the higher that longterm number is the more investors love it That means even with loans that may go into default the bank will make more money than it lent out at least that is the hope That debt is a cash generating machine for the banks If only investors saw Fords longterm debt the same way perhaps we could trade closer to Wells Fargos PE of double Fords PE of We established that Fords debt is actually pretty darned good for the health of the company But that doesnt really matter until the markets realize this There is good news though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is starting to separate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>isnt going to spinoff its finance arm that would be incredibly stupid What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is doing is treating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit like another company entirely and they started in earnest this last quarter For the first time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit was given its own conference call to discuss the quarterly results The call is worth a listen and illustrates the importance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit to the overall company It also shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may be trying to somehow separate their automotive debt from their operational debt If you listen to previous conference calls you can even hear the frustration in their voices as they try quarter after quarter to explain why Fords debt is different Does this make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a screaming buy Maybe that will depend on what kind of investor you are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still yields a healthy has strong sales strong margins and a healthy balance sheet I think that if you could remove that billion in debt from the balance sheet we would have a much higher share price I also understand that institutional investors or so called smart money probably understands already what the real picture of the debt is Either way my point with this article is to explain the debt and hopefully prevent someone else from looking stupid like I did back in December of If you have any questions
