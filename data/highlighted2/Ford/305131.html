no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sees record profits for Q North America was the main driver of growth largely due to lower oil prices However Fords guidance left a lot to be desired <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F recently announced its Q results and they were quite impressive The company generated record profits for the quarter including extremely strong performance in North America Nevertheless the market was not impressed by this news sending <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>lower by for the day There is no doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had a good quarter Total pretax profits grew from last year to billion with the vast majority of this growth coming from North America and Asia Pacific Besides South America and Other Automotive all of Fords segments posted higher year over year pretax profits In addition Fords automotive division saw improvements in all the key metrics Vehicle wholesales were up revenues were up operating margins nearly doubled to while segment pretax profits grew A clean sweep for this unit In particular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw impressive performance in North America Vehicle wholesales were up revenues were up operating margins improved by basis points to while segment pretax profits surged by The company was likely aided by lower oil prices a lot more people want to drive with gas below per gallon As for why Fords stock price did not move much given the positive results the reason is that the guidance was not up to par <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expecting flat automotive profits from North America in This assumes a increase in vehicle volumes in the US This is a very slow growth rate given the tailwind provided by low oil prices It is looking like South America will be a big loser in Brazil vehicle volumes are expected to decline year over year Given that this was the rock in Fords South American operations this is a negative Other countries in the region are very unlikely to pick of the slack especially Venezuela <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could see a billion plus loss here The Asia Pacific guidance which includes China is calling for profits to grow in Given the obvious economic slowdown in the region and the strong dollar this forecast seems optimistic The margin guidance was not good down basis points to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also expecting to see its operating cash flows decline slightly as a result Not good Areas of strength for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in include its credit unit which is expected to post flat to higher earnings and Europe which seems to have gotten out of its economic rut All in all this guidance puts Fords EPS growth in at around flat which is well below where consensus estimates had put it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generated billion or per share in free cash flow in and generated earnings per share of This gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a Price to Earnings ratio of x and a price to free cash flow ratio of x When including debt Fords EV to free cash flow ratio is x and the EV to EBITDA is x In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a fairly undervalued stock in terms of both earnings and free cash flow multiples These values should stay more or less the same for Fords dividend is also very well covered at just of free cash flow when including the special dividend This is important as the dividend yield will probably be the main method investors in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have in generating returns in While its share price may not reflect it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>put up some record numbers in In addition the company recently rewarded it shareholders with a large onetime special dividend of billion or per share Though I remain cautious given Fords high debt totals and reliance on its financing arm Nevertheless the stock is trading at an attractive valuation while the dividend yield offers well above average income Disclaimer The
