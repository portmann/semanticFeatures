Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold vehicles in March of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F did not have the best headlines with regard to march auto sales but the company did sell vehicles and saw its retail sales climb Overall the auto sector remains on a pace to sell million cars this year Last year overall sector sales were million Thus growth of cars spread over several manufacturers will mean leaner raw growth numbers this year despite sales levels approaching record highs A particular bright spot in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>franchise is the Lincoln line Lincoln is seeing fresher looks gaining appeal with younger drivers and seeing sales increase at a decent clip Lincoln sales were up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has also reinvented the perception of full size work vans and put marketing muscle behind its Transit line of vehicles transit sales should be a nice growth segment for the auto maker Sales of Transit vans rose and March of represented the most robust van sales in years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock has ranged between about and in Currently the stock trades at just under Some of the strategies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is considering in have potential to help build new brand loyalty help the brand increase in resale value and help the bottom line These moves could allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock to appreciate and perhaps challenge the week high in the range The equity is not without a bit of risk though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is getting ready to renegotiate its labor rates with unions representing hourly workers Fords Americas Chief Joe Hinrichs announced at an investor conference that a goal of the company is to bring Fords labor costs more in line with that of Fiat Chrysler Among the top priorities in these negotiations is to negotiate more competitive rates for entry level works It is estimated that Fords average pay including benefits is per hour while Fiat Chrysler is much lower and at per hour If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can successfully cut the cost side of the business it could help the bottom line in a material way If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not successful the talks could drag out and cause disruption in the usual flow of business projections etc The concentration on retail instead of fleet sales is an interesting dynamic Fleet sales pump up volume but can also dilute the resale value of cars in a brand Resale value is a consideration of many consumers Consumers want a combination of value when they buy and value in return when they sell or trade By increasing the ratio toward retail buyers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is in a longer term protecting the value of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>brand This dynamic over time can build consumer loyalty <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also making sexier cars that carry more consumer appeal This is another dynamic that will increase brand loyalty sales and eventually market share The new Lincoln lineup which carries more curb appeal to more people is an example of expanding specific models and even a specific make to a larger demographic of people <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also shows an ability to fill a niche and grow new markets with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Transit line These vans are more customizable than the traditional vans and are marketed very well The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Transit is a niche market but sometimes these types of markets can present the best margins On the bullish side we have a sexier brand efforts to increase value at the initial purchase efforts to increase the consumer value at trade in and a possible cut in labor costs with a union negotiation this summer On the bearish side we have the fact that growth does not look as good in terms of percentages than we have seen in recent years and a the possibility of labor negotiations being dragged out without the concessions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is seeking Personally I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as a buy at these levels In February of this year with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at I stated that I felt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had a chance at seeing a good first half of The equity has already seen a gain of since that time and in my opinion will remain
