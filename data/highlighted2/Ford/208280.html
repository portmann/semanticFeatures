July SAN FRANCISCO Apple Incs AAPLO aggressive recruitment of auto experts as it explores building a car has left a promising if financially troubled electric motorcycle startup in the dust Mission Motors whose sleek electric bikes drew comparisons to Teslas cars ceased operations in May after losing some of its top engineering talent to Apple according to sources close to Mission Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building an electric car Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts many from car makers like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>or MercedesBenz which shrugged off the departures As tech giants vie to define the future of personal transportation dangling higher salaries and a more secure future the defections can be devastating for startups industry insiders said Some close to Mission Motors said it had reached a point of no return by last fall when departures to Apple and other companies accelerated after a long struggle to find funding and a sound business model But former Chief Executive Derek Kaufman thinks the company could have carried on if it had not lost key employees undermining efforts to raise funding Mission had a great group of engineers specifically electric drive expertise Kaufman said Apple knew that they wanted it and they went and got it A spokesman for Apple declined to comment for this story Kaufman said Apple recruiters began circling Mission as it was trying to raise a crucial round of funding last autumn An investor who had committed to the round backed out after two key engineers joined Apple he said and more employees followed in the coming months San Franciscobased Mission is not the first to run up against Apples auto ambitions Tesla Motors Inc TSLAO CEO Elon Musk has publicly chided the iPhone maker for trying to poach engineers In February electriccar battery maker A Systems sued Apple for recruiting some of its top engineers claiming it had been forced to abandon key projects A and Apple later settled on undisclosed terms With a research and development team of several hundred A could weather the departures CEO Jason Forcier said But a small startup could be crippled he noted The competition for engineers is as stiff as Ive ever seen it and Ive been in this game for years now he said That was illustrated earlier this year when ridehailing app Uber snatched as many as people away from Carnegie Mellon Universitys robotics lab according to media reports to help it build a selfdriving car And amid tepid interest from investors in clean tech startups rarely raise the money they need to compete Forcier said We put billion into A he said Startups get million to million its nothing Mission raised about million according to investment database CrunchBase Scot Harden a vice president at electric bike maker Zero Motorcycles said his company has not suffered any defections to Apple thanks to a stable base of investors Apple never tried to acquire Mission Motors Kaufman said But the engineering team specializing in hardware and software for electric drive systems including algorithms for battery charging and cooling offered Apple a range of expertise to draw from At least two Mission employees joined Apple in according to LinkedIn profiles Over the past year people with knowledge of Mission estimate about a half dozen engineers moved to Apple Other employees also joined companies such as Tesla and HarleyDavidson but Apple grabbed the largest share they added The hires include Nancy Sun Missions vice president of electrical engineering Mark Sherwood director of power train systems engineering and Eyal Cohen vice president of software and electrical engineering Sherwood declined to comment Cohen and Sun did not respond to requests for comment From its founding in Mission attracted engineers driven to build a worldclass electric motorcycle The company made headlines as it unveiled its prototype an angular modernist racing machine that hit miles km per hour in tests a record for electric bikes It was the best bike Ive ever thrown a leg over former Mission employee Jeremy Cleland said But Mission was perpetually on the verge of running out of money people with knowledge of the matter said In the company began focusing on making software and components for electric vehicles for other firms hoping to generate revenue to support the motorcycle project A separate company Mission Motorcycles was formed in to sell the bike but it plans to file for bankruptcy CEO Mark Seeger wrote in court papers in September Mission Motors had no more luck with its new thirdparty business model Although it struck deals with HarleyDavidson and others the contracts were not lucrative Infield Capital the largest investor which now controls the company is in talks with parties which may be interested in acquiring the remaining Mission Motors assets including designs for components and software a patent portfolio and a battery lab said Bill Perry a venture adviser at the firm Missions prized bike never reached consumers But former employees now hold key roles in Silicon Valleys auto efforts They include Seth LaForge an engineer on Googles selfdriving car project and Jon Wagner Teslas director of battery engineering an impressive tally for a company that never numbered more than about employees The Apples the Googles and the Teslas really benefited from the education that those engineers were given at Mission one industry executive said Whats Next Tomorrows Digital Life Thomson
