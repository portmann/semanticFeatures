It Time To Bail On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Fords earnings miss and range bound nature is frustrating Production of the new F trucks will accelerate rapidly in the second half of The increased average selling price of the F will boost Fords margins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has been a frustrating stock to hold for investors over the last two years The stock has been annoyingly range bound and has hardly crossed the mark To add to the woes of investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>released disappointing quarterly numbers last month The companys earnings of per share missed the analysts estimates by while the revenue of billion was inline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors may have started to grow tired of the companys misfortunes and a jump in short interest shows that many have started to bet against the company Despite Fords troubles I think bailing on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at this point of time is a terrible idea The company has invested billions of dollars over the last two years in order to increase market share and boost profits And to sell the stock when the company is on the verge of reaping the benefits of its investment is a bad idea Hence I think investors should look past its latest earnings report and hold on to the stock Although an earnings miss is nothing to be happy about Fords earnings report was not as bad as it looks Over the conference call Fords CFO Bob Shanks said that a large portion of Fords billion revenue drop can be attributed to the increased strength of the US dollar Another cause of concern was the plunge in Fords F sales The Fseries trucks have been Fords bestselling vehicle for consecutive years and are also the companys most important profitgenerator While the dip is bad news I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to make up for the lost ground in the second half of the year As I have mentioned in one of my previous articles due to the new F having aluminum body panels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had to shut down its two major factories to make the changeovers The changeover at Fords Rouge factory was completed in while the other factory is expected to be converted in the coming weeks As the production of the F accelerates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will regain lost market share as the demand for the efficient F is high Regaining market share will largely add to Fords profits as Shanks said Fords pretax profit would have been roughly billion higher and operating margin in the US would have been easily over percent which gives you a feel for what might coming later in the year Looking at the companys April sales statistics its clear that sales of the new F are improving at a rapid rate The company said half of F sales in April were the version up from percent in March and the average selling price or ASP was the highest ever at roughly more than last year Due to better efficiency and higher towing capacity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can command elevated prices for the F According to Automotive News calculations each F sold contributed over to Fords profit and if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>meets the forecast of FSeries sales in it will contribute over billion to Fords profit Given that Fords monthslong factory overhaul will be complete in the coming weeks I expect Fords stock to breakout in the second half of For investors who have held on to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>during the last few months selling now would be a terrible idea Fords factory overhaul is nearly complete and I expect F sales to pick up soon The increase in the average selling price along with the production rampup will enhance the companys bottomline Moreover despite being range bound <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has always had a juicy dividend yield which now stands at and is too attractively priced to ignore The company is currently trading at a forward PE of and is a buy at present levels Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
