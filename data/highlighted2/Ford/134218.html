Conference Call Please be advised that this call is being recorded I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr Brian Ector Senior Vice President Capital Markets and Public Affairs Please go ahead Mr Ector Thank you Anthony Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for doing this today to discuss the second quarter financial and operating results With me today are Jim Bowzer our President and Chief Executive Officer Rod Gray our Chief Financial Officer and Rick Ramsay our Chief Operating Officer While listening please keep in mind as some of our remarks will contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws I refer you to our advisories regarding forwardlooking statements oil and gas information and nonGAAP financial measures contained in todays press release All dollar amounts referenced in our remarks are in Canadian Dollars unless other specified and I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Thanks Brian and good morning everyone welcome to our second quarter conference call I think as everyone is aware these certainly are challenging times in oil and gas industry with the drop in crude prices over the last few weeks The industry continues to respond to the challenges of declining cash flows capital allocation decisions and then potentially increasing leverage I will get to our operational update in a couple of minutes But before doing so I want to start todays call by addressing our shareholders I know this hasnt been easy for you over the past few weeks and it hasnt been easy for us We are all shareholders of Baytex and I want to assure you that we will continue to manage our operations in interest of creating longterm shareholder value One of our key attributes of Baytex is our portfolio of projects With strong capital efficiencies and attractive rates of return and these projects will serve us well as we move forward in a lower oil price environment I want to start by talking about our financial position because we have already taken many steps to maintain strong levels of financial liquidity These steps have included reducing our capital spending and monthly dividend negotiating cost savings with service providers amending our financial covenants extending the term of our bank line and completing an equity financing Our balance sheet and liquidity were significantly enhanced during the second quarter as we raised million in equity which was applied to reduce bank debt In addition there were no way criminal borrowings during the second quarter to fund our capital or dividend programs Our credit facility consists of a billion Canadian facility and a million US facility With the newly extended maturity date of June These facilities do not require any mandatory principle repayments prior to maturity and can be further extended beyond June with the consent of the lenders As of June we had approximately billion in undrawn capacity on these facilities In addition we have billion of longterm debt with no mature repayments required till Our total monetary debt at end of the second quarter is billion which results in a debttoEBITDA ratio of times based on the trailing months period As a reminder a revised financial covenants now allow this ratio to reach a maximum of times through mid and times through December So with that background about our solid financial position Ill turn to the highlights for the quarter itself First on our operations during the second control quarter we continue to execute our capital program as planned and the results are consistent with the expectations we have In response to the weakness in modern prices our overall level of spending was lower for the third consecutive quarter as we deferred activity in Canada and reduced activity in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Reflective of our reduced activity our production averaged BOEs a day in the second quarter as compared to BOEs a day in the first quarter Capital expenditures for exploration and development activities totalled million in the quarter down from million in the first quarter and also down from million in the fourth quarter of During the quarter we participated in the drilling of gross or net wells Our production guidance remains unchanged at to barrels a day with full year capital spending of million to million Our capital program remains flexible and allows for adjustments to second half spending Speaking to our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>operations production average BOEs a day during the second quarter compared to BOEs a day during the first quarter and BOEs a day during the fourth quarter of last year Capital expenditures totalled million for the second quarter which are down from million in the first quarter and down from million in the fourth quarter Reflective of our scale back activity in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we reduced the number of drilling rigs on our lands from in the late to five currently In addition the number of frac crews has been reduced from three in to averaging between one and two currently Of the gross well that commenced production during the second quarter of those wells have been producing for more than days and have established an average day initial production rate of approximately BOEs per day In addition to targeting the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>formation We are still actively delineating the Austin Chalk formation The number of wells on our lands producing from the Austin Chalk is now with an average day initial producing rate of approximately BOEs per day Additional advancements have been made to delineate the multizone development potential of our Sugarkane acreage We have initiated stack and frac pilots which target up to three zones in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>formation in addition to the overlying Austin Chalk Recent production data from two pads which includes a total of nine wells that targeted three zones achieve day initial production rates per well ranging from BOEs to BOEs per day We now have multizone projects in various stages of execution and production In Canada our assets continue to perform as expected with the limited capital investment Production in Canada that average just over BOEs a day during the second quarter as compared to BOEs per day in the first quarter These reduced volumes in Canada are a result of lower drilling activity The decommissioning of our Gemini SAGD pilot project and on economic production that we have shut in As you may recall our development activity in Canada includes limited spend in the first half of the year and a modest program in the second half of the year As a result capital expenditures for Canadian assets totalled approximately million in the quarter down from million in the first quarter At Lloydminster we have drilled two horizontal wells and at Peace River no drilling occurred during the quarter Corporately we generated funds from operations of million or per share and maintained a conservative payout ratio net of our dividend reinvestment of We generated an operating get back in the second quarter of per BOE or per BOE including hedging gains Our Canadian operations generated an operating net back of per BOE while the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generated operating net back per BOE Our live oil and condensate production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is priced primarily off of Louisiana Light Sweet benchmark which typically trades at a premium to WTI This strong pricing combined with low cash cost contributed positively to our operating net back in the quarter With respect to our marketing efforts our third quarter crude oil hedge position amounts to approximately of our net WTI exposure with fixed at approximately US per barrel The unrealized financial derivatives gain with respect to our WTI hedges is at June was approximately million As part of our hedging program we also focus on opportunities to mitigate the volatility in heavy oil differentials by transporting crude oil to markets by rail when economics warrant We have no fixed investment or take or pay obligations to transport crude oil by rail The recent growth and rail infrastructure around our core heavy oil producing regions has allowed us to optimize deliveries by pipe and rail In the second quarter approximately barrels per day of our heavy volumes were delivered to market by rail And for the third quarter we expect to deliver approximately barrels per day of our heavy oil to market by rail In summary given the low crude price environment We remained focused on prudently managing our operations to maintain strong levels of financial liquidity The execution of our capital program has yielded impressive results in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as we advance to multizone development potential of our acreage And in Canada our assets continue to perform as expected with the limited program to Through negotiated cost saving with service providers our portfolio development opportunities in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Peace River and Lloydminster continue to provide attractive returns And with that I will conclude my formal remarks and ask the operator to please open the call for questions I just wanted to get a sense of the breakdown in production for your Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells in terms of condensate in the NLG and gas for the more recent wells Our breakdown is about on average liquids or so with about of that volume being in NGLs The condensate and crude oil were right across the window in between retrograde condensate to volatile oil as we drill these wells So its pretty difficult to separate out what is crude from condensate and the remainder is gas They vary and we havent really quoted EURs Nima but they vary from area to area in the across the field and across the liquids window that we have Okay Thank you And just wanted to get a sense are you seeing any further There were no changes in terms of the cost per well for Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I know just for the over the most recent presentation do you see any opportunity for further savings down the road or is it just a matter of time or have you hit the bottom in terms of squeezing further costs on the CapEx for a well As you know we were AFEing ph these wells and spending about million US per well that number that we had targeted was for the second quarter was getting down around million per well I dont think weve seen the bottom yet in terms of what that could be where were hopeful that you know the drilling times and the costs will continue to improve as we go through Okay Just wanted to get one sort of housekeeping question Would you be able to provide the breakdown for Peace River and Lloydminster production for the second quarter of Yes were getting that For Q Peace River was about barrels a little over barrels a day and almost barrels a day from Lloyd in the second quarter Yes why dont you call Brian after the call and hell get you the breakdown for previous quarters if youre interested in that Great thank you And that final question just one question on Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and one question on the rest of Canada You mentioned that Canadian declines and there wasnt much spent ED were roughly Is that indicative of the broad decline rates for those properties If you go back we have quoted upwards of to declines that would be a base decline If you actually calculate quarteronquarter it was around if you analyze the decline that we saw and its a pretty good number because we you know we had very very little activity there You do need to adjust for the shutins that we had during the quarter but when you make those adjustments Were probably in the to decline range that we saw So its a good to maybe even if you stretch to potentially lower but so were very pleased with that Yes overall we got about you know the corporate decline we would have quoted across all of Baytex So I said about to what we would use to quote on kind of the heavy oil And when you mix that with the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the mid on an average for the base production plus the new wells you know we were kind to add decline rate and I think all of those numbers will be coming down Partly because the base business certainly seems to be performing better than we expected from a decline rate and secondly were not bringing on as nearly as many high decline wells in any of our plays The initial wells certainly have on year one in production a higher decline rate So theres a lot less of that its occurring so we should see those continue to moderate Thank you There are no further questions retrospect this time Id like to turn it over to the panel for closing remarks All right well thank
