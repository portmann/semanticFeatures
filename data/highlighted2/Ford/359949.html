Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with BHP Billiton is going well as the partnership cranks down costs while boosting well productivity The average oil price required to break even in the prolific DeWitt County is barrel In the often forgotten Barnett shale Devon Energys horizontal restimulation program is outperforming expectations but natural gas prices are too low to justify full scale development At the end of Devon Energy Corporation NYSE DVN was running five rigs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>through its joint venture with BHP Billiton Limited NYSE BHP The JV was developing net acres in DeWitt County one of the most economical areas of the prolific Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>play down in Texas All of that acreage is fully derisked with at least one producing well in each drilling unit Devon also owns net acres in the neighboring Lavaca County which is less developed and less economical than its DeWitt position In Q Devon pumped out a net BOEd oil NGLs from its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>asset Devon noted that the rough breakeven oil price required for Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells in DeWitt County is around barrel one of the lowest in the entire play As that number is significantly higher in Lavaca County Devon is focusing primarily on developing its JV acreage In Devon and BHP plan to run two to three drilling rigs and one frac crew in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for a cost of million net to Devon Source Devon Energy Corporation Operations Report Since acquiring its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>position back in early Devon and BHP have been able to boost day IP rates in DeWitt County from BOEd to BOEd by Q Several of the joint ventures wells have exceeded that rate significantly including the Rayes B H BOEd Wagner B H BOEd Wagner B H BOEd Wagner B H BOEd and Hartman A H BOEd Devons average day IP rate in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>came in at BOEd materially higher than many of its peers On the drilling speed front Devon reported that it was able to drill wells in DeWitt County per rig per year in up from in That came in at wells in Q Faster drilling times and cheaper thirdparty rates enabled Devon to lower its completed well cost in DeWitt County by over versus its peak to million The combination of cheaper completed well costs and better well productivity greatly enhanced Devons and BHP Billitons drilling economics creating an incentive to keep developing the JVs position in the current environment Devons LOE costs moved lower last year versus with its Q LOE coming in at BOE well below its average of BOE Another aspect boosting the partnerships returns is the ability to export condensate On average Devon exported bpd of condensate in enabling the company to realize a pricing uplift of barrel Due to the relatively thick and high quality nature of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reservoir Devon began testing out a staggered well lateral program in the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>during the second half of As you can see in the graph below this may enable Devon and BHP to bring more wells online on their JV acreage wells are going to be drilled and completed in the southern undeveloped portion of the DeWitt County position with production results expected during the first half of The biggest thing to watch is whether the wells communicate or interfere with each others production Source Devon Energy Corporation Operations Report If successful Devon sees this lateral spacing strategy boosting its drilling inventory by over locations That would increase its portfolio to over possible well locations with room for additional upside through the delineation of the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>horizon and the future development of its Lavaca acreage In a play that hasnt gotten much attention since surging natural gas production out of the Marcellus and Utica shales sent Henry Hub spiraling lower Devon is testing its luck on horizontal restimulation efforts This comes after Devon recompleted vertical wells in the Barnett play which like the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is located in Texas last year Devon was able to push down the recompletion costs to as low as cheaper than initially estimated with the average per well uplift of Mcfd exceeding type curve expectations by At the end of of Devons legacy vertical Barnett wells had been restimulated With over horizontal wells in the Barnett shale Devon has plenty to work with To start things off Devon launched a pilot well refrac program under the assumption each recompletion job would cost around million and yield a day IP uplift of MMcfd Out of the wells that had been online long enough to reach a peak day IP rate from its well pilot program which was boosted from its initial well program the average day IP uplift came in at MMcfd above its guidance That is equal to a rough increase in per well production and a strong sign that this program may have legs Refrac costs have also been coming in lower than expected as recent refracturing jobs are coming in close to million Combined with large declines in its Barnett LOE and production taxes which came in at a combined Mcfe in Q down quarteroverquarter Devon has enough of an incentive to test out refracking an additional six wells this year However with natural gas prices so low Devon is holding off on moving towards full field deployment of its refrac program until natural gas prices recover Devon Energy Corporation is sitting on a nice billion cash pile pro forma for its equity raise which added billion to its billion cash balance at the end of Cuts to its common dividend workforce reductions lower thirdparty rates and operational gains are helping Devon save billion a year Add in a reduction in capital expenditures which are guided to come in around billion this year and Devons financial trajectory looks solid The upstream player has million in debt maturing in Q with the next maturity not coming up until Q which will be easy to service as Devon deploys cash raised from its upstream divestitures to pay down debt In another good piece of news the Access Pipeline is expected to be sold off during the first half of enabling Devon to plug its potential outspend As Devon no longer faces a probable cash crunch the company can camp wait out the downturn then strike while the iron is hot in the event of a pricing recovery If oil prices recover Devon Energy can ramp up its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>drilling activity If natural gas prices recover Devon Energy can move forward with its horizontal well restimulation program in the Barnett shale Devon will continue to trade in tandem with West Texas Intermediate prices more or less with an asymmetrical upsidedownside profile noncore asset sales strong balance
