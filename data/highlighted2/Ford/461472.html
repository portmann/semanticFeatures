Simple Look At Fords Debt And Cash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a balance sheet that can confound both new and experienced investors The nature of the business is fairly complex and makes it difficult to accurately asses the capital structure which leads to rampant misinformation concerning the cash and especially the debt If you follow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F here on Seeking Alpha you have likely stumbled upon the many articles that misdiagnose Fords debt and sometimes cash Ive done it before in my first article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Im still ashamed of myself for that I should probably just delete that disaster but it is useful as a reminder of what not to do I wont call out any other articles that arent my own but about once a week a new one pops up that completely misses the boat on Fords debt Im not advocating that anybody purchase shares in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but understanding the balance sheet may help with that personal decision The first problem with Fords balance sheet that many run into is likely the source of information I usually have two Safari windows open when Im looking into a company one with six or seven tabs and another dedicated to just SEC EDGAR tabs One of the tabs is always Morningstar Morningstar is a great free and premium resource for investing research and provides a ton of information in an easily digestible format Unfortunately it can also display inaccurate or misleading information as it does with Fords balance sheet The screenshot above is what Morningstar displays for Fords consolidated balance sheet Starting at the top it shows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the last quarter We go down a little further and see short term debt reported as billion and longterm debt at a staggering billion for billion total Most investors at this point would swear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>off altogether Unfortunately what we have here is both misreported and misunderstood figures If we pull up Fords most recent Q from the SEC we start to see things with a little more clarity The first problem we can see is what Morningstar reports as cash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>itself reported just billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Even if we try to stretch what can be considered cash getting to billion is a challenge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also does a much better job at attempting to differentiate its debt They split it up as Automotive debt and Financial Services debt which coincidentally matches what Morningstar reports as shortterm and longterm debt respectively Even though they split it up it could still be confusing debt is debt after all and investors may not be aware of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit and what it does for the company The Automotive debt is what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company holds on the balance sheet for the automotive segment of their business They could have taken on that debt for retooling at the factories research and development marketing recall costs or just buying printer paper and ink It is the debt that many other businesses may possess The Financial Services debt is what gets most people twisted up This debt is the vehicles that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold or leased through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit to both retail customers and dealerships and other distributors Through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit the company carries secured debt like a home mortgage would be for Wells Fargo NYSE WFC for this reason it is best to view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit like a bank So long as people pay off their car note our beloved <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>makes out pretty well on this debt If they do not pay their note then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can always repossess the car and resell to recoup some of those losses This last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit contributed million in pretax profit Of course this type of debt opens them up to delinquencies and losstoreceivables <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>addresses this risk by maintaining a warchest separate from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor in the amount of million this last quarter to cover losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit is also selffunding and selfliquidating in nature combine that with the highquality credit they lend to and the risk is much less than first assumed Ive grown quite fond of this segment of their business and have written on it a little bit It is worth noting that not all financial services debt is secured That being the case the company will have paid back billion of that unsecured debt within a year leaving billion in unsecured longterm debt to deal with Knowing what we know now about that scary debt figure we can see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>actually has a pretty great balance sheet Total assets come in at billion and total liabilities at billion for net assets of billion Now lets circle back to the cash which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also breaks down for us in detail and even splits up into the Automotive and Financial sectors The only thing Im curious about is where their nonUS government cash is being placed since yields in other industrialized countries are near zero or even negative meaning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could be losing cash here It will be interesting to watch these figures quarter to quarter and see if the company begins shifting more cash to nongovernment securities to get a better return To summarize the cashdebt situation is not so dire at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as some assume The basic numbers are not as bad as many believe The company goes to great lengths to ensure their debt and cash is better understood Unfortunately a quick glimpse at sources like Morningstar can greatly mislead investors of all skill levels and it is important to get as close to the source as possible The old adage trust but verify cannot be overstated here I hope you all got something out of this article I do appreciate the time you took reading it If you are one of those
