style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a small player in India which is not good news as auto sales in this market are expected to double by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however has been mildly successful in increasing market share in India of late on the back of new product launches and is trying to sustain this momentum <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking to make spare parts cheaper introduce more subparts and increase affordability of spares in order to further increase sales in India In a recent article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F I had focused on how the companys focus on the SUV segment in two of the fastestgrowing automotive markets in the world will allow it to improve its margin performance in the long run In fact Fords Asia Pacific president Dave Schoch believes of Fords growth in the next decade will come from Asia Pacific Now India will be one of the most important cogs for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the Asia Pacific as auto sales in this country are expected to double to million units by the end of the decade as compared to However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still a minor player in India with just market share and sold just units in India last year thereby clocking a monthly run rate of less than units As compared to the millions of vehicles that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold across the globe last year this is a very small number However while this represents a challenge for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>since it has low market share it also gives the company an opportunity to make the most of the prospects that the Indian market will offer in the long run Lets see if the company is doing enough to tap the opportunity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>India has been performing well this year In February it sold units up from units sold last year The growth in sales was driven by exports which have been the focus of auto majors in India in the recent past Global auto majors like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GM NYSE GM and Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY are investing heavily in the country However these carmakers arent up to the mark in the Indian market so they are focusing more on exports For instance Fords domestic sales have been flat at best this year In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw a decline of in domestic sales in the month of February in India The Blue Oval sold units last month in India compared to units last year The domestic market share of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been moving within the to range all through this fiscal year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still remains in the bottom rungs of the Indian car industry with an average market share of On the other hand on the export front Fords sales nearly doubled from units in February to units in February However other companies are targeting growth of to for their Indian operations in terms of production due to their multibilliondollar investments This clearly indicates companies are planning to make India a manufacturing hub which will cater to other more vibrant markets in the neighborhood and even the far West The following chart shows the growth in Fords exports A key reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>lies in the lower rungs of the lineup of car makers in the Indian market is because of stiff competition The Indian car market has been long ruled by the Japanese Maruti Suzuki which commands a near of the market share with its affordable and high mileage offerings which the Indian customers love Following Maruti are other Asian brands like Hyundai MM Honda Tata and Toyota which have a much longer and successful experience of selling cars in India as compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>who once had to shut shop earlier due to heavy losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reentered the Indian market in but this second innings hasnt been very successful so far However as seen in the first chart given in the article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been able to improve its market share of late in India and the company will try to sustain the momentum by investing in its models Lets see how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hasnt left hopes yet about doing well in India The USbased car maker is bringing in major changes in its sales marketing strategy for India as it looks to change itself into a big player in this market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has identified certain key areas that need to be addressed in order to increase its sales and maintain customer loyalty The first area is productled innovation As a part of this plan Fords new models for the Indian market have been equipped with new features in order to make its vehicles more attractive to buyers For instance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has equipped the Figo Aspire with cruise control and also deployed semiassisted selfparking in the Endeavour which are segmentfirst features in India Another area to be addressed as identified by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>India is the cost of spare parts components and maintenance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still perceived to be expensive to maintain in India and the Indian customer likes cheap maintenance a lot As a result <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has improved the maintaining ability of its new models by increasing the number of subassembly parts from around for the Figo hatchback in to for the new Figo and Aspire models This will allow customers to replace only the required part in case of damage and not the entire unit Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has worked on component price reduction as well by increasing the percentage of locallysourced parts apart from enhancing the distribution channel for spare parts and components This has been achieved by allowing nondealer workshops to sell genuine accessories and also amplifying the number of service centers closer to customers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has tried to increase its market share in India by introducing new cars recently and the results are showing as its market share has ticked up slightly Additionally the companys focus on improving the service and maintenance experience is also going to work in its favor going forward So in my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can step on the gas in the Indian market gradually and add to its overall growth considering the opportunity present here Disclosure Iwe have no positions
