style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has seen its stock price decline due to the slowdown in China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generates the vast majority of its profit in the US which continues to grow Europe has seen a turnaround and should be profitable in the coming quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F is a widely held widely owned stock and is commonly and frequently discussed on Seeking Alpha I have been invested in the company for a few years now The stock has not been a strong performer per se it is currently down over for the year It has been up and down for the last few years but has traded in the band between and We have seen small movements above or below these marks but they have not lasted for long The day moving average is almost right in the middle of the range I own the stock for the long term and I feel the current dip in the share price makes a great buying opportunity Stock prices fluctuate for a number of reasons Sometimes the cause is a macro event that affects the market or the industry as a whole Then there is the micro side of things In this case I would use the microeconomic approach to describe the situation at a more companyspecific level There are a few macros and micros to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that I would like to discuss I believe that examining the company from multiple viewpoints can help us find the value in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as an investment The markets have taken a beating in the last few weeks Despite the fact that they attempted a comeback the SP still lost over in August and was down by close to at one point This large sell off can be attributed to a few different things but the largest cause of this sell off was the slowdown in China and the large declines that the market has seen there The government in China has tried to curb the selling the markets but has not had too much success in doing so It has continued to lower its lending rates it has eased restrictions on what certain funds can invest in it has even allowed companies to pull their stocks from trading and there are more but the point of my article is not to discuss the methods that China is using to buoy up its economy Despite the efforts of the government to keep the market up the slowdown has sent many investors into a panic Once the slowdown was seen the selling began and the high rates of trading on margin in the country has caused the drop to be more drastic The point here being is that China has seen a slowdown and it has caused all the world markets to take a step back China is major economic world player The slowdown there has caused selling to take place worldwide The slowdown in China can have a global effect The economy there is large enough to have many ripple effects throughout many different regions It is my view that it is not going to get that bad There is slowdown occurring in the Chinese economy I just dont feel it is going to cause a global meltdown The US economy continues to grow steadily But there is a chance that we could see some slowdown for other markets China has been the hottest car market for many years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was slow to get into the country and it does not have near the presence there that many automakers have We can compare to its biggest rival here in the US General Motors NYSE GM sold million cars last year in China that is compared to million cars sold in the US Sales in China equal percent of total sales on a volume basis for GM This is compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which sold million vehicles last year in China as compared to million sold in the US Sales in China equal percent of total sales on a volume basis for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In the most recent quarter sales in Asia made up only percent of total revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>This has long been a benefit that GM has had over its rival F In the short term the slowdown in China will have a much larger impact on GM than F as it has a much bigger presence in China There is one thing that could cause an investor to fret and this is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has made many investments in China which have brought up the fixed costs in the country This may cause its margin to be damaged in the coming quarters if the volume of vehicles sold slows down It has potential to become like Europe a large amount of sales without any profit due to the high costs This is not a situation that investors want to see I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>learned a lesson in Europe and that it will not make the same mistake in China by expanding too fast I also dont see the slowdown in China becoming a permanent problem The country may see a slowdown in its economic growth I dont see this slowdown becoming a stall in their economy At the same time I wouldnt bet on seeing growth in the car market like we have seen in past years The car market in China very well may be slowing down that does not mean there is still not plenty of potential for growth there especially on an individual company basis As was mentioned in the previous section the amount of sales that comes from the Asian market make up a small part of total sales for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>When looking at the breakdown by geographical region you can see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>depends on North America for its profits The US economy continues to grow While the growth is not at a rapid pace the auto industry has shown strong growth and has not shown signs of slowing down The table below breaks down Fords revenues and operating income by geographical region as reported in the most recent quarterly report The North American market makes up of total revenues for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The second largest market is Europe making up We can see that Asia is the third largest market making up While these numbers show the dominance of the North American market when you look at the operating profit you can see even more the importance of this market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>While the North American market makes up of revenues it makes up of operating profit As the South American Europe and Middle East Africa markets operate at a loss The Asian market provides of operating profit Not only is the largest amount of revenue generated in North America it also operates the highest margin At the moment the profitability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>heavily relies on the North American market The US economy continues to show growth So despite the slowdown in China that caused the stock price to crash the revenues for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will continue to grow due to the growth in the US market A sub note that cant really go without discussing is the new F If you are reading this article and are not aware of the new aluminum F then there are a huge collection of articles on this site that you can read in depth about I dont want to go into a deep discussion about it but it is a very important factor for the companys profitability The Fseries trucks make up a substantial portion of revenues and profit for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Now that all the plants are at full production we have already seen the strong sales numbers from the past month During the month of August the company sold Fseries trucks which was good for percent growth from the previous year That is the first full month that the company has had full production of the truck I would expect to continue to see strong sales number for the truck as inventories are built up This was reconfirmed during the monthly update While the company has been converting its manufacturing facilities to be able to produce the new aluminum F and while supply has been constrained the company has focused on the retail market as it is more profitable The normal ratio of sales to retail and fleet sales is During the month of August even with the strong number of sales the company sold at a ratio of This shows that there is room for a lot of room for sales increases as the company is able to build more inventory to satisfy the retail market it can pursue more fleet sales This means that we should see an increase in the number of F trucks in the coming months as well which drives larger profits in the North American market While many are concerned about the slowdown in China they seem to be overlooking the progress that is being made in Europe The auto industry as a whole is showing strong growth there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is growing even faster I briefly touched on the issues that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been having in Europe Despite it being the second largest market it terms of revenue and volume for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>it currently operates at a loss The company put a plan into place and the turnaround plan in Europe is working The company planned to be profitable in Europe for The ordeal with Russia put a small kink in that plan The company has still been able to execute its plan and expects to be profitable in As we can see in the chart below the company has been able to boost its margins in the region This is partly due to some restructuring the company closed two factories in the UK and an assembly plant in Belgium The remaining factories are running at higher production rate making them more profitable Also the company has introduced new products in the region and also focused more on the higher margin retail sales Another strong catalyst for future periods in the region is the Mustang <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>already has over orders for the Mustang in Europe which is being sold this year for the first time I would expect it to show strong sales in future periods helping give a boost to the region and its profitability Looking at the loss in the most recent quarter of million I feel that it is a good assumption that the company will be profitable in Europe for the third quarter hold any catastrophes in the area The company should only see its margins grow as total vehicle sales in the region grow and as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to take market share With more efficient operations in the region the future looks much better for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Europe Even if the company would have broke even in the past year it would have seen billion more income The gain that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is seeing in Europe should offset the slowdown that the company is seeing in China Europe is the second largest sales region for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Company If they can continue to grow their margins in Europe then China should have only a small effect in terms of the company as a whole for the remainder of the year Macro Low Fuel Prices and Low Interest Rates Interest rates seem to remain low which bodes well for sales of vehicles We will wait and see what the Fed does come September and December but regardless I do not see rates rising too fast We are still in a period of low interest rates which bodes well for automobile companies There is also the positive that many are not considering and that is the low oil prices Gas prices have been holding higher due to the low amount of refining available but the prices will not hold up for long Lower gas prices means that people will drive more It can easily attribute to more money in the pockets of consumers which might cause them to look at upgrading their current vehicle Micro <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Selling More SUVs and Trucks The more profitable units for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are their SUVs and Trucks These vehicles do not get as good of gas mileage and so when gas prices are high sales for these vehicles tends to wane Well it appears that gas prices are going down and they could stay down for some time This translates into better sales for the more profitable vehicles for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and other car manufacturers going forward In August <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw its truck line increase percent from the previous year and the SUV rose percent Micro Low Interest Low Borrowing Costs Low interest rates have helped drive new vehicle sales Consumers are able to borrow at lower rates and make the purchase of a new car much more affordable Rates continue to be very low making the cost of borrowing very low There is the continued watching to see if the Fed will raise rates this month or come December Regardless if rates are raised or not in September or this year I would expect the rate increases will be small and slow This means that borrowers should continue to see low borrowing costs into the near future The market was sent into a bit of a panic over the past few weeks with weak economic data coming out of China The sell off for the auto industries was quite large <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw its stock price fall below While there is reason for concern over China as we have seen sales in the country stall and currently shows no growth from the prior year I do not think that the concern is as large as it is being made out to be at least for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The company generates the high majority of its revenues in North America the economy here in the US continues to grow The company has strong catalysts the F and Mustang in particular for the remainder of the year to continue strong sales growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe the second largest market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is showing that it has seen a turnaround and should show a profit in the coming quarters These positives will outweigh the negative that is coming from China in the coming quarters Over the long term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does need to grow its sales in China it is the largest auto market in the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>management came out and said that they have seen a slowdown but still are positive on the region in the long term That is the best way to look at this from an investment perspective In the near term profitability will continue to grow due to the factors discussed above and over the long term I expect that China still has growth to come My suggestion is to take advantage of the low price before it is too late The stock has been on the rise since closing at on August th I expect the price to continue to climb as the company continues to grow revenues despite the slowdown in China Disclosure I amwe are long F MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
