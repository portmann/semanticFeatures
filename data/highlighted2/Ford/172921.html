Sizemore Insights clicks Sep PM ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company F Includes GM by Charles Lewis Sizemore CFA The market is in correction mode right now so its not a fun time to be buying much of anything But these are precisely the times you need to be putting your buy list together While the overall market is still expensive and may have further to fall there are some outstanding bargains out there For those with an iron gut this is the time to start nibbling Lets take a look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has taken a nose dive in and is now down about from its week high China woes Fed angst and volatility in general have all conspired to depress the companys stock price But looking past the headlines there is a lot to like about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Lets take a look Well start with valuation No matter how you slice it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is cheap at todays prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>changes hands at just times expected earnings and it sports a year cyclicallyadjusted price earnings ratio CAPE of just If you use a year CAPE which would only include the healthier postcrisis years you get an even cheaper Stripping out the accounting gimmicks that can manipulate earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trades at times sales And lets not forget that that sales have been depressed for years Auto sales fell off of a cliff during the meltdown and have only recently returned to precrisis levels If you can believe it annual American auto sales are still below the levels of the early s despite the fact that the American population has grown by more than million people since then Fords dividend yield is also one of the highest among major American companies at As seeing as how the company only pays out about of its depressed profits in dividends I would say the dividend is safe for the foreseeable future If you owned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>during the mids this might be something of a sore spot The company cut its dividend in and eliminated it altogether a quarter later as it worked through some very difficult times But since reinstating its quarterly dividend in at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has tripled it to I expect more dividend hikes to come I understand that the American auto industry has been facing major headwinds for decades Foreign competition is relentless and American automakers have the added difficultly of struggling to compete with a punishingly strong dollar Plus better public transit and the rise of Uber Pending UBER has made a car a lot less necessary in major urban areas And capping it off Millennials as a generation are just flatout less interested in driving than previous generations I get all of that But the average age of American cars still on the road just hit an alltime record this year at years Thats not saying that the average life of a car before getting scrapped is years Thats the average age of cars currently in use That means that a significant portion of the American auto fleet is much older than that Hey cars are built better today than they were years ago and you can drive them for longer Sure But at some point they really do have to be replaced Americans have avoided making car purchases for years due to the sluggish economy and lack of wage growth That trend wont last forever Eventually the wheels fall off Im not currently long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Earlier this year I opted to buy competitor General Motors NYSE GM for essentially the same reasons General Motors valuation is in line with Fords though GM has the benefit of having a slightly cleaner slate after its bankruptcy swept away some of its legacy debts Are either of these stocks something I would want to hold for the long term Absolutely not The auto industry is extremely cyclical and one of the few remaining large industries still subject to extortion from labor unions These are not stocks I would want to own for the long haul But with a time horizon of years I expect both to post very respectable returns Disclaimer This site is for informational purposes only and should
