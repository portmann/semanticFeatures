performance set a number of records and its auto sales pace in June was reassuring The company continues to do well in China and while concerns over Brexit and challenging conditions in Brazil and Russia remain we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is on solid ground Our fair value estimate of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is but there is upside to the high end of our fair value range At times EPS its certainly a consideration Its cash balance is in excess of its autorelated debt and liquidity remains robust Bankruptcy risk at this time is minimal Is the market too punitive on shares We recently wrote on our website about some of the red flags we were witnessing in the US auto industry including our concerns about the subprime segment of the autoloan industry but the automakers have still come a long way from the depths of the Financial Crisis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F in particular is a much wiser company since then in our view and frankly its hard not to like the companys product lineup and continuous drive for efficiency Firsthalf sales across the industry werent bad June was particularly good for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and even the companys performance in China remains resilient in the face of uncertain economic conditions in the country We like this automakera lot and recent news was very welcome given somewhat concerning May performance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>set records almost across the board during its firstquarter results see image above released in April and especially in the areas where it counts Record company pretax profit and auto operatingrelated cash flow were solid during the period and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>morethandoubled net income operating earnings per share and its auto operating margin Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is doing a lot of things right and while we fully acknowledge the company is a cyclical industrial that is tied to fickle consumer demand it may not be as levered to the boomandbust characteristics of its pastie those that put GM NYSE GM and FiatChrysler NYSE FCAU into bankruptcy some years ago Brazil and Russia remain under pressure and the fallout from Brexit hasnt been fully realized yet but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains on solid ground in our view Heres the kicker Shares are trading at times operating earnings per share see below and the companys cash at the end of the first quarter of billion significantly exceeds its automotiverelated debt of billion Liquidity of more than billion suggests bankruptcy risk is also arguable the lowest its been in memory Is it time for shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to catapult or is the market still too jittery for consumerdriven industrial cyclicals What gives Were keeping a close eye on the company in any case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been around since the turn of last century and produces and sells automobiles The company also engages in other businesses including financing vehicles Recent performance has been its best since Sales in China have also been fantastic in recent quarters though global economic concerns will always be present US auto sales have experienced a strong run as of late was a record year for the industry in terms of sales and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was not left out of the growth as it continues to capture pentup demand from the Great Recession Average selling prices have increased due in part to improved product mix <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to implement its ONE FORD plan successfully and accelerate development of new vehicles customers want The company continues to have success driving operating margin improvement and has reduced North Americas structural costs by more than billion since Though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has seen turnaround expert and former CEO Alan Mulally leave we think COO Mark Fields is highly capable of running the automaker as the chief executive The middle to late portion of the decade is looking quite bright for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company Market share in China and sales of the F are worth watching closely We like the firms ability to generate strong automotive cash flow while reducing pension obligations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>now boasts an investmentgrade credit rating and expects to maintain it through the course of the economic cycle The best measure of a firms ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firms economic profit spread Fords year historical return on invested capital without goodwill is which is below the estimate of its cost of capital of As such we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of POOR In the chart below we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome in our opinion and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate Firms that generate a free cash flow margin free cash flow divided by total revenue above are usually considered cash cows Fords free cash flow margin has averaged about during the past years As such we think the firms cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow FCFF which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company At <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cash flow from operations increased about from levels registered two years ago while capital expenditures expanded about over the same time period We think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is worth per share with a fair value range of The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firms MEDIUM ValueRisk rating which is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them Our nearterm operating forecasts including revenue and earnings do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of during the next five years a pace that is lower than the firms year historical compound annual growth rate of Our model reflects a year projected average operating margin of which is above Fords trailing year average Beyond year we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of for the next years and in perpetuity Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows Although we estimate the firms fair value at about per share every company has a range of probable fair values thats created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers like future revenue or earnings for example After all if the future were known with certainty we wouldnt see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock In the graph above we show this probable range of fair values for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>We think the firm is attractive below per share the green line but quite expensive above per share the red line The prices that fall along the yellow line which includes our fair value estimate represent a reasonable valuation for the firm in our opinion We estimate Fords fair value at this point in time to be about per share As time passes however companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends The chart above compares the firms current share price with the path of Fords expected equity value per share over the next three years assuming our longterm projections prove accurate The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year represents our best estimate of the value of the firms shares three years hence This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time should our views on the firms future cash flow potential change The expected fair value of per share in Year represents our existing fair value per share of increased at an annual rate of the firms cost of equity less its dividend yield The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range This article or report and any links
