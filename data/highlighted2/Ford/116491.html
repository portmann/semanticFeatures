Alpha European sales numbers released on Tuesday show continued progress for Fords plan of global profitability Demand for Mustang in areas where the vehicle wasnt previously offered is promising This European report does well to reiterate our bull case global profitability will drive the bottom line and fuel the stock move long investors have been waiting for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F stock continues to do nothing which is old news if youre a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investor Chances are if youre long you dont mind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>heaping on a nearly annual yield at current prices The company is a different story however Month by month quarter by quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been executing on their plans to innovate their product line and expand the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>name across the globe With each month that passes we get decent domestic and global sales data continually guiding us to believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is moving in the right direction We have said for a while that profitability globally and the effect it will have on the bottom line is going to be the next catalyst to stop Fords stock price from being an immovable object Value investing is about finding companies that have been overlooked by the market or are simply valued at much lower than what theyre potentially worth in coming years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>meets this description for us in so many ways and the missing link that would let the market in on this Fords global profitability could be coming to fruition sooner than the market thinks Much of Fords ongoing bull case for us revolves around this While we hate to carry on every single time that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reports decent sales we do like that it offers us a guiding look at one of the main proponents to our long thesis This morning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported that sales in Europe rose YY in June to units Seeking Alpha stated that volume leaders were the Fiesta K Focus K and Kuga K models and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>added market share in Britain Germany Italy and France during June From a model standpoint the F and the Mustang were key pieces of our bull case We have long been bettors that the F and the Mustang would drive both domestic and global demand The Mustangs presence in foreign countries for the first time we long hoped would be a continued driving force for the company Another nice piece of reassurance in Junes report is that Mustang sales appear to be starting off strong in areas where the vehicle wasnt previously offered Wed like to take a second and once again review the valuation of the company as it stands The company trades at a very attractive x price to sales and a respectable x their book value At about x what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expected to earn next year nothing about Fords valuation seems overdone in a market where we believe that equities are starting to push their upper limits valuation wise Fords EVSales of x is extremely attractive The difference between that metric and its ballooning EVEBITDA of x all relates to earnings and earnings quality We believe that once global profitability begins to find serious traction and the companys EVEBITDA among other valuations begins to drop its going to be far more obvious what a great buy that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is We continue to be bulls on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and still believe there is a case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to trade well over in the future as the company secures global profitability Source <span style='background-color:
