The Dip In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shares Amidst Market Chaos <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Company declares B supplemental dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F has been doing things right for the most part as the market has turned downward Tuesday they introduced an outlook for that like many other estimates for the coming year has failed to impress the street The No US automaker said it expected record pretax profit excluding special items in the upper half of its outlook for billion to billion That is above the average analyst forecast of billion according to Thomson Reuters IBES Profit for will be at least as high excluding special items said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Analysts were expecting pretax profit of billion for on average This doesnt mean the company isnt being conservative with guidance as we feel other companies like Macys NYSE M are In addition to this the company announced a billion supplemental dividend for their shareholders The billion supplemental cash dividend or cents per share is in addition to the firstquarter regular dividend of cents per share which is unchanged from the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>paid billion in dividends last year up percent from A main question with the estimates just meeting expectations is whether or not the China market is going to be able to hold up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the midst of all of this turmoil The last few weeks have been turmoil for the stock market It looks as though our long held belief of a real correction is coming true While we do think there is more downside to the market we have begun looking around for value in areas that we think will be beneficial over the course of the long term When looking for a company to add on the dip which may continue dipping we are looking for a dividend paying value company that is going to be around for long enough to ride out both shortterm and the next longterm economic cycle If you think the same way now might be a great time to add <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock to your longterm holdings especially after the dip Tuesday on s outlook We have been bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the better part of the last few years and we have owned the stock on and off as we continue to rebalance our portfolio time and again The stock pays an attractive dividend here which we have advocated for reinvesting and we see these shortterm dips in the stock price as an opportunity to reinvest dividends or add to your holdings if you have a long term focus F Dividend Yield NYSE TTM data by YCharts The thing that makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>such an interesting stock to look at now is the fact that the company has invested billions in growing their market share in China This certainly seems to have spooked the market as the company has sold off in concert with the US equity markets since China has been selling off over the last two weeks But where others may see fear from this correction we continue to see opportunity Additionally China is only one of the countries that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is moving into as the company looks to expand internationally in places like South Africa India and Europe Most of these markets have been positive for the company and it has been our prediction that we will see a marked improvement in the companys stock price once the companys international investments start to pay off and show themselves on the companys bottom line You have to have a multiple year outlook on the company in order to invest based on this thesis This is not a international turnaround that is going to happen overnight and we believe that the companys strategy of reinvesting its capital in itself has been a prudent way to use the cash that it has In addition to this the company has had strong success as a backbone in the United States thats led primarily by its new Fseries models and classics like the Mustang One of the reasons that we are not worried about China is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to show promising data overseas Seeking Alpha reported a strong pop in China to end the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>China NYSE F reports it sold vehicles in December a increase from last years level Total <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>China sales to units We are going to continue to keep a very close eye on the company but as long as Fords expectations are modestly met overseas we still believe the company to be on a path for growth as a whole We do not believe that China and other Asian countries are in a auto bubble but we do believe that their economies are looking shaky This is the type of situation and scenario that we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can ride out over the course of the long term Not only do we expect shares to rise back to highs over but we do expect shares to move higher than that over the course of the next to years Mark Fields has done a fantastic job as CEO and we are exciting about the companys future prospects in the realm of self driving vehicles and in smart cars which are the newest investment for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>overseas We think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>unlike its competitor in General Motors has the inside track on innovation We know that General Motors recently paired with Lyft and we expect that investment to ultimately be a bust for them Lyft is a company that is not getting significant enough traction for us to take seriously and the partnership confuses us and we think it takes away from the General Motors name <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on the other hand has done a great job over the last two years in revitalizing not only its core brand but also its luxury brand in Lincoln The redesign and relaunch of Lincoln vehicles have been a success as anyone driving down a crowded highway will see for themselves Europe continues to have momentum and we continue to track European car registrations Recent data reported by Seeking Alpha continues to look promising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F reports sales in Europe rose in to M units Fords SUV sales were higher during the year led by strong demand for the Kuga and EcoSport models We continue to look at sales data on a monthly basis and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to post metrics that give us confidence and optimism that the business is healthy and robust We believe the company is going to be able to ride out the next downturn in the economic cycle just like they did in as the only US domestic automaker to not receive bailout money We think that if you were looking for an opportunity to maybe start moving into a position now that the market has dipped that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should grab your attention Trading at less than eight times earnings the companys valuation is conservative even for an auto maker Last weeks jobs number and suggests to us that the United States economy may be in far better shape than overseas and we expect the domestic backbone of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sales to hold up
