Reasons Why I Bought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha I recently picked up shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to increase my diversification out of energy with the dividend being a major buying point The economic data we are currently receiving will work to Fords advantage especially outside of the United States <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has been a very average stock over the LTM While investors were continually disappointed with the volatility that was hitting the stock despite the companys strong performance I started to take a look at the equity myself to see if it was an attractive LT addition There are three reasons I am currently picking up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in my portfolio the favorable economic data after a record year for the company a sizeable dividend and a greater riskreward scenario In Europe we have the company increasing its market share by bp to YOY with car registrations up in January More importantly perhaps is that sales were up in January for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe Thats exceptional when we start to think about the fear that has begun to swell around the markets with the word recession continually in headlines Additionally on the global scale well start to see a small reduction in operating costs as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>adds more production in its two factories in Mexico at San Luis Potosi and Mexico City While theres no denying the fact that corporate earnings across the broader market have begun to decline we look to Fords bottom line to provide us with some relief <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>grew adjusted EPS from in Q to in Q with adjusted net income showing an increase on the same time frame from billion to billion These are two notable statistics that warrant a buy in my opinion Furthermore I know individuals are concerned the decrease in US vehicle sales YOY for January with the FSeries being a laggard We can call it an anomaly month due to warmer weather or we can accept that it happened and look months forward to when the company will already have an easier comp set in stone The report has likely already been priced into the stock I believe investors are too quick to forget that this is the company that sold a record number of vehicles last year at million This is also the company that generated billion more in net income YOY to end the full year and this is the company who more than tripled revenue in Understanding that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has the capacity to continue to perform and generate strong earnings makes the stock look favorable to me Naturally a year like that would warrant a surge in Fords stock but this is a low beta stock and the SP was and continues to remain volatile as the broader market is weighed down by factors not directly related to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>like lower for longer crude oil prices Naturally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is projecting a sizeable demand from consumers especially domestically over the next few years considering theyre launching four new models From a mature company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I have to see growth catalysts and an initiative like this shows me that management is confident in the multiyear outlook for car consumers Im a college junior so that largely means I have a higher risk tolerance than most investors however I recognize the value that current income can have in a portfolio especially if the dividends are collected over a long period of time and reinvested <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is sporting a dividend yield of on a Y net growth rate of I want that last figure to really sink in Projected over another three years all else equal the stock would be paying a yield of at the beginning of Collecting current income in an uncertain market like the one were experiencing is a key strategy to keep your portfolio safer than others When it comes to dividends I like to know that management wants to outperform The average SP dividend yield is and the average DJIA yield is Fords yield clearly trumps both of these Especially if the major averages start to decline and individuals start to see notable losses in their equities the inflows are going to come to stable yielders on great growth rates like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Unfortunately I did not catch the shares in time for the special cash dividend of representing an individual current yield of annualized as the exdate was January A function I enjoy using for dividend paying equities is Bloombergs dividend discount model According to this model the theoretical price per share should be which would represent upside from the current share price The RiskReward Scenario Was Renewed After a very average year of performance in we saw <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continually fluctuate in the range topping a few times Going back even further the stock had two sustained runs above in If the stock at all bounces back to the level it was trading at before the new year began Ill make on top of the Ive already earned However I do not believe I will exit the trade because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a stock I plan to hold for the long longterm Furthermore the stock is trading down from its week high of On top of that the stock is down YTD which just creates more room to initiate an entry with greater upside Below are both the YTD and month views for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>versus the SP Im thinking longterm here A sub entry was hard for me to ignore and with my cost basis at that last time we saw levels like that was late before the stock zoomed up to over a share by the end of That riskreward is very attractive to me Im well aware that this company will decline with the broader market if there is recession in equities not just on an earnings basis Considering that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has drastically underperformed the SP throughout the last two years its safe to say that the stock would see a more aggravated downtrend than the broader market Even with a low beta of this is something I have to be cognizant of and why I have a small position in Direxions Daily SP Bear x NYSEARCA SPXS to hedge my risk with the leverage in tune to my allocation A high current yield a favorable economic scenario and a cushion in the riskreward scenario all point to an increase in the stock over the NTM Backed by a strong dividend growth rate and record performance in the stock is poised for excellent upside will be a tough year of comps to beat which expectations will assuredly factor in The recent decrease in the stock just allowed investors to have a renewed long opportunity Disclosure I amwe are long
