Automakers Update Market Successfully Corrects Its WorstCase Scenario <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Mr Markets worstcase scenario on GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stocks have played out in full and both have headed North far enough to restrict their YTD losses Strong sales for both especially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on truck and SUV sales are a signal that the worst times are over for their stocks at least for now Economic stability and other factors will play a major role in keeping the balance as it is Ideal time to invest if only for the dividends at this point In my earlier articles covering the major US automakers I explained why I thought the market was unfairly punishing auto stocks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM Over time we saw that there was no drastic drop in automobile sales during the first two months of Though that number has dropped slightly towards the million mark its nowhere near a postpeak crash that a lot of analysts and speculators predicted Theres no denying that auto sales are of a cyclic nature Weve already seen that over several decades The constant ebb and flow of the economy and creditcash available to customers varies within the year and across several years so there are essentially two patterns that can be seen a gentle rolling wave that spans decades and a more pronounced oscillation from January to December each year Thats completely normal What isnt normal is the panic scenario that enveloped the auto industry It didnt make sense from a market correction perspective nor did it hold water from an economic perspective Ive said this several times over several articles but was finally vindicated when GM and F both started climbing since the end of February With regard to the socalled peak auto just because something is peaking it does not automatically mean that the bottom is going to fall out because it has nowhere else to go Thats the thread that many Wall Street analysts failed to pull on right through the second half of Economic conditionsare still quite good Interest rates are still better than theyve ever been Scott Keogh president of luxury auto maker Audi AGs US operations said in an interview last week at the New York International Auto Show Wall Street Journal Im at least happy to see that people are finally starting to connect the dots and realize that interest rates are one of the crucial factors that guide auto sales trends another major point that I covered in detail in one of my recent articles on the subject YTD <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still down by nearly and GM by but both of them have recovered from the lows set in February From now on out its entirely in the hands of the economy The International Monetary fund has projected the global economy to grow at percent in and percent in The United States forecast is healthy too with the economy to stay above the growth rate With relative stability in the economy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM no longer at least for now have to worry about an unfair disadvantage as far as stock prices are concerned Their efforts can be put to better use on product innovation operational efficiency and other activities that actually filter down to their bottom line Thats where the focus should really be at this point Both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have seen poor margins overseas and the United States remains their sole breadwinner market This is not the ideal situation but its a tough nut to crack considering the many challenges they face in Europe China South America and elsewhere That the United States is their biggest market is a given Both companies rely heavily on that market not only for profitability but also stability for their stock prices So naturally as their sales move sideways in a stable economy their stock prices will follow suit The market is now quite stable if not in the pink of health and as long as interest rates dont stray too far north of their current home both companies can expect a measure of stability provided their sales are kept at optimal levels Its clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>did a lot better than General Motors during the first three months of the year a fact that pretty much reflects in the way the stock prices have moved for both the companies Fords first three months sales in were the companys best performance since aided by strong sales from their star performer the FSeries and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>SUVs FSeries truck sales exceeded this year and have slowly moved up to trucks in March The good news for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is that its their bigger models that are driving sales which obviously have better returns to the bottom line of March sales came from fleet sales however so its an equally strong segment that theyre taking full advantage of Not as profitable as trucks or SUVs of course but it boosts the one metric that has a more or less direct impact on stock price monthly sales General Motors firstquarter sales werent the best theyve seen in a while the companys total sales numbers remained well below what they achieved in the first three months of last year The company has been slowly weaning itself away from the lowmargin fleet sales which accounted for of GMs March sales Investorspeak Forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Go On GM In summary the last two quarters have been a harrowing experience for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM investors not to mention the companies themselves I think both are finally out of choppy waters but need to carefully and gradually shift their profitability focus outside the United States This is easier said than done and both of them have made the right moves with respect to becoming more efficient with their production to highlight just one area In innovation GMs actions have been more pronounced because of several initiatives not the least of which was their disruptive announcement of the Bolt something that I believe spurred even Elon Musk to release the first view of the Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Model as early as possible As for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>their drive to make Europe profitable has finally paid off Several factors will influence how these companies project value to their investors and car sales is just one of those The future will hinge not only on the grosser details like auto sales but also the subtler moves made by each company into more profitable international markets electrification market penetration overseas and other factors For now consider GM and F to be relatively safe bets to invest in Stock value may not go up dramatically but at least you can count on dividend income for the next few quarters while the stocks keep moving sideways Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans
