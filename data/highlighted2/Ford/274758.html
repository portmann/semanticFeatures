<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor currently yields I discuss if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor will increase its dividend payout in early January If you follow me on Seeking Alpha you probably know that one of my favorite stock investments of was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F The company and the stock had a lot to offer at the beginning of at least thats what I thought back then Fast forward one year and the stock has not done anything for shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is down during a time of heightened volatility and growing economic headwinds So was my call to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor in wrong How you answer this question relates to how long your investment horizon is If you invest with a year time horizon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor was clearly not a good choice But for anyone who thinks with the long term in mind just like Warren Buffett teaches investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor might be much more interesting than many investors think I have recently reduced my price target on Fords stock from to but an investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has compelling total return potential nonetheless And here is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is widely underappreciated as an income investment Thats right <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is an income investment Though the potential for capital appreciation should clearly play a role when deciding to buy a stock dividends have great long term value for investors especially if the companys dividends are rising slowly but steadily Right now an investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor yields based on a recurring quarterly dividend payout of share A yield from a SP is a good start for building an income portfolio But what has in store for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock investors Are we going to see a dividend hike in The central question when it comes to a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor investment is Will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>increase its dividend payout in The auto maker has traditionally increased its dividend in January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors short term dividend growth trend suggests that the company will also hike its payout in In early <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor hiked its dividend by from share to share In January another dividend increase followed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also keeps its dividend steady for four quarters before announcing a dividend increase But Fords recent dividend history is not the only reason why the company will likely raise its Q dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has seen robust sales growth in and since the F is now being produced without any production restrictions the auto maker is in a good position to continue to grow sales in Importantly Fords F retail sales carry substantial earnings surprise potential too which makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>interesting from both a capital appreciation and income point of view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has historically increased its dividend at the beginning of the year Though it is to be expected that Fords dividend growth will continue to level off I wouldnt be surprised if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>declared a quarterly dividend of share in order to keep shareholders happy and maintain its tradition of steady dividend growth A share dividend implies a YY growth rate which is lower than in the past In any case investors will likely see an increasing yield on cost
