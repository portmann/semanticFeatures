Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>introduced a third prototype eBike last week and will enter the market for eBikes soon Mobility behavior is changing very fast so car manufacturers need to diversify their business The market for eBikes looks very promising as bicycles are taking over the cities The combination might not be the most obvious but car manufacturer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F will be selling bicycles some time soon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>already introduced a prototype of its MoDePro eBike during the Mobile World Congress in March of this year source digitaltrendscom Last week the company introduced another eBike the MoDreFlex The introductions were part of Fords broader attempt to adjust to changes in mobility behavior of its customers Investors might tend to consider the introduction of Fords new eBike as another pilot that is doomed to fail However in this article I will argue that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>entering the market for eBikes is more important than investors might think As <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>traditionally sells cars changes in mobility behavior are probably the most important threats to Fords business model Namely fewer people driving cars results in fewer people willing to buy a new car The way we approach mobility is changing fast Just consider the popularity of car sharing services like Uber No one thought this would be successful ten years ago Therefore the market for selling cars is likely to shrink in the long term Several other trends influence the changes in mobility as well Increased attention for corporate social responsibility is one of these trends Corporate social responsibility is not just a buzzword it is here to stay source theguardiancom Reducing pollution is likely to become even more important in the future As cars are still major polluters an easy way to reduce pollution is reducing the use of cars Another threat to Fords longterm business model Not surprisingly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is taking actions to deal with these changes in mobility behavior Last week the company announced several focus areas for its mobility solutions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>now focuses on two key areas flexible use and ownership and multimodal urban travel solutions source fordcom More specific <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>introduced a car sharing service called GoDrive an eBike called MoDreFlex and a smartphone app called MoDreLink MoDeFlex is Fords third most versatile eBike yet easily reconfigurable for different customer needs The bikes center frame assembly includes the motor and battery while the frond and rear assemblies and wheels can be configured for road mountain or city driving The bike folds and stores inside any <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>vehicle where it can be charged while stowed In this article I will discuss the introduction of Fords eBike and smartphone app An eBike is not an ordinary bicycle An eBikes electric battery offers pedal assistance to its users in order to reduce the effort needed to pedal Not only does pedal assistance reduce the level of effort it also increases speed As a result eBike users get to their destination faster with less effort Ideal for busy businessmen working in urban areas Fords eBike offers another nice feature The company managed to link the level of pedal assistance to the users heart rate The realtime data is sent to a smartwatch app The app is linked to the eBike Therefore pedal assistance can be modified based on the users heart rate Pedal assistance goes up in case the heart rate crosses the preset line This is a really cool feature because now users are able to choose the level of exercise during their ride So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is entering the market for ebicycles Is it just my fascination with bicycles or does it really matter for Fords investors In my opinion the introduction of eBikes is really important for Fords longterm business model as the changes in mobility are real Further the market for eBikes is very favorable in the long term Through Fords attempt to diversify its products the company should be able to benefit from the booming market for eBikes According to Market Research Store the global market for eBikes is likely to grow at an average growth rate of in terms of revenue and in terms of shipments in the period source cmocom These are solid growth numbers However I strongly believe actual growth numbers for the global eBike market are much higher than the research report by Market Research Store suggests Just consider the largest bicycle market in the world in terms of bicycles per capita Holland In Holland there are as many bicycles as there are people source tophellcom and eBike sales are booming Total eBike sales increased in compared to Although many expected sales to ease in eBike sales rose an astonishing in the first four months of compared to the same period of last year source bikeeucom Germany is another large and important bicycle market Sales of eBikes tripled in the period source falkirkheraldcouk Further European Union Commissioner for Mobility and Transport stated on June that we underestimate the potential of cycling see quote below This supports my conclusion that eBike sales will grow much faster than the report by Market Research Store suggests However the potential of eBikes is not limited to Europe In almost million eBikes were sold of these in China It is fair to say that China is in the lead in terms of absolute eBike sales Allianz OTCQXAZSEY published an interesting report stating that eBikes are taking over cities all over the globe Naturally this is caused by a changed mentality towards mobility According to Allianz bikesharing is already an environmentalfriendly alternative in cities Allianz also mentioned that global sales of eBikes up to kmu is likely to grow to million or in the period The report used data of Navigant Research The average annual growth rate is in line with the research report of Market Research Store However the report did not take into account that more and more eBikes offer pedal assistance for above kmu Therefore I expect total eBike sales to grow at a much faster pace Considering the information in this article it is evident that Fords focus on eBikes is important for investors Consumers mentality towards mobility solutions is changing fast One after the other car and bicyclesharing programs are being introduced limiting the number of potential car buyers Further bicycles are more and more accepted as the primary urban transport solution eg businessmen Overall I expect the market for eBike sales to grow very fast in the upcoming years Therefore Fords attempt to enter this market could not be better timed In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>proved to be serious about a sustainable business model in the long term next to the companys traditional car manufacturing business This should improve investors confidence for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as a solid investment Source <span
