ongoing losses This phenomenon is not unique to Tesla Several companies have traded at obscene multiples in recent years Tesla supporters point to the valuation of companies like Amazon to justify the share price For much of its existence Amazon NASDAQ AMZN was known as a stock with a ridiculous market valuation based on its fundamentals The company was consistently unprofitable and the target of jokes among many in the investment community In recent years however Amazon has turned the corner on profitability and grown into a company with a billion market cap Today it trades x higher than it did when its valuation was deemed preposterous largely on the profitability and growth in a relatively new part of its operations Tesla Motors NASDAQ TSLA is the target of similar barbs to those that were earlier endured by Amazon Tesla is consistently unprofitable yet its stock trades at a level that many including myself consider skyhigh Many TSLA investors point to the troubled history and eventual success of Amazon as evidence that Teslas valuation is justified I decided to compare the companies and see if the argument holds up Amazon is really a large umbrella under which several unique businesses operate A detailed analysis of each business unit could rather easily fill several articles In the interest of maintaining focus I will discuss three primary units that are widely recognized as the firms bread and butter Most people are aware of Amazons dominance of the retail ecommerce market Today Amazon has a x larger ecommerce market share than its leading contender Walmart It dominates its space in a way in which few companies can even dream of doing The revenue model for Amazons original and most famous ecommerce operations is similar to that of any other retailer whether internet or traditional brickandmortar Amazon purchases products from vendors marks them up and sells them to the public Amazon Marketplace offers ecommerce services to other businesses Retailers like Lands End and Target who have ecommerce platforms of their own leverage Amazons Marketplace to ensure their products get in front of the latters enormous user base In other cases vendors can leverage Amazon not just for exposure and ecommerce but for warehousing and order fulfillment as well For the most part the retail arms of Amazon are lowmargin businesses The only way to make these units profitable and highly valuable is to ingrain consumer behavior and achieve high market share and order volume Prime is a subscription service that has both features of its own and grants premium features to Retail customers Prime subscribers get upgrades such as free day shipping on retail purchases They also have access to free content such as ebooks and streaming video content Prime itself is not a moneymaker However it offers two distinct advantages to the business Prime offers recurring revenue cash flow and encourages utilization of other Amazon products and services helping drive growth and profits in other segments of the overall enterprise Amazon Web Services AWS comprises unique businessesproducts in its own right These include everything from allowing companies to develop their own ecommerce applications on Amazons platform to data migration and cloud hosting services AWS sprang from Amazons own operational needs Amazon was able to transform those needs into a VERY profitable business with an enormous addressable market Last year AWS brought in almost billion in revenue and operating income of nearly million As most are aware Teslas primary business is making and selling automobiles Tesla has some notable market advantages in this space First Tesla makes the only longrange BEVs on the market today Along with this Tesla also has the only extensive fastcharge network exclusively available to drivers of its vehicles In reality this makes Tesla the only BEV option for people who commute long distances or want to take crosscountry trips in the car Second Tesla has a highly valuable brand image In my last article I discussed how Tesla is truly an aspirational brand Its early vehicles have been available exclusively to societys wealthiest and that exclusivity creates a mystique and desirability around the brand The level of excitement around the Model and the enormous number of customer deposits offer proof of this GMs plans to produce only and units of the Bolt despite or so deposits for the Model lends further credence to this argument In short a lot of people WANT to buy a Tesla assuming they can afford one This is Teslas advantage in its space Last year Elon Musk announced the advent of Teslas stationary storage business It seemed like a nobrainer Tesla already had shown a competency in designing and building battery packs Why not extend that knowledge to a new market The addressable market also appeared large First home battery storage could appeal to anyone who wanted some sort of backup power for their home Second utilities could leverage storage on a large scale to more efficiently store and deliver electricity to consumers It turns out this isnt quite so simple and for a variety of reasons The cell chemistries that are acceptable for a BEV are not ideal for stationary storage applications Further with the possible exception of home storage brand name means just about nothing in stationary storage Is a utility company going to be impressed by the Tesla name Not likely In fact as most utilities operate under the paradigm of trying to make money they naturally pursue the lowestcost effective solution This creates a racetothebottom commodity market similar to cheap Android smartphones lots of players jostling for market share and making next to no money Can Tesla differentiate itself in stationary storage The answer is almost certainly no At least I havent heard any persuasive explanation of how Tesla would do so Can storage contribute to the bottom line Perhaps a little but not significantly It certainly doesnt do anything to justify the companys current valuation Amazon operates several different businesses Giving Tesla the benefit of the doubt and including Tesla Energy Tesla operates only two So what Well if we are looking for comparisons between Amazon and Tesla we can really stop right here Heres why it matters Should one of Amazons businesses falter or should the company realize one of its businesses doesnt have a viable future Amazon can sever the gangrenous limb and leave the rest of the body healthier as a result This is especially true on the retail side Should one if Amazons retail models stop working it can simply move on to more effective models without compromising its overall viability Even so some of Amazons units are beneficial even if on a standalone basis they are money losers Prime is a giant money pit as a standalone business But it strongly influences consumer behavior in the retail channels driving more business to Amazon retail and thereby making it a valuable part of the overall enterprise Further Amazon sells hundreds of thousands of products Obviously some turn out to be more lucrative than others By offering such a product mix Amazon can pivot at will discontinuing the poor performers and exploiting the winners Additionally it costs Amazon almost nothing to add a new product to its lineup Each product represents a tiny fraction of Amazons costs and the occasional disappointment is little more than a blip on the radar The product range dynamic is far different for Tesla Until the Model arrives Teslas ability to drive revenue depends entirely upon demand for only two products the Model S and the Model X Add Powerwalls and Powerpacks if you wish but make sure to tell me how much net profit you envision them generating in and I outlined in my last article why I believe having so few products combined with the total addressable market for BEVs is a problem for Tesla But the primary point here is not that Tesla has so few products Rather it is that its INCREDIBLY expensive for an automaker to design and produce even one more new product Failure in the market of even one model has a serious financial impact on any automaker and it could deal a death blow to a small one To put this in perspective Toyota NYSE TM is the worlds topselling automaker with a large number of established vehicles in its lineup Last year Toyota managed approximately net margins on revenues greater than billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM were closer to Say what you will about these companies but compared to Tesla they are the models of efficiency Tesla is using less than of its factorys production capabilities based on the NUMMI days but still claiming production constraints for its miniscule delivery numbers We have already begun to see the effects of a poor product launch on Teslas financials While the ending of the Model X story is not yet written it is clear that Elon Musks Master Plan to use profits from the S and X to fund development of the Model has unraveled And any serious issues with the Model would absolutely be the end of Tesla Motors at least as we know it today Why The Comparisons Fail Part The Financials Putting aside the obvious differences in industries and business models lets take a look at a favorite argument of Tesla investment enthusiasts if Amazons valuation could be justified based on losses or at least lack of profits then Teslas should as well However peering below the surface reveals two completely different sets of financials First and foremost Amazon turned its first profit in Q demonstrating the feasibility of just the retaildriven model before Prime and before AWS That was only five years after Amazons founding Thirteen years in Tesla Motors has never come close to making a profit NOT EVEN CLOSE Additionally Amazon has been able to fund its own growth In fact over the last several years Amazon has even been a net purchaser of its own stock Tesla is quite the opposite It needs to periodically issue debt and equity not only to invest in its growth but also just to keep the lights on Notice how the blue line is consistently above the red line for Amazon and consistently below for Tesla As it turns out the argument about Amazon not making money is really an argument that Amazon doesnt make MUCH money given its enormous revenues However the company generates enormous piles of cash that it uses to continue to grow market share and build new diverse businesses This as I called out in my first contribution to Seeking Alpha is what drives a high multiple the ability to turn off the growth engine and settle into profitability Tesla generates cash by borrowing and selling stock Its operations yield negative cash flow Amazon is and has always been just the opposite Aside from famous and controversial CEOs and lofty valuations that are difficult for many to justify Tesla and Amazon could hardly be more different Using Amazon as any sort of measuring stick to value Tesla is a ridiculous exercise Amazon is a diverse collection of numerous complimentary and cashgenerating businesses and an entity that has been able to finance its own growth via enormous operating cash flows Tesla is a cashdevouring monster that continues to exist ONLY because of its ability to sell more stock This doesnt mean Tesla is doomed to fail With increased demand and efficient production proper financial management and a few technological leaps forward its certainly possible Tesla will turn things around However the comparison with Amazon certainly makes TSLA stock an unwise investment at its current price In short the comparisons to Amazon are preposterous Its time to put that argument to rest once and for all The Knights Teslar will need a better comparison to justify Teslas ridiculous present valuation Authors note All of the opinions
