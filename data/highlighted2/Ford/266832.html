To Expect From Automakers At CES Relevant To Tesla Tesla Motors NASDAQTSLA Seeking Alpha Faraday Future to show concept car which sounds totally unrelated to its muchexpected practical production car Volkswagen to show allelectric minivan which will be major competition for Tesla when it eventually enters production GM to show mile range or less Chevy Bolt which beats Teslas Model to market by at least one full year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>likely to show software update to Android Auto and Apple CarPlay for all of its cars going forward Kia to show its selfdriving car program which will take a few years to materialize into a volume production car CES is starting to compete with the NAIAS North American International Auto Show otherwise referred to as The Detroit Auto Show as a key venue for global automakers to unveil new products January will prove this thesis to a more significant degree than ever This privately held startup has announced that it will show a concept car at this years CES It even says so on the companys home page Faraday Future will unveil a concept inspired by our design and engineering vision In other words what we will see at CES will obviously not be the production car but rather an unrelated concept As concept cars go they can sometimes be impractical defacto race cars with little applicability to reallife practicality and competition for regular cars As such if people are expecting Faraday Future to show its Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Model Sequivalent production car at this event I think they will be disappointed Faraday Future will likely show its practical production car some time later in It had previously spoken about having this car in production by the end of although it is no longer promising this delivery date With the factory in Las Vegas not breaking ground until early it is unlikely going to be producing cars from that factory until early if everything goes well Therefore if Faraday wants to have this car in production by the end of it would have to happen from some other factory More about this later VW has teased us with a picture of what appears to be the front of a small minivan It has also said that it will show an electric car concept Numerous articles in recent weeks and months have plenty of evidence for this being a car that will enter production probably by the end of as a model The main questions about this Volkswagen electric minivan are Whats the range and How large is this minivan really There is certainly space in a vehicle of this size to make the range at least somewhere around miles on the US test cycle miles on the European test cycle and hopefully a lot more In addition to this kind of nearproduction car still called a concept technically Volkswagen would also likely want to show more futuristic technologies ones that wont go into production until after That could entail an additional concept car and beyond The big news here will be the production version of the Chevrolet Bolt This one was recently leaked The Bolt will have approximately miles of range and cost no more than before tax adjustments and GM has on occasion hinted the price may even be less It will be the first car of this kind miles of range at this price as it is expected to enter production around the end of which would be at least one full year before Teslas equivalent Model Perhaps the most interesting thing would be if GM were to announce in conjunction with the Chevrolet Bolt that it is investing in a charging network to compete with Tesla Presumably GM would not build this network by itself but rather in conjunction with the other major automakers such as Nissan OTCPKNSANY VW BMW OTCPKBAMXY <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Honda NYSE HMC and Mercedes I am not expecting the complete details of such an announcement at CES this year but perhaps some encouraging tidbits about what to expect later in the year In addition one might speculate that GM will talk about how OnStar will evolve For example allowing an owner to move between several GM cars and keeping settings for various preferences ranging from radio presets to seat adjustments One year ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>showed its new infotainment system called SYNC Instead of being based on Microsoft it is now based on BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY QNX During this system was implemented in five <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>vehicles and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>said that it will be upgradeable to Android NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Auto and Apple NASDAQ AAPL CarPlay at some point in the future Well that point in the future is obviously now at CES I expect this to be one of Fords major announcements at CES this year Unlike Kia and Hyundai upgrading their systems in the near future to Apple CarPlay which will require a USB stick <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will do it over WiFi This new infotainment system will continue to roll out across the rest of Fords US lineup in so that by the end of almost of Fords US sales will have it Kia will unveil its selfdriving car program at CES For as far as bragging rights go Kia has set expectations low in the sense that it does not see a seminal car in this field until It all depends on what you mean by selfdriving however Different definitions will yield different years ranging from almosttoday to many decades from now Kia is part of Hyundai and they are selling more cars in the US than you might have thought For the first eleven months of Kia sold cars in the US and Hyundai sold cars in the US That points to fullyear sales at million cars or not too far from of the US car market Therefore when Kia and Hyundai do eventually make moves in this market both in terms of selfdriving cars and electric cars it is likely to have a significant market impact Hyundai has scheduled a press conference for the Detroit Auto Show the following week Stock market conclusion Incremental negatives for Tesla Tesla pulled out of the Detroit Auto Show January where it had exhibited in each of the last years When we tally up what the competition will show at CES the week before one might start to see why There will be lots of new product to compete with Tesla whether the current Model S or the future Model Yes not all products will be the same as the Model S but that does not mean its not competition Some people have bought the Model S when they would have bought a product that was close enough in terms of range or some other metric had such product been available Two houses that are on the market do not need to be identical in order to constitute comps In the meantime based on reading the owner forums Tesla does not appear to have delivered more than approximately fifty Model X minivans to date Founder Series not Signature Series The expectations used to be for Tesla to deliver at least approximately Model X units by the end of this year These expectations clearly came down in recent months but if Tesla is only able to deliver as few as a couple hundred Model X cars by yearend that cant be a positive either Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US exchange Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks
