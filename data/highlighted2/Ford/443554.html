European Union is bullish for Tesla for tax reasons We agree its bullish for automakers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors and also technically for Tesla for tax purposes Tesla has much bigger things to worry about than EU tax implications and is probably the last stock investors should be considering in todays market Tesla is going to receive some tax benefits when it does business in the UK as a result of the Brexit along with auto makers General Motors and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>We wanted to lay out our reasoning as to why these tax benefits are absolutely not a reason to go out and buy Tesla stock Anton Wahlman wrote a fantastically written piece on why the United Kingdom leaving the European Union is bullish for Tesla NASDAQ TSLA and the automotive industry It was a well reasoned article explaining that Britain leaving the European Union could create a an automotive manufacturing tax and free trade haven in the United Kingdom In his article he also talks about how Tesla vehicles need to make a stop in the Netherlands prior to being shipped off to the European Union for sale This is a way to avoid a European Union tariff that the company will not have to abide by further when shipping to the United Kingdom going forward The vehicles are manufactured in California but make a stop in the Netherlands to specifically avoid these tax implications Anton is a sensible writer and does fantastic analysis However we would focus our efforts on looking at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM as opposed to Tesla We are not going to lay out our entire bullish case on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>For that you can consult our recent article talking about why F is probably a good stock to add in the face of this Brexit pullback In that regard we do agree with Anton But lets update investors on our thoughts on Tesla to parse out the difference between these companies Anton is right that there are significant tax advantages for all of the automobile companies that do business in the United Kingdom However Tesla needs a little bit more help than a couple of tax advantages Tax advantages really can benefit companies that have positive cash flow and consistent earnings where a couple of basis points on the companys margin makes an enormous difference basis points here and there will help a little bit more drop to the bottom line for companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors These tax advantages may help these companies juice their numbers slightly and may potentially add a half a cent to each of these companys earnings numbers going forward But Tesla Lets take a look at after tax margin of the three companies GM Profit Margin Quarterly data by YCharts This also speaks to exactly how these companies are valued As staple plays F and GM are valued specifically based on their EPS Thats why a tax break could help the share price increase Tesla is valued on a ridiculous theory that everything is going to be fine until or when analysts hope the company can finally turn a profit A couple basis points from a tax break today is simply meaningless for Tesla Another way that all three of these companies are similar is that they all have a market cap that is between billion and billion They are large corporations that have equally large valuations But we absolutely cannot lump Tesla in with a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>or a company like General Motors Tesla is an entity that has negative operating margins and a company that relies on the sale of stock to survive It has not proven that it can turn a profit and it has not proven that it can leverage volume to make up for its past losses In addition to the simple common sense reasoning that these tax benefits dont matter for Tesla the company also has a significant issue in its attempted acquisition of SolarCity NASDAQ SCTY You can read our article on why we think Elon Musk has simply gone crazy Most importantly we agree with Anton that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors are exceptional opportunities here and we commend him for his fantastic analysis pointing out the intricacies of each companys tax implications from the United Kingdom leaving Europe This is fantastic analysis and supplements our already firmly held belief that General Motors and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should both be buys if the market pulls back lower But to lump Tesla in with these two companies simply because it makes automobiles is a poor reason to go out and buy Tesla stock An overvalued cashburning company like Tesla is exactly the type of stock we believe one should be avoiding or shorting as we move into a period of economic volatility like the one we are currently in To further add to our skepticism on Tesla its recent attempted acquisition of SCTY shows that corporate governance is extremely poor and the conflict of interest between TSLA board members that are also SCTY shareholders is extraordinarily odious Add to that the companys recent suspensiongate where it was reported that the company was having customers sign off on NDAs after the company performed outofwarranty work on TSLA vehicles When you combine this with the recent executive exodus from the company and its financial fundamentals we absolutely do not think that the United Kingdom leaving the European Union is a reason to go out and buy Tesla stock We have been short Tesla off and on for the last few months and we may initiate and add to a new short position at any time I wrote this
