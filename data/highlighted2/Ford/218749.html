Will Get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>To Break Out Higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported another great quarter yesterday with all major metrics improving But the stock continues to languish despite terrific results I would like to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>buy back a significant amount of stock to get shares to break out higher <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has been a tough long for the past few years This is a company that came back from the brink during the financial crisis to be stronger than ever and selling a lot of cars but the market seems not to care Shares continue to languish in a very tight range as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cant seem to catch a break from market participants despite what I consider to be obvious signs of strength The companys rd quarter earnings report showed that Fords momentum has carried through towards the end of but shares were punished yesterday despite pretax profit nearly doubling against last years third quarter Does that mean that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a hopeless long position After all what will make this stock go higher if terrific results arent enough Ive been bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for a long time now because of two main points First the companys fundamentals seem to improve every quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>went through a very dark period for a number of years during and after the financial crisis but those years are well and truly behind the company Further the American new car market continues to boom as consumers with extra cash to spend are spending it on large trucks and SUVs as fuel prices remain low vehicles that are right in Fords wheelhouse In other words the fundamental picture is very strong and has been for some time In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has just been cheap I love a stock with strong fundamentals that is also cheap because they are hard to find in todays market There are many very expensive stocks with poor fundamentals so to find the opposite is a real gem The problem is the only real way to capitalize on a stock being cheap is for it not to be cheap at some point but for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that has proven elusive Fords third quarter really had quite a bit to like in it if youre long Operating profit nearly doubled to B during the quarter as North America had its best quarter ever <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been a North America story for as long as I can remember as the other regions the company competes in basically cancel each other out Marginal or nonexistent profitability in all of Fords other regions eat up some of North Americas profits each quarter The numbers are small in terms of total losses but in order to understand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>you just need to understand North America Since the other geographical segments really dont matter this slide from the press release will give us an idea of just how excellent Q was We can see that NA saw every single major metric improve during Q Units were up revenue was up operating margin was much higher and pretax profits almost doubled I and others have been saying that Fords new model lineup for NA including the Mustang and FSeries would drive higher sales in and that has certainly turned out to be the case Fords products have absolutely resonated with consumers and it is showing up in the companys sales numbers With the FSeries continuing to shine well continue to see huge NA sales numbers in Q and into Comparing against will make a bit more challenging just because this year has been so strong but I expect well continue to see more improvements next year Recall that Q and Q were soft this year because of supply issues and the launch dates of some new model lines in the US those quarters will look very strong for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in due to soft comps Importantly we also continue to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit continue to chug along and produce million in pretax profits per quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has done a great job of extending prudent credit and it is showing up in its excellent profit numbers Nothing much has changed here and I expect well continue to see steady profits from Credit in but that it also may not be a source of significant growth Heading into next year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still in a great position to succeed I mentioned soft comps for Q and Q and I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will produce excellent growth rates during those quarters similar to what we just saw for this years Q The FSeries is at full capacity production and with it flying off of dealer lots that will produce a nice boost to the next two quarters top and bottom lines The Mustang is also doing quite well although volume is much lower there than for the FSeries If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can continue to see improvements in Europe which is currently its biggest headwind to earnings we could see Fords results improve materially Europe saw much better volumes in Q and pretax profits improved substantially but it also still posted a sizable loss Operating margins continue to improve and strength in the commercial lineup will get Europe back towards breakeven in The other three major geographical segments basically cancel each other out so I really dont care what happens there we just need Europe to get out of the way of North Americas results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to produce huge FCF numbers B from the automotive business in Q alone and that allows it to pay its prodigious dividend That yield is certainly enticing and combined with Fords times forward earnings multiple the stock still has the makings of a terrific value play Of course this has been true for a long time but we continue to see shares languish To be honest Im not sure what will cause <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to finally break out of its slump and trade higher because it continues to post tremendous results but to no avail Patient shareholders are being paid handsomely to wait for higher prices but in the interim Id like to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>take the gloves off and do something about its low share price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has the balance sheet and FCF numbers to support a substantial share repurchase program It is only distributing about million per quarter via its dividend but its FCF is much stronger than that and in excess of capex needs Even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>borrowed the entire amount it could issue debt at rock bottom rates lower than the cost of its dividend payment and buy back perhaps of the float without undue strain on the financials I think an announcement like that would go a long way towards enticing people to buy the stock because exemplary results dont seem to be enough I still like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>here but Im growing tired of great quarters not being enough for shareholders The stock is still ludicrously cheap but that has been true for a long time The yield is still great but that has also been true for a long time Id really like to see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>take the share price into its own hands and announce a large scale buyback to get things going Great results havent been enough for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>so perhaps some oldfashioned financial engineering would do the trick We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
