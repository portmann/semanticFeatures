Small Car Will Turn Around Fords Fortunes In This Emerging Market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Fords sales in India have declined in the first seven months of the year which is bad news for investors as India will become the thirdbiggest global car market Fords market share in India has dropped below as it has not launched any new model for over a year in India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however recently launched the Figo Aspire compact sedan but it is looking to step up its game further with the Figo hatchback The hatchback market in India accounts for of total sales and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going all out to target this segment by delivering new features and an updated styling The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Figo is better than rival Suzuki Swift in terms of engine options and power delivery while it is more frugal as well Fords NYSE F performance in Indian market this calendar year has not been up to the mark Its sales have declined in each month of the year both on a sequential basis as well as yearoveryear In fact at the end of July Fords total sales over the first seven months of the year were down at units The following chart clearly shows the weakness in Fords performance in India so far this year The weakness in Fords performance in India is not good longterm indicator for the company This is because Indias auto market is growing at a rapid pace and it is expected to rank among the top three in terms of sales by The following chart shows the potential of Indias auto market Also as seen in the above chart the revenue potential of the Indian car market is expected to be in the range of billion to billion This indicates that the opportunity present in the Indian market is quite strong but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been unable to make any headway into this market as it has a market share of only in the country Moreover the reason behind Fords weak performance in India so far this year can be attributed to the lack of new models In fact the company didnt launch any new model in India in the first seven months of the year before coming out with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Figo Aspire subcompact sedan this month With this launch things could change for the better for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as it is now able to target the fastgrowing compact sedan segment in the country Moreover going forward Fords next launch will also play a crucial role in driving the companys sales in the country The four new vehicles that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>India has lined up for launch this year are the newgen Figo Hatchback the Figo Aspire the Endeavour SUV and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang As mentioned above the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Aspire has already been launched this month The company will now focus on the newgen Figo Hatchback This new model was previewed in India as the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Ka Concept at the Delhi Motor Show and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be launching this model just before the busy Diwali season when car sales in India remain strong Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems to have timed the launch of this new model quite smartly and I believe that a strong feature list of the model will play a key role in the models sales going forward Im saying this because the Figo is already one of the most popular hatchbacks sold by the American car maker in India and was Fords bestselling vehicle until the company phased it out to prepare for a new model This car has been specificallydeveloped for developing countries to give the customers the feel of a big car at an affordable price The new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Figo is expected to retain the strengths of the outgoing model build quality fuel efficiency and affordable pricing apart from carrying an updated list of features <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has updated the styling of the new Figo based on its global design language It now carries the hexagonal grille similar to the Aston Martins and this will play a key role in the cars sales in India as looks play an important factor Moreover the nextgeneration Figo also looks bigger than the outgoing Figo hatchback due to a larger wheelbase which means that it will be roomier on the inside and more comfortable Moreover the interior design of the Figo hatchback is similar to that of the EcoSport and the Fiesta in terms of both layout and overall design The higher end diesel and petrol variants will be loaded with equipment such as Fords inch SYNC music system autofolding ORVMs reversing sensors with camera rain sensing wipers and auto dimming internal mirror Additionally the steering wheel will be mounted with control switches Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going allout in terms of styling and features in order to make the most of the opportunity present in the hatchback segment in India This is a smart move by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as the small car segment in India accounts for around of overall sales Additionally in order to steal a march over its peers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has given the Figo a strong engine lineup that will help it take market share away from existing players The engine options in the new Figo hatchback will be the same as those available in the Figo Aspire There will be options The first will be a liter TiVCT cylinder petrol engine that will generate bhp of power and Nm of peak torque The second will be a liter TDCi cylinder diesel engine that will produce PS of power and Nm of torque The last one will be a liter TiVCT petrol with a Speed auto transmission that will produce bhp of power and peak torque of Nm In comparison the Figos prime competitor the Maruti Suzuki Swift comes with just two engine options and no automatic transmission The dieselpowered Swift generates just bhp of power and Nm of torque while the petrolpowered Swift generates Bhp of power and Nm of torque Hence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has done the right thing by offering the Figo with more engine options higher power and an automatic transmission and these should help the company attract more customers Finally all engines are quite fuelefficient as well The litre petrol is rated to give a mileage of kilometres per litre which is higher than the Swift petrol Meanwhile for the diesel the company claims a mileage of kilometres per litre for the liter diesel version which is again higher than the Swift Thus it is clearly evident that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has got the right product to tap a segment thats fastexpected to grow in India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects the industry sales of compact cars in India to climb to units by from units in Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is targeting the right segment to improve its sales performance in India Moreover with two new cars in its portfolio I think that the company will now be able to arrest the decline in its sales in the country As such Im confident that Fords fortunes in India will soon turnaround and the company will be able to tap a fastgrowing auto market quite successfully Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the
