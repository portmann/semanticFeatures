intrinsic value I have derived <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors free cash flow to equity a measure that shows how much cash is available for return to shareholders The free cash flow to equity includes debt cash flows debt proceeds and repayments which are easily pulled from the firms K filing with the SEC General Motors NYSE GM recently announced a major share buyback program about which I wrote here Share buybacks are financed out of a companys free cash flow to equity which is why I use this measure to calculate Fords indicative fair value The table below

</span>Motor K SEC filing The table also includes my cash flow estimates for The free cash flow to equity sums up operating investment and debtrelated cash flows The resulting free cash flow to equity depicts the amount of cash that can be distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks I estimate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor will be able to rake in billion in free cash flow to equity in part of which is driven by positive net borrowings On a per share basis I estimate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor can earn approximately in FCFE in which translates into a PFCFE ratio of just x In other words given the assumptions outlined below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors share price currently implies a near FCFE yield Source Achilles Research Company Financials Using the derived free cash flow to equity per share as the basis for a discounted cash flow valuation model leads to the conclusion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is substantially undervalued Assuming moderate free cash flow to equity growth rates of about in the short and longterm and applying an equity cost of capital rate of a twostage FCFE valuation model leads to an intrinsic value of per <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>share Source Achilles Research
