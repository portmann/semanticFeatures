How would you respond if we told you that your idiot cousin is consideringa PhD in particle physics at CalTech The Tesla CEO and Bond villaincometolife gave an interview to German newspaper Handlesblatt While the chat centered mostly around Teslas issues in Germany and Elons hope that the German government will start handing out the kind of tax breaks that hes getting back on US soil the interviewer apparently couldnt help asking about The Apple Car Handelsblatt Apple just hired some of Teslas most important engineers Do you have to worry about a new competitor And Elon apparently couldnt help responding like the catty president of the hottest sorority on campus Musk Important engineers They have hired people weve fired We always jokingly call Apple the Tesla Graveyard If you dont make it at Tesla you go work at Apple Im not kidding That was just minorleague shade compared to what else Elon had to offer on that merry band of morons in Cupertino Musk Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch laughs No seriously Its good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches You cant just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say Build me a car But for Apple the car is the next logical thing to finally offer a significant innovation A new pencil or a bigger iPad alone were not relevant enough Snidely congratulating Apple on its innovation while also saying outright that the company wouldnt know how to build a car if the ghost of Henry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>walked them through it stepbystep But buried inside that lava hot diss track is the fact that Elon is also a man of grand ambition and big ideaswhocant help but begrudgingly respect Apples ambitions Especially
