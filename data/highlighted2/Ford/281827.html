amwe are long F MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Fords December sales numbers came in under expectations but still with nice gains Total volume growth seen in will be hard to replicate in but cause for optimism remains Margin growth should continue as sales rise in and at just times forward earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is very cheap Automaker <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is a company Ive been pounding the proverbial table on for a long time I think the companys momentum with new models as well as its huge dividend and stock that is cheap is a terrific combination However thus far Ive been proven wrong by Mr Market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares continue to languish despite what I see as obvious evidence that the companys fortunes are improving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported fullyear sales yesterday and the results were very strong again As we enter I have to think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is due for some buying but analysts for the auto industry arent quite as sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported that December sales rose for the best December in over a decade as the entire industry continues to roll on Fords momentum has been due to the continued runaway success of the new FSeries and other smaller rollouts like the Mustang Passenger car sales languished for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but it has never been a passenger car story <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is all about its utility and truck vehicles and that was readily apparent in Decembers numbers as well Car sales fell more than but as Fords smallest segment cars arent particularly important Utilities and Trucks rose each which accounted for the gain overall as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to exploit its market leadership position in that space I dont like seeing car volume fall but its not a huge deal either as long as the companys trucks keep moving and they are doing just that In addition volume rose for the year capping a year of terrific execution from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and as I mentioned earlier the rollout of some really powerful new models <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a deep reliance on its trucks for success and ordinarily I wouldnt like a company that is so heavily concentrated on one product set But when the one product is as good and as popular as the FSeries Im willing to make an exception Even as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw volume gains in it maintained higher ASPs as well with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seeing pricing higher on average Really what more could you ask for Heading into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>looks very well positioned to continue to see sales gains While the initial flood of FSeries orders is behind us the fact that it sold more than k units in December alone should put to rest any fears that FSeries was a flash in the pan in terms of higher sales should see very strong FSeries sales once again if recent history is a guide and that bodes very well for the companys sales and margins this year In general sentiment on the automaker group is horrible The big three are all trading at or times forward earnings despite the fact that all of them had great years in But the market is unforgiving and undoubtedly pricing in a significant slowdown in the sector in However the data points suggest that a slowdown is not in the cards and that means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is once again cheap after selling off to under Analysts are looking for just under sales growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in and that seems about right While I expect pricing momentum will remain due to the continued success of FSeries it may be tough for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to replicate volume gains made in Indeed after a year where the entire industry saw strong sales Fords volume gain is probably not realistic for However I do think it can hit to in total sales gains based upon both volume and pricing growth That implies that analyst targets are probably about right in my view meaning that upside from earnings surprises will likely be muted if they happen at all However that does not mean the stock cant be owned Fords forward PE of is ludicrous indeed the entire group seems very cheap as the company is producing midsingle digit sales growth and much larger EPS growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to see leverage on its cost base producing margin growth in excess of sales growth It is important to note that analyst EPS forecast for havent budged in the last few months despite the fact that the stock has been hammered once again The companys performance in the marketplace is not the problem Fords problem is sentiment on the stock And that is where the opportunity presents itself as December and fullyear volume numbers suggest that Fords strong momentum is alive and well heading into That bodes very well for a stock trading for a headedforbankruptcy multiple and a yield I recognize that sentiment changes in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>or any other automaker will be hard to come by but the yield and the trough valuation mean that downside is likely limited from here barring a wholesale meltdown in the broader market But upside is certainly achievable as nine times forward earnings is not out of the question should the company surprise to the upside in That would be something like and on a base of less than thats significant Fords future looks very bright and the stocks valuation is beaten down so I think now is the time to consider
