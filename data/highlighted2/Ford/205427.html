#A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to at least and my estimate is on the low side This target gives a minimum upside in the near term with the added bonus of annual dividend yield <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is going to and this estimate might be on the low side The good news is you dont have to take my word for it The average of analysts recommendations is buyoverweight with a price target near Low estimates is current prices high estimate is closer to providing a potential upside The stock is already up over the past three weeks so what could possibly power this move For starters sales trends and earnings expectations The US auto market recovery is key to Fords success US auto sales hit an million annualized rate in September well above expectations for the month and the year making the th year of expansion and historically high levels This is a year over year increase with US sales expected to continue rising into as predicted by the National Automobile Dealers Association In the most recently released monthly sales data <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported a YOY increase in global sales This is an industry leading figure above analysts estimates and further evidence of the ongoing recovery in US auto sales Its also the best month for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>since Within the September reports were several positive factors including evidence of the expected European recovery in Fords sales figures On the domestic front Mustang sales had their best year since Sales of the iconic sports car jumped from last year at this time and are fast on the way to becoming the top muscle car in America shouldering out the Charger and Camaro Sales of trucks was also up The company reported a increase in sales of light trucks in the top selling FSeries September US Retail Sales data echoes the strength seen in the auto sales figures Total US retail sales increased slightly below consensus but declined by exauto Auto sales jumped roughly from August and from the same period last year In the EU sales were up more than led by small cars The company reported increased sales in more than half of the EU markets with an average gain of YTD In terms of brand recognition it is the commercial brand and the passenger brand Top markets were Ireland Turkey Germany Spain and the UK where it led the market Here is a quote from the company press release <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>closed a strong September and yeartodate

yeartodate and achieved market share improvements in of its traditional European markets including Germany Spain France Italy Spain Portugal Netherlands Belgium Switzerland Sweden Norway Ireland and Poland plus at its Turkish joint venture <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Otosan Not only are sales strong and outpacing expectations the company is regaining market share at home and abroad The company reported increased market share in of the EU regions with an average for the month for the year to date period This up from the reported in January In the US market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also recovering from declining market share with bottom hit earlier this year Since then the company has been able to reclaim its number two spot and is still increasing share September share is up nearly a half percent from August and a full percent from in September of last year On a year to date basis market share is flat from last year with expectation for that to improve into the end of the year Fords sales are strong on their own but there is a tailwind labor trends Both auto sales and labor trends have steadily on the rise the one no doubt influencing the other and both key to overall US recovery Labor trends have been on the mend since with most metrics revealing labor market health Jobless claims are trending at historic lows unemployment levels are fast approaching prefinancialcrisis lows job creation is trending at K on a TTM basis job openings are historic highs and the quits rate is healthy The one negative that sticks out is the participation rate but that can be explained away by demographics retiring Baby Boomers and maturing Millenials Altogether the basket of labor market indicators tracked by the KC Fed Labor Market Conditions Index show activity trending higher with positive momentum This months reading shows a small increase in activity with small decline in momentum Sales data is one thing earnings expectations are another and they are positive Current quarter estimates are in the range of to with consensus near This is flat from the last quarter but more than double the comparable quarter last year with significant chance for upside surprise based on sales data Next quarter is also expected to see growth consensus is near per share also with significant chance for upside surprise because the average analyst estimates have barely budged over the last months all while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been excelling in the US and abroad According to data from YahooFinance only estimate has been raised in the last days while have been lowered On a full year basis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expected to earn near This is up or from last year with growth expected next year as well Current consensus for earnings is near an additional growth and well ahead of the broader market Full year earnings growth for the SP is only as last reported by Factset On a PE valuation basis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking good Trailing PE stands near X earnings at current prices near On a forward looking basis this drops down to only providing a near up relative to current valuation Compared to the broad market which is trading near X forward earnings the stock is undervalued on a trailing and forward basis A couple of positive factors have developed over the past few weeks as well For one the company has announced a new billion plan to enhance RD in China and Asia The program is scheduled to unfold over the next years and is aimed at enhancing value in that region In the meantime the company is planning on launching two new hybrid models in China where large scale efforts to shift to electric are underway In the US output of the new aluminum bodied F has reached sustainable levels The truck was rolled out last year but a slow rampup to full production and strong demand combined to put pressure on inventory levels In his article on Brent A Miller says full production has been reached and that the new design is key to the companies future Risk factors include slowing slow global growth and how that might affect the US economy So far there is little sign of a global economic boom and while GDP estimates remain positive they have been reduced several times this year The risk of fallout hurting the US economy is present but as yet not seen in the data relating to auto sales China is the biggest worry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has seen sequential declines in month to month to sales in the country but so far sales growth remains positive for the year Full year industry wide sales growth in China is expected to come in around Summing it up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is undervalued with positive earnings expectations and a screaming buy The company is riding a rising tide of US sales with strong company sales in domestic and foreign markets Market share is also growing at home and abroad with new initiatives to increase over seas sales in China at least Earnings growth is strong with growth projected into the next quarter and next year and with a dividend to boot The average analyst estimate is overweightbuy with consensus target more than above current price levels On a technical basis the stock is moving up from support at the bottom of a month range Momentum is bullish and strong with price action recently breaking a previous supportresistance level Near term target is near with additional upside
