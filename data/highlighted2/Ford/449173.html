of reason why investors should be bearish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the US auto industry Industrywide sales are growing but they are increasing at a slower pace This happens naturally over time due to the law of diminishing returns The problem is that the recovery has been fueled by credit rather than natural economic forces Underlying economic fundamentals are weak HIS Automotive expects US auto sales will hit a peak in Figure before leveling off as interest rates rise The auto industry is benefiting from a combination of factors that can reverse just as easily as they came into place Low interest rates easy credit low gas prices and rising home and stock values which in themselves are a product of low interest rates but are boosting consumer confidence nonetheless are all contributing to the impressive auto sales figures But the sources that sustain demand over time are absent Incomes are not growing and millenials are exiting the labor force We provide some specific reasons why you should be cautious The Federal Reserve has played a big role in the auto boom over the last six years Through quantitative easing and ZIRP the Fed has increased the amount of credit available in the economy and kept borrowing costs artificially low We think the economy is too weak to handle another rate hike this year but eventually the Fed will have to tighten for credibilitys sake According to Charles Chesbrough an economist an interest rate increase of twotothree percentage points would add a couple thousand dollars to the price of an auto loan The average duration of auto loans has increased for six consecutive years While the average auto loan was months in it is closer to months now Much of this is a product of a weak economy as consumers with squeezed budgets are attempting to keep monthly interest payments to a minimum But it also stems from increased competition in the auto industry which is causing carmakers to offer more attractive terms in order to win business Longer loan terms today will weigh on demand in the future as customers are unlikely to purchase new vehicles until they can pay off existing debts It will also lead to lower levels of equity on outstanding loans which brings us to our next issue According to JD Power the percentage of car owners who owe more than their car is worth is expected to hit a year high in Almost onethird of car owners are in negative territory which exceeds precrash levels of in a period not so dissimilar to today considering how it was also fueled by credit Increasing loan terms are a big reason for these trends The longer the principal on a loan remains outstanding the greater the likelihood that a carowner will have negative equity as vehicles depreciate over time A growing prevalence of negative equity is a big problem for the auto sector because it has relied on credit for sales Customers with negative equity will be forced to delay new car purchases until they pay off existing loans Fewer and fewer consumers in this demographic are driving and buying cars In of people between the ages of and had a drivers license compared to in While baby boomer talking heads think this is because of the rising popularity of ridesharing apps such as Uber and Lyft and that millenials dont care about driving cars allow me a millennial to tell you that it is mostly because this generation cant afford to Its the same reason why millenials arent buying homes Do you really think they live with their parents because they want to The labor force participation rate is near a thirty year low largely because so many millenials have left the labor force The path to future income growth for many in this generation has been permanently damaged due to prolonged absences from work This generation will be responsible for the bulk of future car purchases and automakers should be worried According to the Wall Street Journal the supply of used cars is expected to increase as vehicles sold in recent years are returned to dealers as tradeins Tom Kontos an economist believes that the ensuing fall in usedcar prices will make newer vehicles less competitive and dampen new car sales If incomes in the US were rising this would be less of a concern but with wage growth as stagnant as it is we expect consumers will continue to be relatively sensitive to price The US auto industry has been on a great run over the past six years but it wasnt based on anything concrete With the economy fundamentally weak the industry has thrived and survived on credit If rates rise and credit conditions tighten you will see a big correction There are plenty of warning signs you just need to know where to look While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford
