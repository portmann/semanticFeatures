style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw a decrease in US auto sales in May compared to May as the new F aluminumbodied model continued to see tight supply levels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has sold K more Mustangs in the US yeartodate compared to the prior year in an effort to be the nations best selling muscle car <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains well positioned to take advantage of the encouraging US auto industry going forward and is a strong longterm investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F announced May US vehicle sales of K down from the same month in This decrease came in slightly above the decrease estimated by analysts Fords yearoveryear decrease came despite overall US auto sales crushing expectations for the month With the poor winter weather behind consumers and gas prices remaining low analysts are expecting sales to be million This along with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fs production nearing full levels and the return of the Mustang I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is ready to turn the corner and hit on all cylinders Of the major automakers Hyundai was the only one to have a larger decrease in yearoveryear US sales This is compared to other major automakersMercedes Benz Audi Volkswagen BMW Chrysler and GM that saw yearoveryear increases Despite the under whelming results for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in May there continues to be positives to take away from the monthly sales reporting The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F production is continuing to ramp up the Kansas City assembly plant which is expected to reach full production levels later this quarter The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company has not utilized heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors Despite the lack of incentive usage the company continues to see strong sales of the premium types such as the EcoBoost F Premium Lariat King Ranch and Platinum models Because of this the F saw a record setting average transaction price during May Additionally the new F is seeing positive consumer reactions when it makes it to the customer lot with a turnover time of approximately days which is significantly below the industry average of days I think it is important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to get this product launch right as they are taking the Fseries brand in a new direction designed for better fuel mileage With optimal inventory levels expected later this year I think its important to look at the average turn time of the model and the overall health of the US economy Both of these indicators are indicative of a positive second half of for the F and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as a whole In May the US auto consumer continued the shift back to less fuelefficient vehicles in response to the falling fuel prices This shift in consumer sentiment will boost sales for the companys higher profit margin vehicles such as the F Explorer and Expedition The Mustang saw another impressive month in May consistent with early results Mustang sales were up yearoveryear as it continues to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in This is a title the company has not held since before the Chevrolet Camaro was introduced Through May of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has sold an impressive Mustangs up from yeartodate May I believe the sports car segment will continue to see rapid growth as the weather warms and the US economy improves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is certainly losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions Generally a lot of times a customer will purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model This has been seen in the performance of Chevrolets Silverado and GMCs Sierras which combined saw more sales than Fords Fseries in May and June Furthermore GMs two fullsize trucks together are expected to outsell the Fseries this year for the first time in five years However this is not the big picture an investor should be seeing when buying shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>They should be seeing managements plan to shorten the companys normal summer shutdown in order to increase production This shows me as an investor the new Fs results are positive and the high end models are selling well which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward Once full production capacity is reached I fully expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to start reversing these disappointing US monthly sales reports Given this longterm optimism with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I am not worried about the yearoveryear decrease reported in May I continue to be excited about the companys future as the new aluminum bodied F is nearing full production levels the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles and the return of the Mustang With the consumer purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to report stronger top line and bottom line growth I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market I will continue to enjoy the near dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the longterm Source
