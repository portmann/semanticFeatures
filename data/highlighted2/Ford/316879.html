style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>saw a decrease in US auto sales in January compared to January which came in mixed among competitors The Mustang and FSeries posted sluggish results compared to the Chevrolet Camaro and Silverado Despite weak sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>outpaced the industry average in average transaction price growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>faces challenges in but given the strength of the automotive industry and the weak valuation I am optimistic on Fords <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F announced January US vehicle sales of K down from the same month in This decrease came in slightly above the decrease estimate from Kelley Blue Book and certainly signals a slow start for the American automaker Additionally the FSeries saw a concerning yearoveryear drop in January However despite the slower volume the company posted average transaction price growth almost three times the rate of the overall industry With many auto companies blaming the east coast snow storm for lackluster sales Fords decrease came in mixed among competitors with an overall industry average that was lower This comes on the heels of a record that saw million vehicles sold surpassing the mark of million Competitors such as Fiat Chrysler FCAU up Nissan OTCPKNSANY up Hyundai OTCHYMPY up and General Motors NYSE GM up beat Fords January while others such as Honda HMC fell Toyota TM fell and VW OTCPKVLKAY fell lagged behind Furthermore in the critical pickup truck market Fords FSeries lagged behind the Chevrolet Silverado and Ram pickup truck during the month With the FSeries being Fords most important model this is concerning for Fords longterm view The model is coming off a busy where it underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this years model has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F model the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors in the first half of However the company reached full production in the second half of and was credited for the companys late surge in Showing its resiliency even with the supply issues the model was awarded the title of Americas bestselling pickup for straight years and the bestselling vehicle for straight years with over trucks sold in Another concerning figure from Januarys sales report was the sluggish start for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Mustang Despite reclaiming the title of US muscle car of the year in by selling over mustangs compared to only Chevrolet Camaros In January the Mustang saw a decrease compared to an increase by the Camaro In previous months I have credited <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with recreating the magic with the Mustang and continuing dominating the pickup truck market with the Fseries While I understand it is only the first month in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>must be leaders in both of these markets to have a successful year and another slow start similar to is not an option This slow start to in addition to other possible threats such as the overall health of the US economy the upcoming interest rate hike and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry are weighing heavily on investor sentiment If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession it would definitely have a major impact on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Furthermore with an interest rate hike announced in December it will likely force the automotive market to reach its limit Additionally with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL it is important that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stays ahead of this curve and doesnt fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>appears to be prepared for this through rumored partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN however management must continue to look to be leaders in the race to an autonomous car With the company trading near per share with a PE ratio of the company appears to be undervalued compared to the current SP PE ratio of Additionally the company yields over and earns approximately per share Despite a sluggish start to the year with this low valuation I do not see anything in the near term that should weigh heavily on the companys stock and expect a rebound Given this low valuation and the longterm optimism with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Im extremely encouraged by the US sales results the past few months I am excited about the companys future With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles it will allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to report stronger top line and bottom line growth going forward in I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and expect the industry to post results similar to Furthermore I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market and will pay investors an above dividend yield to own the stock Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long
