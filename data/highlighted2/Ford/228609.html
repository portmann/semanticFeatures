Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor released US vehicle sales for the month of October last week Total vehicle sales surged on the back of persistently strong pickup and SUV demand I have lowered my return expectations with respect to Fords stock Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F dead money Thats the question I raised at the end of October in my last article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor entitled This Doesnt Make Any SenseIs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Dead Money The reason why I brought this theme up was because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock has profoundly disappointed my return expectations this year Under normal circumstances Id say that a company with poor financial results deserves to perform poorly no question But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor seems to be special case in which fundamental investment principles dont apply Take Fords stock for example Since the start of the year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has lost in value Even when factoring in the dividend this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has not been a winning investment so far And thats despite the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>released near perfect sales updates throughout the year at least for the United States But investors simply dont care Will things change on the back of strong profit growth moving forward Frankly I dont think thats likely at all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock has hardly moved in light of the Volkswagen emissions scandal even though one would think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>benefited from Volkswagens blowback In addition <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor released October sales figures for the US market last week and they were expectedly strong And what did the stock do Nothing Last month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors US vehicle sales surged yet again total vehicle sales were up YY from in October last year to vehicles this October According to Fords press release see here last months total vehicle and retail sales signified the best October in terms of sales in eleven years Thats quite an accomplishment Yeartodate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has now sold more vehicles than during the same period last year vehicles to be precise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors US retail sales climbed in October while FSeries retail sales were up These are respectable numbers by any standard but does Mr Market care Nope The stock either doesnt move at all or even heads lower Good news also came from the price front Higher average transaction prices and demand growth were driving Fords results in October According to Fords press release average transaction prices increased a whopping YY Strong demand for our vehicles provided another doubledigit sales increase in October and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>vehicles posted alltime record average transaction pricing of per vehicle Gains in our truck business were especially strong with FSeries delivering its fourth straight month of sales gains and its best October retail levels since Sales and price growth reflect robust economics on the ground but we all know that already Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock continues to fail to react positively to good news I dont think earnings surprises and continued sales growth will be positive catalysts for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>anymore As a result I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will not be able to outperform the market over the next twelve months and I am reducing my price target from to A large part of my position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor consists of January calls with a strike price of Since I have to take the time value of such options into consideration I might very well restructure my position and shift more funds into the common stock now that I have adjusted my price target The common stock at least pays a dividend From a sentiment point of view however I dont expect investors to change their disinterested attitude towards <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>any time soon
