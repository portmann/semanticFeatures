style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>currently has a PEG ration of only and a PE of GM is even more impressive at and Dividend investors will love Fords and GMs dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM are what I call DividendValueGrowth Hybrid stocks There is a lot to love and the downside risk seems low at the current share price levels Both companies will likely gain traction with investors as they continue to perform very well The outlook for the automobile sector continues to be strong worldwide although there is tremendous competition for each company An economic global downturn would be a strong headwind Both General Motors Co NYSE GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Co NYSE F are currently excellent investment opportunities based on various metrics of performance and share price Each company qualifies for what I call a GrowthValue hybrid stock AND they each qualify as solid high dividend stocks as well Neither stock will likely be a home run play in but each offers a very good measure of safety while one collects a dividend well above GM currently and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at When looking at the very best high quality stock buys on the market I like to find companies that do very well based on objective financial metrics AND rate well based on highly respected stock ranking systems In my own research I recently looked for Star S P IQ stocks that pay a dividend of at least and is at PEG ratio below Only stocks passed through these screens and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM each outperformed the other significantly on these metrics In fact both companies have superb PEG ratios GM at and F at The PEs of each was also the best of the list with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at and GM at As a bonus each company also rises to the top for another respected stock ranking system GM gets a perfect rating from Thomson Reuters and F gets a very respectable There is a lot to love for investors with either of these stocks Based on the current valuations and earnings each company has a limited downside risk at this point The low short float of each company reflects this fact with GM only at and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at The Risk Reward equation looks firmly in favor of Reward right now for investors in these high quality companies Both SP IQ and Thomson Reuters rankings confirm this opinion Almost any type of investor should take a close look at both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM shares right now Dividend investors will obviously appreciate the very nice dividend yields Value investors have to love the metrics Even growth investors will like that each company has seen solid earnings and sales growth in recent quarters Of the two stocks GM edges out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on basically every metric so if one must pick between the two GM would be the winner based on objective financial criteria However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a very close second and beats every other automotive company besides GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also positioned well in China with its massive market potential Some investors with long memories will also remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was the only member of the Big Three US Automakers not to need a bailout during the last major recession While this author believes that each of these high quality stocks are solid investments right now the automotive market is cyclical and has risks Any significant US or global economic downturn would likely be quite challenging for each company Also the automobile industry has tremendous competition For example some investors believe that Tesla NASDAQ TSLA has disruptive technology that will threaten companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors in the near future and may well be a current headwind Given the competition and the cyclical nature of the industry neither F nor GM shares are buyandholdforever types of investments An investor who buys shares should monitor economic and industry trends when making decisions on whether to add shares hold or sell In summary by virtually every objective financial metric the stock of both the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company and General Motors Company are excellent investment opportunities currently One can collect well over while waiting for the rest of the market to catch on that these companies are in the top one percent of all large and mid cap stocks based
