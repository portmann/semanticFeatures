coming years as shown below This is why even though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had sold just units in India in the first seven months of the year which is a small speck of its global sales the importance of the country for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>cannot be denied for a longterm perspective As such Fords declining fortunes in this market didnt
