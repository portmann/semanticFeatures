style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is in the bargain bin selling for only x e profits Expected sales and earnings recession is weighing on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares Uphill battle against investor sentiment is biggest obstacle for Fords share advancement As a result I expect Fords shares to move sideways over the next twelve months Last year I restructured my position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F because I expected the near term prospects for capital appreciation for auto manufacturers but especially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor to be dim I still believed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor was on a good run but felt that Mr Market was no longer willing to appreciate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors growth and sales successes in the United States and abroad The reason for that growing pessimism on my part was that investors priced a cyclical earnings recession into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares which made my warrantheavy position in the automaker kind of obsolete Further investors didnt react in a positive way to good news from the auto company which is always a sign for caution Consequently I sold my warrants with a strike price of and a maturity date and moved back in the common stock I did so because of two reasons first and foremost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors common shares are paying a handsome percent dividend while there is a good shot that the auto company will continue to increase its regular cash dividend albeit at a slower growth rate than in the past So even if the shares go nowhere for the next twelve months or the next three years income investors at least get a very nice dividend Common shares come without an expiration date whereas option holders have to watch the time value of their options The big risk with taking option positions is that one could be right on the thesis but may not be right at the right time Moving back into the common stock for income and yield made good sense at the time and it still does especially since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor decided to pay a billion special dividend to shareholders at the beginning of the year growing an already respectable dividend yield <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor continued to be on a roll in April growing domestic vehicle sales by percent YY to vehicles thanks to strong customer demand for sport utility vehicles and trucks While the company itself guided for a robust year in financial terms Mr Market would have none of it Investors are effectively on strike refusing to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor even though the fundamentals make buying the auto company a nobrainer F sells for only x this years estimated profits and x sales But investors are not buying Fords sales and growth story which is kind of a shame since the auto company is on track to a record year especially in the United States the companys most important market In fact poor investor sentiment due to concerns that the global auto sales cycle is maturing is the biggest obstacle to significant share price appreciation for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor The unfortunate truth is that Fords results can hardly get any better than they are now And if investors dont care about good results then that sort of limits Fords upside for the foreseeable future Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has an uphill battle to fight in order to overcome adverse investor sentiment despite edging from one sales record to the next I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares to go nowhere over the next twelve months Id love for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares to edge higher simply because the automaker is doing a fantastic job especially in America <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor deserves a higher market valuation since it sells for x estimated profits However investors are not prepared to appreciate the automakers recent gains because they price a sales and earnings recession into Fords shares I am afraid that this lack of enthusiasm for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor will be a major obstacle for the shares limiting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors appreciation potential over the short haul On the other hand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is a promising income investment that might throw off yet another special dividend next year Buy for income not capital appreciation I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no
