Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Slow and steady wins the race Thats our investment theory when it comes to our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>position Domestic reception of the F and future profitability from other global markets continues to validate our long case Slow and steady wins the race Thats our investment theory when it comes to our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F position Sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may be stuck in a trading range that it hasnt deviated from over the last years but important things have been going on under the surface while this is happening The company is paying a dividend with a great yield The company continues to invest in its global operations in anticipation of having them become new profit centers The purpose of this article is twofold First we want to identify some new domestic auto sales data that continues to be in line with expectations Second we want to review some key points of Fords conference call this past week and point out how they continue to coincide with our bull thesis First the companys April sales were released today May st The companys unit sales were up to versus estimates The specifics were Much of our thesis on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>so far has been reliant on the expected success of the companys new F model We also learned on May st that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>posted a strong K number for the FSeries in April even with a Kansas City assembly plant not yet fully up to capacity Secondly lets take a look at some of the statements made on the companys recent conference call post earnings Heres some of the bullish commentary from Fords conference call and our corresponding analysis As you can see here our plan for profitable growth and of course our focus as a business continue to deliver and they remain unchanged This general commentary reiterates our outlook that the company believes things to be on course as we do And while wholesales were about unchanged due to major product launches and the revenue was down mainly because of the effect of the stronger US dollar on our international operations we grew our global market share and achieved profitability in four of our six business units This comment reiterates our thesis that ongoing international growth continues and that the companys revenue miss was due to the strength of the dollar as many other larger multinational companies have faced this earnings season we delivered in the first quarter from several new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Lincoln products and new plants and facilities to being named the only automaker on the list of the Worlds Most Ethical Companies and growing our dividend we are very pleased with our progress We like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as a company because its brand doesnt face the stigma that General Motors NYSE GM does This continues to infuse integrity into its brand and coincides with our outlook that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will turn around Lincoln especially internationally We also have more capacity coming online in AsiaPacific in the second half that will drive incremental volume and revenue We also expect improvements to the bottom line specifically higher automotive operating margin and strong growth in automotive pretax profit driven by North America and AsiaPacific with improved results in Europe and South America as well We continue to expect most of the company improvement to occur in the second half The above statements coincide with our thoughts that China and Asia specifically are going to be major growth drivers for the company in the next couple of years Fords investments in these areas we believe are eventually going to help drive the bottom line once capex settles down and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can achieve some operating leverage We expect North America to have a very strong year in with substantial top line growth higher pretax profit and an improved operating margin This is based on continued robust industry sales our strong product lineup including products launched last year and planned for this year our continued discipline in matching production with demand and a lean cost structure The above statement basically coincides with the backbone of our outlook that domestic growth will hold up and continue to support international expansion Heres some additional support for our outlook that the companys international expansion is going to be the profit driver and subsequently the shareholder value creator moving forward We confirmed earlier this month our commitment to the Russian market where we agreed to certain changes with our partner Sollers that will allow both parties to continue to support the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Sollers joint venture in the nearterm while providing a platform for future growth in this very important market As a result of these changes we consolidated our Russian operations as of March We are continuing our strategy in this region to invest for growth in incremental capacity new products and of course Lincoln in China We expect Asia Pacific to have a strong year with the top and bottom line results improving substantially in the second half versus the first half due to added capacity and new products to be launched from the middle of the year notably the three row Edge the allnew Taurus Figo the allnew Everest the refreshed Ranger and the allnew Lincoln MKX As shown on the left our first quarter wholesale volume was up compared with a year ago while our net revenue which excludes our China JVs declined Our China wholesale volume which isnt shown was up in the quarter This reflects in part strong market reception to the allnew Escort as well as Lincoln which is off to an encouraging start with several of our China dealers already among the brands highest volume dealers globally While the market didnt seem to especially enjoy Fords last earnings report it fell in line with what we are looking for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to be one of the cheapest staple stocks that you can buy on a PE basis and the companys ongoing attractive yield makes it a fantastic DRIP candidate As weve said barring catastrophe we plan on being long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for a long time to come and reinvesting the dividends With the company at a jumping off point for global profitability and the equity priced at just x of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expected to earn next year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is begging us to buy more In general <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to be our preferred way to invest in the US auto market Heres a piece on why we have a target over Again we have to reiterate that we take a longterm view on the company Source <span style='background-color:
