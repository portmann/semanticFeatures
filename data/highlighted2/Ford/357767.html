class='textDiv'>Fords Valuation All Over Again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Cos NYSE F stock is down about since April when it reached a high of No matter what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>does the market seems to have a different set of questions If the China sales numbers are good then Europe numbers are brought into question If Europe numbers are good then US numbers are brought into question If the US numbers break year records its still seen as not having met the expectations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the company keeps winning but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the stock just cannot Sure there are concerns of things slowing down but are the signs bad enough for the stock to trade at a forward multiple of Backing out in cash per share the multiple drops to a depressing Those who have been investing since at least will recall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trading at similar depressing levels right after the market crash when the stock reached as low as We arent arguing that buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>here will give investors a similar return bagger and yield on cost But at nearly yield and a low single digit multiple the stock is priced for a disaster However the rest of the market isnt priced that way as evidenced by the run up in February and March Speaking of it is easy to forget that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>did not declare bankruptcy unlike the other two big players Sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>did get a big loan but the fact is it didnt have to flip the pages to see the dreaded Chapter That thought should be comforting for those want to be prepared for the worst case scenario The management is also being prudent by cutting costs and not overspending on the dividends Keep in mind that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>did not increase the quarterly dividend from cents per share but only declared a special dividend at the beginning of the year While investors almost always want an increase in their regular dividends sometimes companies need to keep the overall longterm interest in mind Make no mistake about it all the major markets that affect Fords sales US Europe China are consumerist in nature and unless things get very depressing for the economy its hard to see a disastrous drop in sales to match the concerns we had in Speaking of the US in specific interest rate and gas price are two critical macro factors that affect car sales The Federal Reserves intent to keep rates low and increase it slowly if at all will encourage more people to take out auto loans Lower gas price adds fuel to the fire pun intended although we are starting to see the usual spike as summer nears The critical FSeries is still going strong newer models are in the pipeline for the higher margin segments and mustang is going strong with a new model expected as well Overall the activities dont seem to match those of a company whose stock is priced for a repeat of But what if one buys here at and the stock indeed tanks Lets do some numbers to find out Now if you believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will go down and stay down forever dont read this section However if you believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will stick to its cyclical nature this section should comfort you Annual dividend per share remains constant at cents This seems reasonable given the free cash flow strength Even if the average free cash flow drops by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should have sufficient free cash flow to cover the dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs about millionqtr to cover its dividends at the rate of cents for billion shares The average of the last five years has been billionqtr and the number was even more impressive at an average of billionqtr Click here to verify this Share price drops by yr in and and then go up by yr as part of a recovery Typically recovery is slower than a fall and hence the lower assumption Over years this experiment yields an annualized return of yr entirely due to accumulating more shares when the price is down Obviously the returns will be higher if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>increases dividends but lets leave out that scenario to counter the other possibility of dividends being cut In addition when valued so low a company needs to surprise to the upside only a little to enhance returns to shareholders We understand that auto manufacturers have been on a roll over the last few years and things are bound to slow down However Fords valuation almost never kept pace with the increase in sales As a result when things are slowing down just a tad the valuation reeks of bankruptcy The stock is also at a critical support level as can be seen here Over the last two years the stock has found strong support at and slightly below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>remains on our watchlist and as we accumulate more cash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be one of the stocks we will be looking
