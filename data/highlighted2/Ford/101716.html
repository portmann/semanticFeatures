NYSEF Seeking Alpha Fords dividend yield is and GMs dividend yield is also Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM look undervalued by from an intrinsic value perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and GM NYSE GM the two iconic American auto OEMs are enjoying one of the best years in auto sales since the mids Mays auto sales at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate SAAR were million cars sold According to JD Power Associates GMs May sales rose while Fords fell thanks to limited production of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Truck as the automaker transitions to the allaluminum body And yet the stocks of both F and GM have stagnated of late A recent article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>here makes one critical error that I think a lot of retail investors make in that focusing on the payout ratio or the quarterly annual dividend divided by the quarterly annual EPS is a less complete way to analyze a companys dividend sustainability since dividends are a function of free cash flow while earnings or earnings per share EPS and the payout ratio is an accounting metric Analysis GMs Q saw the auto giant print versus the in Q so if we exclude Q from the historical EPS growth rate in the table above the average historical growth rate drops to Here is the kicker For both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM is expected to be a strong year in terms of EPS growth with current consensus expecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to grow EPS and GM EPS to grow As you can see from the first table neither stock is exactly shooting the lights out in terms of capital gains this year Free cash flow and Dividend analysis Source Internal spreadsheet all dollar amounts quarter trailing Div FCF The quarter trailing dividend as a percentage of quarter trailing freecashflow Analysis While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>looks to be the more stable and consistent cash flow and free cash flow generator I do think GMs Q was distorted the quarter being a very weak quarter for cash flow from operations CFFO for GM where the Q shows that GM generated about million in CFFO versus almost billion in the year earlier quarter The point being as we get the nd and rd quarter Qs I would expect we will see a normalization of GMs cash flow and thus its free cash flow Analysis One of the benefits of writing for Seeking Alpha is that in writing the article the process is much like doing research and thinking through the topic at hand Simply looking at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GMs balance sheet and the longterm debt issuance my first thought was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>looks better and they are containing their longterm debt issuance unlike GM until the debttocapitalization ratio was analyzed and the reader gets a chance to view the debt from a total liability and equity perspective and GMs surge in longterm debt does not look that worrisome This also helps explain the sudden interest by activist investors in GM that was seen in late Q and early Q While I thought that the interest may have been a function of GMs free cash flow readers now can see that the activist interest was probably driven by the low level of financial leverage that the company was working with The credit ratings for both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM have been improving over the last few years thanks to strong auto and truck sales and improved financial profiles post although the credit ratings remain lowinvestment grade at best and that is the senior unsecured debt While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is likely given the nod in terms of the dividend consistency and stability do not discount GMs low level of financial leverage and its ability to issue more debt Frankly both stocks are significantly undervalued as detailed here with Morningstars current intrinsic value ratings being on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and on General Motors At their current prices <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is trading at a to perceived intrinsic value while GM is trading at a discount to that estimated value With dividend yields and the potential for significant capital appreciation both stocks make sense here for longerterm investors who can be patient The advent and growing popularity of hybrid and electric cars is a disruptive force in the global auto OEM business which impacts the international integrated oil companies too Pleases read the comments section on my recent article on Exxon and Chevron comparison where I get into the discussion with a few readers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM provide pretty decent disclosure in their respective earnings reports and SEC filings so investors can see the financial performance of the auto segment versus the financial segment The fact is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit and GMAC now Ally Financial are still very profitable and provide some financial stability to the razorthin automotive operating margins GM had an interesting stat in its Q Q day delinquent loans had risen to of the receivables portfolios as of Q Is GM doing more than its share of subprime auto loans and are those subprime loans that are starting to rear their ugly heads I havent checked the same number for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>so it could be normal delinquencies for the sector Personally given the improvement in consumer credit and personal balance sheets I think the US consumer has a long way to go before we have to worry about the next consumer credit cycle Technically the area should be good support for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on any market pullback Following the Goldman Sachs downgrade Goldman upgraded <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this week and at the same time downgraded GM GM is testing its week moving average in the area of we probably dont want to see GM trade below on heavy volumes Both auto giants have issues with their South American operations and currency volatility while GM has the still lingering issue of the ignition switch scandal With the nice dividend yields which will only increase on any longawaited correction of for the SP look to buy both stocks on any decent pullback Deepcyclical stocks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM tend to perform best late in the business cycle I do think more upside is ahead for both as long as interest rates and auto financing rates do not rise too quickly Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Vs GM From A Dividend Free Cash Flow And Valuation Perspective Disclosure I amwe are long F GM MoreI
