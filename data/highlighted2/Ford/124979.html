the F has been in question over the last two weeks after reports of incentivized selling of up to off F was being offered We quickly debunked that mostly misleading headline in an article out yesterday and presented our case for why we think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be fine This mornings news of a new luxury F confirms that there is robust demand above current price points for Fords F We wrote an article yesterday about why we thought that the panic about Fords NYSE F incentive pricing on its F was overblown and why the pricing actually went on to support our bull case for the company This morning news was released that supports our rebuttal and supports the notion that F sales are healthy thereby firming up this leg of our bull case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been trying to push the luxury element of its business especially outside of the United States The company has done well in projecting the Lincoln line as luxury vehicles outside of the US and now it looks as if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to try and combine the rugged tough guy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>tough image of its pickup trucks with a bit of luxury This morning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced that theyre going to be offering a new top of the line F that sits above the Platinum version of its truck which is currently the most expensive offering The new truck will come in over and will help push ASP up significantly for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Some people are apparently luxury truck buyers Wired described them as the ability to haul a pound horse trailer without giving up the finer things in life Here from Fords website you can see the higher end models that the company currently offers The new model would usurp the Platinum as the high end model One thing is for sure here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wouldnt be taking the time to make this model if they werent confident it would sell The company must be seeing encouraging data from the Platinum model to support this After all the companys ASP for an F as we stated yesterday is This falls toward the higher end of all models offered we cut out the economy models from the above screen shot If you recall from our article out yesterday one of the points we made defending the F was that the average price of a F rolling off the lot told a very different story than some incentives that were being offered The addition of this higher end F to the companys line of already existing trucks shows us that theres demand for a very expensive pickup truck Its at direct odds with the bearish thoughts a couple weeks ago which basically amounted to the F has to get cheaper for anyone to buy it With the F a key component of our long thesis we are happy to see this news today and are happier for what it will do for Fords margin and ASP heading into future quarters As we debunked yesterday the incentive figure is nonsense Only in certain parts of the country while taking advantage of all available potential configurations and options is this available The company is not hacking off from every F despite what the headlines make it look like The company says the average incentive is just big difference Todays luxury addition tells us just the opposite is happening demand must be robust This news comes on the back of positive European sales numbers reported earlier this month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>registrations were up YOY to units and EU registrations were up YOY The company gained market share moving to from in the year prior period Source <span
