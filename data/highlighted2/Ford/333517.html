Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe has been in the news for all the wrong reasons until their turnaround last quarter But why is the market still belligerent towards them What more are they planning in Europe to make sure that their profitability in Europe which is already better than GMs stays in the black <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F has been at the center of attention because of a lot of things in recent months Since their coup in Europe during the fourth quarter of and the subsequent softening of the market towards them despite strong January sales in the United States <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been in the spotlight a lot more than General Motors NYSE GM and for all the wrong reasons Their success in Europe was the result of several positive actions and Id like to explore that in more detail to make sure that its sustainable As the only other significant market apart from the US I think thats warranted Theyve been dependent on the success of the US market for far too long and I think Europe is ready to become a dependable additional breadwinner to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>family <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems to want to make a statement in Europe Sales have been steadily moving up for the company and it looks like it could become a trend despite the challenges with strict emission laws in the continent In <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold million vehicles in Europe or Euro for new investors thats what they call the top markets of the approximately countries in Europe thats vehicles more than what they were able to move in about As you can see from the chart below Fords Europe market share has slowly moved up from the range in to to in The trend seems to have spilled over into the new year with the company reporting a market share as of January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>posted its best January performance in Euro since with vehicles sold during the month The surge in SUV Commercial Vehicles and Performance lineups seems to the driving force behind Fords improved sales numbers The company plans to launch seven refreshed models in Europe this year and its little wonder that the company is concentrating on Kuga and Edge SUVs Focus RS performance hatch and the new powertrain for their Transit and Transit custom Commercial Vehicles and also a refreshed Ranger pickup The European auto industry is off to a very strong start and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was able to outpace this growth thanks largely to demand for our SUVs commercial vehicles and performance vehicles said Roelant de Waard vice president Marketing Sales and Service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>of Europe Importantly we gained share by selling to retail customers while many others in industry are using selfregistration and rentals sales extensively Its good to see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has recognized the retail market as its strength Add on top of that the solid performance in three vehicle categories SUV CV and Performance and what you have are highmargin products supporting the companys profitability in the retail segment rather than massmarket models being pushed via rentals sales being the primary source of growth After turning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe to profits after four long years of struggle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seems to be in an as much as possible mode The company announced that it will be starting a voluntary redundancy program that aims to save a possible million a year On a personal note I think the term voluntary redundancy itself is selfdeprecating Who in their right mind would willing declare that they are a wasteful and noncontributive dead weight to the company theyve probably served for a decade or more Bad PR but thats just my opinion During fiscal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>registered a pretax profit of million on billion in sales in Europe an operating margin of When you compare this with the from their most profitable segment North America its clear that they need to get more efficientand thats exactly what they intend to do Think of the level as a sort of benchmark for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe to aspire to The higher the sales of an auto company the easier it is to improve operating efficiency and therefore operating margins The company says that it is targeting long term operating margin of to in Europe I think thats a fair target considering various factors that make Europe a very different market from the United States or Canada With market share on the growth path <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wants its Europe division to be as lean as possible You can look at this from two different angles price increases can contribute to higher margins but the better expander of margins is efficiency in matters such as capacity Hundreds of salaried employees expected to take Voluntary Redundancy To make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Europe operations leaner and more efficient translation dont rule out more cost cutting Capacity Utilization target of At this level shutting down a plant may not be on the table right now but removing the excess capacity is definitely on the menu It is very clear what the company is trying to do in Europe Efficiency and capacity have been major concerns that have only recently been offset by better yearoveryear sales At this point bottom line growth through greater efficiency is as important as top line contribution from sales Both GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have been losing money in Europe and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>management is well aware that their pound of flesh is now overdue for the growth that this market has given them over the past few quarters Expect more costcutting moves over the next few quarters in Europe every extra million saved is a million earned at the bottom line In fact with of Fords sales coming from Europe against GMs the former has a greater vested interest in seeing that operating margin expanding to its most sustainable limit possible In North America and China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been playing catchup with GM In Europe however <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a step ahead of GM in terms of profitabilityand theyll want to keep that status quo going for as long as they can There are some hard times coming for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>employees in Europe but the company has always tried to play fair with its people I dont think this episode will be any different
