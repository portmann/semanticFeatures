Financial Officer Brad Fisher Vice President and Chief Operating Office Andy Agosto Vice President of Business Development Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by Welcome to the Carrizo Oil Gas First Quarter Earnings Call During the presentation all participants will be in a listenonly mode Afterwards we will conduct a questionandanswer session Operator Instructions As a reminder this conference is being recorded Wednesday May of Thank you all for calling in As we always do our CFO David Pitts will go over the financial results then Ill go over the operation status then we will open it up to QA So David do you want to get started Sure thanks Chip and good morning everyone Oil production for the quarter was barrels per day This exceeded the highend of our guidance due primarily to strong performance from our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>assets Gas and NGL production for the quarter was Mcfe per day which also exceeded the highend of guidance due primarily to lower than expected levels of voluntary curtailments in the Marcellus and higher than expected NGL production from nonoperated wells in the Utica First quarter revenues of million included million attributable to oil revenues During the quarter we realized of NYMEX for oil revenues which was within the range of our guided realization And we also realized of NYMEX for gas and NGL revenues which also exceeded the highend of the range of our guided realization Total cost and expenses for the quarter were million and were within the range of guidance DDA for the first quarter was per Boe which was below our range of guidance primarily due to the reduction of future development costs of our crude undeveloped reserves reflecting the approximate reduction in drilling cost and reduction in completion cost we had realized by the end of the first quarter Adjusted net income was million or per diluted share which exceeded consensus earnings estimates of per diluted share Drilling and completion capital expenditures for the quarter were million of which was in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>this is a lower percentage attributable to Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>than prior quarters This is because during the first quarter we incurred the majority of our drilling and completion capital expenditures for the Utica and Niobrara As mentioned in the press release due to the cost savings and efficiencies realized in our drilling program we are decreasing our drilling and completion capital expenditure plan for the year by million We ended the first quarter with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of times This ratio is computed in accordance with our credit facility and includes on a pro forma basis the historical preacquisition EBITDA associated with the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>minerals acquisition in the fourth quarter of Included in the press release is our secondquarter and fullyear guidance table The table reflects the increased production guidance and the reduced capital expenditures guidance for the full year as discussed in the press release as well as updated DDA guidance for the full year Fullyear guidance remains unchanged for all other costs and expenses For the second quarter of we expect to realize to of NYMEX for oil revenues and to of NYMEX for gas and NGL revenues Beginning in this quarter we have also included these commodity price realizations in the guidance table We currently have hedges in place for approximately of our production for the balance of consisting of collars on approximately barrels a day with floors and ceilings We also have hedges in place for consisting of collars on barrels a day also at floors and ceilings In addition to these hedge positions we also continue to receive the benefit from the offsetting crudeoil hedge transactions we entered into in February which locked in additional cash flows of million for the next three quarters of and million for calendar Based on oil and gas prices as of May we expect to receive million to million from derivatives settlements during the second quarter of This includes settlements on our existing oil and gas hedges as well as settlements of our offsetting crude oil hedge positions Please refer to the hedging tables included in the press release for further details In March of we completed an equity offering for net proceeds of million which were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolver And in April of we issued million of senior notes due This was to refinance our million senior notes due Only of the senior notes were tendered in April at a total cost of million As a result on May we will redeem the remaining of these senior notes at a total cost of million As of April we had nothing drawn on our revolver and million of cash on hand Pro forma for the May redemption of the remaining senior notes we would have million outstanding under the revolver Recently our credit facility was amended to establish an approved borrowing base of million which is equal to our existing commitment amount This million borrowing base is slightly higher than the million estimate we provided during our fourth quarter earnings call back in February Based on existing bank pricing we expect our borrowing base will increase to approximately million in connection with the next redetermination scheduled for the fall of Thanks David Despite the challenging commodity price environment during the quarter our management team is pleased to report another outstanding quarter for the company Our net oil production of BOPD was up yearoveryear While we are currently choosing to hold our fullyear oil production roughly flat with the fourth quarter of we do expect to exit with a yearoveryear increase in production With our combination of highreturn assets operational flexibility and a strong balance sheet we are well positioned to resume strong production growth as commodity prices improved In the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>we are producing from gross or net wells with three drilling rigs running in one frac crew During the first quarter Carrizo drilled gross or net operated wells completed gross or net wells Crude oil production from the play was approximately BOPD for the quarter At the end of the quarter Carrizo had gross or net operated Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale wells waiting on completion equating to net crude oil production potential of more than barrels per day Carrizo currently expects to drill approximately gross or net operated wells in frac gross or net wells in the play during We are currently developing our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale acreage on a combination of foot and foot spacing with approximately of our drilling inventory based on foot spacing Downspacing to feet on our remaining Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale acreage would add another approximately net locations to our drilling inventory We currently have four twowell pads online in these areas and have three additional foot space pads scheduled to come online in the firsthalf of the year We are pleased with the early production data as the performance from these wells looks similar to that of wells drilled of wider spacing We have also begun testing of a stagger stack concept in the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>which may allow us to further reduce effect of lateral spacing in the lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>below feet and downspaced areas will be initially drilled on wider spacing Additionally we plan to start a test of the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on our acreage in the third quarter We think approximately of our acreage could be prospective for the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>We have continued to add bolton acres to our position in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale Our position in the trend now stands at approximately net acres following the addition of about net acres since late February In the Utica we recently brought online our third and fourth operated wells from Wagler H and H in Guernsey County We are pleased with the early results as each well averaged more than barrels a day of condensate over the day test period And each well was still producing more than barrels a day of condensate when they were shut in at the end of April We are working with Mark West and hope to have these wells hooked up to sales during the third quarter We currently have net drillable acres in the condensate window of the trend We think that equates to more than net potential locations on acre spacing In the Niobrara we are producing from gross or net wells with gross or net wells waiting on completion at the end of the quarter representing about net BOPD of potential initial production We remain pleased with the performance of our Niobrara Abench tests as they continue to perform in line with our expectations for Bbench wells We have also been impressed by Whitings Codell test in the area About of our acreage has at least as much thickness as their wells and we will continue to watch their performance In the Marcellus we are producing from gross net wells in Susquehanna in Wyoming County Pennsylvania with gas sales in the three major pipelines We continue to limit our production volumes from the area when prices get too low and have a production capacity from the area well above our current rates As a result production volumes will vary based on the strength of local market prices For the second quarter total Company oil production is expected to range between and net barrels of oil per day For gas and NGL secondquarter production should range between and net million cubic feet equivalent per day Our drill and complete budget moves down to million to million as a result of cost reductions and efficiencies land CapEx remains unchanged at million At this total level of spending we expect to be able to generate midsingledigit exit rate growth in maintain a strong backlog of wells to complete once commodity prices improve and keep our net debttoEBITDA ratio below times This should position us to be able to quickly accelerate our production growth as commodity prices improve So the nearterm catalyst would be Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>foot downspacing We should have some results in the next days Longerterm in the secondhalf we should have some results on Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stagger stack and Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>test Delaware Basin farm outs and leasing and potentially a Codell test in the Niobrara So to sum up before the QA we expect steady sequential oil production growth through the year betterthanexpected service cost reductions are letting us reduce CapEx and our strong balance sheet is allowing us to look at new opportunities primarily in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Delaware Basin Operator Instructions One moment please for the first question Our first question today comes from the line of Will Green from Stephens Your line is open Please proceed with your question So weve recently seen some strong well results from Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and other areas and I think other operators have sighted higher amounts of proppant I know you guys have been kind of on the leading edge of really pumping a lot of proppant into the wellbore As you guys look at these cost reductions youve seen in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and another places is that an area where you guys would potentially look at pushing that further and applying some more science to the well or do you guys feel like youve kind of exhausted kind of the possibilities of enhancing the EURs on that front and now its more of a cost game I wonder if you could just talk about how you view that balance right now or if you are actually seeing if youve seen the diminishing returns of the pumping things like more sand Will this is Brad Fisher We have just recently fracked a couple of wells We had a fourwell pad We did two of them with our standard pounds per foot of sand concentration and we fracked another two on the same pad with pounds per foot The incremental cost on that runs about a stage for us So we expect probably sometime in third quarter that well go and get an indication of how successful the increase sand concentration is And based on that that pilot well make a decision on a go forward on adding some additional sand to some other completions In addition to the sand concentration weve had several wells now where we have pumped Halliburton diverter into put that as part of our frac jobs So we are looking for some data on that probably third quarter as well So we certainly havent given up by any means on optimizing how we frac the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>wells Great I appreciate the color And then maybe talk a little bit about refracs Its something weve heard quite a bit about here in the last few months And I wonder if you guys had a take on it if its an opportunity for you guys and if its something you are looking at or plan to do anytime soon Well were a proponent of refracs We are waiting for the industry to the service industry to figure out how to do it efficiently I mean refracs have worked in conventional plays and shale plays We refracked a horizontal well in the Barnett It was a short lateral which made it pretty easy to do and we have very good results back in about So we are a proponent of it And we would like to see the service companies come up with a way to do it The mechanical isolation of the zones is the hard part And whether you can do that with diverters or some sort of vault to plug off the perfs or whether you have to cement the well and start over we are open to suggestions But we havent seen anything yet that makes us want to start spending money Will this is Brad Fisher I just want to add one thing to that A lot of the talk around refracs has been targeted at wells that were initially understimulated either longer frac intervals or lower sand concentrations Weve been very consistent on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>since starting of shorter frac intervals in large sand concentrations So we want to see industry progress into the what well call the properly fracked well and see how refracs work on there before we make a decision on how far well go with that Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust Your line is open Please proceed with your question Good morning guys Chip could you talk a little bit about the down spacing of foot foot Again how many locations is that going to work in most of your Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as well as the stagger stack concept a little bit Well if we can down space that feet in the virgin areas we havent drilled already that adds about net wells If we can stagger stack then we might be able to down space that again That would essentially double the amount of wells you could drill And I think we said that could be as many as wells That spacing is getting very tight and we are drilling a well now to test that So its fairly risky that we will be able come up with that many locations But the other thing we want to do is figure out if we can go back into the areas we drilled on foot or foot spacing or even spacing And even though theyve been producing for a couple of years maybe we can stagger stack that and that could add a few more locations Our next question comes from the line of Brian Corales from Howard Weil Your line is open Please proceed with your question Yes good morning Kind of on the same topic has anyone done kind of a foot stagger stack well in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Hey Brian this is Andy Agosto We are not aware of an actual stagger stack at that spacing no From the data we can see publicly there are clearly wells being drilled tighter than but were just not sure whether any of those are staggered or not Okay And then kind of on the same concept if you were on the water space wells I guess you drilled three or four years ago I mean would you have to shut in that pad to put the stagger stack to put that other well in there if you were to down space from that method Yes I mean thats clearly an issue with any drilling around drilling and fracking around existing production We tend to build that into the forecast From a drilling standpoint no I dont think we would be shutting production in From a completion standpoint we would but thats kind of normal course of business for us Any well thats within feet or feet we typically shut in Okay I mean just one more if I could Chip you talked about the higher prices kind of waiting for some of these to complete or not completing all of the wells for higher prices Are we getting close to that point where maybe we could start seeing you all whittle down that backlog Well we havent been trying to build a backlog I guess the backlog in the Niobrara has gone up but we will frac three of those wells shortly But at some price and we have said in the past we are comfortable that oil is going to be for a long time we could add a fourth rig and that would probably be in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>But were not ready to make that call yet I think we would be jumping the gun to do anything before the OPEC meeting in June and see what happens then Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe of Tudor Pickering Holt Company Your line is open Please proceed with your question Good morning I had a couple of quick questions on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>I guess first would be on the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can you talk about how thick that is where you are planning to target it on the western side of your acreage position The section is there is comparable in thickness to the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in spots the total section may even be a little bit thicker But as weve talked about in the past whenever weve discussed the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the issue there is hydrocarbon storage so were looking for porosity And generally what we would consider net pay in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is considerably less than the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The big issue in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and again well just refer you back to the Analyst Day is there is a formation we call an ash bed that separates the Upper and the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>its a clay formation And the question is whether thats going to seal post frac And so we should be able to ascertain that with the test that Chip mentioned that well be drilling this year Okay fair enough And I guess on the Delaware Basin and I guess there wasnt much to talk about on the press release But can you just comment on nearby drilling activity in your areas of exposure Im just curious if you are seeing any material changes to cost structure or other interesting data points from offset operators Thank you I think the most activity in our area has been from BHP and also from EOG and the well results just seem to get better and better So we still dont have a good handle on cost because we havent drilled or fracked a well yet We are still working on a farm on a farm out Were closer to getting it than we were two weeks ago But looking at the BHP wells the Horseshoe Springs wells are the best thing to compare to Our next question comes from the line of Michael Glick from Johnson Rice Your line is open Please proceed with your question Good morning guys I know you took delivery of those newbuild rigs in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>What sort of efficiency gains should we expect there I think at Analyst Day were predicting the generation three rigs to go from about wells per rig to up to about So and we seem to be on schedule for that so thats what I would use in your model Gotcha And then maybe just from a high level or higher level what inning do you think we are in in terms of efficiency gains in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And then maybe what inning are in in terms of recovery factors in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>This is Brad Fisher Ill address the inning for the efficiency I think probably the bottom of the eighth I think theres smaller gains to be made but they are going to be more slug it out type stuff I mean our average Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well now is run in to days on a foot lateral And we see incremental gains but they are small and we talked about it at Analyst Day It is kind of slugging it out from here We do get a little bigger jumps when we bring on these new generation rigs and new generation tools But I think the eighth inning is where we are at On the EUR side this is Andy Agosto I think were probably six to seventh inning One thing that we have to remember here is the most mature Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well has probably been online for five years or less And I think if weve been able to prove anything in this industry and in particular with respect to resource plays shale plays is that weve figured out ways to get more out of this rock Weve started out with pretty low recovery efficiencies and weve consistently been able to up that Brad earlier talked about a couple of different things we are trying on the completion front And there may be some things down the road that we dont even know of yet but these are to year life type wells And I think we will see continued improvement in EUR Our next question comes from the line of Dan Braziller from Jefferies Your line is open please proceed with your question Hello everyone Thank you for taking my question Just jumping over to the Utica I was hoping you guys could discuss the pressure drawdowns you have seen specifically on Brown compared to Wagler and maybe also compared to the Rector well And just kind of wondering what type of pressures you have seen on Brown What type of decline you would anticipate from this point forward Thanks Good morning Dan this is Jim Pritts With respect to the Brown and Wagler and Rector wells is important to understand their relative structural positions and location North and South in the play The Rector and Wagler wells are at about the same structural depth some miles apart And when we tested the Wagler wells we primarily tested those for a short time frame because since they are on strike with the Rector we expected them to be very good wells And indeed they were and we were more interested in getting fluid samples to kind of refine our understanding of the facilities that we would need in stabilization around those wells So the Wagler wells were very Rector like The Brown well is some miles up depth of the Wagler wells So if you go up depth its about miles away and some foot to foot shallower from a structural standpoint And we are very pleased with the Brown well relative to other wells in that structural position We have averaged over barrels a day For the Brown and we are on day of the flow test for the Brown so the well is doing well It is some less on those than our type well in length Our type well is foot and it is on order of foot in length So it continues to flow last test a day or so ago was barrels a day plus over million cubic feet a day plus With respect to be exact pressure differences between the Rector Wagler and the Brown we view that somewhat competitive and prefer not to get into that Operator Instructions Our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets Your line is open Please proceed with your question Thank you and good morning First two questions on economic limits How do the economic break evens of the Upper and Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale differ Appreciating the data may be limited with the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And then secondly how do those breakeven prices compared to what youre see in the Permian basin again appreciating that the data may be limited given your limited operating history in that basin Hey Dan this is Andy Agosto I think getting back to my comment earlier about whether that ash bed seals If it does not our anticipation is that the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to look very much like a Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well If it does seal and it is an independent reservoir its going to be more chalk like Were not sure at this point what the EURs are going to look like in that scenario It would be hard to comment at this point As far as the Permian comparing it to the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>there are a lot of moving pieces as well costs differentials the amount of gas We think the better performing Permian wells look very Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>like in terms of economics And so for us we think where we are going to be drilling where our initial wells will be in that area So we believe its going to be competitive with our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Great And as a followup to that if we believe strip pricing and maybe the lack of much of a Contango in the shape of the curve today maybe you could conclude that opportunities for acquisitions will be greater tomorrow than they are today Maybe as a reality of low for longer prices sets in and producers further struggle to make it work do you agree with that statement And if so does that mean the MA window could open again or open wider going forward I guess I support your plan as somebody who wants to make acquisitions But I read way too many reports where people think it is going to be a Ushaped recovery And it just depends on where that lacks on the right leg on the U is whether a year from now or five years now But the Contango dropping like it did should help us eventually to bidask should start shrinking and people will start getting a little market therapy and be willing to sell something Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stevens from KeyBanc Your line is open Please proceed with your question Hi guys Thanks for taking my question Can you just talk a little bit about how you balance increasing activity levels next year between your different areas Oil prices are in the upper s I think in your press release you mentioned wanting to increase activity levels in the Utica a little bit But the economics are obviously a little bit better in Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>so how do we think about that dynamic through next year I think it all depends on oil price Not only because it gives us more cash flow to invest but the effect of the big differentials has less bearing The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>right now has a low differential like below WTI whereas the Niobrara is still higher than that to The Permian as higher than or is around Utica seems to be around to So as long as those differentials stay there the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to always command the dollars But if prices go up enough then that shrinks or the impact of that differential doesnt have the same bearing and wed probably think more about drilling in some of these other areas Okay So I guess it sounds like you would be more likely to just kind of add a rig in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and go from there if commodity prices go higher then add to other areas Yes that would be safe through and in wed probably start thinking about holding acreage in the Utica But we dont really have to spend much money until on Utica acreage holds We really dont have to spend much money anywhere else on that Operator Instructions Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Connolly from Clarkson Capital Markets Your line is open Please proceed with your question Hi guys Service costs seem to be running a bit ahead of schedule Do you think there is more room to lower costs And then how do you think about the cost reductions you have achieved as crude starts to recover a little bit more maybe heading into and Jeffrey this is Brad Fisher So far we are a bit ahead of what we projected Right now we are running on the oil or on the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>side We are at about on the drilling and about almost on the completion side If we kind of hold that constant for the rest of the year assuming we maintain that were going to basically come out of just a little bit of ahead of what we predicted in our models Going forward on the drilling and completion side I think there is a little bit of room there Once again I think its going to be kind of slugging it out from here forward if we see commodity prices start to come up and we see activity pick up the discounts are directly tied to activity levels So if activity levels come up the discounts are going to stay stable and at some point they are going to start to erode At the price level we are at right now its hard to fathom that its going to they are going to erode a lot more but I just dont see them really coming up a lot on the drilling complete side Well if there are no further questions we will wrap it up Just to sum up I think we are one of the healthiest small cap companys at these oil prices We have been able to improve the balance sheet in the first quarter both with the equity offering and the restructuring of our bonds We have we beat the high end of our oil production guidance and now we should have sequential growth all through this year We are poised to be able to ramp up if we see a significant increase in oil prices And maybe the market for acquisitions is going to get a little better as some people start saying that they need the money as we get closer to the next redeterminations With that I would like to thank the staff and the management for doing such a good job of dealing with these low oil prices And well talk again in days Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the
