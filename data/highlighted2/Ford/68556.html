valuation model the company is undervalued at the present time The market is implying a in annual earnings growth over the next years which is significantly less than the growth the company has seen in recent years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F has shown very strong earnings growth over the last several years which when combined with the companys high dividend yield will immediately intrigue many investors For example Orange Peel Investments recently justified a long position based on strong overseas and capital investment Similarly Christopher Salerno believes in the companys management despite some concerns about the plans to grow efforts in the Russian market These are great qualitative concerns that must be taken into consideration when making investment decisions However Benjamin Graham the father of value investing taught that investors must take emotion out of the equation as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investments merits Heres a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research In addition Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation to remove the subjective elements of emotion This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another By using the ModernGraham method one can review a companys historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries Adequate Size of Enterprise Market capitalization of at least billion PASS Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition Current ratio greater than PASS Earnings Stability Positive earnings per share for at least straight years FAIL Dividend Record Has paid a dividend for at least straight years FAIL Earnings Growth Earnings per share has increased by at least rd over the last years using year averages at the beginning and end of the period PASS Moderate PEmg price over normalized earnings ratio PEmg is

Score Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition Part Current ratio greater than PASS Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition Part DebttoNet Current Assets ratio less than PASS Earnings Stability Positive earnings per share for at least years PASS Dividend Record Currently pays a dividend PASS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company performs well in the ModernGraham model and is suitable for Enterprising Investors The Defensive Investor is concerned with the inconsistent dividend record and the lack of earnings stability over the last ten years while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns As a result Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis which is a determination of the companys intrinsic value When it comes to valuation it is critical to consider the companys earnings history In this case the company has grown its EPSmg normalized earnings from in to an estimated for Even though this is not a very high level of growth it is well above the markets implied estimate of only annual earnings growth over the next years Here actual growth in EPSmg over the last several years has averaged annually so the market is expecting a very significant drop in earnings growth The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure assuming that some slowdown will occur but still estimates a growth figure much higher than the markets implied rate Therefore the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the current price indicating the company is significantly undervalued at the present time Enterprising Investors should take this information regarding the companys valuation and proceed with further research into whether the company would be suitable for individual portfolios as it has passed a ModernGraham review Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company Is A Great Opportunity
