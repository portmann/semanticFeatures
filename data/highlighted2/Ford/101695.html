style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been range bound over the past two years The next months are very important for the company as it cant afford any more hiccups The demand for Fords new F is high and the company needs to solve the frameshortage problem as early as possible The new F recorded the highest ever selling price for the month of May and has potential to considerably boost the companys bottomline The last two years have been pretty frustrating for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F investors as the company has failed to live up to the promises The stock has been rangebound and the company has been plagued with many unforeseen headwinds The slowdown in the Brazilian economy and slowerthanexpected revival rate in Europe has kept a lid on Fords stock To make matters worse the sales of Fords main revenue generatorFare also falling due to the production constraints <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was expected to reach full production speed in the second half of and the Blue Oval cannot afford any more slipups <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has no further room for error and needs to deliver in the second half of to gain investor confidence Earlier this month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>released sales statistics for May Sales of the companys fullsize pickups were down close to while General Motors NYSE GM posted solid gains <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is losing market share to peers However the companys falling sales arent a result of lack of demand but production constraints <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold over trucks in the first five months of and the number would have been much higher if the company had produced the trucks at desired capacity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>took a huge risk in switching to aluminum especially after commanding a strong position in the US as the FSeries has been Americas highest selling vehicle for years While the demand for Fords new F is high the company has been faced with supply shortage as the two facilities making the trucks were being retooled Consequently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has lost market share to peers However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should be able to manufacture at the maximum capacity in the coming months as CFO Bob Shanks recently confirmed that the company has finished ramping up production of the F at both plants that build the aluminumbodied pickups Although the shortage of supplierbuilt frames has restricted the plants from running some scheduled overtime <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expects to counterbalance it by removing the conventional twoweek shutdown at its factories this year While sales are down the F is clearly generating more revenue per sale than its predecessors The truck averaged a price tag of in May more than last year The average selling price has also increased by since March was a record for the F The higher average selling price or ASP has partially offset the plunge in sales And if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>manages to reach its goal of selling FSeries trucks in it will contribute over billion to the companys bottomline One thing that investors should not worry about is the demand As per TrueCar demand for the F has forced GMC Chevrolet and Ram to offer more discounts on their trucks so as to keep <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>from stealing market share TrueCar President John Krafcik said The initial success of the allnew aluminum body Fseries is undeniable We project that positive sales and revenue momentum will continue and expect automakers within the fullsize segment to offer largerthanusual discounts to remain competitive The F has received positive reviews and given the high demand I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will find it easy sell vehicles if it manages to produce them at desired rates The next two quarters are extremely important for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as the company cant afford any more hiccups The company has already sold over FSeries trucks and shouldnt have a problem in reaching its target if production remains at desired levels for the remaining part of Due to the high ASP the new F will considerably increase Fords bottomline <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a juicy dividend yield of and I think investors should continue to hold the stock for the next two quarters to see if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>finally lives up to its promises
