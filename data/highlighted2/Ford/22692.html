March but the auto maker managed to beat the consensus estimate nonetheless I have commented on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors latest sales results here General Motors also had to report a yearoveryear decline in vehicle sales although the decrease in sales was not as large as the one for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor In March General Motors
