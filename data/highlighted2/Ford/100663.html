Seeking Alpha A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor executive has sold shares recently which gets some attention The sale is nothing unusual at all and shouldnt be blown out of proportion There are no implications for Fords share price I discuss why Fords chart setup is getting more bullish <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F is one of my investments that I have gradually build up over the last two years by buying the dips and I specifically loaded up the truck when the company released its overrated profit warning in September The majority of my long position now consists of January <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor calls with a strike price of although I do own the stock too <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is a longterm investment for me because of its compellingly low valuation and because of Fords Frelated potential for earnings growth Last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor made a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to a stock transaction by David Leitch identified as a vice president and general counsel at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor that took place on June According to the insider filing Leitch sold shares at an average transaction price of thereby netting million Company insiders usually executives board members or influential stockholders often have superior information about the companys financial condition sales prospects etc so insider transactions like the one mentioned here are watched closely because investors like to see how insiders evaluate their businesses In theory and practice insider ownership is a very good thing for shareholders Having skin in the game aligns managements interests with the interests of shareholders and properly incentivizes management to do the best job it possibly can to create value for the owners of the company Logically selling shares as a company insider is often construed as an unwelcome and unfortunate event However this shouldnt be the case here First insider sale transactions take place regularly to some extent because insiders have legitimate financialpersonal reasons to sell stock Second the insider in question here Leitch owns shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor worth approximately million after the latest transaction was executed Third the transaction volume is relatively small when put into relation to Fords market valuation Fourth Fords executives have regularly sold shares in the past so I wouldnt characterize the latest transaction in any form as unusual Bottom line The latest insider sale has at least for me no implication at all with respect to how I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor as a value investment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors chart setup is improving After rebounding and recapturing the mark in June helped by a Goldman Sachs upgrade the stock is trading in the lowmid range to gather strength for another push north In the absence of any shortterm market dislocations or negative earnings surprises with respect to the second fiscal quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor surely has potential to move higher from here Insider transactions can give investors valuable clues as to how executives evaluate their company But things must be put into context The latest insider transaction is not unusual and the low transaction volume should not make anyone anxious Now if the CEO dumped all of his stock suddenly at week highs that would be another story But the reported transaction should not be construed as a negative vote on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor at all Long F Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor I Dont Care About The Recent Insider Sale
