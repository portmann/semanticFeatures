#A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors have been inundated with negative sounding headlines about incentive selling of the flagship F Looking behind the headlines shows less reason to panic This doesnt change a key part of our long thesis that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will continue having success with both its F and Mustang Those that read us regularly know that there are several components to our long thesis on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F Second we believe the companys bet on itself allocating capital to innovation and global expansion versus giving it back to shareholders will pay off in global growth In turn we expect this to generate net income far in excess of expectations which we believe will be the one catalyst that can push the stock higher Third we think there is a strong backbone of sales domestically that we expect to hold up Fourth even stronger are the companys two new offerings in the F with new aluminum body and the Mustang now being sold globally in areas where it previously wasnt available If one of these key components of our thesis were to change it would necessitate us taking another look at the company Recently some headlines gave us pause and caught our attention We wanted to run through them at length and see what they meant for our thesis Causing a stir recently was a report that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was hacking off the price of its F This is extremely alarming wording for those long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>especially those who count on the F to be a big part of their backbone of their long thesis like us It just doesnt make sense the F seemed to be so well received Could it be time to panic We think not and heres a couple of reasons why Average prices remain high at and the companys data shows that the F sits on the lot at about half the time as average inventory To put it concisely sales are still rolling along strong The figure is bologna Only in certain parts of the country while taking advantage of all available potential configurations and options is this available The company is not hacking off from every F despite what the headlines make it look like The company says the average incentive is just big difference Much of the incentives that are being talked about arent specific to the F Theyre being offered as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit incentives like the companys offer to get cash back when using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit The company has been upping its production In the business incentives are relatively common Sales run at certain holidays and down times and its just a feature of the business Like retail theres generally always an incentive being offered Put simply this is a case of having to look behind the headlines We are actually encouraged by the way the F continues to sell The companys success in Europe which we wrote about days ago also continues to support our thesis The company trades at a very attractive x price to sales and a respectable x their book value At about x what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expected to earn next year nothing about Fords valuation seems overdone in a market where we believe that equities are starting to push their upper limits valuation wise Fords EVSales of x is extremely attractive While its worth continuing to watch we think these F headlines are false alarms We are still bulls on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and think the best days in the companys history are ahead of it Source Fords F Do New Incentives Signal Bad News For Shareholders Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
