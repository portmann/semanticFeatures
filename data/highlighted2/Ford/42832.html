Buy General Motors When Theres <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Lately General Motors has had a lot of fans in the stock market including in the hedge fund world from people like David Einhorn Although the business has done better on the top and bottom lines than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors should take a close look at the latter before discarding it Given the disparity in price between the two it appears as though Mr Market isnt fully recognizing Fords potential as a longterm holding When it comes to cars customers tend to be fairly picky The same likely holds true to the shares of car manufacturers like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM Lately Mr Market seems to have a similar sense of loyalty as evidenced by the fact that shares of the latter have risen more from their week low than Fords and that they are trading nearer to their week high While this could be quite bullish for General Motors investors should take a step back and consider that just perhaps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may offer the better prospects moving forward The reason why Mr Market tends to favor General Motors at this point in time comes down to performance Over the past five years the company has outgrown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with sales climbing from billion to billion while Fords top line has grown slightly less at Looking at cash flows from operating activities we see a similar trend with Fords metric rising by from billion to billion while General Motors fared far better with cash flows from operations soaring from billion to billion Even in terms of net income General Motors has come out on top Between and the company saw its net income actually decline a whopping from billion to just billion largely due to an increase in depreciation and amortization during this fiveyear period <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however did even worse with its net income plummeting from billion to billion F Net Income Annual data by YCharts Based on the numbers alone investors would be crazy to pick <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>over General Motors but thankfully for the formers shareholders its important to consider the price you are paying for said value Looking at the graph below you can see that shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are actually trading far cheaper than its rival when it comes to free cash flow With a pricefree cash flow ratio of the company is less than half as expensive as General Motors which suggests that Mr Market is undervaluing the companys lackluster but allaround reasonable performance from years past F Price to Free Cash Flow Annual data by YCharts Another way to evaluate the picture is through the lens of share price in relation to net income As we can see in the graph below the valuation picture is a little less onesided by using this metric which removes the possibility of cash flow timing from its results At the moment shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are going for a fairly high but not necessarily unreasonable priceearnings ratio of which is just slightly lower than the times profits that investors can pick up General Motors for Looking at asset value we continue to see that shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are cheaper than its rival Currently investors can pick up the business for just times the value of its net assets all assets less liabilities which is significantly cheaper than the times book value that General Motors are trading for In essence although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is more profitable on a pershare basis than its peer Mr Market is trying to say that the assets that create that value are worth about less than the assets that create General Motors profitability Right now Mr Market seems enamored by General Motors but it appears as though its more or less disregarding the potential that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has underperformed its rival over the past few years but the companys sales and operating cash flows are rising and shares are trading at a rather meaningful discount on a pricebook value and a pricefree cash flow basis compared to General Motors and at a slight discount when it comes to earnings Although this does not mean that the company presents investors with phenomenal prospects moving forward it does imply that it may be a better longterm play for valueoriented investors than
