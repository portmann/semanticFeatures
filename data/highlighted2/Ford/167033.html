<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Can Get To Per Share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares are over off their week highs following the recent market downturn US sales are still going strong and launching a wave of new models last year should free up capital going forward The right combination of dividends share buybacks and debt reduction could push <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares to in the next couple years The past year has not been kind to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F shareholders with shares off over from their week highs Concerns over a slowdown in China and an upcoming Fed rate hike have hurt markets recently and pushed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares to the low end of their longterm range But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sales are still strong and if the broader economic environment cooperates good execution and capital returns could push shares to While unlikely to push shares to on its own earnings growth will be a key factor in pushing shares higher Currently analysts are forecasting in est EPS in est EPS and in est EPS Investors are discounting these future earnings over concerns that they may never materialize in the previouslytroubled auto industry But if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can meet expectations it will have demonstrated a couple more years of profitable strength allowing it to get a valuation closer to x earnings pushing shares to around However achieving this multiple will likely take more than just greater earnings and could incorporate the three concepts discussed below Although Fords stock has underperformed the dividend has been a source of strength for investors Currently yielding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>pays a sizeable dividend in the current low interest rate environment While this is a sizeable dividend the market has already factored it in and dividend investors are looking for dividend growth as well To boost the share price higher through dividends the dividend will need to move higher from here Fortunately for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>investors the company has a history of raising its dividend at the beginning of the year which it has done every year beginning in If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues its pattern of raising the dividend by per quarter at the beginning of each year the quarterly dividend would rise to per share beginning in This would give investors at current prices a yield on cost If the market adjusts Fords share price to keep the yield the same shares could rise With the payout ratio at I dont expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to move the dividend dramatically higher However the increasing earnings trajectory combined with much of the model refreshing capital spending being done last year should allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to continue doing incremental annual dividend increases These moves will demonstrate management confidence and attract dividend growth investors two factors beneficial to the share price The recent market downturn has negatively impacted current <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shareholders but it does present an opportunity for the automaker While General Motors NYSE GM was buying shares back before the downturn racking up significant paper losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could begin a buyback at the current lower market levels Now that the previous heavy development spending has passed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will have more cash to fund shareholder capital return programs The initiation of a share buyback would offer a signal of confidence from management while at the same time increasing every shareholders slice of the earnings pie And at the current low forward PE levels buybacks would be highly accretive and could grow the effect of higher earnings on the share price Many investors have been calling for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to reduce its debt levels and I believe some debt reduction would be beneficial Lowering the debt level would help derisk the company as an investment as well as lower interest payments However the debt picture at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not as bad as many people believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit carries the vast majority of the debt with much of the debt directly secured by borrowers cars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automotive only has about billion of total debt and actually has net cash of around billion The company has already noted that it intends to lower <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automotives debt level to billion by which I view as a positive development While debt reduction has many positives it is not necessarily the best use of capital if the interest rate is low In the case of low interest debt such as the ATVM loan from the Department of Energy it would make more sense to repurchase cheap shares carrying a dividend than pay down the loan early Nonetheless strategically retiring a modest amount of debt could help bring more conservative investors to Fords shareholder base These investors are typically willing to accept a higher valuation in exchange for greater security making them more likely to push shares higher than if the shareholder base was just speculation and value investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares have had a tough time making gains but earnings growth should provide a favorable background for the company In addition to growing earnings the automaker will need to attract investors through already implemented debt reduction plans and expected dividend increases Investors could also see additional upside if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>were to launch a modest share buyback to reduce outstanding shares and signal management confidence Disclosure I amwe are long GM AND MAY ADD F IN THE NEXT HOURS MoreI wrote this
