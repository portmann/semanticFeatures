style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is seeing strong sales numbers but still carriers a low valuation Shares carry a sizeable dividend yield With auto sales going strong major automakers are returning capital to shareholders through multiple avenues In a previous article I discussed the capital return plans from General Motors NYSE GM and here I will discuss the plans from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F Auto investors are well aware of Fords position as the only member of the Detroit Three not to go through reorganization during the financial crisis But prior to the crisis the automaker took action to revamp itself including selling off Volvo Land Rover and Jaguar to raise cash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also has the bestselling pickup truck in the US the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F however sales of the F lag the combined sales of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra For the model year the F gained an aluminum body helping to shave off weight boosting performance and fuel economy While there have been some concerns over the move to aluminum Fords August sales numbers looked encouraging for the F remodel Alongside its automotive side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also has a financial side <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit that extends credit to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>buyers Worth noting is that this part carries the vast majority of Fords total debt with much of it being backed by vehicles themselves This makes for a significantly safer investment than its debt to equity ratio would imply Unlike GM with its billion share buyback <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has not launched a stock buyback to reduce outstanding shares Last year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>launched and completed a billion share buyback however this was only to balance out dilution from share based compensation and convertible notes In its annual report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>noted that it had completed the buyback and gave no indication of launching a new buyback While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has mostly avoided share buybacks in recent years it has made major efforts to return capital to shareholders via dividends Currently the quarterly per share dividend gives the automaker a yield of This puts its yield slightly below GMs but above almost all of the rest of the automotive industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has also developed a pattern of raising its dividend by per quarter at the beginning of each year With a current payout ratio of the dividend is met at this point but earnings growth from the company would go a long way towards making it appear more sustainable This payout ratio also implies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will need strong earnings growth to safely increase its dividend Trading at only x est earnings and x est earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares carry a low valuation Largely because of this I would like to see management implement a stock buyback program even if it is not as large as GMs program But investors should be aware that GM only launched its billion buyback after being pressured by activist investors Similar action is less likely to be successful at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>due to the power of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>family in the voting structure Although I would like the company to add a buyback the dividend still makes the capital return plan a positive one overall Fortunately for investors significant earnings growth is expected with EPS expected to more than double from to If this earnings growth materializes it should allow the company to both raise its dividend and bring its payout ratio down to a safer level Some investors have also argued that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should pursue debt reduction While I do believe that less debt could earn the stock a higher valuation I also believe the company should be selective in which debt it targets High interest debt is worth eliminating but the company has better uses for cash than eliminating low interest debt Its also important to note that since shares have a dividend yield <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>could reduce ongoing cash commitments by repurchasing shares Despite the low current valuation and large dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares continue to remain volatile and this will likely keep happening as broader market turbulence continues Fords exposure to the cyclical auto industry could impact its ability to paygrow dividends in the future so investors should be willing to assume some risk before adding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to their portfolio <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has focused almost exclusively on dividends over buybacks making it better positioned for income investors However the lack of a buyback misses an opportunity for management to reduce the share count at this valuation as well as saving on dividends from having fewer outstanding dividend paying shares Despite the lack of a buyback <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is still a worthwhile investment for dividend value investors to consider in my
