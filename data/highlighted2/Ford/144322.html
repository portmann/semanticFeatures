Alpha Domestic sales and F sales are the backbone of our long case for F The demand for Fs has been called into question numerous times over the last month Amid reports of F trying to ramp up production WSJ confirms that the company has gone to a second steel body supplier to meet demand We continue to follow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and as we disclosed that we were going to do last week we added shares this week with a longterm focus on both collecting the companys impressive yield mixed with waiting for it to achieve global profitability We have a multiyear outlook on the company One of the things weve talked about in our past articles was the F and Mustang continuing to be the backbone of the companys production in the US Domestic production needs to remain decent so that the company has a foundation for when it finally starts collecting on some of its overseas investments Domestically the F is a sizeable investment the company has made in itself and the results of F sales show us whether Fords use of its capital has been worth it So far things look good Coming off some news last week that the F didnt perform well in crash tests combined with the misunderstood news of incentive based selling we were happy to read some news that continues to support our case The company has now gone out and hired an entirely new supplier just to provide steel frames for the F This is all part of Fords continued plans to ramp up production as demand is keeping the F model flying out of dealers lots The steel frame remains one of the steel parts of the vehicle which now incorporates a significant amount of aluminum that helps with emissions and gas mileage The Wall Street Journal said The Dearborn Mich auto maker is struggling to get as many redesigned Fs on dealer lots as planned because of troubles its supplier Mexicobased Metalsa SA is having building enough frames to keep up with demand according to the people <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>recently hired a second supplier to fill in the gap and has been shipping frames to its factories by truck rather than rail to get them there faster but at a higher cost the people said With not enough frames <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has had to cancel planned overtime and at times temporarily halt the assembly line during regular shift work as plant employees wait for more frame deliveries to arrive say people familiar with factory operations This combined with the companys new addition of an even higher end model of the F continues to fuel the fire that suggests domestic demand for the F is meeting and exceeding expectations Again from WSJ The Fs frame was reengineered for the makeover and is about pounds lighter than the old one It has a higher percentage of highstrength steel and is built with a new process that varies the thickness of the metal used to reduce weight The frames are built by Metalsa at a factory in Elizabethtown Kyabout miles south of Detroit and miles east of Kansas City The shortage has become so acute that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has sent a team of fixers from advisory firm KPMG to Metalsas factory in Kentucky to ensure smoother operations people familiar with the move say This is a nice day by day update that the company continues to have the active problem of not producing enough Fs and that they are working to reduce the supply chain bottleneck We think this will be good news for the financials moving into the back half of Despite this progress its been much ado about nothing for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock still It stays parked and paying out a nice yield As we said in our last article the company is continuing to roll out its foothold globally and become an international powerhouse in the automotive market We continue to believe that as investments in these companies top out or start to slow and the operating leverage begins to take hold the narrowing losses and eventual bottom line growth from its international markets backed by strong domestic sales will be the catalyst that drives <span
