investment proposition has been under scrutiny over the past week but investors shouldnt be moved The companys focus on fuel economy is a longterm growth driver The longterm investment proposition of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors NYSE F has been placed under scrutiny over the past week owing to the yearoveryear decline in sales the company reported for the month of March A contributory reason for the heightened scrutiny is that the company also reported a yearoveryear decline in sales in February <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported overall sales of vehicles for the month of March representing a percent decline compared to the sales from the same period one year ago In addition for the month of February the company reported overall sales of vehicles representing a decrease compared to February While these trends doesnt offer any hope on the surface I believe that there are a couple of things that investors can be optimistic about Ill discuss one in here Overall investors should love <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for what it stands for providing longlasting value to its customers In my last article here on Seeking Alpha I discussed how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been committed delivering longlasting value by focusing on fuelefficient vehicles and how the benefit has been obvious in the companys gross margins Moreover as I said the article if you cast your mind back to the beginning of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>youd find that Henry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>originally started the company to offer longlasting value manufacturing vehicles that the average American can afford Are great to sit in second home comfort convenience exceptional quietness Provide fuel economy as a reason to buy Provide exceptional value and quality The part that I like the most is where it says it aims to produce vehicles that provide fuel economy as a reason to buy The steps the company is taking to make this vision a reality position the company for better profitability in future Lets look a bit into that vision <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F is one of the products through which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been trying to promote fuel economy as a reason to buy In fact MainStreet included F in a list of Most FuelEfficient Vehicles of Their Class for And the company is even driving further by ditching the vehicles steel body for a body made of aluminum The Car Connection reported towards the end of March that insurance rates for F remain steady despite the uncertainties surrounding the new aluminum body This quickly struck me since experts were expecting the modification to bring about higher insurance rates Among other things increase in repair cost a big reason why experts expected higher insurance rates However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had taken certain steps to ensure that the modification doesnt result in higher insurance rates Logically I would expect that the company would take similar steps with other models to ensure that its fuelefficient autos dont break the bank to insure Therefore customers might actually be able to save on both gas costs and insurance costs In the end this could encourage higher adoption of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>autos Here are some of the steps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has taken to keep insurance costs in check First as The Car Connection reported the company factored the higher prices by building the new F in such a way that it allows bodywork and repairs to be performed on a smaller scale In essence owners of Fs that need bodywork can decide to replace only a small and cheap part of the aluminum body instead of replacing a large aluminum panel This would always be beneficial to keeping repair costs at reasonable levels In addition a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>spokesperson told caranddriver last year when speaking about the cost of aluminum that while highstrength aluminum alloy is more expensive than steel on a poundforpound basis weve developed manufacturing efficiencies to reduce this cost as much as possible Considering that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would be largely involved in the manufacture of spare parts for the new F a takeaway from this statement is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has also taken steps to ensure that repair costs will be bearable Still in an effort to keep repair costs in check the company also said that it planned to certify and EQUIP of its dealerships to deal with collision repairs on the new F <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also said it planned to certify additional independent shops to handle the same work As I stated earlier all of these steps would to some extent keep insurance rates in check And there was another point from an expert that suggests that the change shouldnt cause any drastic change in the Fs insurance costs Dr Robert Hartwig President and Economist at the Insurance Information Institute told caranddriver in the story I referenced above that The portion of most drivers insurance premiums devoted to collision repair is rather small with the majority given to liability coverage Given that comprehensive and collision typically makes up about a third of a premium any increase in repair costs wont drastically affect overall premium rates This also goes to say that expecting drastically high insurance rates based on high estimated repair costs is not a complete analysis Moreover since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>carefully chose aluminum alloys that have similar tensile strength to that of steel we shouldnt expect that the new F is so fragile that it cant even carry a yard dumpster without cracking By way of bringing it together I would say that with the steps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is taking to keep higher costs associated with producing fuel effect vehicles in check we could expect that consumers wont suffer by paying higher insurance premiums And as I stated earlier this could be a major sales driver for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as the world shift focus to fuel economy Source Another Way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Is Delivering Value Disclosure
