driving suit mimics taking the wheel stoned Reuters A simulation suit that mimics the effects on wearers reactions of taking illegal substances has been developed by scientists to show young drivers the dangers of getting behind the wheel while intoxicated by drugs Scientists from the MeyerHentschel Institute in Germany in conjunction with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company created the suit to simulate some of the effects of drugs such as cannabis cocaine heroin and MDMA Ecstasy in particular slower reaction time distorted vision hand tremors and poor coordination A kinetic device in the suits gloves produces a tremor akin to that caused by some illicit drugs Random flashing lights in the goggles peripheral area allied to hallucinogenictype sounds in the headphones combine to disorientate drivers In tests even professional drivers were badly affected failing to perform simple tasks such as driving in between cones The suits made of a number of different elements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>vehicle safety manager Paul Fay told Reuters So there are pads that go on the elbows and knees which stiffen the joint and slow down reaction times In addition to that there are large heavy weights placed on the ankles and wrists These have a big effect on coordination and balance On one hand theres a device that produces a tremor and affects motor skills and the key thing is the addition of the goggles which produce tunnel vision with visual distortions and random flashing lights and finally headphones which provide audible disturbances with random noises which are very distracting when you are trying to drive We start with very heavy ankle weight then youve got knee padding knee restraints restricting movement added <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>spokesperson Charlotte Ward Weve then got two wrist weights elbow restrictions the tremor glove neck brace to again restrict movement the goggles which distort the vision and with the flashing lights can help create this kind of tunnel vision effects and then weve got the headphones playing this sort of horrible noise The experience will be incorporated into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Driving Skills for Life DSFL the automakers young driver program that provides training to people around the world through handson and online tuition Young drivers will be given the opportunity to wear the suit while driving on a closed course The suit is designed not to produce the sensation of being on drugs but to reproduce the side effects which may have a dangerous effect on your driving said Fay The suit is a variation on the Drink Driving Suit that the automakers incorporated into their training last year Fay said the company wants to provide handson education to young people about the effects of driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol even when they might believe they feel fine A lot of the skills that they need for driving coordination good eyesight good visual acuity being able to be free from the distractions of things that are happening on the road to be able to operate and control the vehicle All of those deteriorate response times are slower coordination is poorer he said A survey by the USs National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that around percent of the countrys motor vehicle driver deaths involved nonalcoholic drugs other than alcohol Their study showed that percent of drivers tested positive for drugs that impair driving Fay says it is too early to draw major conclusions from the success of the suit in changing young peoples perceptions as the project has only just been launched but said those who have tried it out for themselves were all surprised Obviously its been launched as part of Driving Skills for Life program so we havent a huge amount of experience with it but I think everyone who puts it on says I didnt expect the effects to be so marked and I guess when you take the suit out of context of people actually being high on drugs and saying this is the effects it would have if they were taking drugs they may not notice that their performance was being affected in this way so its a real eye opener for them that this could seriously affect what theyre doing and how theyre driving <span style='background-color:
