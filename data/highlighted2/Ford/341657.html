Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has got off to a mixed start in on the stock market as it does not expect a material improvement in its pretax profit but things should improve <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is lining up new SUV launches going forward which will allow it to tap SUV growth in key markets such as China and India The SUV market in India is expected to grow by the end of the decade while SUV sales in China will grow this year itself <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has recently launched the Endeavour SUV in India and it is competitively priced while for China it has modified its lineup as per local expectations to improve sales Since SUVs are highmargin products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to improve its margin profile on the back of growth in both these markets and grow its pretax profit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F got off to a disappointing start in even after beating Wall Streets earnings estimates last quarter as the company warned that its margins in the US will take a hit As a result Fords pretax profit forecast of billion for the current year was not met with enthusiasm by analysts and investors who were expecting the company to post a figure of billion this year But there is one key area where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is capable of improving its margins Asia The demand for SUVs in Asia particularly India and China is growing at a tremendous pace and the good thing is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has lined up new models to make the most of this growth In fact according to Fords Asia Pacific President Dave Schoch When I take a look at Fords growth over the next five to years we believe roughly of the growth will be in the Asia Pacific region More specifically in this market the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>executive believes that China and India will be the key growth drivers In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sees Chinas auto sales hitting million vehicles in up from million in and doubling to million in India in the same period Hence in order to gain the highest market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is focused on offering the vehicle categories that are relevant to most of the potential buyers in these markets And like the US in China and India too the SUVs and crossovers are proving to be sales drivers So in this post we will try and take a look at the prospects of the SUV market in India and China and how the company plans to attack this particular market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is not a big player in India with just of the market share but the companys sales have taken off in this market after the introduction of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Figo twins last year Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has introduced its newgeneration Endeavour SUV which was launched in January The new Endeavour SUV marks the third launch for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>India in the fiscal year after the Figo and the Aspire The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Endeavour is based on Fords T platform and retains the bulky and long stature This premium SUV is priced between INR lakh approx and INR lakh approx in India In the premium SUV segment the all new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Endeavour is going headon against contenders such as the Toyota Fortuner the Chevrolet Trailblazer and the Mitsubishi Pajero Sport But more importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has cut its competitors on pricing with the Fortuners base price beginning from INR lakhs or The following chart clearly shows that the Endeavour has undercut its rivals on the pricing front in India More importantly the new Endeavour is the latest generation among all three models This means that when primary rival Toyota reveals its next generation Fortuner later this year it will receive a price hike that will make the Endeavour cheaper Already sales of the Fortuner in the Indian market are declining and once it receives a price hike due to a newer model its sales will fall further This presents a strong opportunity for the Endeavour as sales of SUVs in India are expected to go up to units by the end of the decade from around last year Since the Endeavour is an SUV so it will command higher margins than the rest of Fords lineup in India which is why I wont be surprised if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sees its margins from India getting better A similar story will be seen in China where Fords SUV sales are recovering now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sells its luxury brand Lincoln in the Chinese market After declining to a year sales low in the brand finished on a good note In fact it was the first year since that Lincolns sales topped vehicles in China In addition it posted consecutive sales gains in the two years and More importantly Lincoln has started this year with an yearoveryear sales increase riding on the success of the allnew luxury midsize SUV the MKX which posted a increase in sales This also marked the best sales performance for Lincoln SUVs since Now the Lincoln is just of the highmargin products from Fords stable in China For instance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is selling the threerow Edge SUV which is made for China as opposed to the tworow Edge which suits the US market The new Edge was very well received in China Further SUVs such as the Mondeo and the Kuga which are the Chinamarket versions of the Fusion sedan and the Escape SUV respectively have allowed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to improve its margin performance in the Asia Pacific This is because a sizeable portion of Fords profit from the AsiaPacific region was driven by China in the fourth quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>clocked a profit figure of million in the region last year out of which million was made in the final quarter But in the same quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>made million in China from equity income from its two joint ventures which means that China is Fords only profitable region in the Asia Pacific The income from China was up by as compared to the same quarter of indicating that Fords SUVs are driving growth in this segment as the company did not gain any market share last year despite which the profit increased The trend will continue this year as SUV sales in China are expected to rise in Since the company has been focused on improving its SUV portfolio in China I wont be surprised if it is able to capitalize on SUV growth in this region this year as well Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has announced that it will expand its lineup of sportutility vehicles by adding four SUV nameplates globally over the next four years which will give it ample strength to capture the growth markets of India and China Fords performance in the two key Asian markets will be driven by SUVs going forward and since the company is targeting both markets by launching new models it should be able to gain more traction As pointed out earlier since SUVs command higher margins due to their desirability and premium nature <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should be able to improve its margins this year mainly on the back of growth in China while India remains a longterm play Hence I think that investors should not get discouraged by Fords guidance of pretax profits excluding special items to be equal to or greater than the billion reported for as the company is capable of overhauling this target due
