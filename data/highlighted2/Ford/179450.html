the claims in the article make it appear that Apple can achieve this target which would put it in direct competition with Tesla Tesla will be unable to compete with Apple because of Apples deep pockets talent and an established network of manufacturing expertise Since Teslas current share price is reflective of massive projected future sales any serious competition from Apple could quickly deflate its share price Tesla NASDAQ TSLA just received troubling news that Apples NASDAQ AAPL electric car project has a target ship date of Back in February when initial reports suggested that Apple was planning on building an electric car very few details about the project were revealed At that time we found out that Apple had approved the project and put veteran product design Vice President Steve Zadesky in charge of it The project was codenamed Titan and has been secretly in production since last year The latest revelations provide additional details about the project The most significant point is that Apple is committed to a target ship date Other revelations from the article are In May Apple employees met at a secure testing facility for autonomous vehicles in San Francisco In August an Apple lawyer met with California Department of Motor Vehicles officials to discuss autonomousvehicle testing rules Apple does not plan to make its first electric vehicles fully autonomous If Apple can effectively break into the electric vehicle market this will be a game changer Tesla will have to face a corporate behemoth with deeper pockets more talent and an established network of manufacturing expertise Given Apples strategic advantages over it this may be the most significant problem Tesla has ever faced Tesla faces a myriad of challenges from Apple with the most salient being its deeper pockets stronger talent and established network of manufacturing expertise Apple has much deeper pockets than Tesla According to Apples latest quarterly report it has billion in cash and cash equivalents Although of this is housed overseas it still has over billion in the US Its aggregate total cash on its balance sheets is the largest of any company in history Apple has deployed its cash to increase its competitive advantage It spent bn on research and development in fiscal alone indicating its strong commitment to continuous innovation On top of all of this Apple is incredibly profitable raking in a massive billion in profits last quarter Compare this to Teslas financial situation It has spent billion in the first half of this year and has had to resort to selling additional shares to raise capital After initially suggesting it would aim to raise million to help fund its growth it eventually raised million by issuing a little more than million shares Tesla is hoping to ease its tight financial standing through high sales of the Model X and preorders of the Model next March It needs to raise as much capital as possible especially since it lost on every car it sold last quarter Telsa expects to spend billion in capex and research and development this year alone While its understandable to spend a lot on the front end in order to achieve high returns on the back end it remains an openquestion mark about when Tesla will actually be profitable This is one of the most problematic issues and Elon Musk has suggested that Tesla will not show profitability until In terms of talent one could make the argument that both Tim Cook and Elon Musk are incredibly talented CEOs But Tim Cook only has to manage Apple while Elon Musk manages Tesla SolarCity and SpaceX Although Musks Ironmanlike management of multiple companies is unparalleled it means that he is not entirely devoted to Tesla at all times This means that his deputies have to play a larger role in ensuring Teslas overall success Cook also has deputies to manage Apples electric car project Looking at who he has in charge highlights an additional advantage for Apple over Tesla Steve Zadesky is an incredibly talented leader and is in charge of Apples Titan electric car project He received a BA in mechanical engineering from UC Berkeley and an MA from Stanford in mechanical engineering Zadesky worked at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as an engineer for threeyears before moving to Apple in At Apple he first worked on developing the iPod and then shifted over to help develop the iPhone He worked on both projects from their inception and these products have been incredibly profitable for Apple These products are arguably two of the most successful personal electronic devices in the past fifteenyears With a leader like him in charge of a person team it is likely that Apples electric car is on track for success While Musk centralizes a significant degree of power over Teslas direction for himself his Chief Technical Officer and cofounder Jeffery Straubel plays a significant daytoday role in Teslas operations Straubel got his education from Stanford and received a BA in Energy Systems Engineering and an MS in Energy Engineering Prior to working at Tesla he worked for Boeing and cofounded a company called Volacom that specialized in highaltitude electric aircraft Since working at Tesla Straubel has worked on expanding Teslas development of its own batteries and also helped set up the supercharger system He is a talented leader that is hoping to reduce the cost of batteries in order to make the Model affordable and attractive to the average consumer There is no doubt that these two leaders are innovative and have the skills necessary to succeed However Zadesky already has two game changing pieces of technology under his belt while Straubel is hoping that cheap batteries and high consumer demand will lead the Model into the mass market While a reasonable argument could be made that both these leaders have the potential to be successful what matters most is who will be able to put their respective companies on top In my estimation I believe Zadesky will be more successful than Straubel This will likely be the case not only because of Straubels track record of prior success but also because Apple can help bankroll the poaching of additional automotive talent to add to his team In fact this is exactly what Apple has been doing and hired Doug Betts who led global quality at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NYSE FCAU in July Apple will continue to hire and attract the best and brightest which will ensure the longterm success of its electric car project Tesla meanwhile will have to continue to deal with the problems of attracting talent because of an overzealous CEO As Straubel pointed out I try really hard to back away and put my ego aside Elon is incredibly difficult to work for but its mostly because hes so passionate He can be impatient and say God damn it This is what we have to do and some people will get shellshocked and catatonic It seems like people can get afraid of him and paralyzed in a weird way This is not an ideal work environment and there is no doubt that Apple has an advantage over Tesla on this point The other major advantage Apple has over Tesla is its established network of manufacturing expertise Apple does an excellent job of finding contractors to do its manufacturing For example Hon Hai Precision Industry Co aka Foxconn is the Taiwanese contract manufacturer that builds most of Apples iPhones It does so in an efficient costeffective and streamlined manner Although building a car is considerably more complex than building a phone it is possible that Apple could reach out to Fiat Chrysler for help With the recent hiring of Doug Betts from them and ties that senior Apple executive Eddy Cue who is on the board of Ferrari which is owned by Fiat Chrysler has as well it is possible a partnership could develop Alternatively Apple could bankroll the creation of a car factory which would only set it back a little more than billion It could then use its deep knowledge of supplychain management to ensure that all of the parts and equipment necessary can be procured and used to build its electric cars at this facility The bottom line is that Apple has multiple options it can pursue to build its electric vehicle whether it be through subcontracting a partnership building its own capacity or some combination of the above On the other hand Tesla continues to spend an enormous amount of capital on constructing its gigafactory which remains an untested experiment on a massive scale Tesla will cover billion of the billion total cost of the gigafactory The factory will be built in segments and the latest videos show some progress in its development However it will not reach its potential full capacity of gigawatthours GWh of annual battery production for its projected cars a year until Yet the entirety of Teslas future growth and profitability is contingent on the success of this unproven gigafactory Suppose Tesla is somehow able to garner enough demand for cars by it is unlikely that the gigafactory will develop exactly as planned As this is Teslas first attempt at building such an expansive and complex facility there will undoubtedly be challenges in the developmental process Tesla has already experienced developmental challenges with all of its cars so far and it will likely face additional challenges with the gigafactory Depending on the severity and types of challenges Tesla runs into with the gigafactory its ability to respond to them will determine its overall success or failure While Panasonic will no doubt help and it is likely that the gigafactory will reduce the cost of batteries bringing the factory to scale without setbacks is a near impossible task Given the fact that Tesla has nowhere near the manufacturing expertise knowledge in supply chain management or prior experience in managing large scale projects compared to Apple this will add to Apples advantage over Tesla in the long run Tesla faces a serious challenge from Apple Although Elon Musk has welcomed Apples foray into the electric car business he is welcoming a competitor that could far surpass Teslas capabilities While Ive outlined numerous problems with Tesla in the past its Apple problem could mark the biggest challenge yet Tesla investors should be wary of Apples plans to develop an electric car It is unlikely that Tesla will be able to compete with Apple in the long run because of Apples deep pockets talent and its established network of manufacturing expertise Additional details concerning Apples electric car plan are needed in order to fully assess the extent of its challenge to Telsa But based on what is currently known it is clear that Apple has a number of key advantages over Tesla As Teslas current share price is reflective of massive projected future sales any serious competition in the future from Apple could jeopardize these sales and quickly deflate its skyhigh share price Disclosure
