Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Analyst downgrades and commentary have hurt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>last week A US recession at this point is already priced into shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F did not get a good start to the year Investors have been ridding themselves of stocks ever since the new year started and concerns over a US recession have hurt cyclical auto makers like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor the hardest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has crashed since early January driven by a mix of concerns over the economy in China the United States and over the energy price rout that extended into Adding to and exacerbating those concerns was a highprofile downgrade and negative commentary about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor by an investment bank last week that gave investors the jitters On Wednesday Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse downgraded Fords stock from Neutral to Underperform and set a price target of Reason for the downgrade The investment bank argued that the auto makers volume assumptions are too optimistic and that recent gains made due to price growth and mix improvements were offset by higher material costs But that wasnt enough Investment bank Morgan Stanley piled on the bad news last week and reiterated its Sell rating on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor due to the risk of a cyclical downturn Morgan Stanley has a price target of on Fords stock There surely is risk of a cyclical downturn but it is no reason to rush and sell the stock IMO In one of my last pieces on the auto maker OK This Is Just Stupid I contended that investors are already pricing a US recession into shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor and other US auto manufacturers at this point in time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>reported record results for and announced a special dividend of billion in January because the automaker expects momentum to carry forward into Though the outlook for does not look too bad I reduced my price target on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock to in January because sentiment towards auto companies has unmistakably taken a turn for the worse this year In a January piece on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor I concluded The reason why I am reducing my month price target has therefore nothing to do with Fords operating results or outlook but rather with the uphill battle the company will have to fight to overcome negative investor sentiment this year There is no love for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor in this market and a lot of it appears to have to do with expectations that the auto maker is approaching a sales and earnings peak before global auto markets are cooling off The latest Sell ratings just prove this point investors are pricing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor for a recession Whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and other auto manufacturers for that matter have already reached a sales and earnings peak is up for discussion but the stock is nonetheless a good income and yield play moving forward The simple question is Whats wrong with buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor for a yield and holding on to it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>declared a special dividend this year thats true but even if the automaker decides to return to paying only its regular dividend of share in assuming no YY dividend growth an investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would still yield close to The risk of a dividend cut is low in my opinion and collecting regular dividend paychecks from a SP company during a downturn is not the worst of ideas Investors already price a cyclical downturn into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares at this point so downgrades are to be expected US economic data so far does not indicate that the US is heading for a recession which makes it likely that investors are overreacting to downgrades from investment banks All considered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is an appealing investment choice with low headache potential The dividend yield is good enough at least for me I wrote
