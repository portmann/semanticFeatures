Hits The Brakes In China Should You Worry General Motors Company NYSEGM Seeking Alpha China is GMs largest end market in terms of sales which is why a slowdown in the country hurt its sales in August GM however is taking the right steps to weather the downturn in China by following a threepronged approach to sell more vehicles by targeting the premium budget and SUV segments GM has released a highmargin SUV in the form of the Buick Envision in China while the Baojun brand will allow it to tap the costconscious customer GMs focus on the Cadillac brand in China is another smart move as the luxury market in the country is slated to outpace the overall car markets growth General Motors NYSE GM has a huge stake in China It is second only to Volkswagen OTCQXVLKAY in terms of sales volumes across the country and sells more vehicles in the country than anywhere else in the world including the US This means that China is GMs biggest end market Together with its partners the company has sold a record vehicles in China during the first eight months of this year This is higher than the same period last year But more recently the Chinese economy has hit a roadblock due to a variety of factors ranging from the stock market crash in the country to slowing economic growth As a result if we take a closer look at General Motors recent monthly performance in China it becomes evident that the company is facing problems in the country In the month of August GMs sales in China declined to vehicles owing to softness in the overall vehicle market in the country However GM has taken certain steps that have helped it deliver positive growth in the first eight months of while rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has reported that it has sold less vehicles in China in the first months this year Amid all the challenges GM is facing in the much coveted China market the company has remained focused on designing specific products to cater to the needs of its Chinese customers The new SUV Buick Envision has been a big hit for GM in China GM reports that Buick has had its best sales ever in China in the first eight months of the year The brands sales increased yearoveryear to units Though Envisions contribution to the brand was not huge units in the first half but it is growing now and this is good news for GM The increasing share of Buick Envision in the brands total sales is also financially beneficial for GM The Envision is priced in the range of RMB about to RMB about An almost similar upcoming version of the Chevrolet Equinox will sell for around in the US Thus the Envision commands a premium in the Chinese market which is why it will positively impact the companys margin performance due to a higher sale price This is probably the reason why GM has kept its profit margin goal intact for the year GM China President Matt Tsien said in a press release Recently launched models such as the Buick Excelle GT and Cadillac ATSL have been well received by consumers and produced solid sales growth The success of the luxury brand Cadillac is also a welcome sign for GM Even as overall sales of the company dont rise for some time Cadillacs rise will boost profits Cadillacs sales have come in at units higher on a yearoveryear basis through August Going forward it wont be surprising if Cadillacs sales continue increasing as the luxury segment in China is slated to grow despite the downturn clocking a CAGR of until Moreover apart from the highly profitable segments of large SUVs and luxury cars GM is also targeting the Chinese middle class population This is not surprising as local Chinese car makers are thriving on this particular segment In fact the sales of the locallymade inexpensive SUVs are also on the rise in China To keep its market share intact GM has launched two very affordable Baojun SUVs The Baojun is smaller in size and is priced at RMB It has been on the market for the past few weeks and has performed well all this while In fact for the January to August period the Baojun brands sales have jumped to an alltime high of units However GM will face stiff competition from American rival <span style='background-color:
