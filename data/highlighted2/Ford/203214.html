review <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company and General Motors to determine which stock is currently the best longterm buy I examine each stocks value as a stable growth value and defensive investment based on a wide number of metrics The results of this analysis lead me to believe that GM is currently the best longterm option at the moment due to its greater returns yields and profit margin In this article I look at both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM to help determine which is the better long term investment for specific types of investors based on a variety of metrics In doing so I review each stock based on the following characteristics Since all investors are not the same I believe that looking at companies through a range of lenses is useful in determining the worth of specific stocks In my review I compare the two stocks on individual metrics and then tallying the results of those values to determine a winning stock for each category The purpose of this category is determine which stock has the best overall financial position possessing a stable and consistent balance sheet and overall value GM also has a significantly higher earnings yield when compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>GMs value comes in at while Fords is While both companies have seen an increase in book value per share over the past five years Fords increase has been significantly greater Both companies have also seen an increase in the number of its outstanding shares over the past five years with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seeing the largest increase In the stability section I feel that GM is the clear winner outperforming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in four out of the five metrics While Fords increase in book value has been impressive the fact that it lags GM in the other four areas is a bit of a concern The purpose of this category is to determine which stock has seen the most growth over the past several years and which stock is likely to continue seeing the most growth in the future Both companies have seen decent growth over the past several years but GMs has been more impressive at more than double Fords growth In terms of earnings both companies have seen significant declines over the past several years with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>seeing a slightly more significant decline I believe that GM wins this category as well With stock price appreciation or in this case depreciation being nearly identical along with similar ROEs it is GMs stronger revenue growth and less of an earnings decline that makes it more attractive from a growth standpoint especially when you take into account the companies slightly better profit margin The purpose of this category is to judge each stocks current value to determine which one is more attractively priced GM is more attractive based on this value as well with a x value compared to Fords x price to book value This is the one metric in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>appears more attractively priced with a value of x compared to GMs x valuation GM wins this category as well as it appears more attractively priced based on PE PEG and Price to Free Cash Flow values The stocks Price to Free Cash Flow valuation is high but otherwise GM appears to be the more attractively priced stock at the moment The purpose of this category is to judge how well each stock will hold up during a recession I will be looking at both dividends and past performance to score this Both stocks currently pay dividends with similar yields for GM and for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been paying constant dividends a bit longer compared to GM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has increased its dividend by since reinstating it in while GM has increased its dividend by since reinstating it in Normally I would review the stock price returns for each stock during the last few recessions but this information is not available for GM due to the bankruptcy years ago I did look at Fords stock and it didnt perform well and in general auto stocks are not very good defensive stocks during down times While both stocks offer fairly high yielding dividends the dividend history of the companies leaves a lot to be desired I dont think that either stock is a suitable defensive investment option At this time I consider both stocks a hold There is a lot of headwinds facing these two companies as auto sales forecasts are falling and worries about global demand mostly China linger But for long term investors looking at a value play I think that GM is currently the best bet Both stocks have seen deep losses the past month for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and for GM and I think this has presented a decent buying opportunity for long term investors especially in the case of GM as its loss this month is nearly double that of Fords but with higher returns higher yields and a higher profit margin I feel the stock has been somewhat oversold I think the next couple of months will continue to be a grind for these two stocks which is why I consider them Holds but whether or not they are at or near their bottom is something only the market will decide For those who believe that bottom has been reached I believe GM provides the most bang for the buck at the moment As always I suggest individual investors perform their own research before making any investment decisions We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
