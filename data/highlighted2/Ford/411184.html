style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and General Motors are both on a strong rebound after the rout at the end of last year The economy as well as the auto industry is showing signs of stability that both companies can piggyback on Fuelled by increasing truck sales low fuel prices a stable economy and key opportunities overseas both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM offer attractive investment opportunities for longterm investors irrespective of whether youre looking for longterm total returns or dividend yield growth What makes these stocks valuable now after the rout last year How do their metrics and current industry sales trends impact their performance moving forward And what specific numbers should you be looking at before you invest These are the questions I will try to answer here The first environment we need to look at is the industry they operate in Many analysts estimated that peak auto sales happened in and therefore must necessarily show a significant decline This is clearly not been the case as you can see from the graph below Though sales for light vehicles in the United States showed strong performance until November the decline after that has only been relative and thats something Ive been trying to draw investors attention to ever since my first automakers update on Feb around the time when F and GM shares were at their recent lowest At the time I claimed that unless there was another major recession sales would not dip too far from the million level Three months on and the market has validated that claim and auto sales have stayed at around that critical million mark To put that in perspective from a FordGM viewpoint the key driver of those numbers have been truck sales where the companies have seen significant growth year over year Despite a decline in car sales trucks have shown strong sales growth for both companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in particular has seen the most gain from truck sales the F Series being their champion variant with a YoY increase in yeartodate sales As you can see overall sales for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have been positively impacted by its light truck sales edging it closer to GM in terms of market share From an industry perspective truck sales will continue to show strong performance through the year and will offset any decline in car sales as weve already seen in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM Obviously an industry cant grow without macroeconomic tailwinds and this is what were seeing in the case of the US auto industry as a whole which directly influences and is influenced by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GMs individual performances Fuel price is one of the key considerations here While there is no clear causative link between fuel prices and car sales it is logical to assume that light truck sales will only drop under two conditions one if fuel prices suddenly surge and two if the economy collapses In addition to stable fuel prices interest rates are expected to stay near their current levels until the end of and possibly beyond With the IMF forecasting a growth rate for the US economy in things are going to be good if not great for the auto industry In my opinion interest rates and credit availability are the most important factors that influence the overall auto sales As long as the economy holds its ground and credit is available thats going to keep auto sales chugging along Although both companies depend on the North American market for profitability <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM are looking to counter that poor balance with aggressive growth overseas In Fords case they expect Europe to play a significant role in helping boost overall profitability Theyve shown consistent profitability in that segment over recent quarters after a long period in the red and project strong growth for this segment in subsequent quarters As for GM CEO Mary Barra expects to grow China sales by with an expected billion in investments through The significance of these successes is that over time they will help transform both companies from dollardependent entities to firms that have balanced portfolios to offset any future weakening of the dollar In a sense it is akin to hedging their success in the United States with strong performance in nonUS currencies Investorspeak Summarizing the Investment Opportunity Encapsulating the investment opportunity in a nutshell this is why you should consider investing in F and GM Continued strong sales performance in driven by growing truck sales Stable economy that indicates continued sales growth trends Downsides have already been priced into both stocks Looking at these factors its clear that theres a definite opportunity for longterm value investing But yet another benefit of putting your money here is their growing dividends Both stocks currently show dividend yields well over with GM at and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at From a valuation perspective GM seems to be the more undervalued of the two Nevertheless both companies are ideal longterm investment destinations
