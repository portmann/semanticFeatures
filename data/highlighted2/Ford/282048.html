from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>struggled on the stock market last year as weakness in China overshadowed the positives in the US but will turn out to be different Low unemployment rates and faster wage growth in will power US auto sales to more than million units driven by the growth in SUVs and pickup trucks China will see stronger auto growth of this year due to lower sales tax and the growing adoption of EVs Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is strengthening its SUV and pickup truck lineup in the US and has also finished introducing new models in China it can benefit from both markets Fords focus on the EV market on the back of a billion investment will reap rewards in markets such as China in the long run The recently concluded was a mixed bag for the global automobile industry as the optimism was muted due to weakness in China the worlds largest auto market On the other hand auto sales in the US remained strong in with sales of million vehicles an increase from million vehicles last year In the midst of these mixed emotions in two of the most important auto markets across the globe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F turned in a muted performance on the stock market in losing almost of its value Fords decline started after weakness in the Chinese auto market reared its head bringing an end to the bright start that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had in However investors should not miss the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has started gaining some momentum in the past three months and I wont be surprised if this trend continues for the rest of the year So in this post we will take a closer look at how the auto markets of the US and China are expected to perform and how they will shape Fords performance this year In fact this year it is expected that US auto sales will cross the millionmark The improvement in the auto market will be driven by better economic conditions in the US such as an improvement in employment and better wage growth For instance as shown in the table given below the unemployment rate in the US has declined steadily over the past few years In fact in the unemployment rate has come down to indicating full employment At the same time it is anticipated that in we will see an increase in wage growth As reported by Bloomberg After five years in which annual wage increases have averaged around percent salaries are set to pick up as a taut job market prompts more employers to boost pay to retain or add the workers they need economists said This will be the first time in a long time and Im talking a long time that workers will see real wage inflation of some magnitude said Jonas Prising chief executive officer of ManpowerGroup Inc the Milwaukeebased staffing company with more than billion in revenue last year In fact for much of wage growth in the US remained strong as shown below and it is anticipated that this trend will also continue in the New Year Hence a combination of higher employment and higher wages will push up the purchasing power of consumers and this bodes well for automakers such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>However the US is not the only market of importance for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as the company is on track to hit a million units in sales in China for But the economic conditions in China are not as favorable as the US Sales of new vehicles slowed down in China in after several years of strong growth As such this market has to stop collapsing if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is to do well in as the company now gets a sizable portion of its sales from here But the good thing is that Fords sales in China are now picking up pace Fords sales in China for November increased from last year and it is likely that the company will be able to sustain this momentum in the New Year In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will benefit from a drop in sales tax on new vehicles which is expected to drive the Chinese auto markets growth to a range of in as compared to last year Now considering that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has bolstered its product portfolio in China by introducing new vehicles it is now in a strong position to benefit from the growth in this market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is focusing on key hotspots in both the US and China which is a smart move in my opinion For instance in the US <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has strengthened its pickup truck and SUV segment with the launch of the new F and Edge models On the back of such models <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can benefit from the booming SUV and truck market in the US In fact pickup trucks account for of auto sales in the US while SUVs account for Looking ahead it is expected that by SUV sales will account for of the market Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is moving in the right direction in the US by focusing on light trucks and SUVs Meanwhile in China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will benefit from the increasing demand for electric vehicles as it has lined up an investment of billion in electrified vehicle solutions for the next five years In the next half decade the company will introduce new electric and hybrid vehicles which will allow it to tap the booming EV market in China Thus considering the prospects of the Chinese and US auto markets we can expect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will have a better time in The company will benefit from positive actions by the government in China while improving employment conditions in the US will be another tailwind So in my opinion after a disappointing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is all set to make a comeback this year Tagged Investing Ideas Consumer Goods
