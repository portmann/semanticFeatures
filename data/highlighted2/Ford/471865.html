Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Silverstone Bernard B Silverstone Chairman Chief Executive Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC Thank you Steve Let me add good morning to everyone and on behalf of Marion Neil and myself thank you for dialing in or indeed joining by webcast So today we will review our results for the second quarter and well look at key metrics and trends for the business bring you up to speed on our funding of course and as usual take your questions So we can get started if we can turn to slide one where you should be familiar with this We talked about this slide last quarter but I did want to quickly touch on it again today really to reinforce our focus on running our business with clear operating principles executed by our very experienced team Consistency and discipline continue to define our origination practices and worldclass customer service Additionally strong risk management and focus on business fundamentals are cornerstones of how we run the business and they really underpin our results So if we can move to slide two and we will start the review of some of those results for our operations for the second quarter So as you can see in the second quarter we made million of pretax profit That was lower than a year ago but is still a very solid result and that puts us at more than million in pretax profit for the first half of the year Also our receivables were up as we continue to grow in line with expectations and youll see later how our worldwide credit losses were actually down for the second quarter versus the first quarter but here you see that in the US market our losstoreceivable ratio was higher versus the second quarter last year However the losstoreceivable ratio remains close to historically low levels and consistent with our expectations for this stage in the ongoing recovery it continues to edge closer to the longerterm trends For placements our average placement FICO scores just to remind everybody this is one component of what we use for proprietary scoring models but it remains very consistent and strong and US delinquencies although slightly up remaining at very low levels So starting on the next slide Marion will go through the results in more detail Marion Harris Chief Financial Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC Thanks Bernard On slide three youll see our million of pretax profit The decrease from the second quarter of last year can be attributed primarily to unfavorable lease residual performance higher credit losses and a couple of factors in the category we call other Partial offsets were favorable volume and mix These were driven by growth in finance receivables globally plus operating leases in North America Unfavorable lease residual performance primarily reflected higher supplemental depreciation in North America related to lower expected auction values on smaller vehicles in our lease portfolio The higher credit losses reflected higher chargeoffs in North America and an increase in the credit loss reserve The higher chargeoffs reflected increased defaults and severity as well as growth in receivables Other reflects a few items including higher stormrelated insurance losses and unfavorable derivatives market valuation following the BREXIT vote The slide four shows North American financing share and contract volume Financing shares were down slightly in the second quarter and first half from the year ago periods The lower retail and lease financing shares were driven by marketing programs and the lower total contract volumes from the second quarter and the first half are more than explained by lower retail installment and lease financing shares Turning to slide five this shows our financing share and contract volume for our international operations in the second quarter and first half In Europe share was largely unchanged from last year and in China share and volume were higher related to marketing programs Total contract volume was higher primarily reflecting higher financing share in China and higher industry volume in Europe Bernard B Silverstone Chairman Chief Executive Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC So just on some of those quarteroverquarter movements that we can see in these share metrics just to give you a little bit more texture In the US the reduction in share mostly reflects the lower leasing share which is consistent in fact with the outlook that we talked about at the end of the first quarter And of course were always reviewing marketing programs to understand customer needs and market trends and then respond appropriately which means that its also quite normal to see quartertoquarter fluctuations in share And additionally looking at China we continue to see a gradual increase in market acceptance of credit as a means to acquire vehicles and thats particularly true amongst younger customers Marion Harris Chief Financial Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC Okay Thanks Bernard So turning to slide six youll see placement FICO in the US in the second quarter was up slightly from the first quarter and our average FICO scores remain very very consistent And as Bernard mentioned earlier FICO is just but one component of our proprietary scoring models As you know we support customers across the credit spectrum and our higher risk mix has been running consistently around in recent quarters and has been stable for over years Our average retail term remained largely consistent with recent periods and lower than the industry So slide seven shows our US retail and lease credit loss metrics as we continue to come off an extended period of extraordinarily low credit losses Delinquencies at basis points remained at historically low levels and repossessions were up slightly in the quarter from the second quarter a year ago The severity increase in the second quarter from the prior year primarily reflected lower auction values higher balances at repossession and higher amounts financed Severity has been relatively flat from the first quarter Our chargeoffs and loss receivables ratio were higher yearoveryear and that reflected primarily higher defaults and severities So now on slide eight as Bernard mentioned earlier our worldwide credit loss metrics remain very very strong Worldwide LTR in the second quarter was higher than a year ago reflecting primarily US retail and lease business that we covered on the prior slide The credit loss reserve was up from a year ago primarily reflecting credit loss performance trends The reserve as a percentage of managed receivables was also up from the second quarter of So on slide nine our lease placement volume in the second quarter was about the same as last years second quarter but our lease share continues to run below the industry We continue to expect our lease share of retail sales to be lower than the first quarter Bernard B Silverstone Chairman Chief Executive Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC I just want to mention here that as weve talked about before just to remind everyone that our placements and shares continue to be managed as part of our overall One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Lease strategy and weve referred to that before because thats where we work with our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>partners to plan leasing considering things like share term model mix all those things that weve got unique insights to And in fact it helps us balance sales and residual values in the future and of course as weve also emphasized before our focus on the trade cycle so that weve got satisfied customers and a sustainable leasing program As you know the industry of leasing stayed about flat and weve taken a more proactive approach we believe by managing down our lease mix as we indicated in the first quarter We think this will help address some of the supply concerns around returns of offlease vehicles given the growth in leasing these past few years Marion Harris Chief Financial Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC Okay So on slide youll see we had units of lease return volume in the second quarter This was higher than last year and reflects our higher lease placements in recent years as well as an increase in the return rate Our used vehicle auction values in the second quarter were lower than a year ago but have been flat from the prior quarter past couple of quarters in fact Although Manheim reported an increase in used vehicle values in the quarter our results reflected a larger mix of two and threeyearold smaller vehicles which have had lower auction values Our mix of newer vehicles is just a subset of the broad range and age of products that make up the Manheim Index Lets go to slide Slide shows our trend in funding of our managed receivables and at the end of the second quarter managed receivables were billion up billion from yearend and our securitization funding was about of managed receivables And as weve said in the past we continue to expect the mix of securitized funding to trend lower over time as our unsecured funding becomes a larger part of our funding structure However the calendarization of our funding plan may result in quarterly fluctuation of the securitization funding percentage Our funding strategy really continues to center on having a very strong investmentgrade balance sheet with ample liquidity and funding thats diversified across markets and channels and investors Just one other thing I want to point out on this slide You will note that we are no longer providing a range on yearend managed receivables and funding structure and that reflects the recent regulatory changes around the use of nonGAAP measures in guidance So turning to slide this slide shows our public term funding plan and we are off to a terrific start this year and weve completed more than twothirds of our full year funding plan with only just halfway through this year And for we do continue to project funding in the range of billion to billion This is a bit tightened on the range from the first quarter and both the amount and composition of our fullyear funding plan are consistent with our issuance in Turning to slide you can see our leverage and liquidity metrics At the end of the second quarter our financial statement leverage was to and our managed leverage was to We target managed leverage in the range of to and our managed leverage was above our targeted range reflecting the recent growth in receivables and the continued impact of a strong US dollar For liquidity we target at least billion to protect against downturns and market disruptions Our quarterly levels can be affected by nearterm debt maturities receivables growth timing of transactions and other factors like that but we feel very good about the very strong liquidity we have So with that Ill turn it back over to you Bernard to wrap things up Bernard B Silverstone Chairman Chief Executive Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC Great Thank you Marion So if we can turn to slide here we show that we now expect our pretax results to be lower than which is really impacted by the higher ongoing depreciation reflected in our expectations of continued lower auction values on smaller vehicles We do expect however that second half pretax results will be about in line with our first half results And as youve heard earlier in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>earnings call both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit are already finding improvement actions and working to mitigate some of the risk that weve discussed Also on this slide in terms of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit working to return leverage towards our target range one of the initial actions weve taken is to continue to change our plan for distributions and you can see its consistent with our first quarter guidance So now we go over to the takeaway slide slide before we turn to your questions But before I actually go through just wanted to touch on the British vote to leave the European Union as I know that is certainly on many peoples minds and to mention at this stage we continue to monitor the developments closely and assess any impact on our business And of course we will act appropriately under any new regulations that result as and when we understand and what those are going to be So now just to summarize our performance Weve had a solid second quarter and first half We know expect our pretax profits to be lower than reflecting the increased depreciation charges that weve mentioned throughout this presentation We do however expect our second half pretax results to be about in line with the first half results So as always we remain focused on disciplined and consistent execution to support sustained performance all based on a very strong balance sheet So thats how I report out Steve back to you Can you open the line for questions Steve Dahle Finance Manager <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Co Thank you Bernard We will now start the questionandanswer session As a reminder we will only take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit questions on this call Automotiverelated questions should be directed to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Equity Investor Relations contact as detailed in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>press release LaTonya may we have the first caller please Thank you And your first question comes from the line of Eric Selle with SunTrust Eric J Selle SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc Hi Good morning guys Thanks a lot for the time again I kind a hitting on the lease share and I do appreciate how you guys have I think Mark said it on the last call you guys are always very early to react which is why we appreciate color from you guys because you guys are always honest and early You guys are decisively giving up some lease share Financing is still available to you The auto side needs support Is this a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit riskadjusted return decision looking out at the ALG guide How was this made to move away from the lease market And is it something that the other financers are going to pick up the slack because theres so much growth in that area Bernard B Silverstone Chairman Chief Executive Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC First Eric thanks for joining us and thanks for your question So I think I can relate it back to really as we talked about our One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Lease strategy So its definitely a joint approach to how we think about leasing I think one of the keys also to underpinning that is our view that leasing has to be sustainable Not to go back to and but you know what happened there So were taking a long view in terms of the dimensions weve talked about and they spit out if you like some concentration parameters for us and weve used those in aggregate to look at our overall lease share So we may be giving up some leash share in the short term but would it be good lease share in the long term When those customers come back in two or three years time if there isnt a comparable lease program then its really not sustainable One of the main benefits of course is the loyalty we see the satisfaction we see as well as the nearterm impact on sales So we are certainly going to be present in the leasing market at the right level but we are managing this to make sure its also sustainable and that when those customers come back at the end of their lease we can have a good experience and offer them a new product again and hopefully enjoy the kind of loyalty weve always seen from our leasing presence Eric J Selle SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc I appreciate the holistic view Ive worked at a bank for years and I always tell my bankers its easy to initiate a loan its hard to sell it So obviously short termlong term is obviously appreciated Looking in the States its obviously welladvertised and wellexpected sedan glut concentrated with the Japanese and Germans How can they come in and support residuals Were hearing stuff that they are getting a little bit more conservative on some of their structures How can they because I feel like if they support the residuals some of the overhang goes away Are you seeing them come in and really come in and support some of that residual risk Anything they are doing that would help bottom that trough and kind of how are you all looking internally at that sedan glut When does the glut kind of peak and kind of move through the snake per say When is the worst of it And are you seeing any of your J or G captive competitors step up to support the residual risk that they have because it seems like its more pronounced over there Bernard B Silverstone Chairman Chief Executive Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC Ill kick off on that one and just say that I think you can see it on the numbers on the page there that the industry is still running higher than we are certainly running so clearly the marketing offers there arent presumably being supported in terms of as you say the residuals that have been held out When that eases I think its back to the disciplines we talked about in the earlier call that if the industry holds its discipline if indeed the pattern that we are seeing is across the industry in the various segments and youve called out a couple of segments that I think are very valuable and clear insight on your part there then youd think there would be an adjustment But clearly we dont have insight to their specific plans so I cant give you a call of when that will change We are taking our own actions and you can see it in our numbers there that weve moderated our leasing programs to make sure we can be there through the cycles Marion Harris Chief Financial Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC Eric this is Marion I would just say that where industry leasing is today is about the peak of where it was almost years ago And so our view is that at those kinds of levels its a bit too high And as Bernard said we have to manage our own business and we do that through our One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Lease strategy and you want to keep it at such a level that you are not getting people into cars with so much Motor Company subvention that it gets them into a car that they really probably shouldnt be in as opposed to a different a lower price point vehicle And you see that You see it in the luxury segment Sometimes when folks are chasing share they will do very aggressive lease programs and theyll support the residual very strongly and in the end that ultimately results in a bunch of returned leases that run through auction at lower prices and over time kill the brand Eric J Selle SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc Weve all seen the One <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>work through the cycle so as a credit guy we appreciate it and I do appreciate your time today Marion Harris Chief Financial Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC Your next question comes from the line of Garland Buchanan with Legal General Garland Buchanan Legal General Investment Management America Inc Hi Thank you for taking the question Can you just confirm of the remaining billion to billion issuance recorded out of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit how much of that is expected in the unsecured market and the tenor views there And then another question in terms of rating migration youve communicated a desire to go upward Do you think that you need to get through the cycle in order to get that upgrade or is that something in your conversations with the agencies that you see as possible going into a downturn or even in a downturn Thanks Marion Harris Chief Financial Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC Yeah Id say Ill start and then kick it very quickly over to Neil If you look at our slide this shows in the forecast for our funding plan So we have somewhere between billion and billion left to do in unsecured and you can see it broken out by region and then what we need to do left in securitization So that gives you some guidance on where and how much is left to do And then as it relates to tenor and rating agency questions I will ask Neil to comment Neil M Schloss Treasurer Vice President Yeah I think on the tenor question which I think we both look at the market but also manage our maturity profile to fit into where we are not overly concentrated in any one calendar year or calendar quarter for that matter And so weve issued these things sort of three years and years manage to an average maturity sort of in the middle there but then we also look at the market from a standpoint of where best to issue And then on the ratings I think your guess is probably as good as ours from the standpoint of what it takes I think we continue both at credit and auto to manage to a single A credit from a standpoint of our balance sheet We think we are there You look at some of the metrics on both leverage for the company as well as for Credit and they would based on the rating agency metrics would say we are single A So its getting the business there and obviously getting through a cycle being able to maintain our funding being able to maintain our base dividend would obviously go a long way to supporting a higher credit rating Garland Buchanan Legal General Investment Management America Inc Okay So Im sorry to confirm then that slide if you just look at the billion to billion issuance remaining that does not include commercial paper Thats correct Neil M Schloss Treasurer Vice President Correct This is unsecured term and secured term Bernard B Silverstone Chairman Chief Executive Officer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit Co LLC Just to add a little bit of flavor on this page is something that I think underscores some of the values that weve espoused into how we run the business If you look in the middle there at our European operation and what they funded through July you can see how we approached having the contingencies in place for Brexit not knowing how the vote would go but really having a great step forward on the funding I think it more talks to the values we espouse about being a consistent player and making sure we are fully funded and thats why weve got the strength of the balance sheet that Neil just referred to Neil M Schloss Treasurer Vice President Yeah and specifically on the CP side we ended the quarter with about billion of commercial paper outstanding which is up from where it was at the beginning of the year in part because we now have a two rating from all of the agencies which obviously creates new demand for us on the shortterm programs Thank you At this time there are no further questions Mr Dahle I will turn the floor to you for closing remarks Steve Dahle Finance Manager <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Co Thanks LaTonya With that I would like to conclude todays call As
