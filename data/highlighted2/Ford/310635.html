growth has been a bright spot for the company as of late Its European sales increased by to million units It was China that stood out the most however as it saw a pretax profit increase from to million It sold million vehicles which is a increase from A negative takeaway from the report was the reduced guidance of its profit margin to for fiscal year Pretax results were also poor from South America as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>experienced a loss of million Its Other Automotive segment lost million in the quarter as well Along with reporting solid numbers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also offered moderately positive guidance for Its North American unit is expected to remain neutral to slightly up for This is a focal point that many bearish investors are paying attention to in the company and rightfully so The North American segment represented about of its revenues in With the negative sentiment surrounding the United States as the Federal Reserve continues to keep rates low this is going to be a key unit for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to grow Positive growth in North America will help silence the bears The companys European segment showed signs of growth in the fourth quarter and is expected to continue the trend into It is forecasting a neutral to a growth rate in this area while the Eurozones gross domestic product is only expected to be This is an area in the business that represents about of Fords revenues and is showing steady growth As it reported a loss in Latin America in the fourth quarter growth in Fords Brazil segment is forecast to contract more than This country as it is well known has been having hardships lately with its GDP expected to contract between and Although this unit only represents a small portion of the companys revenues investors should still monitor just how poorly future performance is The China segment is performing very well even with the recent economic slowdown in the country It is forecasting industry volume between and units compared to the units it reported in This may be a sign that Fords decision to open ten new plants in the region is beginning to pay off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has recently been helped by the record setting year in the United States auto industry as sales totaled million in With lower fuel prices consumers have been spending more of their money on less fuel efficient vehicles such as Fords F Series pickup trucks The F Series experienced a sales increase in December even as industry numbers for the month trailed estimates It was also the best selling truck in the United States for the th consecutive year and celebrated years as the best selling vehicle of any kind With a report on Tuesday morning the F Series units decreased by for the month of January Overall US unit sales dropped which beat the Kelly Blue Book estimate of a slide The share price dropped following this report as many continue to worry about the US auto industry This is the key risk that investors assume by creating a position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The recent trend in the oil market has been lower for longer Many investors have a bearish outlook on the auto industry after its record setting year but I still believe that there is potential for growth Since consumers will continue to save money at the pump if fuel prices do remain lower that means they should also keep purchasing the higher margin vehicles like the F Series <span

price I strongly believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be able to grow their earnings and cash flows into the future which would provide evidence of an even higher valuation With the stock down from its week high the price range presents a great buying opportunity As we all know the goal of investing is to buy low and sell high I believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is trading at a very low price The company reported higher than expected growth on both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter as well as forecast for moderate growth in Investing in the Asia Pacific region should continue to increase its market share in a region where it has seen solid growth as of late Inexpensive fuel prices should continue to drive demand for vehicles like the companys very successful and popular FSeries line A very conservative discounted cash flowearnings analysis suggests that shares are priced cheaply around I
