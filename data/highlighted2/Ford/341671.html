growth where shareholder value gets destroyed Management has a large impact on shareholder returns Considering the current circumstances I foresee no reason to invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is an automotive manufacturer based in Dearborn Michigan with operations and distribution in six continents and a financial services arm called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Credit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a monster house a true force of nature Yet from an investors perspective <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hasnt always lived up to its expectations In this article I will explain what I believe those expectations should be In specific this article will look at prediction markets a topic often neglected how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>performed during the previous crash the relationship between sales and share price and management and shareholder return The world of Prediction Markets the role of a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>expert Prediction markets are often a little bit more unknown to common investors yet an interesting concept to follow They are virtual stock markets which can be used to leverage the thoughts of crowds used for political elections for example In case of businesses one can use prediction markets to leverage employee knowledge The question is is this useful This paper examines the efficiency of corporate prediction markets at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>employs experts to forecast weekly vehicle sales and the article shows that contemporaneous prediction market forecasts outperform the expert forecast Make no mistake the forecast of sales is an imperative task at an automaker for production as well as procurement this to minimize outlandish inventories Yet as we all know these kind of forecasts are difficult and from an investors perspective one should even think about whether or not sales and share price are related The initial findings of this article is that forecasts from prediction markets outperform other forecasts available to management including in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sales forecasts that are taken extremely seriously as quoted by the article The important takeaway here is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>performed times better than Wall Street Consensus had anticipated while times it was worse than expected The other takeaway is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has the tendency to massively overdeliver with regards to results The graphs above clearly prove the point that sales at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are highly cyclical which in turn makes them difficult to forecast by analysts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>How does it hold up during a recession How does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hold up during recessions in contrast to some of its peers This is of interest considering the likeability of a stock The mortgage crash had <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>plummeting as follows Its clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had a much stronger burn and rise story than its peers On the other hand the internet bubble tells a different story Both recessions saw <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>plummet significantly yet only during the mortgage crisis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was able to climb back up Could management be a key driver here Another factor worth investigating is management and shareholder returns Lets look at the current and previous CEOs of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Alan Mulally September to July William Clay <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Jr October to September Return since inception is the share price return since the CEO took over By looking at the numbers its clear that management plays a large role in shareholder success Its interesting to see that both William Clay and Mark Fields shared similar appalling results Rather than looking at the current fundamentals which clearly point towards a cheap valuation with a PE under and a yield above lets look if profitability is a driver of returns There is definitely some scientific background to growth profitability and shareholder returns but as this article points out every firm eventually hits a point where additional growth destroys shareholder returns I normally tend to ignore technical analysis but sometimes its worth having a look at the other side of the table that is the fundamental side The price line underneath shows that from time to time the share price moves in line with profitability while after it seemed to already expect this continuous rise in profitability yet that didnt happen Lately the share price has been declining while the same happened with profitability If we extend this thought to analysts expectations of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>there is not much to be happy about Expected profit margins are not looking to improve much over the coming years One thing investors sometimes forget is that blue chip stocks are mostly driven by larger institutional players and not driven by cheap valuations This means that even though one large firm might have solid fundamentals when an overall slump on the market is happening every stock in the sector will drop regardless of its fundamentals Like for example during the last mortgage crash Recent data tells us that most car manufacturers move together when there is a massive shock like October which is fully ignoring the who is the better car manufacturer firm Furthermore it seems that Fiat NYSE FCAU Renault OTCPKRNLSY Peugeot OTCPKPEUGF seem to move much more in line with each other on the positive side while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Toyota NYSE TM and Honda NYSE HMC seem to be paired on the negative side Source Orange Peel Investments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Article This obviously calls for some more investigation Might there be some relationship between sales and share price If we look back in time thats hardly noticeable Revenue actually remained relatively on par for almost years while share price continued to drop I am glad I didnt hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>between and the bottom of the mortgage crash Moreover I think its fair to say that price and revenue are not a strongly correlated argument for a longinvestment thesis in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Sales growth is not a reason to touch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>On the other side solid management is The appalling figures presented by management and presented to the management of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>by form of prediction management offset any potential gain through dividend Even though a declining share price might make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a yield chaser there are enough variables which should act as a potential resistance Based on the last years I foresee no reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will become a cuddly stock for investors This is typically one of those stocks which should be avoided in the case of an imminent recession and depending on management might be a golden goose when we enter another bull market Under current circumstances this is purely a trading stock and not a value nor longterm investment Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next
