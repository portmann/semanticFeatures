Inflation Or Deflation Would Impact Our Investments Seeking Alpha America has experienced severe periods of Inflation and Deflation over the last years Given the intervention of central bankers the outlook for the global economy is extremely uncertain Certain types of business models are better able to navigate varied economic conditions and we aim to invest in those businesses As a long term investor I think long and hard about the potential outcomes of investments in my portfolio I believe that each and every one of my long term holdings will be able to not only survive in the years ahead but prosper also even as the economic landscape changes What will the future look like I dont know but I take solace in the fact that my long term holdings have business models that will allow them to adapt to the changing times Today I want to take a look at few different companies and discuss how they could be affected in the future I think questioning outcomes are especially valid currently given slowing global growth and that global central bankers are in uncharted territory The range of possible economic outcomes looks as wide as ever One whole group of economic experts are calling for severe deflation as a result of the slowing global economy while another group of experts is gearing up for high rates of inflation as a result of years of extremely low interest rates Whatever ultimately happens it will likely differ from the economic conditions weve recently seen How will the companies in your portfolio handle these changing conditions Lets start with deflation The big D inspires even more fear in the hearts of Wall Street bankers than does that other D divorce The United States hasnt had a persistent bout of systemic deflation since the s but that era was a huge deal and shaped the mindset of two whole generations Central bankers greatest fear is likely runaway deflation Youll notice the Federal Reserve tries to err on the side of having monetary policy too loose in an effort to avoid deflationand reduce the cost of repaying Americas national debt The s saw a tremendous number of businesses close and high levels of unemployment Difficult economic conditions for sure While that time period was extreme do you think the companies you invest in would survive significant deflation I believe some of our long term holdings like CocaCola NYSE KO and Visa NYSE V would weather the storm just fine Why These two companies have remarkable brand recognition and sizable networks The brand recognition means that customers will use these companies again and again all else being equal and the size of these companys networks means that they have the size and clout to survive More importantly each of these companies have exhibited consistently high profit margins and low variable costs Those high profit margins give the companies flexibility with regard to price flow and how their respective managements choose to allocate cash flow The low variable input costs along with the high profit margins mean that these companies should be able to cut prices and maintain market sharewhile also remaining profitable The production plants are already built so buying a little more or less sugar and water wont result in a large capital expenditure decision for a company like CocaCola One big problem with persistent deflation is that some consumers dont spend because they are waiting for lower prices while other consumers dont spend because they cant afford to as a result of pay cuts or layoffs A cycle like this becomes a feedback loop which feeds on itself Now lets juxtapose CocaCola and Visa with a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>manufactures and sells some wonderful cars and trucks around the world Fords business is highly susceptible to changes in input costs and the spending habits of consumers A significant bout of deflation would probably reduce consumer demand for Fords products significantly Fords input costs would probably decline some as material steel aluminum plastic costs would likely decline but I suspect the company would really struggle on the basis of consumer demand and retail pricing Fords management also manages input like material and labor costs by utilizing multi year contracts These contracts whether with a steel provider or labor union dont provide much flexibility for a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Fords management has accepted this approach so that they would not be hit with a significant increase in input costs during times of inflation but of course the terms of those contracts would cut both ways If Fords management believed a deflationary time would go on for while they could choose to bring less expensive products to market that may better suit the consumers changing tastes Rolling out new products requires expensive changes to the existing factories and may take years to implement The existing inventory of already constructed products would not be worth much in such a time and would likely have to be sold for a loss If you would like an example of the lack of flexibility that auto manufacturers tolerate look at the changes they experienced around the financial crisis In and much of gas prices were soaring and the large SUVs that had been so popular for consumers and profitable for auto manufacturers were suddenly not so desirable So the auto companies came out with new smaller and more fuel efficient vehicles that they hoped consumers would buy just in time to have the economy turn aroundgas prices slashedand the sales of trucksSUV climb again a few years later I dont envy the management of auto manufacturers like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Theirs is a tough industry So now lets take a look at the inflation side of things During times of high inflation prices rise and spending power declines As mentioned above companies like CocaCola and Visa have exhibited consistently high profit margins and good brand recognition in the past During times of high inflation the input costs for most companies would rise but companies like CocaCola and Visa will better be able to pass those higher costs on to customers as a result of their market position and brand power Both are recognized brands but each is also a heavy weight in their respective industries Merchants and consumers both choose to use Visa cards because their products are trusted and the network of cards are honored in the vast majority of areas Both companies were also able to automate many of their processes reducing concerns about labor rate increases Furthermore many would consider CocaColas drinks an affordable luxury and spend the few dollars available to purchase a drink An auto manufacturer like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>however would need to navigate the maze of increased input costs As mentioned above both material and labor input costs could pose a problem Additionally another problem is that those higher input costs would need to be passed on to consumersif the company is to maintain profitability Wages tend to go up during inflationary periods but the costs consumers incur in their daily lives do as well Those costs like healthcare food housing transportation etc tend to constrain consumer spending at least in the near term making it difficult for companies to raise prices This dynamic leaves managers at companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with two choices Either they can pass through the cost increases they are incurring which will likely result in fewer shares and lost marketshare or they can hold prices steady and try to improve sales volume but accept that profit margins will decline and profitability will be adversely affected In a commodity business where there is little differentiation between the offerings of several different companies it can be remarkably tough to pass increased costs on to customers We can argue able whether or not a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would be able to pass those costs on but I would expect most investors to be in agreement about the ability of CocaCola or Visa to raise prices These types of businesses make more attractive investments in my way of thinking Click the following links if you would like to read my company specific thoughts about outlook for CocaCola and Visa
