style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor released another set of excellent sales figures on Thursday The auto manufacturer sold more vehicles yy while FSeries retail sales continue to surge While other auto manufacturers like Volkswagen AG OTCQX VLKAY are suffering from an unprecedented selfinflicted emissions scandal that is set to cost the German company billions and billions of dollars it is smooth sailing for American auto manufacturers and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F in particular Why Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is on a roll in the United States and there seems to be no stopping The auto company released September sales for its US market last week and they were excellent Thats an understatement really <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors results shot the lights out According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors sales release the auto company sold a whopping vehicles last month more than a year ago when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor sold vehicles The yy sales increase in September even puts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors sales growth of in August and in July to shame Importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors vehicle sales surged in all categories which is good news Fords car sales grew in September from vehicles a year ago to vehicles utility sales jumped yy from to vehicles and truck sales increased yearoveryear from to Its been a great month for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor all around Yeartodate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor now sold a total vehicles which is more than during the same period last year when the auto maker sold vehicles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>broke sales records in months prior so it doesnt come as a surprise that the auto maker continues to do well in terms of sales According to Fords press release retail sales in the United States also jumped last month which was the best September performance in eleven years FSeries retail sales which are a defining sales driver for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and closely watched by investors increased yy and marked the best sales result since Right now from a US sales perspective things couldnt be any better for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Truth be told <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been the biggest disappointment for me in Ive had high hopes in early about Mr Market being able to reverse Fords painstakingly low valuationso far Mr Market has not come around yet In fact investors have continued to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the boot over the last few weeks as Chinas growth concerns took center stage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock is down this year I have already stated numerous times that I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors consolidation is undeserved simply because the company delivers strong sales numbers Granted growth in China is slowing for the time being but a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor investment is so much more than a China growth play Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>derives the biggest chunk of its revenues and operating earnings in the US the auto maker is indeed in a good position to ride the storm out It is almost painful to watch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors stock price languish the way it does The auto maker sends out excellent sales updates with consistent regularity but it doesnt get anything in return American consumers love cars and they love <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors vehicles especially its F and brand SUVs But investors dont love the company and thats a problem Fords market valuation on the other hand does not adequately reflect the realities on the ground And thats a chance The risk of overpaying for a yielding SP stock at x e earnings is very low The best approach to investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Buy the stock collect the dividend shrug off market
