This makes it easy to expect a great report from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Key points include GM profitability overseas the same roadmap we see for success in F shares going forward Some of the best news that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F shareholders could have gotten was the General Motors NYSE GM earnings report just a day ago General Motors knocked it out of the park beating on both lines handily and more importantly showing promise in both Europe and in China For those that didnt catch the General Motors report here is a wrap up from Seeking Alpha General Motors premarket after easily beating Q earnings expectations and raising its FY guidance despite concerns about the financial impact of the UKs decision to leave the European Union GM says Q net income more than doubled to a record B from B a year ago on higher revenues of B with operating margins of globally and in North America representing postbankruptcy records despite relatively flat sales and a decline in US market share GM posted a M profit in its European operations its first quarterly profit in the region since after losing M in the region a year ago but it warns that the UKs plan to exit the European Union could cost the company M in H Income from China operations was steady at M although the operating margin for the country was slightly lower than a year ago GM raises its fullyear EPS outlook to from previously vs analyst consensus estimate We believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is going to blow it out of the water this quarter as well as the public focuses on an auto financing bubble that has yet to burst and how each individual auto company continues to crank out excellent operational results for itself We have noted this in several of our past articles stating that as long as the company continues to meet or exceed expectations that with a small short in Credit Acceptance NASDAQ CACC a consumer auto credit company owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>should not be an issue here General Motors and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>have seen their earnings be very similar over the last few years Usually when one of the automakers is doing well the other one is also doing well The companies trade side by side because their results are generally very close to one another in relative fashion F Total Return Price data by YCharts Those that have been reading this for a while know that our main focus for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been its international profit centers an area that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has invested a lot in but has yet to see a lot of return in as far as the bottom line is concerned Our long term bull case on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>revolves around the company turning international locations into profit centers using them to boost the bottom line and the multiple getting too compressed to ignore As you can see right now both US automakers trade at a very low multiple and a very high dividend yield F PE Ratio Forward data by YCharts Again this is due to lingering fears of an auto financing bubble bursting We have recommended in several articles and will recommend again shorting CACC as a hedge against any long position in any US automaker Here is how they have performed collectively As you can see CACC has been the obvioius beneficiary of low interest rates and easy credit for consumers post Its up over the last years making it a prime suspect for a pull back should the auto credit market start to come undone For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM were not sure how much more downside there is when you already trade at just x forward earnings General Motors also gave us decent news from China This was an outstanding quarter for GM said Chairman and CEO Mary Barra Our results were generated by strong retail sales in the US record sales in China and a continued emphasis on improving the performance of our operations worldwide Well continue to focus on driving profitable growth and leveraging our technical expertise to lead in the future of personal mobility China has been another international location that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has invested billions of dollars in in hopes of being able to produce vehicles that are cheaper and turn it into a profit center <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has also invested billions over the last months into researching smart car and EV technology in China two of the emerging auto markets overseas We believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is moving in the right direction both domestically and overseas The core business continues to show strength in key markets like Europe and it continues to innovate here on the homefront launching the new Super Duty and soon launching its new Fseries piggybacking on the innovation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>spearheaded when they made a shift to using aluminum in their vehicles years ago The continued focus on efficiency from weight loss proves that innovation made years ago and continue to pay benefits for years to come While other automakers like GM are focused on distributing capital to shareholders <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to make strategic investments in itself all over the globe in hopes that these initiatives will pay out in years to come We think that profitability in key international markets will drive Fords stock much higher in years so we support these strategic investments across the globe For those that have been reading us you know that there has been a significant amount of call buying in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as well this week We noted days ago Also catching our eye was a bullish bet in the options market yesterday that came in to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Traders bought the weekly expiration calls contracts were bought in one shot and K contracts in total were traded during the day This was compared to total open interest of K contracts This bet signifies the bettor is looking for an almost immediate price move to the upside In addition to those call buyers we pointed out just two days ago we saw more call buying in the strikes yesterday and the day prior The expirations were scattered ranging from next week to the beginning of August According to Yahoo Finance the company will be reporting earnings on July th before the bell The real question is what is going to unlock value when it comes to the multiple How are we going to see multiple expansion in the sector that doesnt seem to want to expand One good way we could see a return on our investment is for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to issue another special dividend similar to the one that they did months ago to give their shareholders some of the value that has been trapped in a stock trades at such a low multiple Another option at the company has that it has not tapped is to perform a buyback We have not been huge fans of using capital for this as we would rather see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continue to simply invest in itself and invest in innovation but a buyback is certainly on the table due to the compressed nature of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock We see the General Motors positive news as a definite positive catalyst for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>moving forward here and we are happy to be long into the earnings print next week I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Consumer Goods
