the impression of awesomeness was how hard it was to get one ie so much demand that supply copuld not keep up However as The Wall Street Journal reports it was not demand it was instead defects that forced the company to limit supply Apple Inc is said to have found a defect in a key component of its watch during production forcing the company to limit supply of the new device As The Wall Street Journal reports A key component of the Apple Watch made by one of two suppliers was found to be defective prompting Apple Inc to limit the availability of the highly anticipated new product according to people familiar with the matter The part involved is the socalled taptic engine designed by Apple to produce the sensation of being tapped on the wrist After mass production began in February reliability testing revealed that some taptic engines supplied by AAC Technologies Holdings Inc of Shenzhen China started to break down over time the people familiar with the matter said One of those people said Apple scrapped some completed watches as a result Apple last week told some watch suppliers to slow production until June without explaining why according to people familiar with Apples supply chain Suppliers were surprised because Apple recently said that Watch inventory was insufficient these people said On Monday Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said demand is greater than supply for the Watch but didnt disclose sales or orders In a memo to retailstore employees earlier this month Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts said stores wont get watches to sell until the end of May because of high global interest combined with our initial supply New online orders will be delivered in June Apple says on its website Wed Cognitive Dissonance Wed pods The truth is that North Korea
