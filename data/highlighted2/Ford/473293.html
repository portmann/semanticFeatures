style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit is an essential part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor and its results are an important indicator of how the company is really doing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors quarter was not well received by investors for obvious reasons but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit remains strong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F did not have a very good day on Thursday and finished the day down just over Investors were nonetoopleased with the EPS miss and cared little that YoY revenue was up Not helping things along was the strong beats that General Motors NYSE GM posted just a week ago Investors were hopeful that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>would post strong quarterly results as well but shares traded mostly sideways in the days leading up to the earnings release Once the floodgates opened pessimism reigned supreme with bears declaring victory and bulls expressing justified frustration I couldnt wait to get my hands on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit slides to see how this part of the business was doing At first glance I was discouraged and I still kind of am There is plenty to be concerned about but plenty to be optimistic about as well In the second quarter of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit generated million in pretax profit this quarter that dropped to million The drop is concerning especially considering that managed receivables increased by but didnt translate to an increase in profit Yeartodate pretax profits are down by amidst record auto sales Fueling the drop in profits was the increase in losstoreceivables which now rest at a basis point increase Lease residuals were not as kind to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as they were last year The company actually gained money on the returned vehicles they just didnt gain as much as last year which cut into profits The incentives offered during the second quarter also didnt help either One only has to watch their television for ten minutes to notice the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>commercials offering significant cash back and interest for those who qualify Also impeding profits were credit losses thanks to an increase in delinquencies and an increase in defaults from those delinquencies leading to higher severities compared to Q The higher defaults leading to repossessions and severities led to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>placing more cash in reserves which also cut into profits On a year over year basis the picture isnt as dire as this one quarter may indicate The company still maintains a healthy average FICO placement of with their Higher Risk Portfolio Mix maintained at Unfortunately even with a high quality portfolio of loans chargeoffs and defaults are cutting into profits If FICO scores start dropping through the year that would be a real problem but for now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit manages to secure highquality borrowers The length at which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>finances or leases a vehicle has also been a concern for many investors The good news is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is maintaining their month figure and keeping month lengths low between three five percent If we dont compare quarter to quarter the longer term picture for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit is pretty stable The graphic above showing delinquencies and repossessions actually shows a pretty stable picture with this quarter actually showing some drops These second quarter drops are standard I guess the only real issue is that the drops are smaller from quarter to quarter compared to last year What will be important to keep an eye on is how much higher these figures go up for the third quarter Yes there was some good news here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has managed to lower the percentage of leases as retail sales compared to other auto manufacturers Just of US retail sales are coming from leases while the other manufacturers sit at This is good because as we learned above the company isnt making the same as it used to off these returned lease vehicles The figures are still much higher than they were this time last year but the drop is encouraging And of course the segment still generated million in pretax profits for the company While that may not be as high as last year that is still a significant sum <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit remains a cashgenerating asset that brings tangible and intangible benefits to the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>got absolutely hammered thanks to their lackluster numbers It doesnt help that management was pretty negative towards the auto industry and the economy as a whole with management stating they felt we were at the top of the cycle Some more positive comments from management could have the share price along a little bit but at least management isnt blowing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit saw some metrics headed in the wrong direction but still remains a vital and profitable segment of the company Unfortunately the company is guiding for lower numbers overall for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit compared to but will still contribute significantly to the greater business All graphics were taken from the investor slideshow provided here I hope you all got something out of this article I do appreciate
