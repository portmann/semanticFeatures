concludes that Texas Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale basin the most prolific shale oil basin in the US has peaked and reached terminal decline status The Post Carbon

overhyped future of oil obtained via hydraulic fracturing fracking in the US by Post Carbon Institute Fellow David Hughes Hughes formerly worked for years with the Geological Survey of Canada as a scientist and research manager before coming to PostCarbon It also comes just two months after Post Carbons October release of a similarly titled report on North Dakotas Bakken Shale basin the second biggest shale oil field in the US behind the EagleFord In Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Reality Check David Hugheslooks at how production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has changed after a year of low oil prices a summary of the report explains Oil production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is now falling after more than a year of low oil prices The glory days of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are behind it at the ripe old age of sixyears Many of the same themes and concepts for those familiar with Post Carbons previous shale bubble updates reappear in this report Those include the drilling treadmill drilling sweet spots and US government and industry drilling productivity assessments the seeds and intelligence upon which energy policymaking is made vs independentdrilling productivityassessments The skinny on the report is that the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is certainly productive and resilient even despite a year of low global oil prices but its future as a supermajor type field is certainly in question based upon the numbers crunched byHughes Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Oil Production Numbers andFigures Post Carbons report cites an array of numbers and figures throughout the report some of which arejawdropping For example the vast majority of the drilling read sweet spots for fracking occurs in six counties within the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>And productivity of that oil in some counties yes even in the most productive counties is indecline In July of production came from Karnes Dewitt and Lasalle counties and came from the top six counties the reportdetails Oil production peaked in all counties between June and May Karnes County the top producer has experienced the largest decline at thousand barrels per day or a reduction from peak Dimmit County with the fourth highest production has declined theleast As a result the drilling treadmill seeking out new locales to frack in order to keep productivity rates flatcontinues apace The problem Hughes points out is that there isnt anywhere left toturn This is somewhat counterintuitive as conventional wisdom suggests that companies are focusing drilling efforts on their best acreage which is in top counties such as Karnes and withdrawing from more marginal parts of the play in order to maximize economics in a low oil price environment he writes The reason for the steeper decline in Karnes County is likely that it is the most heavily drilled and high quality locations are runningout These drilling trends are also mapped out for readers to see what the drilling treadmill and sweet spots looks like inaction Image Credit Post CarbonInstitute Peak production and the downward productivity trend in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is also explained and shown visually by Post Carbon in the report As more and more wells are drilled productivity has reached a downward spiral as of March and hasnt turned back since Image Credit Post CarbonInstitute Figure illustrates Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>production through July Hughes explained Production peaked in March at million barrels per day mbd and has fallen barrels per day or since then As of July there were producing wells in the play compared to in March at peakproduction Bleak Future for Eagle FordFracking Couple the fact that new policy is in place that will open up the spigot to USproduced oil in places like the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with the fact that even in the best counties productivity rates in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are in terminal decline and you have a perfectstorm Not to mention the myriad local community impacts air impacts groundwater impacts and climate change impacts that accompany the controversial fracking and drillingprocesses The observation that new well quality is declining in top counties despite every incentive to maximize individual well production is key Hughes wrote in the conclusion Thus even to maintain the peak rate of mbd the drilling rate would have to increase from the wells per year currently required needing billion per year of capital input exclusive of leasing and other ancillarycosts Hughes closes the report by suggesting that US energy policy and thus global energy policy is dictated by a drilling technique that has already eclipsed peak production mode just over a half decade after itsbirth The hype surrounding tight oil as a means to bolster global oil production over the long term is not justified Geological fundamentals clearly show that high decline rates limited sweet spots and finite numbers of drilling locations will limit long term contributions to production wroteHughes The optimistic tight oil forecasts of the EIA and even more optimistic forecasts of some industry watchers are unhelpful abstractions in developing energy policy for a more sustainablefuture Lambert

all you can Its a mistake not to You can follow him on Twitter at lambertstrether httpwwwcorrentewirecom This is pretty much exactly as the geologist Arthur Berman and others predicted quite a few years ago Extrapolations from the outputs existing shale oil wells ignored the fact that experienced drillers dont drill randomly they know what they are doing and usually are very good at hitting the sweet spots Add in the strong incentive drillers have to exaggerate their success rate and you have a recipe for over optimistic predictions and over investment The nature of tight oil is such that a decline is likely to be very rapid after the peak is hit as established techniques for drawing out the life of a conventional well such as fracking around an oil bearing void or pumping in seawaterCO
