style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor reported a yearoveryear drop in total US vehicle sales for the month of March on Wednesday This comes after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>announced a yearoveryear decline in US sales in February However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>beat the consensus estimate which called for a decline in sales F retail sales momentum keeps me optimistic for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is not a Sell just because sales declined on a yearoveryear basis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>represents a good deal for shareholders nonetheless Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F worth investing in or not If you looked at the automakers latest US sales results the answer would probably be no Last month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor released its February sales numbers which were very disappointing to say the least In February <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor sold vehicles in the United States which was about lower year over year Further <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor missed the consensus sales growth estimate of by a wide margin whereas General Motors NYSE GM did much better than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the same month I contended that Fords sales decline was not a major issue at the time because February is usually not the strongest month for car sales and adverse weather conditions can have a dampening effect on sales volumes Fast forward one month and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>released another set of weak US sales numbers So is it time to revisit the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor investment thesis Not so fast Lets first look at the numbers to get a feel about how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor was doing in the month of March In March <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor sold vehicles which compares against vehicles sold in March of last year Thats a decrease of year over year Fords car sales declined from last year to in March Sales of utility vehicles declined from in March of to vehicles in March Decreases in car and utility sales were partly offset by growing truck sales The truck segment has been doing much better lately for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor and March wasnt an exception for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Truck sales grew year over year to which compares against truck sales of in the year ago month Despite the overall weak performance in March it is noteworthy that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor does have segments of strength which gives reason to be optimistic Much has already been said about Fords F truck and its potentially very positive influence on Fords truck sales The bottom line here is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor will likely see more sales momentum in the truck segment throughout and beyond thanks to its new aluminumbodied F In addition as weak as Fords US sales in March were <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>did beat the consensus estimate Analysts were expecting Fords US sales to decline Put differently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has outperformed sales expectations by posting a lowerthanexpected decline in US vehicle sales in March While I certainly agree with investors that a yearoveryear decline in sales isnt a reason to bring out the champagne bottles things are not as bad as they seem According to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors press release <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>posted its best US retail sales in nine years US retail sales increased year over year Fords Fseries even saw a retail sales increase of in March adding to expectations that will be the stellar year of the F Sometimes investors just need to be patient Just because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor had another weak month in the US on a total vehicle sales basis doesnt mean <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is becoming less of an attractive investment Quite the opposite is true <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is remarkably cheap for the value it brings to the table and the company could generate some promising catalysts in which may very well support the share price My advice here would be to not lose patience in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>just yet because of lighter yearoveryear sales in March <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is doing well in Europe growing market share and outpacing industry sales growth Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor can also be bought with a sizable margin of safety and with a dividend yield the case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is as valid as it was before the company released sales results on Wednesday Investing is a marathon not a sprint and an investment in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is likely to put investors patience to the test <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has a lot going for itself though It is cheap has a stellar product lined up to ignite truck sales in and returns a nice dividend to shareholders The positives outweigh the negatives by a mile Longterm Buy Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Should You Be Worried Disclosure The author is
