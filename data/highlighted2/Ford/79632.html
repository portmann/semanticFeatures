week low is Chesapeake Energy a falling knife or a good contrarian play The Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shale could help Chesapeake stem the slide in its stock price while setting the stage for strong liquids growth in the future After burning through billion in cash in Q Chesapeake is well aware that it needs to dramatically cut back its drilling operations As West Texas Intermediate Americas crude pricing benchmark and Henry Hub Americas natural gas pricing benchmark collapsed from late to it took Chesapeake Energy Corporations NYSE CHK stock price right along with it WTI fell from a barrel in the middle of to under by early with Henry Hub falling from mmBtu to under mmBtu Chesapeake Energy Corporations stock price fell by around over that time frame This could be a classic case of a falling knife that could continue to cut into investors returns or it could be a good contrarian play that might sharply rebound given the chance if natural gas and oil prices rise There is also a lot of upside to be had regardless of where prices go in the shortterm from Chesapeake Energy improving its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>operations Chesapeake Energy has long been primarily a natural gas producer but in light of the Appalachian pricing differential around per mmBtu and low domestic natural gas prices see natural gas surplus management decided to move into the liquids rich Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>play down in Texas Recently Chesapeake had some pretty good news for investors Downspacing tests reducing the distance between well laterals have been a success as production levels matched those of its previous wells as depicted below These downspacing efforts were able to increase Chesapeake Energys potential drilling inventory in the Lower Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>by locations boosting it to Additional tests are in the works including foot spacing to see if that could be increased further Management stated this during its UBS Global Oil Gas conference presentation Whats fantastic about these locations is that we added them with virtually zero acquisition costs So really strong for us as weve added years of inventory to our Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>drilling program Successful downspacing efforts effectively boost the value of Chesapeakes acreage and grow its growth runway for far less than if Chesapeake was to go out and acquire additional acreage Another way management hopes to grow Chesapeakes growth runway is by testing out the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>interval By Q Chesapeake will begin drilling its first Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well Many other players in the industry have been able to bring reasonably productive wells online in the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>horizon including Marathon Oil Corporation NYSE MRO Marathon Oil was able to bring five wells tapping into the Upper Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in Q with the day IP rates of those wells ranging from BOEd BOEd Room for improvement but not a bad start Another way Chesapeake Energy is seeking to optimize its drilling program is by extending the horizontal reach or lateral of its wells By increasing its well lateral length to feet from feet in the Four Corners oil weighted area Chesapeake can boost its EUR estimated ultimate recovery rate from BOE to BOE This helped reduce Chesapeakes Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>well cost per BOE recovered from to The higher recovery rate is half of the equation and the other half is that it costs Chesapeake less per lateral foot to drill and complete an extended lateral well On a foot lateral it costs Chesapeake per lateral foot which goes down to per lateral foot on a foot lateral Management noted that XL wells have a payout rate that is roughly twice as fast as its normal wells in this part of the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>With potential drilling locations capable of handling XL wells Chesapeake has plenty of room to see if its initial results can be replicated elsewhere This is definitely something to watch as Chesapeake Energy plans to makes drilling XL wells in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and elsewhere a priority going forward due to stronger well economics Chesapeake may also end up testing out wells with significantly higher lateral lengths than feet once it gets a better handle on drilling and completing XL wells The longest well lateral Chesapeake Energy has drilled so far in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was feet long Another benefit that is also somewhat of a curse is that even as Chesapeake Energy reduces its rig count it may end up drilling more wells than its revised guidance suggests due to much faster drilling times The biggest challenge that weve got right now is we cut costs but our teams are doing so fast that a rig that used to drill wells is now drilling wells So well continue to just watch it as it progresses but you get some capital pressure when your wells are drilling faster Example of that is the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>We had rigs going Our top core so the difference between our top quartile rigs and our bottom quartile rigs was percent or more So when we pull down our rig count to our top quartile rigs they are drilling faster by default not to count all the other innovations that they are continuing doing So thats the challenge for us is well continue to see cost reductions but I think well drill more wells than we anticipate as well With billion in longterm debt and billion in cash at the end of Q Chesapeake Energys debt load is something to be wary of During the first quarter Chesapeake burned through billion in cash to supplement its cash flow streams However there are reasons to believe that this picture will improve throughout the rest of the year WTI has rebounded substantially which will push up Chesapeakes realized crude and NGLs natural gas liquids are generally priced at a percentage of WTI prices Henry Hub prices have slipped a bit which will reduce some of its pricing cash flow gains What will really help out is the sharp reduction in its spending levels throughout as it winds down drilling activity by reducing its rig count Source Chesapeake Energy Corporation Presentation By the end of the year Chesapeake Energy should be able to at least bring its spending levels close to being in line with its cash flow streams It really comes down to where WTI and Henry Hub prices go but management is well aware of the reality that it needs to cut back Worse case scenario Chesapeake always has the option to sell off some of its acreage or producing assets if it becomes that desperate Chesapeake Energy Corporation is a risky investment but it might be one worth taking a closer look at now that its stock price has fallen down to a week low There is a chance that its Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>operations and efficiency gains could help stem the slide in its stock price while Chesapeake Energy sets the stage for strong liquids production growth when its needed Even if oil andor natural gas prices dont rise from their current levels this year there is always to look forward to American LNG liquefied natural gas exports are guided to startup in early while natural gas continues to tap out coal to generate electricity Petrochemical expansions will also drive demand for natural gas higher through the end of the decade On the oil front a combination of higher demand particularly from Asia and slower supply growth due in large part to curtailments in Canada and America could result in
