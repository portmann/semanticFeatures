GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and theyve made a strong declaration Stock price is starting to recover after being slammed hard into the ground over the past six months Panic on Chinas economic woes were responsible for unrest with US investors but the faith in the system is back hopefully here to stay If the analysts were right at the end of last year we should have ideally fallen off the auto sales cliff by now Nothing of the sort seems to be happening The way Mr Market hammered auto stocks over the past several months youd think something as serious as a major recession was in the offing Thats how furiously US auto majors Fords and General Motors stock value eroded The automobile market is a cyclic one for sure but the ferocity with which the market has treated GM NYSE GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F isnt justified Looking at their market cap collapse over the period in question will show you how true this is From billion levels in April theyve both moved dangerously close to billion GM more so than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Note I covered this in more detail in my prior two articles on the subject I invite you to review Part and Part for an overview on the situation over the past months Things seem to be looking up however over the past three weeks Specifically since February soon after January sales figures were published and crushed all predictions of doom for both companies Will this upward trend continue Is there enough evidence to suggest an upsurge in both stocks over the rest of this quarter and beyond The data clearly leads to that conclusion as I will show What Happened to Mr Market Over the Past Few Months I just never got my head around one thing Everybody believed that million was the peak auto sales number and the US auto market has been hovering around that million level since February and even breaking the million barrier during the final quarter of The market knew of the million trend yet kept pushing GM and F on an upward trajectory right until April when it suddenly woke up to reality and started pushing the stocks disproportionately downward Then in September when the market realized that the peak was yet to come it again reversed its path and briefly pushed stock prices up for about four weeks after which it yet again reversed itself and pushed the stocks back to levels Talk about volatile This isnt what you would expect in one of the most analysed and closely watched industries in the world The only plausible defense for such a crush is because before there wasnt any fear of a slowdown But after the Chinese economy took a beating the market started to feel the fear and pushed the panic button on one of the key industries that highly correlates with the general health of the economy Now though the market is again coming to the realization that peak auto was not in fact the crest before the deep trough in the wavelike nature of auto sales The auto stocks in question are slowly picking up their broken teeth and making their way up the value vine once again But first lets take a look at US figures as a whole and then specifically GMs and Fords first two months sales for This should give us a much better view of how things are likely to move forward and stop all the guessing and uncertainty around this vital market Light Weight Vehicle Sales in the United States Ive first shown January and February auto sales for the lightweight vehicle segment in the United States As you can see below January was a healthy million units for the industry as a whole and February was close behind at Not a significant drop in sales over the period The data above shows that the economy can still support a million level sales volume in this vehicle segment This is a critical point because most previous analyses on the subject predicted a doomsday period post the December highs for both General Motors and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>As we can clearly see from the above that is not the state of the industry But does that mean GM and F are home free Not in the least Well have to dig deeper to see what their January and February sales numbers were and compare that with the same period last year First however Id like to talk briefly about the current state of the economy because that is one of the pulse points for how the auto industry will fare In the quarterly analysis you can see some random distribution that indicates occasional downturns during a particular quarter but then look at this excerpt from Statista along with the graph below it The GDP increased to about trillion US dollars in According to the BEA the deceleration in real GDP in primarily reflected downturns in private inventory investment and in federal government spending and a deceleration in exports that were partly offset by a deceleration in imports and an acceleration in nonresidential fixed investment Rather than showing signs of an impending recession it points to a much more stable economy than before Obviously there are numerous forces at play within the worlds largest economy but Real GDP is a reasonable indicator of the general healthy of any economy Some might rightly argue that there are several reasons why Real GDP is not an accurate measure of an economys welfare but for the purpose of this particular analysis its as deep as I want to get Now for the real test Lets see if overall US sales and the Real GDP can accurately reflect the sales performance of the top automakers in the country As you can see from the graph above Fords January sales were nearly units down from last year but still at a healthy units February however was a surprise to many with the company racking up nearly as much as they did in September when their stock started climbing briefly before the collapse again towards the last week of October Now with strong sales during the first two months and the seasonal increases expected in March and May I see F going up significantly over the remainder of the quarter and into Q In GMs case too the trend is very similar with the exception that their January sales were better in than the year before although only by units or so February again surprised many by showing strong signs of expansion over the previous month If the cyclic pattern holds which I think it will then we can see more sales increases right through May as we saw in Fords case If you look at the stock chart for GM it shows almost the exact same pattern as F Investorspeak Are They Out of the Slump I believe both stocks are on their way to recovery Even though two months may be too short a period of time in which to make a future assumption over several quarters I see both stocks prices increasing at a healthy rate over the next three months at least and possibly beyond It seems now that the market has realized that a recession is not on the horizon for the foreseeable future Panic over Chinas sudden economic shocker was bound to make US investors head for the hills but I think that period is finally over and we can see some gains for GM and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>over Q and Q this year As I showed in my articles about GMs General Motors What is your Rationale for Investing and Fords Fords Dividend Payout An Attractive Proposition dividends both companies are in a good position to keep paying dividends for a long time and the sales growth along with stock price growth now if sustained will only make them stronger and more attractive investment destinations for your money Thank you for reading For more detailed views into auto technology retail logistics and other
