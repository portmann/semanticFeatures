Did The Market Reject Fords Special Dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long F MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>provided investors a peek into its solid results Those figures were accompanied by forecasts of slight improvement in and a special share dividend After the market closed on Tuesday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F announced a special dividend of share in addition to its initially scheduled share Also included in this announcement was ample information about the companys performance as well as guidance Shares were trading down as much as in aftermarket action The press release showed that Fords domestic sales increased and were the highest they have been since The numbers reported were generally pleasing to investors including operating profit in the upper half of the guided range BB and the th straight year of US dominance for the FSeries For investors should be satisfied with the projections provided by management Operating profit is expected to be equal to or higher than as is the case with automotive revenue and operating margin There was also good news with regard to Fords operating regions with Europe Middle East Africa and Asia Pacific is expected to improve and be profitable next year as North America thrives once more This is a major step for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in my opinion as it points to the company finally becoming stable across the globe with the exception of South America The part of the announcement that has investors talking is the supplemental dividend bringing the total quarterly payout on March st to share approximately a yield On the surface this is great news following good news Especially since the supplemental dividend will only be an additional billion out of Fs pockets in the form of dividends for the quarter At the end of Q the company had roughly billion in cash so the special dividend brings up no liquidity concerns The problem here is why is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>doing this The obvious answer that the market is seemingly assuming is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has nothing better to with the cash and therefore is throwing it at shareholders to make up for its lackluster performance of the last few years It hints that F is starved for growth and needs to please investors somehow The large buyback program and yield excluding special dividend serve as points to support this thesis As an owner of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>it was also the first thought I had As I pondered the move and managements motives I came to realize that this is not necessarily true Has anyone considered that maybe the company has nothing better to do with that cash in Including the special dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be outlaying only of its cash hoard in dividends this quarter Given that the Blue Oval generated billion in free cash flow last quarter alone I think its fair to say there is some disposable income available That FCF is not the result of stagnant corporate action however which is why I dont believe it should be viewed as a red flag The company has been very aggressive with new product rollouts worldwide Speaking of the rollouts on the Q conference call CEO Mark Fields reminded investors that the firm successfully introduced new vehicles in and had completed of product debuts in There are more vehicles slated to be brought to the market next year as well On top of that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been very proactive in its investments with regard to electric vehicles and now autonomous vehicles Much has been made of the partnership F struck with tech giant Google NASDAQ GOOG to build driverless vehicles There was much speculation about which automaker Google would collaborate with and has not been greeted by the market with the enthusiasm it should be Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock are actually down about since the announcement An underappreciated aspect of the agreement is that the jointventure will be legally separate from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shielding it from any liability that could arise while testing the new technology This is an investment for the future that will benefit both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and Google as autonomous vehicles are widely regarded as the future of vehicular travel Fields himself has publicly stated that fully autonomous vehicles will be available in the marketplace by and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers believes that of all vehicles will be autonomous by Oh and dont forget about the massive transformation of the F It was a rocky transition early in the year but consumers were pleased with the changes as the F topped Car and Drivers list of fullsize pickup trucks Despite supply constraints in the first quarter the FSeries still sold over vehicles for the first time in years With US vehicle sales expected to set an alltime record in its very likely that FSeries sales surpass the unit mark by a much larger margin this time So what else is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>supposed to do with its cash The company is expanding worldwide introducing a litany of new vehicles and innovating in multiple ways to tailor its products for the coming decades I believe much of the negative reaction from the market is due to the panicridden stock market environment that has been present for much of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>issued this special dividend as a treat for investors and it should be interpreted that way The company is investing billions in capital expenditures while providing strong shareholder returns with more than enough cash flow to support both initiatives The special dividend is merely due to Fords excess cash on hand and overshadows what is an attractive investment opportunity Tagged Dividends Income Consumer Goods </div></body></html>
