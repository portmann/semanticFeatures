Strong underlying performance has not turned into higher stock prices The trend is industrywide not just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSE F just reported an all time record quarter for the company with a very strong performance across the business A record billion pretax profit was recorded up an incredible billion in just months Net income was billion and operating earnings per share were both these results were more than double versus last year Of course with such a huge earnings beat on both the top and bottom line a record operating profit margin and the best quarter in Europe for years the stock rocketed into outerspace far beyond the Hubble Space Telescope right Well no not really Since the earnings release the stock hasnt moved nothing has changed from the continued downward slope The company smashed the ball out of the park and Wall Street didnt bat an eyelid This trend has been apparent in most of the auto stocks with General Motors NYSE GM being another example of a company thats improving earnings but not appreciating in share price What we are left with is a stock like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that trades at x earnings and yields nearly x earnings is a ridiculously cheap valuation for a stock that is growing at the rate that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is especially given the generous dividend yield GM is even cheaper Less than x earnings and a dividend yield that makes a year bond look like the worthless piece of paper found in a cheap Christmas cracker Mr Market is not in favor of the auto stocks right now and unfortunately the trend doesnt appear to be drawing to a close Expectations for revenue and earnings growth at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are very disappointing as explained in a recent article by Josh Arnold But having said that does that mean we should steer clear of the segment altogether because the market isnt in favor right now I dont think so However measured <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM are both very cheap at the moment Both stocks are also vastly improved from their postrecession states with both now very profitable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has even managed a profit in Europe for the past consecutive quarters Both stocks are growing revenue as well as earnings per share with growth coming from increased sales and much needed higher margins especially at GM The two are offering yields of and respectively with continued share buybacks only boosting these even higher Both companies are developing new products which are proving to be very popular As a UK citizen it is clear to see the popularity of Fords new EcoBoost engines in the new Focus and Fiesta models and the Mondeo Fusion in the States is selling much better than I ever expected With this in mind it is clear to see that both are very undervalued companies with generous dividend yields and a range of new products to ensure that growth continues for years to come With the average age of the US vehicle at an alltimehigh interest rates still relatively low and job creation strong it should be a good time for the automakers However at least for the time being the stock price has not kept pace with growth in the underlying business The problem is not in the business its the stock itself Both have traded far too cheap for far too long with some investors losing patience As a bond alternative or a pure income play both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM are an attractive opportunity The yield is incredibly safe as well as being well over twice that of the SP <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM may not be trading higher in or months time but as an income play with the opportunity for longterm stock appreciation both companies are at the very top of my wanted list I like both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM at these levels Being cheap should never be the sole reason to buy anything but these stocks offer so much more than just a discounted stock price Yields are strong as is the pipeline of new vehicles GM has made the shift away from highvolume lowmargin fleet sales to the more profitable retail business and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is growing margins in almost every region as well as turning profitable what was once a money furnace For anyone looking for long term gains and a bountiful income both of these stocks should be high priority It is important to remain diversified and I stress my fears of near constant share prices for the immediate future but these two stocks cannot be ignored when building a long term income portfolio I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Dividends Income Dividend Ideas Consumer Goods Auto Manufacturers Major </div></body></html>
