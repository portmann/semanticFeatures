about US automakers and the quality of the debt they are issuing Despite this sales numbers continue to look good One of the big questions that is plaguing the US auto market and US auto stocks right now is whether or not we are starting to see saturation here in the United States and whether or not that saturation includes a subprime financing bubble Weve said over and over about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F that we are going to be making our investment decisions based on the company sales production in real time We have been watching things like domestic auto sales and European car registrations to get a fantastic month by month view of exactly how the auto industry has performed without having to wait for each companys quarterly reports There was some serious doubt when the market moved lower on China fears earlier this year but it seems as though those concerns have mostly been alleviated and all stocks including US automakers have rebounded We have been bullish on ford for the better part of a year and a half now and we continue to think that if you are a long term oriented dividend investor that it is a great place to have some exposure to We have been backing up our thesis with facts Monthly domestic auto sales and overseas auto sales continue to post promising numbers The latest piece of data that we were able to get was European car registrations and sales for February These numbers continue to grow in strong fashion Newcar sales in the European Union rose in February helped by the extra sales day from the leap year though auto executives have cautioned that fullyear growth would be more modest even as volumes head back toward precrisis levels <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>said it sold vehicles in February in its traditional European markets up percent over last year and the companys best February sales since while its market share increased by percentage points to percent last month Across all of its European markets the company reported units in deliveries a percent raise vs an industry growth of only percent We are growing and gaining market share with our fresh cars SUVs and commercial vehicles and unlike much of the industry we are pulling back from rental car sales and dealer selfregistrations that can erode brand value and residuals said Roelant de Waard vice president Marketing Sales and Service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>of Europe The last two or three years have really been a turning point for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and it looks like the company is continuing its momentum through The introduction of the aluminum F into their pick up truck series spurred a stage of growth for the company that was on the optimistic side of early predictions In addition the company has set a trend and now has other manufacturers like General Motors looking to implement aluminum in their SUVs as well The company has also recently invested millions into smart cars in China We are seeing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>in the headlines when we research not only smart cars but driverless vehicles and vehicles with automated braking systems here in the United States The company appears to be staying on the forefront of innovation in the industry One area we would like to see the company put a little bit more work into would be their electric vehicle hybrids While the company has done a fantastic job introducing hybrid vehicles through models like its Fusion we think that EV is going to represent a significant opportunity domestically first and then internationally over the next few years We are confident that under CEO Mark Fields <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will stay in front of the innovation adoption curve and will continue to operate profitably with a focus on creating shareholder value moving forward After all this is the CEO that issued a billion special dividend and then went on television afterwards and said that if the stock remains undervalued he will continue to do this moving forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will be reporting in April and we are looking for several things We will be looking for the companys continued momentum and return on invested capital in places like South Africa and China We will look to see if high margin SUVs and pick up trucks maintain their stronghold in the United States We will keep a close eye on margin as the company is positioning itself in various locales to try and trim gross margin even lower Finally we will look for any outlook from the company as its previous outlook was basically in line with expectations A guide higher could be the key to a shortterm rally in the stock As we have said in the past those that are looking for a way to have exposure to the US auto market and its corresponding dividends but also want to hedge can go long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>or whatever automaker that they like and short CACC which is the best way to have exposure to the loans that these companies are cranking out to finance vehicle purchases Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
