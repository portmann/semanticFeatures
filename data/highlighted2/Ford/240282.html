Wealthy clicks Year over year auto sales in the United States remain strong but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has had trouble delivering similar results overseas Fords decision to invest in Russia as GM was exiting could prove to be a profitable move or it could lead to additional losses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has lost money in Europe for several years but improved auto sales in the region could finally return the company to profitability in the area <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F seems to have enough going for it to suggest that the companys stock should be a buy The auto sector continues its recovery pushing sales to their highest levels in over a decade US vehicle sales are up double digits year over year The remodeled F pickup truck remains popular The stock has a dividend of over and a forward PE ratio of under Yet the stock is at roughly the same level that it was back in the beginning of I bought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>back in the beginning of based on the premise that the F would help deliver strong results and its valuation would help provide a floor for the investment Needless to say Ive been disappointed So why isnt this story playing out any better There are a few likely causes Oil prices and interest rates seem to be headwind macroeconomic factors Cheap gas is making consumers feel more comfortable putting lots of miles on their cars while low interest rates helps financing deals look that much more attractive While oil prices could stay low if North American and Middle Eastern oil producers continue to try to outproduce each other the low interest rate environment looks to be ending soon Higher interest rates could not only start squeezing the consumers budget but also make new vehicles relatively less valuable Another reason is likely that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has no one to blame but themselves for their troubles Fords rollout of the new F has been less than smooth as manufacturers have had to spend time and money get their assembly lines prepared That delay cost the company sales that are only starting to pick up again The F delays actually led to Toyota NYSE TM outselling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>earlier this year Fords overseas activity could very be a bigger culprit The companys investment in Russia could prove to be fruitful in the long term but right now it looks like a sunk cost General Motors NYSE GM exited Russia which could pave a smoother path for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>but GM likely left Russia for a reason Sales growth in China has also trailed that of GM and Europe has been a trouble spot for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for a while now Sales in Europe have improved recently but the company is still recovering from years of losses thanks to the regions economic crisis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is expecting better results in Europe in the coming year but Qs disappointment could suggest that were not quite there yet So what needs to be done to move the stock price up again It seems the answer is to execute overseas <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>needs to see a return on its investment in Russia and it needs to see continued sales growth in the rest of Europe Sales results seem initially encouraging but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has lost billions in the region over the last few years and that needs to turn around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also needs to clean up some of its manufacturing issues The F seems to be a success on a high level but the production delays seem to have muted some of the positive impact Things look fairly good on the domestic front but its going to be the companys ability to execute profitably overseas thats going to finally lift
