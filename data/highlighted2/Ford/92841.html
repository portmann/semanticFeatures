SM Energy Is Primed For More Upside After An Impressive Run So Far SM Energy Company NYSESM Seeking Alpha SM shares have outperformed the market so far this year even though the companys financial performance has taken a beating due to weak energy prices However SMs acreage in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and the Bakken areas will help it make a strong recovery as these carry robust internal rates of returns despite weak oil prices SMs drilling completion and service costs have dropped at a rapid pace indicating that the company will be able to improve its margins going forward By using stackstagger laterals in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>SM has reduced its well costs by and achieved an IRR of It is surprising to see that SM Energy NYSE SM has appreciated close to on the stock market in The company which gets of its revenue from natural gas from crude oil and the rest from natural gas liquids has seen a consistent drop in its financial performance over the past year This is clearly shown in the following chart SM Revenue NYSE TTM data by YCharts Additionally the companys bottom line performance has not been up to the mark either in each of the last four quarters Even in the recentlyreported quarter SM missed the bottom line estimate by per share and the revenue estimate by million Thus the weakness in oil prices has taken a heavy toll on SMs performance But what is it about the company that has kept investors faith intact as SM has beaten the overall market by a big margin this year despite financial weakness Lets find out SMs core acreage is spread across economical assets such as the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the BakkenThree Forks formation and the Permian Basin For instance in the Bakken shale of North Dakota the cost of extracting oil from newlydrilled wells is as low as per barrel across the state as per Institutional Investor In fact in certain counties oil can be extracted in the range of per barrel More importantly at the existing wells in North Dakota the cost of extracting oil is just per barrel Considering these numbers it is not surprising to see why SMs cash flow from operations has started recovering slightly as shown in the chart above Additionally even when oil prices were around a barrel SM was able to generate an internal rate of return of over Now as oil prices currently hover around WTI the companys IRR is hovering around the range in the North Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shown on the left and the Bakkens RavenBear Den shale shown on the right areas as shown below Thus as oil prices continue improving going forward on the back of an improvement in demand and supply conditions in the industry it is likely that SM Energy will be able to generate higher returns Now there is a distinct possibility that oil prices could improve going forward This is because the production of crude oil in the US is expected to decline from now till early as per the EIA This is not surprising as the rig count in the US has declined at an aggressive pace over the past couple of months and this is now leading to a drop in production as shown below The idling of rigs in the US is also bringing down crude oil stockpiles with oil inventories in the US down for seven straight weeks now Last week crude oil inventories dropped another million barrels This is good news for oil prices as the drop in production will help decrease the oversupply situation to some extent Another reason behind the drop in crude oil inventories in the US is strong demand For example the EIA is of the opinion that oil demand will rise by another barrels per day this year to million bpd as compared to its earlier forecast Hence on one hand demand for crude oil is rising while on the other supply is gradually coming down This will allow SM Energy to record higher internal rates of returns at its wells as oil prices continue improving In a low oil price environment SM Energy has done the right thing by reducing costs For instance its lease operating expenses in the previous quarter declined yearoveryear More importantly SMs drilling costs have dropped in the range of while completion costs have declined between and as compared to last year Also the company has significantly reduced its service costs to the tune of to from last year The following chart clearly shows the progress that SM has made at its key Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>asset with respect to cost cuts SMs production in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>play was up in the first quarter on a sequential basis Looking ahead it is highlyprobable that the company will continue increasing its production in this area In fact SM is trying to improve inventory in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>by stackstagger laterals while optimizing spacing The company has identified over locations in its operated Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>South area to implement this strategy More importantly SM can bring these wells online at low costs The well costs at feet laterals are expected to be million down as compared to last year Also these wells have an internal rate of return of and offer net present value of million The graph below shows the stack and stagger testing road map in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Shale Thus driven by its new investments in the Eagle <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>SM should be able to enhance its margin performance going forward as oil prices improve Given the points discussed above it is not surprising to see why investors have faith in SM Energys prospects and its shares have gained so far this year Looking ahead as oil prices continue improving investors can expect the companys performance to improve further As such I would advise investors to hold on to their long positions in SM Energy as it can deliver more upside Source Why SM Energy Is Primed For More Upside After An Impressive Run So Far Disclosure
