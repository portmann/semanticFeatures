Market Got Fords Earnings Wrong <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha We think the market has it wrong Its not about short term outlook or next years outlook its about years from now While the market seems ambivalent about how it wants to react to Fords NYSE F earnings we are not The US automaker came out Tuesday and beat on revenue while slightly missing on earningspershare but only due to a higher tax rate that analysts were not expecting Momentum with F sales global sales and continued investments in itself were all positive topping off a generally positive report that we think the market got wrong The company continues to update it shareholders on its progress globally and we are happy with how things are going despite the headline miss This drubbing in the stock comes after what has been a great month where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has rallied from all the way above We think the market has it wrong selling off <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>here First credit and incentives continue to help fuel the business but not so much that it has become a detriment While there is continued easy access to credit and while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>still has the incentives lever to pull a little bit more the company should keep coasting on sales We saw this same type of positivity in sales from General Motors NYSE GM just days ago We remain confident in the core fundamentals of the business moving forward here Thirdquarter revenue rose to billion due to higher sales in the US and Europe but softness in China and emerging markets is tempering the companys outlook <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>said sales volumes in Asia Pacific fell compared with a year earlier The auto maker a late mover to China the worlds largest car market spent heavily to add significant production capacity in that country just as demand started to cool While stronger demand in Europe helped offset Chinas sales decline those gains havent yet benefited the bottom line The loss in Europe narrowed to million from a million deficit a year ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>hasnt forecast when its European losses will end Operating profit in AsiaPacific was a modest million in the quarter less than half of the earnings there a year earlier <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>lost million in South America slightly better than a year ago Its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Credit finance arm contributed million to the quarters profit up from million in the same period a year ago There seems to be a lot of confusion about the quality of Fords earnings The company only missed its headline estimates because of a higher tax rate The company paid in taxes as opposed to the that analysts were predicting There were also concerns about whether or not the company would be able to meet its estimates for fourthquarter and for the full year The company reaffirmed its outlook for the full year and CFO Bob Shanks in an interview with Bloomberg made some very bullish comments about the companys future Here are some highlights I dont think were peaking Bob Shanks Fords CFO said in an interview Its bizarre if you just meet expectations somehow youve let the market down The earnings per share miss is entirely due to a tax rate difference Shanks said We came right on in terms of operating results but we had a percent tax rate The analysts on average had a percent tax rate The fourth quarter is usually the weakest of our four quarters Shanks said But its going to be an extremely strong quarter and on a yearoveryear basis the numbers are going to pop Its going to be extremely impressive Im not talking about a bad quarter Shanks said this is not as good as it gets for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Weve got several years ahead of us that are going to be really really good Shanks said North America is going to continue to run and operate and deliver very strong results We also read a couple of articles that suggested that General Motors was the better bet over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>because of the dividends and the buyback As weve said this is an area where we disagree We think the problem is that those looking long term at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>are only looking out till next year Even then consensus estimates are for We believe investors in the company not traders should be looking at the companys plans for the next years We see a company that is setting itself up on the global stage for significant international growth We think that this choice of investing in itself versus buying back stock will pay off for shareholders with a much longer term view of the company Investors have to remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a multi year hold for us While we were expecting a beat this quarter we are encouraged by the companys revenue numbers and we see the same type of strength in areas that we saw for General Motors The companys decision to spend its capital on continued investments in itself as opposed to going out and buying back stock could have been the difference maker in the headline number If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was buying back stock it would have made the headline number Were glad it didnt and that its spending that capital on things like continued investments in smart cars in China Once again we are left trying to determine if Fords investments in itself now will pay off in the future We believe that it will Again one of the nice things about holding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the long term is that it is going to continue to provide investors with a nice dividend yield that they can reinvest F Dividend Yield NYSE TTM data by YCharts If you are bullish on the long term story the same way that we are we do not mind compounding our dividends quarter over quarter while we hold onto our core shares We remain encouraged by this quarters results and we continue to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is on the right track The market got this one wrong and we continue to be long We only use your
