style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has posted record profit pays a dividend yield and trades at just times earnings Despite how well its doing shares are down this year and over the past months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and General Motors NYSE GM have been under some serious pressure for whats turned out to be years at this point And for a long time I was long both names I owned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>the longest until the continued underperformance took its toll I cashed out I couldnt take it anymore Was it a lack of patience Maybe Too short term Not for me I had owned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>since and over the last six years shares are up When I sold it in the fall of my return was a little better than that but it was far from impressive Despite a resoundingly better situation than the automaker faced five years ago the stock price refuses to gain any traction Its a Seeking Alpha favorite that refuses to perform It feels like the market is actually punishing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the inevitable slowing auto sales At some point in the future be it this year or or auto sales will decline from the prior year If theres a recession theyll probably plummet But so far the seasonally adjusted annual rate SAAR has continued to churn higher since the Great Recession One Mans Trash Is Another Mans Treasure Theres lots of reason to own the automakers one of which is the dividend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM yield and respectively While the income is nice the valuation is almost a joke GM trades at x trailing earnings x forward Five <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>trades at x trailing earnings x forward Granted the companies low profit margins for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for GM dont command a very high valuation but and times Cmon There are concerns like subprime auto lending perhaps showing its hand at a future wave of defaults when times get tough and South America certainly isnt anything to get excited over China isnt the growth engine that it appeared it was going to be just a few years ago but it kicks out a steady stream of profits Theres also the good Each quarter I read roughly two dozen conference calls take notes and draft a Big Picture Summary In a recent summary Fords management noted how similar Europes recovery looks compared to the one seen in the US a few years ago Thats very encouraging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>also boasts how well the F is doing since its completed overhaul The companys and countrys most popular vehicle is a big hit winning the Best Value in America award among fullsize halfton pickups for the fifth time reclaiming the title it held from through It also won Consumer Reports best pickup truck selection and is the only large pickup truck to receive an IIHS top safety pick I feel like if I told any investor I knew a stock that paid a dividend yield traded at times earnings and reported record profit in most would be buyers But thats not the case for the automakers Honestly the only thing I can think of is that the market is discounting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and GM for when sales finally do decline and even then theyll probably take the stocks down What else could it be Because its not just now its been this way for years Yields got higher a cheap valuation got cheaper US sales got stronger Europe has improved But none of it has mattered No stock is perfect but in my mind thats what a low valuation is for Seemingly everything else is laid out in a bullish manner At least bullish enough to own the stock And thats exactly why I wont own it Because when everything makes sense for a long position record profits five times earnings yield and the stock doesnt perform Im clearly missing something Perhaps investors looking for yield want it from a Dividend Aristocrat while others are seeking out growth from a company like Starbucks SBUX I waited for years and my investment did little more than pay me a dividend Not the worst scenario but it definitely was a frustrating ride If its going to trade like this when times are good what will it be like when times are actually bad I dont want to find out and the yield isnt enough to get me back in at current levels I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Dividends Income Dividend Ideas Consumer Goods Auto Manufacturers Major </div></body></html>
