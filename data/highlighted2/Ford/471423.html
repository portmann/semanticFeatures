Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F earnings were certainly not what we expected this morning There were a myriad of surprises in numerous metrics and at first glance the companys guidance is making it look as though the second half of the year isnt much to look forward to either Those that have been reading us know that the companys business holding up domestically is a large part of the backbone of our thesis The companys admission this morning that North American sales missed last quarter but also that incentive selling was basically pushed as hard as it could be pushed and these numbers still missed was an obvious disappointment We had said in our last few articles that hedging a long position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>by shorting Credit Acceptance NASDAQ CACC may be a great way to go long and trap Fords yield but also have short exposure on if the auto market bubble starts to collapse Statements from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>management this morning seem to make it look as though the bubble in North America may be pushed as far as it can go We continue to think that shorting CACC is a prudent strategy if one is going to keep their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>long in place While revenue impressed and it was nice to see the top line growing as a result of international growth margin collapsed and the companys net income suffered With better than expected numbers in Europe we were hoping that net income would at least come inline with expectations instead of missing them widely We had largely projected that rising margin and better EBIT in International venues would be the driver for new EPS growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>In todays case it looks at though it is simple whats holding Fords EPS together as North America is withering away Here were some other takeaways from this mornings report summed up by Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F brought in over B in profit during Q but EPS fell from the level of a year ago and missed the consensus estimate of analysts Automobile revenue increased YY to B Operating margin by region North America bps to South America bps to Europe bps to Middle EastAfrica bps to Asia Pacific bps to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>CFO Bob Shanks says demand in the US will be lower than it was a year ago Fullyear guidance is at risk with the impact of Brexit and higher incentives also major factors It is also disappointing to see margin fade in numerous other locations aside from the US The company building infrastructure in places like Asia and Africa is supposed to help give them a leg up Focusing on the causes of these margin falls will be part of our follow up work that we likely publish tomorrow What is most disappointing to us is that General Motors was able to deliver a fantastic quarter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was not Generally these two automakers trade in line and General Motors report gave us optimism for Fords report This optimism obviously was not warranted however we dont think the report was absolutely terrible The top line growth is a nice indicator for the future that we may be able to see more sales drop to the bottom line One of the big parts of our thesis was that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was going to be able to turn international markets into profit centers that can capitalize on for some consistency wherever there is an economic upswing What we saw in Europe was some of the better results from the company in its history Europe is turning into a profit center due to strategic investments that the company has made an infrastructure there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is working on the same type of progress in geographies like China and Mexico Those investments clearly have not paid off just yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>kept its dividend at meaning that the yield is still going to be impressive if the stock pulls back even further We are going to continue to hold our shares long and may put on CACC on as a short to hedge against further signs of an auto market bubble collapsing Despite the bad news Fords profit was still decent annualized at around and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock remains at between X and X earnings depending on where it winds up today This plus the yield which will top if the stock moves lower should continue to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>a foundation We plan to be on the conference call this morning and review Fords results further later in the day today We will likely update this article over the next day or two with our revised long term outlook on the company I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Consumer Goods Auto
