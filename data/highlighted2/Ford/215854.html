Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor will release third quarter earnings tomorrow I expect very strong results based on Fords excellent sales growth in the United States in recent months Further General Motors handsomely beat earnings expectations which implies surprise potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor NYSE F will release third quarter earnings early tomorrow morning on October Naturally shareholders are looking forward to the release date hoping that the auto maker will make a case for buying its stock While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has been doing a solid job over the last few years in terms of launching new products and growing sales the same cannot be said about Fords shares though Fords stock sits just below and has become slightly overbought lately But dont let the chart or the Relative Strength Index for that matter fool you here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor can today be bought at the same price that investors were required to pay for the company in early Granted shareholders got to collect a nice enough dividend and they continue to do so but from a capital growth point of view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has not been a winner Despite Fords disappointing share performance in and in the years before the company is on track to deliver strong earnings tomorrow which could be a positive catalyst for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares Why For one because General Motors Company NYSE GM released excellent third quarter results last week that beat consensus estimates by a wide margin This implies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors earnings also have substantial surprise potential because the Street might be similarly too cautious about Fords earnings growth General Motors said it had third quarter earnings of per share which compares against earnings of per share in the year ago quarter The Street expected General Motors to report earnings of just per share Secondly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor has been shooting the lights out lately with impressive vehicles sales in the United States Remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>sold more vehicles YY in September and a booming US auto market will leave an imprint on Fords results that are set to be released on Tuesday In the second quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor also beat earnings expectations by a wide margin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had Q earnings of per share compared against per share in Q Analysts were expecting per share in earnings an number that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor easily beat According to Yahoo Finance analysts now shoot for per share in earnings this quarter on billion in revenues Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>beat the consensus estimates for US sales in previous month chances are that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>with outperform earnings expectations on Tuesday and potentially by a wide margin too There is a high chance that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor will follow General Motors lead this quarter and report a significant jump in YY earnings on the back of strong truck and SUV demand that has helped propel US sales in previous months Importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor could outperform the consensus EPS estimate by a considerable margin which in turn could be understood as a positive catalyst for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motors shares While Fords stock has not met my capital return expectations so far there is a good chance that the auto maker will report excellent results tomorrow My month price target on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor is We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
