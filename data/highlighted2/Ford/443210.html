style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was hit with the broader markets on Friday If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>continues to fall with the markets heading into next week month quarter or year its a buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>at this level and any lower is still way too cheap hedging with a short of auto credit makes for a nice pair trade What we look for in a situation where the entire market sells off is core stocks that we believe will be around for the long term can generate yield and will be risk adverse We see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F and General Motors both fitting into that group Generally our strategy is going to be to position ourselves short in individual equities and through currencies but as equity prices fall and we believe they will continue doing so we will begin to build positions in core longs that we want to hold over the course of many years We have been writing about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for a long time and we have continued to state that our investing timeline for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares is a multiple year approach that we have a long term horizon on Because of this we believe that a global selloff in equities like we saw on Friday can create fantastic buying opportunities for companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is already a cheap stock When looking at the valuation we have to take into account that a large auto financing bubble is being priced in With that said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>shares now trade at X next years expected earnings and x sales The companys EVsales is x These numbers are astonishingly low and are pricing in a catastrophic financial bubble collapse While we do believe that there is some credit that is going to wind up being defaulted on and we do believe the automobile financial market is in a bubble we believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>can withstand this bubble and that these prices are taking into account far more risk than there actually is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is the one company that survived the crash without assistance and we think a small burst in the automobile financial market would not phase the company for long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is larger and more diversified globally and economically now as it has ever been As an investor we have talked about a pair trade that can protect your capital for these purposes as well all while taking advantage of Fords enormous yield It trades this way because people are nervous about there being a bubble in the automobile financing markets We have written a few articles suggesting to hedge a long position in any of the auto manufacturers with a short position in CACC which is a company that primarily originates financial loans for automotive companies We think this is a risk adverse way to be in a position that will allow current investors to benefit from Fords yield moving forward from here F Dividend Yield NYSE TTM data by YCharts Not only does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>generate a majority of its profits from North America but the international locations that the company is looking to expand to and do business in dont really have too much to do with the United Kingdom exiting the European Union While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is looking to increase its footprint in Europe the largest investments it has made over the last two years have been in Mexico and China It has invested in both of these geographies in order to build infrastructure and create product for distribution all over North America and Asia at a cost efficient rate The United Kingdoms exit from the European Union will have very little effect on Fords two biggest investments Despite this we do believe that international profitability is going to be the key in whether or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stockholders see appreciation of the companys equity This is a long term strategy that we know will take years to continue developing but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has been showing traction in recent quarters and we believe they are on the right track There comes a point where equities simply get too cheap for people to ignore We dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is at this level yet but we believe that if it continues to sell off in tandem with the overall market the way that it did on Friday it will not be long before people are taking a serious look at the company from both an investment standpoint and a potentially strategic standpoint The company has already showed us that it is not afraid to allocate capital back to shareholders with the recent issuance of its B special dividend We continue to expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to offer shareholder perks like this moving forward if the equity price remains underappreciated We would not be surprised by a sizable buyback similar to the one General Motors issued months ago Automobile stocks were already compressed on the assumption that there was going to be an auto financial bubble That hasnt happened yet and the average age of vehicles on the road is at an alltime high nearing years per vehicle We have given investors a decent way to protect themselves against the auto finance bubble with a pair trade in CACC At this point we think there is nothing left to do but to add <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>on the way down from here and enjoy the yield moving forward from this rock solid stable company that will not be going anywhere anytime soon I wrote this article myself and it
