class='textDiv'>Fords China Fake Out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company NYSEF Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>puts up great numbers in China for February alleviating concern about the companys poor January numbers This data follows strong results in the US to start off With the market looking like its not going into fullfledged recession mode we continue to like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>here with a multiyear hold thesis We almost couldnt have timed it any better It was just last week that we came out with our latest bullish article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F a company that we have been bullish on for the better part of two years now Last months China numbers made it look as if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>may have hit a roadblock This months numbers tell us just the opposite Today we have additional data from the allimportant Chinese market that seems to corroborate our thesis that the company despite the narrative placed on it by the market is doing just fine After <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>had a slowdown in China during the month of January this mornings data shows that the company bounced back with a fantastic February in the extremely important country of China which arguably represents Fords most lucrative global market According to Seeking Alpha here is the data we received this morning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F reports sales in China are up YTD to vehicles The Changan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Automobiles JV has generated sales of vehicles while the Jiangling Motor JV is in with vehicles Sales in China were down during February <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Escort sales are up YTD to vehicles All the while we continue to hear that US automakers are getting run over We dont think so Those that read us regularly understand that we follow these monthly metrics for a snapshot into the companys business in between its quarterly filings We feel that monthly auto sales data gives us a great look into the current health and vitality of the company without having to wait for three months of rolling data in quarterly reports These fantastic numbers from China show the payoff for Fords continued commitment and investment in the Asia region <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has spent billions to try and give itself an international footprint and it has spent the most in the Chinese market due to its massive populous and strong advertising requirements As we have stated in previous articles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>has created a brand inside of its brand in China and the company spends as much focus on marketing and advertising in that market as it does anywhere else in the world Again as we have been saying for two years the international outreach is where the company is going to be able to juice its profitability as long as sales domestically continue to hold This is what we believe we are seeing happen right before our eyes This news of course follows news we wrote about last week regarding the companys United States auto sales When checking in with United States auto sales we found that the company continues to have a strong backbone intact for domestic sales with SUVs and pickups leading the charge It has been a bit taxing to write about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>for the better part of two years where the share price has basically just gone lower over that time But as we have said from the first article that we wrote we had a multiple year thesis on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>that involves holding the stock and reinvesting dividends For those that have taken this strategy you likely bought stock at prices underneath todays price while reinvesting We think buying today and locking in a yield of well over is a smart move for any dividend portfolio We think appreciation of the stock back to previous levels of where we felt it was underpriced is going to leave you at least upside from here From there we believe the stock can and will move higher as the company proves on a quarterbyquarter and yearbyyear basis that it is capable of continuing to execute For those who are worried about subprime risk in auto financing we proposed in our last article to short Credit Acceptance Corporation NASDAQ CACC and go long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>as a pair trade CACC is a company that provides automobile dealers financing programs and related products and services that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers It advances money to dealers in exchange for the right to service the underlying consumer loans and buys the consumer loans from the dealers and keeps various amounts collected from the consumers In other words CACC backs all of the auto finance industrys loans and would make for a great hedge to short if you are a nervous investor regarding the subprime lending happening in the auto sector Of course with the way the market is looking over the last week it appears the US could be avoiding going into a fullfledged recession This would only be good news for United States consumers and we think that this should help support <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>stock on a go forward basis Even if the market does correct slightly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a name that we dont mind being in because of the companys great financial position and its dividend We recently said that rather than a recession this was likely a stock pickers market and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is a company that we continue to maintain as a great longterm hold Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with
