sales look to continue in the very near future Autonomous vehicles will be a huge disruption to the auto industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>NYSE F is part of the automotive manufacturing industry and this article is an analysis of the automobile industry leading us to information that will be vital when forecasting future growth in our DCF analysis The industry is involved in the design production marketing sale and servicing of motor vehicles Most auto manufacturers currently produce compact cars midfull size sedans SUVs pickups and luxury cars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is involved in all of these categories with their best known vehicle being the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>F pickup truck The industrys revenue streams come directly from vehicle production and sales volume and is based on the relationships between prices sales mix and volume Sales mix is one of the most important things for the automobile manufacturers and Fords profitability On small compact cars the margins that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and others make on the sale of these vehicles are very slim Especially when compared to the margins that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>realizes on trucks SUVs and luxury cars Although government regulations are pushing manufacturers to have to sell more compact cars which are low margin vehicles the current state of the economy is pushing consumers towards bigger and less fuel efficient vehicles This industrywide trend bodes well for Fords sales mix in the shortterm but in the longterm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and other competitors will need to be able to sell smaller more efficient cars at higher margins to remain as profitable as they are today Over the last year consumers have been purchasing more cars than ever before This can be explained for several reasons low gas prices lownonexistent interest rates and the old age of the average car being driven today These are important trends for us to consider when we eventually forecast growth prospects in a future article as interest rates and gas prices will not be this low forever In the US demand for vehicles has recovered over the most recent two years since the Financial Crisis and I expect for demand to grow slightly or remain steady over However in the AsiaPacific region of the world car demand will continue to grow because of the expanding middle class in these emerging markets In this region obtained more than half of the worlds car production and I see this trend continuing over the next three to five years While Chinas GDP is starting to slow it is still growing at a crazy rate of nearly triple that of the US Expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and competitors to fight intensely for market share in China The market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is able to capture in China could be the biggest catalyst for growth in the foreseeable future <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>is leading the industry in the trend towards autonomous vehicles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>will have the largest autonomous fleet of the major auto manufacturers and plans to continue development of this industry changing technology When analyzing how autonomous vehicles could change the future of the automobile industry we have to consider several different possibilities and factor these into our potential growth situations Will the sharing economy become the norm when autonomous vehicles become popular Will people consider a car as a necessity anymore Or will people still purchase cars as they recently have they will simply have the autonomous feature Will the first autonomous vehicle that is cleared for roadways be the biggest winner You know the answer to these questions as well as I do and nobody knows how it will play out but it is something that we will need to account for when modeling Fords growth into the future I think that the threat of the sharing economy is the single largest threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>With a large concentration on lowering carbon emissions regulators around the world are making manufacturers sell a certain percentage of their vehicles as lowemission or even zeroemission Since these cars are usually quite small the margins on these vehicles are quite low There is some regulation that will be slowly phased in over the next five to seven years in the US and Europe that will require <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>to have a sales mix that is skewed towards smaller and less profitable vehicles Smaller countries are also starting to adopt regulations similar to the European Union and the US If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>and competitors cannot create higher margins on these low and zeroemission vehicles expect a much lower return While this may seem like quite negative trends for the automobile industry I look at it as quite the opposite for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Every negative has the potential to produce great growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Imagine if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was the first to have a fully autonomous vehicle that was legal to buy and drive in the US or EU Imagine if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>was able to create a lowcost highmargin low or zero emission vehicle that would be popular in the US EU and China I think that we are coming to a point in the automobile industry that will be revolutionary Maybe not tomorrow or two years from now but definitely in the next years The manufacturers most willing to adopt new technologies and innovate the automobile will be winners in the next age of the automobile industry This is the second part of doing a DCF analysis on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>Motor Company Now that the more general analysis is over I will begin working on analyzing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>directly I hope you all will continue to read my articles about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Ford </span>so that you all have a better
