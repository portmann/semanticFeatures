class='textDiv'>Why Facebooks Billion Milestone Is A Big Deal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha On August th in people on earth used <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in a hour period A huge milestone for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>successfully attempts to fill a human void created by technologys ability to connect people by disconnecting us In the process <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will become a platform of choice for advertisers With a user base equivalent to approximately of the global population the social network is increasingly becoming a data analytics powerhouse Yesterday Mark Zuckerberg announced on his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB page that the company had just connected a billion people in a single day A tremendous milestone for the company that substantiates how it has become a powerful platform We just passed an important milestone For the first time ever one billion people used <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in a single day On Monday in people on Earth used <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to connect with their friends and family When we talk about our financials we use average numbers but this is different This was the first time we reached this milestone and its just the beginning of connecting the whole world Im so proud of our community for the progress weve made Our community stands for giving every person a voice for promoting understanding and for including everyone in the opportunities of our modern world A more open and connected world is a better world It brings stronger relationships with those you love a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society that reflects all of our values Thank you for being part of our community and for everything youve done to help us reach this milestone Im looking forward to seeing what we accomplish together <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>CEO Mark Zuckerberg Technology has is and will always be a paradox It helps us save time and at the same time and makes us waste time It enables us to stay more connected with people all over the world by making us more disconnected with our surroundings You can have dinner with someone and yet spend more time chatting on the phone than with the person seated next to you The vast array of ways we are able to stay connected with people has made us more disconnected today than ever However this disconnect has given birth to more powerful companies that attempt to fill that physical human void Social networking sites like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>have dominated this space This dominance is important in three ways More advertisers By having enough people use their platforms social networks can attract more advertisers Data analytics They can make money from data analytics by leveraging big data to analyze human trends Live news market They can grab market share from traditional media by dominating the live news market This is why Facebooks billion milestone is very important It positions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a platform of choice for advertisers In addition it gives the company the green light to attempt other revenue generating strategies such as the live news business No social networking site comes close to Facebooks Daily Active Users DAU This is significant if put into context It implies that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has almost twice the traffic as Instagram Twitter NYSE TWTR Snapchat and Whatsapp combined and then multiplied by Although these DAUs are averages for Instagram Twitter Snapchat and Whatsapp they give an idea of the enormous user engagement <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offers relative to competitors Furthermore this increased user engagement is in addition to the data that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>accounts for of all social media site visits The billion milestone reiterates Facebooks dominance to advertisers Repeat traffic means repeat exposure for advertisers and this increases the probability of a user clicking on their ads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has managed to make users visit the site again and again By having a lot of new content generated every second it makes the site less boring and it makes users stay longer on the site <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>owns some major players in the social networking space such as Instagram and Whatsapp This is important because it enables the company to gain insight into different demographics This is a value proposition that means everything to advertisers For instance retailers targeting teens universities attempting to lure high school students to apply to them a politician trying to appeal to youth an advertiser with a specific demography targeting a person with specific interests etc The examples are endless The opportunities are numerous The company has access to data it can use to make advertising on its platform more efficient Heres the list of the top eight most popular social networking sites as derived from an eBizMBA Rank which is a continually updated average of each website Alexa Global Traffic Rank and US Traffic Rank from both Compete and Quantcast The image above shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has almost the same unique monthly visitors as Twitter Linkedln Pinterest Google Plus and Tumblr combined Having an audience this large enables the company to become a powerful data analytics tool Through big data they can give advertisers specific information about their audience to enable them to effectively target the right groups of people <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does not need to have tweets to compete with Twitter in live news In a sense <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has already began making steps into the now news space One of the comments on Mark Zuckerbergs announcement that grabbed my attention was about the devastating Earthquake in Japan <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does not need to buy Twitter to enter into live news It can just compete with Twitter With a billion DAU milestone increases in Facebooks user growth and engagement look promising In addition its easier for anyone to post their thoughts on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>without the character restriction than it is on Twitter Good writers who can succinctly express their views in characters are more inclined to prefer Twitter for being concise but the majority would rather not have the restriction I would take it with a grain of salt Chowdhry told Benzinga I dont think we are seeing the whole picture I will not believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had one billion on the same day I think this statement is lacking some details Chowdhry said if the announcement had specified that this includes Instagram and WhatsApp he would have believed the reported milestone Engagement levels on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>especially on desktop are declining said Chowdhry On mobile Instagram and WhatsApp are growing at a faster rate and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is declining So I wont believe what he says at face value Benzinga I think these are good points to consider But I believe they are short sighted If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is even close to a billion people on a single day thats huge However more users do not mean increased revenues How they leverage the user base is what matters For instance some people have more than one account Others might be logged in but not actively using it Nonetheless the milestone is a significant one It reiterates how popular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is and gives a glimpse not only in what the company is but also what it could be With billion users as of August according to Statista not of them are active but that is more than the population of China billion or about of the worlds population Lastly over the coming months news like this will attract more advertisers I would recommend getting into the stock before the October earnings report considering the recent correction dropped its stock price from its week high of share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is going to go above share before the end of this year due to increased ad revenues and momentum driving news such as its drone program or its visual assistant Advertisers who desire efficiency and better targeted marketing will start considering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a platform of choice Advertisers get more bang for their buck on <span style='background-color:
