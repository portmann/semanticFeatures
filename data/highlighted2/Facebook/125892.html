Ways to prevent getting fired because of Social Media Canadian Budget Binder July By Mr CBB Leave a Comment Its nothing new that people have lost their jobs because their employer found out or was notified about something posted on a social media account Just imagine you are working towards a debt free life and a good retirement fund and all of a sudden you say the wrong thing on your social media account and you lose the career you worked so hard to get It happens more often than you think You can completely ignore any advice and say what you want because its your after all The problem is some people arent going to learn until they are getting the pink slip Social media is not rocket science but your employer may still hold reign over you even when you are not working Whats worse than being embarrassed about the job you have is being embarrassed when you are fired and its been made public because of your online actions Your companys reputation is always on the line never forget that Like the saying goes Common Sense isnt so Common which means there are always going to be people who make you scratch your head and wonder Why on earth would you have said that Some people dont care about whether they get fired or not Some people believe that Free Speech will cover their butt but it may not when it comes to you job If you dont care about whether you get fired or not you likely dont need to work because your bank accounts are overflowing with cash Probably not which leads me to believe that people who say things they shouldnt on social media simply dont think before they speak whether in person or when hiding behind a computer screen Its not just social media like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Twitter Instagram Reddit and so on its anywhere on the web whether it be on a forum or even a blog post Once its out there its out there and if someone can see it you may get burned for it Whatever platform your venting your views on you may want to engage the brain before the mouth starts working Our world revolves around technology and its only bound to become stronger and much more powerful for the people Its and were well into the digital age where anything and everything you say on the web follows you Lets not forget that just about everywhere we go in public these days we are being filmed on camera If its not camera then someone has a smartphone or camera ready to video or take photos Our lives used to be private behind closed doors but not so much these days with social media photos we share comments and opinions Weve digitally invited people into our private world Its like leaving your front door unlocked all the time Can you really be fired for what you say and do outside of office hours You bet especially if you signed an employment contract which has terms and conditions including a code of conduct specifically a social media code of conduct That question was posed in a Globe Article written by Tony Wilson in Social Media Conduct Could Get You Fired and here was the answer With very few exceptions an employer can fire an employee for just about anything It just comes down to whether the employer owes the employee severance or if the employees conduct is so egregious the employer can dismiss the employee for cause with no severance at all If there is something you dont agree with when it comes to your company dont take to social media talk to your boss employer or HR first If you care about your place of employment or what you do for a living then watch what you say whether you are on or off the clock Most businesses use a company mission and code of conduct including social media which they expect every employee to follow The problem is most people let their mouths or fingertips in this case do the talking They dont think before they hit Tweet or Post and before you know it a social media laugh has gone viral right into the Human Resources department which lands on your bosses desk What if you are the boss and you get called out on social media You type something hateful or that is downright unacceptable especially from a business owner Well you wont get fired from being the CEO of your own company however dont jump to conclusions about that so fast Thats right the customers so if you think for one minute you are safe because you are the owner think again Word of mouth or social media in spreads like wildfire on Reddit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter being the most popular of the many available on the web When your customers stop spending money at your business and they will talk then you might as well close up shop and ask for forgiveness if thats even possible Id certainly make a public apology for what was said or done and face the consequences of your actions Even if you have a millions of dollars in the bank you better hope that you can stretch that money and take your lifestyle down a notch if you screw up your business because of what you say or do on social media Millions dont last that long if you like to flash the cash however billions might be a different story Look at what happened in when Mike Jeffries CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch said he markets to exclusive groups of people goodlooking sexy and skinny Sex sells and skinny people are sexy he said in a interview with Salon The puncture repair kit came out in the aftermath of motor mouth with a statement saying they will be adding a line of clothes for plus size women in Mike Jeffries also stepped down as CEO after the board of directors didnt exactly like what they saw On the exit of Jeffries the stock jumped Just yesterday yet another person was fired from their job because of something said on Social Media An Ontario College Professor Rick Coupland at the St Lawrence College was put on leave with pay pending a social media investigation in regards to his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account The investigation was prompted after a student complained about a comment on the professors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account It didnt take long to see his account deleted but that doesnt mean the complaint is no longer valid According to news reports the investigation has been completed and he no longer works for the College What did he do to be reprimanded so harshly He shared his homophobic thoughts in an open post on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for the world to see He commented with hate talk on an American post which depicted a Rainbow Flag being lifted in St Petersburg Florida It was a Breach of the schools code of conduct according to Spokeswomen Kelly Wiley for the College Yes he made his bed and now he has to face those consequences I read so many comments on social media about this College Professor and Freedom of Speech came up so many times Yes in Canada there is Freedom of Speech however there are expectations of common sense especially when you work in the public or private sector or anywhere for that matter So what did Rick say on social media that had him asking his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>friends to Pray for Me and My Job as he was called into the college by representatives He already knew he was in trouble and what he said cost him big time These are times where youd better have an emergency savings fund ready and something to tell the wife and kids you will be going home to with no income to pay for the family budget If youre single or dating someone you still have to live with the consequences too because you are the one who has to live with them Some people may not feel any remorse for what they say or do on social media until it comes down to losing their job because of it You see that Earth symbol next to the hrs under his name That means that the post is made Public which means everyone can see it and read it Now youve not only told your friends what you think youve told the entire world of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Well thats not our decision to make because we dont have his employment contract in front of us and we never will The only people who can make that decision are the people he dealt with at the College level Its no surprise though to see the consequences of his actions come to light That may or may not be a huge blow financially to Rick and he may never work in the school system again after this public verbal performance That one second of not thinking can follow you for the rest of your life Today I have tips for all you social media lovers out there that dont want to be next on the stands wondering if they will have a job to go to in the morning Listen Im not your boss Human Resources the union or anyone that works in employment law or even human rights etc so if you dont know the answer talk to one of them first Free Speech means you wont get your butt thrown in jail but common sense should be your first priority Your job may be potentially in jeopardy whether you say or do something during working hours or not online so be prepared if you get called in by Human Resources or your boss If they have concerns or someone has complained you may find yourself in the hot seat Im going to say times out of when you say something on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it will find a way to come back to you if it was something you shouldnt have said Remember You always represent the company you work for especially if your employment contract says so If you dont want to be the next person out of a job and splattered all over social media learn how to keep your mouth shut if you cant say anything nice at all That really is the only line you need to take away from this entire blog post if you value your career Its one thing to be opinionated but another to bash someone or a group of people online Once its on the web someone can capture it in an instant and if its a hot topic it wont take long before it goes viral Changing your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>status to Friends only or a specific group to target among your friends may help keep the nosey people out but thats about it All it takes is for you to say the wrong thing and even though someone may be your friend they may find it offensive especially if they work for the same company as you It may seem harsh to do but not having anyone you work with on your social media accounts which you can control might be a good idea You can make most social media account private such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Instagram or even Twitter where your tweets are protected Just because youre not at work doesnt mean it wont affect the people you work with or the organization Not everyone we accept on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are friends we interact with daily or have recently seen Some socalled friends are just being nosey and most people allow them to be on their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page just to have more friends on their list like its a popularity contest If you havent spoken or seen someone in a long time then consider letting them know you appreciate their friend request but are not interested or just leave it This tip still doesnt make it right or safe for you to say what you want but its your life do what you want Remember what I said earlier you suffer the consequences of your actions As for other social media such as Twitter once your public tweet is out there you can delete it but again it takes mere seconds to capture a tweet to share with the world If you are not aware whether your company has a social media conduct code or if you could get terminated because of social media Id recommend you to talk to your boss or Human Resources Every good company who cares about their employees will create a program to educate their staff about social media and what is and what is not acceptable Your employer can terminate you for just about anything if they have grounds to show you the door Trust me when I say they wont hesitate either unless they find your social media account has been hacked but that takes concrete evidence If your company does not educate you educate yourself There is more than enough information online to aid you but the best place to go is right to your employer for the answers If all else fails Think before you type Ultimately if you value your career keep thoughts you dont want the world to see off the web Even better dont use social media at all Free Speech is free which means you are free to use your voice but if the consequences end badly then you pay the price If you dont want people to talk about words youve shared then dont type it especially when your livelihood is on the line Check out my new Free Recipe Index If you like FREE then click this link
