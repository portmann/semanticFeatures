</span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class performance yield and more check out the ETF Hub ETF Hub FB has officially entered the mobile payments space via text However its not a service that will directly impact PayPal yet Instead WU investors should be most worried as FBs large user base and free service could lead to a deterioration of WUs business model very quickly Back in June of last year I suggested that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB was preparing to take the mobile payments industry by storm following a presentation by BlackBerrys NASDAQ BBRY CEO John Chen regarding its own messaging service Later I concluded that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would in fact use payments as a core product for Messenger and WhatsApp and that it could be the death of PayPal if targeted at the thousands of small to largesized businesses that already advertise on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>allowing merchants to sell directly to consumers on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>However now that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has officially added payment services to its messaging apps it is clear that I was way wrong about which company would be most affected by Facebooks payment presence Just to be clear no one knows exactly what Facebooks payment services will become In the past I have suggested that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>might become a payment processor like MasterCard NYSE MA maybe even a full blown bank and would certainly allow for the purchase and sale of goods through its platform But for the time being <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is only allowing users to send and receive money between friendsfamily by using its PC and mobile Messenger app which reportedly has million users For example a parent can now use their debit card to send money to children in college who can then retrieve those funds for use A person can send money to another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>user regardless of the reason just tap the icon and click Pay So this of course affects eBays NASDAQ EBAY PayPal as many of its millionplus users certainly use PayPal to transfer funds back and forth However the main purpose of PayPal is for paying and retrieving funds for the purchase and sale of goods Therefore Facebooks initial services with Messenger wont really affect PayPal all that much Instead this looks like a much bigger problem for Western Union NYSE WU whose core business is sending and receiving money between two people Admittedly I did not see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messengers entrance into payments being a problem for Western Union as I had originally thought it would be more so aimed at merchants to consumers and vice versa However Western Union could take a major hit from how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now plans to use Messenger And the reason is because of the number of people that use Messenger and the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is essentially offering the service for free whereas Western Union charges a steep fee based on the amount sent During the fourth quarter of last year over billion of Western Unions billion in revenue came from consumertoconsumer transactions This is a business that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is targeting directly with its Messenger payment services Moreover this is a business with an operating margin of which may not be sustainable now that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>allows users to send and receive money for free or a very small fee Lastly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is directly targeting the dotcom and mobile side of consumertoconsumer payments This is Western Unions fastest growing segment In fact it is one of the very few growth drivers that Western Union has within its business During the last quarter WesternUnioncoms revenue and transaction growth increased and respectively This is an area that could be significantly affected by Facebooks new service All things considered I was certainly wrong about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messengers payment services being an immediate threat to PayPal as that doesnt seem to be a nearterm goal for the company Also I completely missed the effect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger could have on Western Union However I was right that payments is in fact a part of Facebooks future and wont be surprised to see this service evolve in the coming quarters and years to where it becomes a meaningful part of the companys growth outlook While investors shouldnt expect any meaningful revenues or profits from Messenger in the immediate future it doesnt mean that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wont soon begin to charge higher fees once users become comfortable with the service At that point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could begin to charge a pertransaction fee like PayPal and Western Union and even expand with WhatsApp by allowing instant currency exchange via text due to WhatsApps large global user base In essence the skys the limit and thats something that should make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>investors very bullish long term Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger Is Now Equipped With Payments Where I Was Wrong Right And Way Off
