class='textDiv'>Starboard Says Cut Costs And Spin Off Yahoo Japan Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha Starboard put out another letter to Yahoo last week this one being over words The activist lays out various plans for shortterm fixes but theres still no clear path for longterm value creation Jeff Smith Starboard Value founder was busy last weekend Busy penning letters Last week he sent a letter to Staples NASDAQ SPLS and also found time to send a letter over to Marissa Mayer and Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO Its not a few paragraph letter saying Hey Marissa why not spinoff Yahoo Japan Its a plus word letter The key point is that Starboard isnt happy that Yahoos stock price has fallen after the announced spinoff of Alibaba NYSE BABA shares One thing that Starboard doesnt touch on is a merger with AOL NYSE AOL Thats a big hit to our thesis taking out a key backstop Putting two struggling businesses together and cutting overhead is a theme of Starboards think Staples and Office Depot The key is that Yahoo and AOL together would be more formidable foes against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL in the war for advertising dollars But back to Starboards gripes Its thesis involves spinning off Yahoo Japan cutting costs buying back shares and monetizing its real estate and intellectual property portfolio If Yahoo does everything Starboard wants the activist fund thinks that it could unlock per share in value or roughly upside to the current stock price But theres a lot to be done there And the Yahoo Japan spinoff or exploring of options wont come until the Alibaba spinoff later this year but lets focus on what Yahoo can get started on One interesting point is that Yahoo doesnt need to hold bn or so in cash rather it can return the majority up to bn to shareholders Assuming it isnt planning on wasting that cash on unfruitful acquisitions On a bn market cap thats fairly significant Cutting costs is another thing that seems logical where the idea is that Yahoo doesnt need the majority of its staff The company is bringing in less than k per employee in revenue while the likes of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is pulling in mm in revenue per employee Yet the fundamental issue is that cost cuts are a shortterm fix not a longterm one which would include a clearer plan for growing the stop line In early March we noted that we were playing wait and see with Yahoo This comes as theres no quick fix for its operating costs and monetizing Yahoo Japan will be more complicated than the Alibaba spinoff with Softbanks Masa Son having a say in the future Yahoo Japan Its core business is pulling down a billion a year in operating cash flow But the valuation story is well told Theres plenty of sum of the parts valuations out there that show that the market is valuing Yahoos core business at virtually We went through the analysis earlier this month on shorting Alibaba and going long Yahoo in a trade to capitalize on the markets inefficiency assuming theres some value still left in its core business Yet looking at the markets inefficiency another way is Alibaba grossly overvalued Valuing Yahoo Japan at bn and bn after tax assumed tax rate using its bn in cash and valuing its core business at bn all that yields a total value of bn With a bn market cap its Alibaba stake is worth just over a share Meaning that Alibabas theoretical value is billion or right at share In that case Alibaba is overvalued by or so Is that really so unreasonable At a share Alibaba would still be trading at x forward sales Theres ways to slice this Earlier this month we noted The handling of Yahoo Japan will prove tricky but it takes just a little to go right to make this an interesting story Masa Son is a dealmaker and will have a say in what happens to his Yahoo Japan even if it means buying the stake from Yahoo Yahoos core business while its debatable of the exact amount still has some value Yet Starboard appears to be reaching a bit in its recent letter trying to squeeze value from all places including IP portfolios and real estate Its not an easy fix at Yahoo Its unclear how it manages to grow the top line where we thought a merger with AOL would be the easiest avenue We dont see how cost cuts alone afford Yahoos core business a x EVEBITDA multiple as Starboard suggests We need some revenue growth to justify this And then theres the idea that perhaps Alibaba isnt the great ecommerce giant everyone thought If youre going to play the
