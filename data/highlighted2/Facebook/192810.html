Expensive content competition and the fact that Netflix is a data hog are major structural issues I was asked by a reader to evaluate Netflix NASDAQ NFLX Given my own intrigue about Netflix and its valuation this was the catalyst for me to research the company Similar to my recent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB piece the aim of this article is to help readers understand the bet they are making owning shares at I have no horse in the race and will not participate on the long or short side If effective this piece will synthesize and present the key drivers so investors are fully aware of the risks Wall Street is captivated by monthly subscriber revenue streams especially when they are growing nicely As long as Netflix can continue to grow its user base which is million as of June million US and million International then momentum crowd will probably continue to own shares Despite Netflixs lack of free cash flow and nosebleed valuation again Wall Street is myopically geared towards growth On the Q conference call sellside analysts continued to discuss Netflixs stated goal of achieving million global subscribers here is the transcript Mr Hastings repeatedly reiterated the goal of targeting to million new net subscribers per year It is well known that Netflixs affordable monthly pricing is one of the key reasons it has so many subscribers ASP growth is YoY but this was driven by a higher mix of premium subscribers Mr Hastings said the company will not get greedy and raise prices Clearly he knows that the lynchpin to Netflixs stock buoyancy is subscriber growth so he isnt going to gamble On the call he also said that the VAT tax and currency were headwinds Interestingly he talking about Hulus flop in Japan and how it was led by overly aggressive pricing leading to lack of traction These comments and competition limit Netflixs ability to raise prices This is definitely a negative and hurts the bulls longerterm thesis The key driver of Netflixs future success is really its ability to generate compelling original content Although this model is more capital intensive initially it is Netflixs mostimportant longerterm competitive advantage Netflix has done a much better job in this area and House of Cards was the key catalyst that helped Carl Icahn make X his money buying shares before the successful launch This new business model fundamentally shifted the way analysts viewed Netflix and it is clearly a barrier to entry if the company can continue to execute well on this front Mr Hastings indicated that the company is investing heavily and casting a wide net trying to appeal to all demographic ages by targeting different genres The Achilles heel to the Netflix story is twofold they dont own the broadband pipelines that stream their services the last mile is owned by the cable companies As we can see in the chart below Netflix is a broadband hog Even more so with its premium HD services which required mb per second to stream Although the consolidation by the likes of ATT NYSE T and DirectTV NASDAQ DTV as well as the proposed Time Warner Cable NYSE TWC and Charter NASDAQ CHTR deal offer the prospect of lower interconnection fees as concessions to winning the FCC approval if Netflix is using of internet bandwidth then there is always the risk that the Comcasts NASDAQ CMCSA of the world will want to get paid fairly for Netflixs high utilization of other companys broadband bandwidth capacity And secondly Netflixs content is very expensive Unlike other businesses that require massive upfront amounts of capital acting as a huge barrier to entry and knowhow with the longterm goal of then transforming into cash cows after buildout Netflix is constantly running on a neverending treadmill Besides its original content the company has to pay licensing fees for the content As discussed on the call other content owners are no longer interested in limiting themselves to multipleyear exclusives With Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Hulu the threat of cable more so in other countries and HBO Now content will become more expensive as there are more bidders As we can see Netflixs net income is nothing to write home about As they constantly have to invest in new content whether that be in the form of licensed or original the income statement is lumpy and a C report card Netflixs cash flow statement is a joke and as we can see they dont generate free cash flow even with million users The US streaming and DVD businesses are nice gross margin contributors However the International business isnt compelling from a financial standpoint as Netflix hasnt been able to gain the same economies of scale compared to the US and each country is nuanced and presents different challenges Perhaps rightly so Netflix is guarded with providing granular international performance Mr Hastings said that backing out currency and new VAT tax headwinds Netflixs pricing competitiveness is similar to its lowprice model in the US At per share I wouldnt touch Netflix with a tenfoot pole on the long side Given the persistent threats of expensive content the company doesnt own the broadband networks but are data hogs even more so with HD and premium services and increased competition from the likes of AMZN Hulu HBO Now and cable buying share at is super risky Netflixs billion enterprise value for a company that doesnt generate any free cash flow is a classic greater fool theory If investors are comfortable gambling their hardearned money pretending that the only thing that
