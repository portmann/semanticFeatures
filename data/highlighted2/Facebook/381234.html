class='textDiv'>Tencent Like Buying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>At A Bargain Tencent Holding Ltd ADR OTCMKTSTCEHY Seeking Alpha Tencent is growing revenue and earnings at strong doubledigit rates The stock held up well in the face of the selloff in Chinas stock market The picture of the plants above represents Tencent Holdings OTCPKTCEHY OTCPKTCTZD growth I like to use plants as an analogy for growth especially as I get my hands dirty in the spring pulling weeds from my flowerbeds while admiring the beauty of the blooming tulips Tencent is a company that has the potential to grow from a small plant into a large sturdy tree over time Tencents strong doubledigit revenue and earnings growth is likely to drive the stock to grow at market outperforming doubledigit rates Tencent is significantly undervalued as compared to more wellknown social media companies However I think that this will change over time as the company continues its growth and gains more widespread exposure Tencent represents a beautiful plant among the many weeds in the investment world in my opinion Tencents acquisition of Riot Games gave the company a strong boost for its online games segment Riot Games produces the popular League of Legends game which has over million monthly active users The company has a way of encouraging user engagement and having users pay with ingame promotions Tencent has a variety of games in this segment including shooter games adventure roleplaying puzzles etc The company also has a good pipeline of games in development which will enable Tencent to continue its online game growth when they are released The important thing is that the company is achieving strong doubledigit revenue growth from this segment which comprises more than half of Tencents total revenue In social networks Tencents WeChat had about million monthly active users as of November The monthly active users have grown steadily from under million in the beginning of WeChat is more than just a messaging app The company has been focusing on the needs of its many users As a result WeChat has millions of lightweight apps within its main app The lightweight apps within WeChat allow users to order food for delivery play games summon a taxi check in for a flight order movie tickets schedule doctors appointments etc One key element that enhances WeChat usage is the WeChat Wallet feature which enables users to quickly send payments to companies or people The revenue driver of the social networks segment is from digital content subscription services virtual item sales and from QQ memberships As WeChat users continue to increase the revenue generated from these services is also likely to increase Tencent has a knack for getting customers to pay for virtual goods such as online stickers gaming avatars and other icons Tencent is also a key provider of premium content such as video music and literature I expect the Social Network segment to do well going forward as users continue to find value in the companys numerous offerings Tencents online advertising segment is gaining growth from Qzone WeChat accounts and from WeChat Moments Qzones social networking features allows user to write blogs listen to music watch videos and send photos So it is somewhat similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB which is a successful advertising business that I expect to perform well Just as advertisers seek out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to place ads I also think Qzone will continue to be sought after as a popular medium for ad placement Qzone has over million monthly active users So it is likely to continue to attract advertisers to the site WeChat Moments is pricier for advertisers than Qzone Qzone has a cost per views CPM of to RMB while Moments ranges from to RMB However Moments advertising is considered more conducive for wellknown brands with visually attractive products Since wellknown established companies have more money to spend on advertising campaigns Tencent stands to benefit from this visually appealing form of ads which appears within the newsfeeds Established companies such as Coca Cola NYSE KO and Daimler AGs OTCPKDDAIF Mercedes Benz are already advertising on Moments So I see Moments as a good driver of growth going forward as big names continue to utilize this advertising platform Tencents stock thrived in the face of the Chinese market selloff Tencent is being compared to Deutsche XTrackers Harvest ETF NYSEARCA ASHR which seeks to track the performance of the China AShare market This shows that the company is a strong rock and less risky than the average Chinabased company If the company thrives during a sharp selloff then imagine how it will perform during a bullmarket Tencent doesnt get the same media attention as a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does in the investing world As a result Tencent is trading at only X and X expected earnings for and respectively Compare that to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which is trading at X and X expected earnings for and respectively Tencent has strong expected doubledigit earnings growth that averages to annually over the next two years which is in the same range as Facebooks expected annual growth over the same period <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a better track record of exceeding its earnings estimates over the past year while Tencent missed estimates in its past two quarters So that is a likely a factor for Tencents lower valuation The larger factor for Tencents lower valuation in my opinion is that the company is just not as wellknown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in the investment world Tencent may not be as trusted as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>since it operates in China I think that investors could be overlooking Tencent as just another risky Chinabased company I dont think Tencent is as risky as most Chinabased companies The company has proven itself with a growing visible business Gamers Qzone users and WeChat users can witness how many others are on those platforms during their social interactions If the advertising for these platforms wasnt working then those companies would pull out However the evidence from recent earnings reports shows that advertising is Tencents fastestgrowing revenue stream I understand certain investors will stay away from buying stock in Chinabased companies That may come from a lack of trust and a patriotic philosophy of only buying stocks based in the United States However I think that such an investing mind frame is the main factor that is keeping Tencents valuation at bargain levels If Tencent was trading with Facebooks valuation the stock would be instead of the current price of I dont think that Tencent will reach the same valuation level as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>However I do think that Tencent has plenty of room for PE expansion since it trades with just a singledigit PE At the very least I would expect the stock to increase approximately inline with earnings growth I think it would also be reasonable to add annual growth to take some PE expansion into account Therefore it would be reasonable in my opinion for the stock to gain to annually over the next two years I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other
