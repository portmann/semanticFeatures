advice or should Apple be looking at Amex for inspiration Apple needs to go beyond product line extensions and channel its inner Steve Jobs to keep from becoming the Amex of the tech world in years time On Sunday we all watched as two of the NFLs crown jewels battled it out for a chance at Super Bowl Manning and Brady did not disappoint unless you are a Pats fan In which case youre pretty bummed out Which I am and I am Oh well theres always next season As earnings season hits its stride we all watch as tech and financial services players take the field too battling it out for the affections of analysts and investors whose expectations become the basis for stock prices and market caps and often their own fair share of bummed out fans One of those segments crown jewels American Express NYSE AXP took the field last week and Apple NASDAQ AAPL will this week Both have sterling global brands incredible assets and seemingly untouchable positions of leadership in their categories Yet each had performances that didnt deliver as planned setting themselves up for a challenging and questions about the future of their respective franchises So should Amex be looking to Apple for advice or should Apple be looking at Amex for inspiration Sounds like a couple of crazy questions But read on and Ill tell you why it might not be as crazy as it sounds You know things are bad when the CEO himself starts an earnings call by confirming the analysts worst fears that the shortterm view is pretty bleak Let me acknowledge that the performance were discussing today is not what we or you are accustomed to from American Express and that we are taking significant actions to change the trajectory of our business going forward During our remarks well address three main questions Why has our view of and changed What are we doing about it Why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to longterm Thats Ken Chenault last week at the start of Amexs Q earnings call And a far cry from the way that earnings calls had gone for him and investors for the better part of the last two decades Amex hasnt been the biggest card network of the four for a long long time but its the oldest established in its card network was started in almost a decade before MasterCard NYSE MA and Visa NYSE V and it is an iconic global brand that has captured the minds and wallet share of the most affluent consumers in the world It all but owns the corporate travel market and is regarded as the gold standard for rewards rewards funded by its oftencontested merchant discount fees and informed by its unique position as a threeparty network which gives it the data needed to devise rich and relevant offers to its cardholders But when the markets closed on Friday Amexs market cap was billion or nearly half of what it was a year ago The loss of the Costco NASDAQ COST relationship was the start of the downward spiral offering some insight into Amexs challenging economics as a card brand That was followed by the loss of other important cobranded relationships like Jet Blue NASDAQ JBLU For sure Amex had a number of problems that were brewing before the downward slide But perhaps most revealing over the course of last year was the recognition that for all of its many brand assets Amex had whiffed on some of the biggest trends in payments and commerce Take mobile for example While everyone else was busy devising strategies for digital devices and a world in which consumers were transacting online Amex seemed unconcerned happy enough watching the revenue line fueled by its rich merchant discount fees swell Amexs Mobile Strategy Is Largely Nowhere Then while debit cards exploded in the US Amex was pretty much stuck with its credit and charge cards making it overall a lot smaller than its rival networks Visa and MasterCard Serve its GPR product which Ill get to later was clearly not going to make up that lost ground or appeal to a mainstream debit consumer Amex also had trouble getting banks to issue its card products It has been slogging along since the mids outside the US and since the early s in the US to do that after it got the Justice Department to force MasterCard and Visa to end their bank exclusives The reality is that it hasnt made much progress anywhere and one of the few relationships it did strike Fidelity through Bank of America NYSE BAC went to Visa earlier this month A judge ruled that it was OK for merchants that signed contracts to accept Amex cards to encourage consumers to then go use another aka cheaper method of payment That could give the merchants more power to demand Amex cut their fees possibly taking a big chunk of volume for Amex since most people actually carry multiple cards in their wallets especially the wellheeled customer base that is Amexs bread and butter Personally I think the judges decision is wrong and hope the nd Circuit Court of Appeals reverses the judge which they just may In the category of missed opportunities Amex also failed to put enough emphasis on what could have been one of its biggest areas of opportunity BB payments It failed to do what Discover NYSE DFS did with SAP NYSE SAP AribaPay and leverage its network to enable payments between businesses especially the small businesses that Amex has openly courted through its OPEN program Chenault himself said on the earnings call that of the trillion spend by SMBs in only percent was spent using plastic cards at the same time calling out Amex as the market leader in small business So Amex said last week that it would spend the better part of more or less shrinking its way to greatness slashing billion in costs and shuttering the things that dont work One of those things is its enterprise growth group once thought to be the forwardlooking lab focused on the digital products that would define the future of the brand An Amex spokeswoman said last week that within the enterprise growth business there are some things that worked and some things that didnt while emphasizing that its focus on prepaid remains intact That focus is wrapped up in the companys flagship product Serve which analysts say is a profitless product struggling to find its footing in the GPR market serving a client base that is largely unprofitable GPR is a product that as a category has largely struggled to find a profitable path to growth anywhere Its also one thats at serious risk of being pummeled into oblivion depending on how the CFPBs muchawaited ruling on prepaid nets out The icing on the cake though was the report late Friday that ValueAct has exited its position in Amex ValueAct is the activist investor that took a billion percent interest in Amex last year Those with knowledge of the matter say its exit is because Jeff Ubben ValueActs CEO and Warren Buffett Amex and Chenaults staunchest advocate and large investor butted heads on whats needed to move the company forward which ValueAct reportedly said included the exiting of Chenault and possible breakup of the company A strategy that I advocated last year when it was announced ValueAct had taken an investment in the company Buffett obviously disagrees despite the drag that Amex had to have created on his portfolio last year Its first hundred years saw its transformation from express mail business to travelers cheque company to charge card for the wellheeled three reinventions in more than years is pretty amazing Its also hit the ropes a number of times always to bounce back Back in the mids when Visa and MasterCard started honing in on its territory with credit not charge products Lou Gerstner reinvigorated the brand by revving up marketing expanding acceptance enriching its rewards programs and adding to its card portfolio to include its Gold and Platinum brands Gerstner was the brains behind the branding and the commercials everyone knows well American Express the exclusive club Membership has its Privileges Dont Leave Home Without It That helped Gerstner grow card membership by nearly x in the years he ran the place A Positioning And A Strategy That Has Changed Very Little Since Then A little more than two and a half decades later Amex needs another turnaround act and quite possibly a turnaround artist to execute it Maybe it should look to Apple one of the worlds most powerful tech brands which has also had its fair share of turnarounds for inspiration and guidance There are some awfully good people there and there is tremendous brand loyalty to that company I think the way out is not to slash and burn its to innovate The year was and the person speaking those words was Steve Jobs Apple Computer as it was known at the time was collapsing Its price per share was half what it was seven years earlier and its market cap was on a steep downward spiral Jobs who was forced out of the company he founded in rejoined the company in as a result of Apples purchase of the NeXT computer franchise Jobs founded in when he left Jobs comeback was anchored in a vision that has been the companys North Star ever since people would carry computers in their pockets instead of being tethered to them at their desks And those devices would offer access to content that would create a dependency on those devices devices that would be beautifully designed and simple to use The introduction of the iPod in was the first glimpse that the world would see of the execution of that vision It brought music stores right into the hands and the ears of iPod users The tough dealdriving that went along with it would define Apples position with content producers and partners too For the better part of the next decade if you wanted to play ball with Apple you did business their way And given their power and the consumer love affair with the brand everyone did The introduction of the iPhone in and the iPad in further reinforced the wisdom of Jobs vision Apples stance as tough negotiator and ultimately Apples enviable spot at the intersection of tech mobility and content That business model elegantly designed products that consumers want are willing to pay handsomely for and use to access apps has sustained Apples massive sales numbers and market valuation over the last years iPhone sales drive percent of Apples revenue When Jobs took over in Apples market cap was billion In February it was billion And the chatter then was that Apple was likely to be the worlds first trillion market cap company Yet ahead of this weeks muchanticipated Apples earnings now two decades later the chatter is focused on whether Apples greatest days are behind them Apples market cap on Friday was billion off billion from where it was one year ago iPhone sales are down overall despite a healthy holiday sales season And analysts have raised further concerns that the sales of Apples shining star the iPhone have not only declined but will continue to slump through March of iPad sales have slowed too for reasons that arent entirely clear some attribute it to the increase in sales of the iPhone Plus and consumers who feel they no longer need a tablet Still questions remain Also in the question mark category is the Apple Watch Apple uncharacteristically discounted Apple Watches presumably in an effort to juice sales But despite vague references that Tim Cook reasons as keeping his competitors in the dark no one really knows how sales have gone One analyst who has kept track of analyst forecasts since its launch concludes that sales are off percent from initial estimates Apple TV has been put on pause owing to its lack of success in negotiating content deals with programmers Apples iTunes download business has been collapsing as consumer preferences for music and video consumption move to streaming That resulted in it buying Beats for a massive amount of money and launching a Spotify killer Maybe theres hope here Apple Music is said to be up to million paid subscribers which means it is catching up to Spotify But then again the fact that Apples dominance in digital was put on the ropes by a startup from Sweden is kind of amazing It was also reported on Friday that year company veteran and Apples driver of electric car project was leaving for personal reasons Apples car project Titan had a ship date of which could now be in question Speaking of cars car manufacturers appear to be closing ranks around their own connected car software platforms that dont include Apple or Google for that matter out of fear of turning their cars over to Apple Despite Apples public statements about being pleased with where they are with its mobile wallet Apple Pay has to be a huge disappointment for Apple It was the centerpiece of the iPhone launch and was clearly expected to be the killer app that would drive sales of the phone Our quarterly study on the adoption and usage of Apple Pay shows that only percent of iPhone S users bought their phone to have access to the digital wallet Usage is anemic at roughly percent of all iPhone S users who are in a store that is equipped to accept it When you break all that down that means that Apple Pay now some months into its highly acclaimed launch drives something like percent of retail sales For those of you whove read any of my writings on this you know that Apples Apple Pay predicament is the result of its lack of understanding about how to ignite a platform in a complicated business like payments Its business model sell more phones imposed constraints on the consumer side by forcing usage from a new device that people had to go out and buy To work those phones required merchant hardware that most didnt have And in true Apple style Apple forced issuers into contracts that required a fee to be paid on each transaction and marketing commitments to popularize it it was rumored in the millions of dollars Its been reported that Apple Pays focus now is on expanding the utility of an app that isnt used much for paying for items in a physical store and acquiring new users And its seeking partnerships with banks to enable PP to do that partnerships that Ive written banks would be crazy to entertain given Apples history of playing nice before they dont Just ask ATT how that has gone for them and not exactly delivering on their initial Apple Pay expectations But whats clear is that at least from where I sit today in January of Apple needs partners across all dimensions of its business more than those partners may in fact need it Ironically one of the partnerships that may not entirely fit that definition is Amex a partnership that Apple has struck in its ambition to make Apple Pay a global brand Apple Pays transaction revenue tax has turned off most issuers who dont want to pay the tariff and in countries where interchange is regulated would require giving away what little profit they have on those transactions Amex as a threeparty system is exempt from those regulations Yet even with that the Apple PayAmex combo doesnt seem all that promising since Amex has a small share of card use outside of the US isnt widely accepted and well as Ive just laid out is struggling itself But like Amex its the vision and strategy put in place more than a decade ago by Steve Jobs that has carried Apple thus far while perhaps masking some the larger and more endemic issues that are now starting to surface for the company Apple is as dependent on the success of the iPhone to drive its future as Amex is on merchant discount fees Dependencies that now put both players at risk One of the reasons that Apples iPhone sales are slumping is that consumers arent upgrading their phones as often as they once did Theres nothing wow enough about the device to get consumers outside of its hardcore fan boys to make the upgrade worthwhile Thats part of the reason its looking to the enterprise and a partnership with IBM of all players to drive new hardware sales and stimulate the development of apps to satisfy the corporate user They also lack no real killer app to drive demand for those phones So in the meantime Apple is banking on iPhone users sticking with it because the pain that would be caused by losing access to its app store is a cost too high for consumers to pay to make the switch But thats what Blackberry NASDAQ BBRY thought too Its dominance as a mobile computer with an amazingly easy to use keyboard in the end wasnt enough to keep users in the Blackberry boat once they saw what life was like with a device that offered them access to apps and an app store Blackberry didnt realize it had missed that boat until its own was sinking Phones are nothing more than access devices to apps apps that are increasingly becoming available across platforms and even embedded inside of other apps that provide contextual access independent of a specific device or operating system Uber Private UBER can now be accessed across most operating systems and increasingly inside other apps eg <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Messenger and OpenTable Amazon NASDAQ AMZN takes it one step further and can enable ordering and payment inside of any device linked to the ever expanding voiceactivated Alexa ecosystem The more apps proliferate across the many connected devices that enable access to the Internet the more vulnerable Apple and its dependency on the iPhone becomes Now it helps to put things in perspective Apple is an incredibly valuable company It has the most successful mobile app platform and accounts for much for of the app revenue and app use than Android or anyone else And with more than a half a trillion dollar market cap its not like these guys are on deaths door But like Amex Apple might have gotten a little too comfortable living in the draft of a vision put in place many years before by a man whose one more thing was an entirely new way for how the world would access and consume content And by a business model that more or less minted money so long as that vision was relevant and distinctive Apple needs to go beyond product line extensions and channel its inner Steve Jobs to keep from becoming the Amex of the tech world in years time a powerful global brand in free fall struggling to find its next act As for Amex I think its got a much tougher path forward to avoid being the financial industrys Westinghouse a valuable brand with a deep history that couldnt anticipate the future and execute on that vision Its assets are amazingly valuable but it will take both slashing and burning and innovation to turn it around The big question will be whether it has the stomach to do that on its own </div></body></html>
