Ways Zuckerberg Attracts And Keeps Talent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>recently poached Regina Dugan from Google where she headed their Advanced Technology and Products Group <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has demonstrated it can attract and retain talent Its executive team has remained largely intact since its beginnings In lieu of the high profile hire of Regina Dugan its relevant to highlight one of Facebooks NASDAQ FB hidden competitive advantages its ability to attract and retain talent Dugans hire is of importance since she was an executive at Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL reportedly one of the best companies in the world to work for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has consistently attracted top talent and has held on to many of its early employees that helped shape the company into what it is today Mark Zuckerberg has created a corporate climate that employees seem to thoroughly enjoy which is essential to reducing turnover A report by Payscale discovered that of Facebooks employees report high job satisfaction Its CEO is its Chief Recruiter This factor is magnified by the celebrity status of Mark Zuckerberg its founder and CEO Compare this with CocaCola NYSE KO one of the most recognized brands in the entire world Despite its global brand power Im willing to wager that an overwhelming proportion of the population would be unable to name its current CEO On the other hand Zuckerberg is a household name and a visionary He also doesnt have a college degree and hes been disrupting the market continuously for the last decade In short hes the tech equivalent of a rock star Zuckerberg applies a handson approach to recruiting his top talent and it has paid off immensely He also employs the strategy of acquihiring which is acquiring a company in part to gain the employees and their talent He has done this with Palmer Luckey of Oculus Rift and Andrew Anker of Tugboat Yards Tugboat Yards closed shop once acquired so its employees could apply their expertise to initiatives within Facebooks platform More Than Just a Cash Machine Zuckerberg has made it explicitly clear that the goal of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is to connect people He lists the Connectivity Labs as one of his top three priorities for This department is responsible for Intenretorg a program dedicated to providing internet access to impoverished areas As a result million people have been brought online thus far by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Internet access has been shown to improve economic conditions and education so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>employees can know that their work is having a positive impact In addition to increased internet access the social media giant is also working to by developing artificial intelligence to help blind people experience photos on Facebooks newsfeed Lastly Facebooks safety check feature has been utilized to keep families connected and informed about their loved ones Throughout its business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is finding ways to incorporate positive social initiatives into its overall strategy The current and incoming workforce are socially conscious and this will be increasingly important in attracting talent It Respects its Employees <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>knows that its employees are people and it treats them as such It is especially forward thinking in terms of maternity AND paternity leave allotting four months off for such an occasion While its true that other tech companies offer maternity and some paternity leave it may be just a PR stunt and unrealistic in practice For example there are reports that an Amazon NASDAQ AMZN employee was effectively forced out following her maternity leave and cancer diagnosis Zuckerberg has eradicated any thought of punishment for maternitypaternity leave by taking paternity leave himself after the birth of his first child As the CEO he is consistently setting the bar on how employees should be cared for by setting an example of himself Overall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has received a rating of on Glassdoor when it comes to general benefits This ranking is higher than both Twitter NYSE TWTR and Google As a result of the work environment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the least stressed most satisfied employees in the tech industry as demonstrated in the chart below Flexibility For being a massive multinational company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has demonstrated that it is still incredibly flexible with its employees Because it places such a significant value on talent it is willing to work with those it wants to hire or are already employed For example Zuckerberg wanted to hire Yann LeCun to run his Artificial Intelligence division but LeCun did not want to leave his post at NYU Zuckerberg offered to let LeCun set up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>AI Researchs headquarters in Manhattan and retain his professorship on the side Once this was communicated LeCun agreed to come on board with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The Pay When considering job incentives all employees take into consideration their salary According to a recent report <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ranks as the th highest paying company in the world Its median compensation package for its average worker is a year This ranks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>above LinkedIn NYSE LNKD Adobe NASDAQ ADBE Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and Salesforcecom NYSE CRM to name a few <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is also generous to its interns ensuring that its farmsystem of talent will remain exceptionally strong According to Glassdoor interns at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>make a month depending on what their role is By this measure the average intern makes well above the average US citizen When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>went public one of the main concerns was that the social media company could meet the same fate of its predecessor MySpace To survive and thrive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>needs to be constantly innovating and creating new products and services While Dugans new position at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still unclear she will be leading a new group called Building that will focus on creating hardware products related to Facebooks mission to connect the world As a former head of a few of Googles moonshots projects investors can expect to see interesting developments coming out of Dugans department <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>plans on investing hundreds of millions of dollars into this group further promoting the notion that this group will become a key component of Facebooks business If executed properly Dugans Building could develop products that will
