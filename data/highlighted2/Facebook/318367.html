class='textDiv'>As An Alternative To FANG Stocks Consider DAVF Instead Seeking Alpha Out of the FANG stocks I like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the best Disney Apple and Visa comprise the other three stocks in DAVF I expect DAVF to perform well over the long term especially when the market turns around Buying a collection of growth stocks can act as a portfolio catalyst I wouldnt recommend owning only four stocks However a small collection of growth stocks can be a part of an investors portfolio to help boost overall gains Of the FANG stocks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and Alphabet Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL I avoid Amazon and Netflix because of their lofty valuations I see nothing wrong with GOOG but I choose to own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as my advertisingrelated investment because of the companys stronger expected earnings growth over the next few years according to consensus I see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in a stronger growth phase than Alphabet Therefore I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to outperform Alphabet over the next few years Disney NYSE DIS Apple NASDAQ AAPL and Visa NYSE V are some of my other favorite investments that comprise my FANG alternative known as DAVF The DAVF collection of stocks are not my only holdings and I am not implying that investors should only own these companies without further diversification What I am saying is that Disney Apple Visa and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>represent attractive growth at a reasonable price after the recent market selloff I also think that these four represent a viable alternative to owning the FANG stocks with the exception of keeping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I avoided Netflix because it trades at X expected earnings consensus and X expected earnings Netflix also operates with negative operating cash flow The negative cash flow is an issue because the company will need to add to debt or do a secondary stock offering to continue its global expansion That is not an attractive position for a stock to be in More debt will weaken the balance sheet and a stock offering would dilute the shares thus putting downward pressure on the stock price I look for growth at a reasonable price and companies that have positive operating and free cash flow and Netflix just doesnt fit the bill Amazon also has a lofty valuation as it trades at X expected earnings consensus and at X expected earnings Amazon does produce positive operating and free cash flow However the stock is priced too high in relation to earnings to fit my criteria of growth at a reasonable price Frankly I think that the fears over losing ESPN customers are overstated for Disney I acknowledge that cable cordcutting does lead to fewer ESPN subscribers However I dont think that the majority of cable customers are going to cancel their service As stated in Disneys Q conference call of Americans with a multichannel bundle watched sports and of those viewers watched ESPN content Another key statistic is that four out of five adults in the US connect with ESPN on some platform every month Therefore I think that the fears about the loss of ESPN subscribers will not significantly hurt the company over the long term Granted some millennials dont choose to buy cable packages but I think that many of them will as they begin to earn more as their careers advance especially for those who are sports fans Disney did achieve revenue growth in each segment in its Q results Revenue increased in the Media segment where ESPN is included ESPN advertising revenue increased in Q CEO Bob Iger said that there was an uptick in ESPN subscribers in Q Sports fans can get ESPN on alternatives to standard cable services such as Sling TV So millennials and other cord cutters who are sports fans are likely to get their exposure to ESPN in some form Disneys other segments Parks and Recreation Studio Entertainment Consumer ProductsInteractive Media are all continuing to grow Ultimately I think that the stock will perform well over the long term The stocks valuation has become attractive due to the recent market selloff With a forward PE of Disney is now trading below the SP which is trading at X next years expected earnings Furthermore Disney is now trading with an EVEBITDA of just which was about where the stock was trading about three years ago I expect Disneys stock to outperform as the company is expected to grow earnings at high single to low doubledigit rates over the next few years At the same time the SP is only expected to grow earnings at about annually Apple is a company that some people are giving up on because of slowing revenue growth Last year was a big upgrade cycle for iPhones with the S Plus and S Plus models Many consumers upgraded to the larger sized iPhones since the and Plus models debuted in late Consumer enthusiasm for the larger iPhones led to record sales of billion for Apples fiscal year ending in just for the iPhone segment The fiscal sales were higher than fiscal sales After such a large leap it should be no surprise that Apple will take a breather this year and experience a to decline in total revenue according to consensus Lower sales for the current fiscal year doesnt mean that Apple is finished as a longterm investment The news of lower sales is already priced into the stock in my opinion The stock is trading at only X expected sales and X expected sales This is significantly below Apples fiveyear average PE of The catalyst for higher sales for the iPhone is likely to be the iPhone which is likely to be released in the fall of Therefore most of the sales for the new model will be reflected in fiscal Although some of the specs for the new model arent official yet the MacRumorscom website states that the iPhone will have a thinner design no headphone jack corded headphones will use the lightning jack and wireless headphones can connect via Bluetooth two screen sizes a duallens camera for the Plus offering DSLRlike image quality w X optical zoom and an upgraded processor It also could be made out of a new composite material which is more water resistant The smartphone still remains most consumers portable computercameraGPSmusic playerphoneetc all in one device The iPhone remains a popular choice as evident in FY sales Older models that are still being used such as the C and S will eventually need to be upgraded Therefore the iPhone and Plus will provide loyal Apple consumers with an improved product to upgrade to Even with a slight decline in sales for FY Apple will still produce billions in free cash flow The free cash flow is used for share repurchases and to pay the dividend With the stock priced at a discount I would expect Apple to continue its stock repurchasing which will make existing shares more valuable over the longterm by reducing share dilution Therefore by owning Apple shareholders are paid a dividend while they wait for the stock to go back in favor The company is an innovator so I think that the stock will be back in favor later this year when Apple officially announces the features for the new iPhone model I expect Apple to continue to offer consumers improved innovative products going forward Visa is a steady growth stock for the long term I like it because the company acts as a common denominator in the economy It doesnt matter what is selling in the economy it just matters that there is strong sales volume and that consumers are using Visa debit and credit cards for their transactions Visa collects its fees every time its cards are used Visa gets involved with new technology as well For example Apple Pay uses Visa account information for convenient shopping with an iPhone Another example of Visa utilizing new technology is Square NYSE SQ which allows credit cards to be swiped and accepted using smartphones Interestingly Visa has been purchasing shares of Square However Visas plans for its stake in Square have not been disclosed Perhaps Visa is interested in acquiring Square Visa tends to trade at a premium to the SP as evident in its forward PE of compared to the SP s current forward PE of However Visa consistently achieves above average earnings growth over the long term Therefore a premium valuation is justified The trailing PE of is below Visas fiveyear average PE of So I think the stock is ripe for the picking after the recent pullback Consensus estimates are calling for Visa to average to earnings growth annually over the next five years I expect the stock to continue to outperform the SP as Visa achieves its above average growth Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>trades at a premium to the market with a forward PE of based on expected earnings the PEG of just under one shows that the stock is valued attractively in terms of its longterm expected annual earnings growth of over Facebooks valuation is much more attractive than Netflixs and Amazons Mark Zuckerberg previously stated that US users spend an average of minutes on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>per day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now has over billion daily active users which is a mouthwatering amount of eyeballs for advertisers especially since many of the users are engaged on the site for significant lengths of time This is why I like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>over Alphabet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users are more likely to spend significantly more time on the site as compared to those doing web searches That makes Facebooks advertising potential much more attractive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also has other future sources of revenue The Oculus Rift is now available for preordering While the Rift will initially be for gaming there is a long list of potential uses for this virtual reality headset Some potential uses are surgery drivingflying simulations virtual vacations PSTDanxiety treatment education movie viewing exercise viewing etc There also is the future monetization of WhatsApp to act as a future source of revenue for the company My DAVF collection of stocks is an alternative growth collection to the FANG stocks By keeping <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and replacing the other three Im investing in reasonably priced growth stocks that are likely to outperform the market over the long term driven by above average earnings growth Im more comfortable eliminating the highly valued Amazon and Netflix Im also more comfortable owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a higher growth advertising related stock over Alphabet I would recommend that the DAVF stock collection can be a part of a larger diversified portfolio If you like my analysis click on
