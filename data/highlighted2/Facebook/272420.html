class='textDiv'>The Downside Of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Notify is presenting itself as unpopular and lacking a value add component A continued lack of monetization is frustrating as the company tries to perfect WhatsApp and Messenger We can only speculate so far on Marc Andreessens recent selling of of his shares in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB If you were look at this company on January you saw the stock struggling around the level with no clear future direction Had you taken a gamble and bet on the company surpassing even its own expectations you wouldve seen the stock perform exceptionally YTD up some The question is as we move through Q and into are we sitting on the small plateau of another strong month trend Id argue yes and you can view my bullish cases here and here However I believe there are certain things significantly holding the company from reaching its true potential Despite Facebooks allaround tremendous growth in the last few years visible in both the top and bottom lines as well as improved cash flows the company has begun to set a high bar for itself For example Its going to be difficult for the analyst community to gauge how these numbers begin to level off The speculation will draw to a viable range but even then the company could miss wide or surpass for a few more quarters If the latter is the case well likely see a run up in the stock like we saw this year However if we see the former we have a situation like whats going on at Apple NASDAQ AAPL Despite the company still on track to sell tens of millions the growth is beginning to level off Herein lies a caveat While the stock will retreat on decreased growth versus comps the stock will find its fair value to be much lower The company will face easier comps the year prior and averaging into a position at that lower level will be lucrative for the quarters following Its an expectation game and I believe Facebooks numbers are beginning to top out increasing the likelihood of earnings misses this upcoming year As each quarter goes by what does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>miss out on in terms of ad revenue from WhatsApp and Messenger Well lets try and think of this in terms of what Instagram generates in revenue per year Instagram has million MAUs and climbing and is on track to do million in ad revenue this year If we scaled those to WhatsApp and Messenger having million and million MAUs respectively the company is missing out on billion and billion respectively in annual revenue Thats substantial and they need to recover the billion price tag of WhatsApp which has been the subject of much criticism Additionally Instagram is projected to increase revenue from ads by x next year to billion Thats a multiple that could be presently applied to both WhatsApp and Messenger but instead Zuckerberg has made it clear that until these products are refined to the maximum ad revenue will be on the back burner <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is concerned that if they try and monetize these apps too soon while theyre still growing at a high rate that users will withdraw If we think about the companys game plan after the Q report management stated that they wanted to get people organically interacting with businesses before you let companies pay to reach customers The fact of the matter is that the timeline has to be sped up before shareholders become too dissatisfied Monetizing these two apps is a challenge as they are textfocused applications Thus thats where businesses come in and Zuckerbergs push for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to be an ecommerce oneclick buy hub comes in to play Businesses will be able to contact individual shoppers directly send extensive messages about new products much like an email offering but with the wellcurated benefit of push notifications and more personalization If you go onto the App Store the th review on Facebooks new news application Notify is Whats the point of this app Its not even in the top downloaded free apps You can see for yourself in just a quick tap or view the trend here Ventures like this question whether or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trying to diversify too quickly While Ive made it known that I like the growth potential in the diversification into the product space via the Oculus Rift Im not so keen on Notify Yes its a chance for the company to rival Twitter NYSE TWTR and arguably diminishes Twitters valueadd component if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can reinvent the platform so quick but I dont think this app is the next big thing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is looking for Further complaints show that it uses up too much data and that the news sources it has contracted are incredibly limited in scope Thus Twitter still remains a better source for quick news as virtually every major networksource has its own page with realtime updates Furthermore the app attempts to take on Apple News which is already directly integrated with every new iPhone model Trying to adopt a following amid heavy competition is a challenge all its own The app is currently not available for Android devices which limits its user base And who knows maybe the app would have more success on that platform as Apple News isnt present there Furthermore users are currently complaining about location services and continual prompts on Apple devices so a bug fix could certainly tune the product We currently do not have any figures on how many downloads the app has received and likely wont until the Q earnings call The development costs could be better spent speeding up the perfection process for the WhatsApp and Messenger platforms Notify could likely turn into another scenario where shareholders are disappointed that an app isnt monetized Were really seeing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>having a hard time gaining a clear trend line and breaking the level since the Q earnings report This company is well past its and DMAs is close to perfectly neutral on the RSI is seeing lower more stable volumes and really has a solid technical basis to pop up Below you can see the some of the more flat trends and as an added focus take a look at the October to November run up and just how substantial that growth period was The stagnation post earnings is really what makes me questions this stocks ability especially if in a future quarter the company fails to live up to expectations In terms of other downward catalysts one could argue that the lack of transparency on their expansion into Africa is concerning after all the word Africa is only mentioned once on their Q Q and that the tech premium that places the stock at a PE of is a target for when the broader market begins to experience a downturn I will be covering these concerns in Part II All downside considered Im long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>because I believe in management the core product the growth initiatives in other areas like Oculus and a continued emphasis on innovation We only use your contact details to
