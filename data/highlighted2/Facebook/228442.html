photos down from and respectively in the same period a year earlier onwsjcomQBQyg Messaging will blow past social networks as the dominant media activity readbihUgir Turns out throwing your vitals your hobbies your irrelevancies into the ether is ultimately ungratifying At first you get caught up in the hoopla but when you realize no ones reacting no one really cares you stop Weve seen it again and again in the internet sphere Remember when everybody was gonna have a blog And then there was Friendster MySpace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Twitter Instagram Snapchat Theyre all fads People have a fantasy others care but they dont And once youre disabused of the notion that everybodys waiting for your words and pics of wisdom you stop playing Meaning those enterprises that are built upon the efforts of the crowd that supply infrastructure and nothing more are doomed Its all about content And the best content is not that created by nobodies but pros Why do you think YouTube is challenged and starting to charge Theres no money in everybodys home movies Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>just reported stellar numbers Give the company credit for moving quickly to mobile and doing a good job of selling space to advertisers But weve seen advertising costs plummet around the web will they plummet on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Is amassing eyeballs upon bogus content the future of the internet Thats why we have linkbait so companies can generate impressions that they can sell to advertisers But the rates keep going down because the ads make no impression people ignore them if they dont block them entirely Which is what Apple allows you to do on iOS Users are thrilled outlets basing their revenues on advertising are not And then theres PewDiePie the king of the aforementioned YouTube who claims that of YouTubers block all ads bitlyLFvbs Making Apple once again the smartest enterprise on the planet Knowing that there has to be a there there and you gain advantage by establishing trust with your customers as opposed to employing subterfuge and selling their data But the dropping posts on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>prove that everybody is not a star That the wild west atmosphere of the internet is a phase And as things solidify cyberspace resembles the rest of society Theres a very thin layer of superstarswinners a small class who believe the low barrier to entry means they can win the lottery while the rest have checked out and are interacting one to one and consuming when theyre not Same as it ever was Passivity reigns TV never became interactive and the websites built on this premise that if you build it they will come and spew their data and make you rich is flawed too You cant control the customer And what the customer has said again and again is not only will he gravitate to free his allegiance is temporary at best Youve got to create a product worth paying for and continue to improve it otherwise youll be passed by So those who create visual content professionally are still in good shape As are the news titans Theyve just got to wait out the chaos as the major labels did in the music business Remember the majors were gonna die But now theyre even more powerful than before because of their relationships In an era of chaos theyre the only ones who can gain traction on a product So Wall Street is behind the times not as lost as the government but clueless as to whats coming down the pike Anybody who used a mobile device knew that BlackBerry was toast but Wall Street propped it up for years and believed theoretical comebacks even though we know its impossible for classic rockers to have another hit hell Robin Thicke may never have another hit Were a nation of grazers not builders We dont want to waste too much effort constructing that which will not pay dividends So we talk to our friends and click through to the greats <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may end up being a primary destination but housing the efforts of its users will yield diminishing returns Its all about first class content Forbes let the lunatics into the asylum letting everyman post and it ruined their brand never mind their financials HBO skims only the biggest talent and scores big in subscribers Because we dont want to waste time on nobodies only stars And the truth is there are very few of them Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for scientific knowledge Be sure to create straw men and argue against things I have neither said nor implied If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant off topic discussions it would be appreciated Lastly kindly forgo all civility in your discourse you are after all anonymous As a member of the
