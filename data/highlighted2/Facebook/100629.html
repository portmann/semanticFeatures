maxed out after its first quarter showed a sequential decline FBs new ad products suggest this isnt the case These new products should put FB on a playing field by itself offering advertisers the ability to create actual revenue from ads Facebooks NASDAQ FB ad prices have continuously soared since becoming a public company While many investors remain somewhat infatuated with the prospects of video advertising these days the reality is that most of Facebooks current business is tied to display ads as is a large percentage of its future growth opportunity That said many analysts have debated the upside of Facebooks current ad pricing after its first quarterly sequentially decline the reality is that new ad products could very well catapult ad prices much higher to a new level First and foremost Facebooks sequential decline in ad prices was marginal as it still managed to produce a increase yearoveryear in prices Historically the fourth quarter has been very strong for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in advertising due to the holidays whereas the first quarter typically reflects a slowdown Therefore investors should have never bought into the idea of peak prices for display ads and judging by the stock price the overwhelming majority of investors remain quite bullish Still all indications suggest that the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>presents ads is about to change and quite drastically in a way that no other big advertiser offers Up until this point advertisers have been buying placement on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>news feeds including likes and increased engagement The hope is that by spending this money on advertisements that future posts will reach a larger audience and possibly lead to product and service sales After all the goal of advertising is for it to eventually reflect as new business Whether or not that actually occurs is quite difficult for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to determine That said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now testing a variety of new ad products that will allow advertisers to realize that sale immediately by the use of ads on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Or in this case a new subscription With the above ad users can subscribe to services or fill out forms in just two clicks as explained by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in a blog post Now the limitations for something like this are seemingly endless whether you are applying for a credit card or subscribing to the Wall Street Journal After all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now storing credit card information on their platform allowing users to send money via Messenger and is reportedly preparing to let users make purchases on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with a single click The above shows yet another <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is letting advertisers get more from their ads making direct purchases with a Buy button So if an advertiser can gain new subscribers to their service or create actual revenue from their ads due to the Buy button it obviously increases the value of Facebooks ads In other words advertisers are no longer buying placement on a social media platform alone but also have the opportunity to create real revenue from their ad spending Clearly this is the future that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>foresees in their ads a very wise decision indeed So just how much upside is possible with these changes Thats hard to figure but keep in mind that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>earned just in revenue per user during its last quarter in the US and Canada While it may seem that there is limited upside in Facebooks most lucrative market the US and Canada be sure to remember that Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is earning north of in revenue per user Thats a wide disconnect between two of the worlds largest platforms If anything once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>deploys ads on a large scale that allow the sale of merchandise subscriptions or enrollments then it will offer advertisers something entirely unique While Googles ads encourage link clicks Facebooks encourage likes that lead to a higher chance of product purchases it doesnt give advertisers the ability to sale from the ad itself <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be the first to do so and that adds value Therefore given the disconnect between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Googles ad prices combined with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>having the best platform to provide direct selling due to user and consumer engagement my belief is that ad prices for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are going to soar quickly and consequently Googles could decline faster Source Why Facebooks Ad Prices Still Have Considerable Upside
