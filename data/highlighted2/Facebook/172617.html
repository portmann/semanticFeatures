internal development Comparing Amazon to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>provides a compelling demonstration Despite its recent GAAP losses Amazon has seen quite strong owner earnings over the last few years Conversely Facebooks high expenses for defensive acquisitions have not shown up in GAAP losses though actual owner earnings are strongly negative Fretting over tech earnings often centers on whether the company tries to deflect investor attention away from stock option expense as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB does or fully incorporates option expensing as does Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Although significant this overlooks more important factors in assessing earnings quality One such crucial factor is the dramatic accounting difference between internal development and acquisitions Although most investors are aware of the advantages of organic growth over bolton acquisitions the accounting implications of entering new markets through internal development are perverse An excellent example of this is the contrast between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>widely lauded for its GAAP generally accepted accounting principles earnings vs the lackluster performance of Amazon by that measure And yet had FB internally developed the same technologies and brands it purchased at the same cost it would have large losses for its lifetime Conversely had AMZN reached its present position the same cash brands and technologies through acquisition rather than internal development it would equate to quite large GAAP earnings To a fully rational investor then Amazon has been an immensely profitable company during its recent stretch of reported modest GAAP losses and FB should rationally be regarded as unprofitable through its lifetime to date Taking the case of FB first the companys most significant acquisitions are for Instagram B WhatsApp B of stock at the time more based on the current price and Oculus B None of these endeavors produce profits indeed they scarcely produce revenue Crucially at least the first two do not represent new opportunities but are rather plays in the same field FB already dominates to wit mobile advertising More accurately FB jointly with Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL accounts for about twothirds to threefourths of all mobile advertising with FB smaller but gaining ground B is a tidy sum to spend largely to forestall rising competition There is unlikely to be a significant direct return on these large expenses For example WhatsApp is most popular in parts of the world where the median income is a little above a day Most of its customers do not pay even the modest yearly fee Such customers are not widely appealing to advertisers and cannot be charged significant fees for example for mobile payments since they have so little to begin with In any event regardless of whether or not WhatsApp is ever successfully monetized it is a play for the same mobile advertising pot The cost of buying it is therefore an expense incurred to support Facebooks current primary business If Intel spent a similar sum developing a new processor it would not hold that cost on the books as goodwill so that the impact on GAAP profits is protected <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>should not receive such an accounting pass either at least from a careful investor Instagram also was a defensive purchase as the app was rapidly spreading among the most important audience important to advertisers and also in terms of predicting future global trends namely Americans below In retrospect the purchase was nonetheless a bargain as it succeeded in fending off the threat of an upstart Inevitably Instagram has begun to languish under the benign neglect of FB management and has been surpassed by Snapchat Not in overall usage but in the critical under crowd in the United States where time spent on social media is now more often on Snapchat than FB or Instagram that is more hours are devoted to Snapchat Although almost unknown and certainly unused by those above Snapchat has a fanatical following among teens and the youngest adults Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel refuses to calculate monthly active users which FB touts Instead Snapchat focuses on daily and even hourly use with million active users under this stricter criterion Those are largely the million most important individuals both to advertisers and to investors who wish to predict future trends The company has according to reliable rumor turned down a B offer from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Apparently Facebooks business requires periodic expenditures of large sums just to play defense A monopoly typically cracks from the establishment of a niche which then expands Even if the young are regarded as a niche they may age continuing to use the same platform Conversely FB need not worry about the geriatric set anytime soon To be clear the young also are on FB For example nearly threefourths of all Snapchat users also are on FB its just that they spend far more time on Snapchat At any rate most of Facebooks acquisition expenses are incurred chasing the very same advertising dollars rather than developing a new line of business This would still be true even if Instagram Messenger or WhatsApp are eventually successfully monetized Oculus may be the exception to the rule genuinely representing an attempt to enter a new business Even there depending on how the virtual reality product is implemented it may be ultimately primarily incorporated into the existing products So far however Oculus has produced only more expenses For its lifetime as a public company then FB has spent B on acquisitions which currently produce essentially more expenses while reporting GAAP earnings of B FB claimed earnings of B in B in B in and has fallen to B for the first half to The irony is that should FB admit that one or more of its defensive acquisitions were overpriced the writeoff of goodwill would be a noncash expense Even those who bemoan option expenses which FB tries to hide for example by requiring analysts to predict future earnings on a nonGAAP basis typically give a pass for goodwill write downs Yet the cost to investors is quite real and indeed can be an order of magnitude greater than the promiscuous issuance of stock By contrast AMZN has to a much larger extent favored internal development over acquisition As soon as selling books became profitable indeed slightly before AMZN expanded into selling CDs and DVDs As it became apparent that also would soon be profitable AMZN began selling electronics and so forth After selling pretty much everything became profitable AMZN invested into initially mysterious heavy tech spending which later produced the Kindle and Amazon Web Services AWS among other results To be sure it also produced the Fire Phone probably much to Tim Cooks amusement and certainly to Amazons loss but all expenses for each effort were duly accounted for not held as goodwill Out of these various new endeavors AWS is of course the crown jewel Indeed AWS is a superlative asset whose like is not approached anywhere else in the tech world This is not because of superior foresight That cloud infrastructure would eventually be huge was never a surprise For as long as Google has been a publicly traded company it was assumed that it perhaps along with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and perhaps IBM NYSE IBM would eventually duel it out for mastery of this potentially lucrative centerpiece of the future world of computing Instead AMZN whose core principles include a bias toward prompt action quietly established a dominant position while the others were still busy making strategic plans It would be difficult to overstate the dominance of AWS in infrastructure as a service IaaS for those who favor altogether pointless acronyms Several estimates put AWS infrastructure sales as equal to the next competitors combined but this still understates the situation The next closest albeit still distant follower is MSFT but its Azure is used only by those already using Azure for their web servers While hardly a negligible market its more or less moribund whereas Linuxbased servers continue to rapidly expand Nearly all of this fast growing group converges on AWS which has by far the largest set of services with the largest supporting community surrounding it Thus for new tech companies their choices are AWS or well pretty much to appear peculiar and endanger their venture funding Once a company begins using a particular cloud infrastructure platform it is exceptionally difficult to ever switch According to a recent August issue BusinessWeek article Netflix investigated switching but decided moving from AWS would require a costly multiyear effort and decided to simply stick with their competitor That is what sticky looks like In the Q July report AWS had B in revenue up yy with M in profit There is nothing nearly so superlative to compare with it in the cloud space especially inasmuch as AWS actually showed accelerating not decelerating revenue growth For contrast Salesforcecom NYSE CRM with yy revenue growth in the low s and decelerating appreciably has a PriceSales of about a little less after the recent crash If we estimate the next months revenue of AWS at B as its growth implies this suggests a market cap of B for AWS Or it would if AWS did not have vastly greater growth than CRM and the advantages of being actually profitable as well as dominating its space in a way that Salesforce does not In fact no cloud company remotely has the combination of monopolistic probabilities and extreme high growth AWS does Such superlatives merit and inevitably earn a premium in the market typically proportional at least to the ratio of respective growth rates Therefore a B market cap as a standalone company is plausible on a comparison basis To be sure its a bit shady to use comparative valuations in a frothy segment as cloud companies doubtless are even after the recent sell off The comparison is offered only to suggest that a spinoff IPO would be highly lucrative Amazon has an asset it could dispose of were it so minded A better fundamental valuation is to estimate likely earnings over the next months The run rate is B but profit growth should be more than over the next year as economy of scale kicks in So let us say B in profits for the forward year and taking into account the very rapid growth and high chance of monopolizing a potentially quite large market xB B as a conservative estimate Probably too low but at least high enough to scandalize Graham purists Amazons Core Retailing Profitability Amazons core retail business also is quite profitable With trailing twelve month revenue of B AMZNs balance sheet shows B profit from operations The B that came from selling stock via option grants should be deducted as should the B attributable to AWS Conversely there are several large expenses which should be added back before considering the profitability of the core retail operation These include large losses from the Fire Phone not just the inventory writedown but development and marketing the cost of drone research expensive efforts to break into China and numerous new business efforts such as booking local contractors home delivery of restaurant meals and so forth The total of all these efforts is unknown Being a physicist by background Im more comfortable with a rough estimate than pretended precision Let us take the total expenses not associated with current operations to be at least B After deductions and additions then we come to B With a currency adjusted growth yy growth rate currently at this implies at PEG a valuation of B for the core retail business Owner Earnings and Capital Expenditures Some investors mistakenly deduct AMZNs capitalized leases for new distribution centers from their operating cash flow In analyzing some or better most companies its quite proper to subtract similar sounding capitalized expenditures No matter how much Intel spends on its current die shrink it will need to spend as much again or more for the still more difficult shrink which follows This is a marathon race which will probably outrun the investors lifetime Likewise a chain expanding across the country in companyowned stores will have to be building brick and mortar for decades But this is not the case for much of Amazons capitalized leases which they virtually own except in name To understand why it helps to consider a little history On June as the dotcom implosion was underway an otherwise unremarkable and unremarked bond analyst Ravi Suria of Lehman Brothers created a media sensation when he announced that his gimleteyed analysis of Amazons cash flow showed that the company would be bankrupt by that fall This was contrary to Amazons own analysis showing it nearing breakeven cash flow but still with GAAP losses Mr Suria had the good fortune to be widely hailed as a hero and truth teller touted for refuting the crazy supposition that a market capitalization of B was plausible for the leading internet retailer The magazine Individual Investor named Mr Suria truth teller of the year for As the stock fell below share it advised readers to keep your shorts on The fall cover of Individual Investor asked whether would be Amazons last Christmas Actually it was the last Christmas for Individual Investor For that matter Lehman Brothers lasted a bit longer but it too is gone As for Amazon a funny thing happened during the dotcom crash AMZN did what its detractors claimed it could not namely accumulated cash paid down debt and became GAAP positive This while fully expensing options at a time when companies like Intel and Cisco still refused to do so Why was Lehman so wrong The mistake Mr Suria made was to suppose that the construction of a few regional warehouses was a cash flow deduction that like Intels die shrinks could be extrapolated into the indefinite future In fact at the time of his announcement AMZN already had all the warehouses it needed for its then current mode of operation It was several years before targeting new opportunities that caused Amazon to enter another epoch of intensified capital spending It would be a Lehmansized error to make the same mistake about the current burst of capitalized spending In fact the current construction about regional distribution centers and they may not be quite done has little to do with Amazons current operations Amazon sees a future in which a delivery vehicle carrying goods for AMZN either directly or fulfilling a third party order goes up and down virtually every street in every populous neighborhood in the nation Given their recent advances in warehouse robotics the incremental cost of each delivery then shrinks considerably while their tactical moat over competitors becomes overwhelming Crucially these investments make it possible to sell groceries a larger business Byear than everything else Amazon currently sells combined Expenditures which are not necessary for the current business will occur only for a limited time and are aimed primarily at a large new market are not properly deducted from cash flow Instead its those expenditures which are necessary to defend an existing business Intels die shrinks or FBs purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp that should be deducted from cash flow In its short time as a public company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has spent B playing defense This loss is unacknowledged on the books which holds the full cost as goodwill The money is still gone Conversely Amazon developed valuable assets one of which alone is worth B However AWS has almost certainly produced a net recorded GAAP loss for its lifetime given the years it took to build Creating and owning an exceptionally valuable asset is not a true loss One of several ironies of the situation is that even were FB to later write down the corresponding goodwill most investors and analysts would give them a pass wrongly believing that goodwill is a noncash expense Yet the money FB spent really is gone and AMZNs asset is really still there This yet understates the stark difference between owner earnings for the two companies The owner of FB while paying out these whopping sums would still be fretting about the rise of yet another youth niche social network SnapChat as well as the possibility that fickle advertisers could find other ways of targeting their audience once the new wears off Conversely our AMZN owner is sleeping well knowing that AWS and etailing are two key franchises in which the company is utterly dominant Even better a rather significant possibility exists of intruding into the advertising market itself Both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google are acutely aware of the Amazonian danger that shoppers will begin to search on Amazons site first hence the pairs otherwise seemingly quixotic attempts to insert themselves into the shopping process Amazon has achieved its enviable dominance while encountering surprisingly little negative coverage at least until fairly recently It has for example at least half and possibly twothirds of the eBook market depending on the estimate Yet outside of the publishing industry there is little appreciation let alone complaining about this dominance Indeed one is likely to instead find analysts worrying that AMZNs profits will be negatively impacted by the transition of media consumption to digital Undoubtedly it has helped Amazons image to have masked its large owner earnings through constant expansion That expansion is not just of its existing businesses but also into distinctly different avenues Profits are likely to be too large to hide soon especially for AWS That fact along with the fear AMZN engenders in the print industry means a negative bias from the press is virtually inevitable in the near future Naturally I am not referring to the New York Times article describing the shocking fact that one employee out of sent an email after midnight No doubt the article was necessary as that probably never happened anywhere else Amazon investors should see appreciation the next few years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>owners are not likely to be so lucky Disclosure I amwe are long AMZN MoreI wrote this article myself
