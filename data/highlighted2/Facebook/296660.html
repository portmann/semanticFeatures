and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Using adjusted earnings FBs adjusted return on assets is projected to fall from levels to in still more than twice the ROA most financial databases report One culprit behind traditional metrics major distortions is GAAP accounting for goodwill which amounted to bn for FB this large figure leads to a significant understatement of FBs economic Another reason behind our significantly higher ROA is FBs adjusted earnings of bn compared to asreported earnings of only bn The PVP chart above reflects the real economic performance and valuation measures of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB after making many major adjustments to the asreported financials The four panels explain the companys corporate performance and valuation levels over the past years plus best estimates for forecast years based on quarterly financials and consensus estimates The apostrophe after the ROA A VA and VE is the symbol for prime which means adjusted These calculations have been modified with comprehensive adjustments to remove asreported earnings asset liabilities and cash flow statement inconsistencies and distortions To better understand the PVP chart and the following discussion please refer to our guide here For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>there are many failures of GAAP that lead to a lowquality earnings number and an unreliable balance sheet One major issue is the failure to consistently require capitalization of research and development expenses which tech companies usually have in abundance The natural lumpiness of the roughly bn expenditure in RD results in earnings margins cash flow from operations and return on assets that can fluctuate up and down materially from year to year unlike economic reality GAAP requires RD costs to be either expensed or capitalized from acquisitions as inprocess or written off later The goodwill and intangibles from acquisitions compound the issues when research and development expenditures are involved For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>goodwill in the bnbn range also creates material inconsistencies These create inconsistencies when comparing one company to another and from comparing a company to itself from year to year Its worth noting that the handling of RD under IFRS is even more of a problem than under GAAP as it can allow even more wiggle room for judgment by management from year to year as to what is capitalized and what is expensed As it stands even the venerable Statement of Cash Flows is full of distortions and the expensing of RD is just one of the many issues When SFAS implemented the Statement of Cash Flows in the late s three of the seven FASB members voted against it Its almost unbelievable and yet its written into the actual Statement of Financial Accounting Standard One would think that for such a major change in financial statement reporting and disclosures youd require a unanimous vote or at least a supermajority Analysis shows that FBs GAAP net income was bn for when in economic reality FBs adjusted earnings was twice that at bn The profitability of FB is therefore not as traditional metrics suggest Return on Assets Prime Real Economic Profitability in the ROA The top panel of the chart shows ROA ROA prime aka Adjusted Return on Assets This measure is comparable from year to year and across peers as it cleans up the aforementioned GAAP accounting issues to provide consistent analysis Facebooks adjusted return on assets is forecasted to fall to from levels of While their adjusted ROA is projected to fall in the near term the forecasted figures are still significantly higher than the GAAP ROA reported by most financial databases In addition the expected fall in adjusted ROA in is due to the disproportionate rise in adjusted net assets and adjusted earnings Furthermore the company has spent significantly on acquisitions leading to a large discrepancy between our adjusted ROA and FBs asreported ROA as the GAAP method artificially punishes the company for goodwill and other intangibles FBs adjusted ROA is x costofcapital levels and is approximately x the US corporate average of and the firms traditionallycalculated ROA These are all real not nominal numbers undistorted by varying levels of inflation from year to year or country to country Facebooks adjusted ROA has been fluctuating since its IPO peaking at levels in before falling to in ROA then began rising to a recent peak of in and is expected to fall to levels in While a falling ROA may indicate that FBs profitability is fading this is only a natural result of the firms aggressive investment In reality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a massive cash flow generator that has been heavily investing in itself That is a major difference in context and concept for evaluating Facebooks situation In the second panel of the fourpanel chart Asset growth stands for Asset Prime Growth and is the real annual growth rate of the cleanedup and properly adjusted asset base of the company This metric shows the management teams propensity to reinvest or divest over time When viewed in context of the adjusted ROA the growth rate explains a lot about managements intended strategies and even performance incentives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has shown a history of significantly investing in the firm which is the right thing to do when adjusted ROAs are well above and expected to remain above the opportunity cost of capital Asset growth rates range from to much higher levels in the last decade peaking at in This is significantly above GDP growth rates as well as US corporate average growth of to over the last ten years By reinvesting in such high adjusted ROAs the firm is compounding its returns Valuations reflect that positive performance Valuation Relative to Adjusted Assets VA The third panel of the four panel chart shows the Adjusted Value to Assets ratio VA is a calculation comparing the enterprise value of the company to the asset level A The V is the market capitalization of the company plus the total debt of the company including offbalance sheet debt The A reflects the total operating assets of the firm necessarily adjusted for problematic accounting standards for reporting of the balance sheet VA can be thought of as a cleanedup PricetoBook metric The A is the same as the denominator of the ROA calculation and the Asset growth panel As Facebooks returns fall we also see the asset multiple VA fall The firms ROA when the asreported ROA is may indicate that a VA of x may be too high However FBs continued investment growth ought to justify this multiple Valuation Relative to Adjusted Earnings VE In the fourth panel we have a third perspective of valuation to help triangulate the markets embedded expectations for company performance We are seeking to determine whats pricedin to the stock price In this case we evaluate the enterprise value of the firm relative to the expected adjusted earnings E for the current year The E is the adjusted earnings resulting from the companys core business operations regardless of how it is financed and adjusted to its current dollar value This is adjusted to eliminate accounting distortions and shenanigans enhance comparability across different companies industries and globally to determine potential mispricings The value numerator is the same as that in the adjusted value to assets ratio Facebooks asreported PE is at x indicating that the firm may currently be overvalued Our analysis finds that FB has approximately a x VE that supports the suggestion that FB equity has an overly high valuation given longterm PE averages of x to x unless of course FB can continue to grow aggressively which theyve shown the ability to do while maintaining superior adjusted ROA levels Asreported financial statement information and financial ratios which make up most of the publicly available financial databases do not consider the extent to which distortions miscategorizations and misclassifications cause asreported financial statements to depart from economic reality Even the venerable statement of cash flaws pun intended is horribly distorted as many items in the statement of cash flows are actually noncash related What is deemed cash flow from operations investing and financing activities are inconsistently booked from company to company and even just from yeartoyear at an individual company The distortions are material and directionally changing and the mismeasurements that result are decisionchanging issues A far better picture of the economic reality of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can be seen once those distortions are removed The firm is generating returns at five times cost of capital and is successfully reinvesting in itself at levels far above the anemic GDP growth rates seen around the world With that context of corporate performance and market valuation we have a far better means for evaluating FBs prospects for the future of its stock To better understand the discussion
