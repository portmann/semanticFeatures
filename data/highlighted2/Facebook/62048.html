not affect the actual opinions and recommendations of the authors Corporate responsibility is great because it boosts the companys PR efforts and it makes employees feel good about helping others I think blood drives and canned food drives are really easy ways to help To provide a useful service or product that improves lives and therefore society To provide productive and meaningful employment To do no harm to customers andor employees I think all companies should be giving back to the communities they reside in in some way It may be as simple as offering to donate money annual to a charity of the corporations choice or even as deep as involving employees within an event such as a run to help raise awareness perhaps the susan g komen events Corporate social responsibility means taking care of your employees and giving back to the local community Paying employees a living wage and providing them with full benefits Encouraging employees to volunteer and matching charitable donations It also means caring about and being part of the community youre in to make it a better place Corporate Social Responsibility means that a company uses their money power and reputation for good and not for evilboth in the US and overseas To not take advantage of those who are less than you Disclaimer The links and mentions on this site may be affiliate links But they do not affect the actual
