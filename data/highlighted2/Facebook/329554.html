Instagram now has monthly active advertisers for a monthly active user base of million We can see that advertisers are already flocking to Instagram more so than TWTR and we believe this is just the beginning of a secular shift We think that of Facebooks million advertisers will eventually flowthrough to Instagram million advertisers We contend that Instagram might actually possess more advertising potency than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and that Instagrams advertiser density has potential to exceed Facebooks advertiser density We do not think the revenue estimates for growth this year and growth next year are fully baked with Instagram revenue potential We see Instagram as a growth machine that will propel significant revenue and earnings growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB over the next years We conservatively think a mature Instagram is a billion annualized revenue platform and further think growth will be quick more than billion in revenue by As Twitter NYSE TWTR continues to cede market share we believe there is tremendous opportunity for Instagram to continue to exponentially grow its advertising revenue We remain bullish on FB and think shares still have considerable upside Instagram now has monthly active advertisers for a monthly active user base of million That is roughly advertiser for every users By comparison Twitter has advertisers on a monthly user base of million or advertiser for every users We can see that advertisers are already flocking to Instagram more so than Twitter and we believe this is just the beginning of a secular shift from a FacebookTwitter dominated app market to a FacebookInstagram dominated app market Some could argue that this shift has already occurred with one out of every five mobile minutes being spent on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram We believe however Instagram is still at the very early stages of exponential growth FB has million advertisers for its billion monthly active users and that is about advertiser for every users We do not see any reason why Instagram cannot approach or even eclipse that advertiser density or around advertiser for every users especially given its natural connection with FB on the advertiser side According to James Quarles Instagrams global head of business and brand development We recommend that businesses be both on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and on Instagram its the same back end but a different storefront We think it makes natural and intuitive sense for there to be significant overlap in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram advertisers Already of the top <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>advertisers are on Instagram We think that of Facebooks million advertisers will eventually flowthrough to Instagram million advertisers We contend that Instagram might actually possess more advertising potency than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and that Instagrams advertiser density has potential to exceed Facebooks advertiser density We make this argument on the grounds that Instagrams pictureexclusive news feed lends itself to higher user engagement Roughly of users says they learn about products and services on Instagram and say they take action after being inspired by an Instagram post This number is shockingly high and we think it illustrates the potency of a pictureexclusive news feed This is also why we expect there to be significant flowthrough of advertisers from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to Instagram We believe Instagrams userengagementfocused platform supports an upwards of million advertisers In sum we believe Instagram will propel significant growth for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on both the top and bottom line over the next several years We do not think the revenue estimates for growth this year and growth next year are fully baked with Instagram revenue potential We like the valuation of FB here still trading at a discount to its cash flow
