This time I looked at Microsoft On first glance I found Microsofts stock price to be rich so I dove deeper to understand what the market is thinking Using a reverse engineering process I understood how MSFT is priced and subsequently took a look at why it is priced in such a way Weekly I personally take a look in the tech world to find a suitable place to put my money This week I looked at Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and what I found may make you reevaluate how you view the mature company that it is After looking at MSFTs stock price and some basic metrics I first asked is Microsoft priced for growth Thats a pretty heavy question If the answer is yes then my next question becomes is Microsoft trading at these levels because its in growth mode or because its expected to be in growth mode If I can determine the market is accurately pricing Microsoft then I can buy shares today at a reasonable fair valuation If the answer to that twopart question is no and no it becomes a decision to pass on the investment for now and if possible create a fair value entry price on the stock In this article I answer and evaluate these questions using a less conventional method To understand if Microsoft is trading at growth levels I need some growth valuation parameters to hold it up against Here I use the companys historical multiples as well as a comparison to a growth companys earnings Picking this comparable is probably harder than the actual analysis itself therefore I decided to reference wellrespected Seeking Alpha contributor Chuck Carnevale who is endearingly referred to as Mr Valuation I believe his valuation metrics are arguably the most conservative of our time and will represent valuation accurately In particular I will pull from his recent article Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB A Screaming Buy Or Sell In this article Chuck applies a generous annual earnings rate for a dividend growth stock and an acceptable annual earnings growth rate for a growth company However since I dont expect Microsoft to be growing at Facebooklike multiples due to many factors I split the difference and use a middle ground of Typically when evaluating whether a stock is overvalued most people look at the current pricetoearnings and pricetosales metrics among other ratios to observe if they are higher than the comparable and if they are conclude the underlying stock is overvalued However I want to change that evaluation and use a different method This method takes a growth companylike earnings rate historic company multiples the current stock price and determines if they line up If they do it means the stock is trading in a historically average range with growthlike earnings Its a reverse engineering method to check our valuation with our expectations For the historical valuations I determined Microsofts average PE ratio to be about for the last six years not including this most recent year to facilitate a historical basis Similarly MSFTs average PS ratio is This historical valuation brings us back to and is the starting year for my growth calculations In fiscal year Microsoft earned per share Using the predetermined annual growth rate MSFT today would be yielding in earnings per share Using todays share price of the PE ratio would be calculated at near the historical ratio of Continuing the exercise with a pricetosales comparison the company brought in B in revenue in Using the same growth rate gives us B in revenue for the last fiscal year The PS ratio then calculates to be which is slightly above the historical average but within an acceptable tolerance We can conclude Microsoft trading at using historical valuation averages should be growing earnings at growth company rates In other words Microsoft is currently priced for growth First question answered On to the first part of the next question Is the company currently in growth mode Since weve done the bulk of the work already it is easy to apply actual earnings from the past five years In the table below I examine the released earnings with the yearoveryear growth including the average growth rate Does not include B in impairment charges It seems net income isnt terribly healthy let alone in growth mode Revenue on the other hand seems healthier but still a decent amount below our expected rate of growth Its easy to conclude the company is not currently in growth mode This brings us to the other arm of the question Is Microsoft expected to be growing This is trickier but these future expectations are what the market uses to price securities However the market isnt always right and thats what I ultimately want to weigh Using past and present analyst estimates to get a handle on how the company performs relative to them can be a good indicator of what is to come Because of the long track record this can be an effective method for evaluating expectations of the company For this analysis I use several sources ranging from Yahoo Finance to FAST Graphs which provide collective analyst estimates Because Microsoft is wellcovered analyst estimates seem to be within pennies across these various sources Now of course estimates are just that estimates Therefore I must look deeper than that alone and also include the companies track record of beating or missing estimates Using NASDAQs earnings surprise history Microsoft in the last three quarters managed an average beat of Im going to give MSFT the benefit of the doubt and say it can maintain that streak I then factor in estimate beats to give us a realistic idea of what the company may issue Because FY is halfway over I factored in a surprise These numbers look better and give me the impression Microsoft is ready to kick it into growth gear However I hope youre now recalling my exercise above that gave the company a growth EPS of to support the current share price It would take the company until after to be fairly valued based on historical average multiples But I already see the comments saying historical multiples shouldnt matter here if the company is in growth mode Alright lets bump it up Im willing to pay up to times earnings for a Microsoft that is kicking some butt but not complete butt That equates to a share price of In other words Im looking at capital appreciation of nearly over three years or in compounded annual growth Thats not terrible but remember Im seeing a company priced for growth and Im not looking for a measly per year from a growth stock For comparisons sake Ive realized in compounded annual growth with my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>holding That growth is very healthy and one that Im willing to pay for Great question Because MSFT pays a dividend Im willing to accept less than in CAGR I apparently agree with so lets stick with that number I would need to buy shares of MSFT at to realize a CAGR over the next three years Thats over downside I must hold out for So what am I assuming about Microsoft Im assuming Microsoft will trade for times this years forward earnings per share of to see high enough annual capital appreciation to buy a company that is currently priced like a growth company If the company is priced for growth then I want the share appreciation of a growth company With Microsoft at current levels I will not realize that By reverse engineering Microsofts current valuation I found the stock is priced for growth However that growth is not here but expected in the future Unfortunately the growth that is required to support the current valuation is about three years away For the stock to be valued for growth and growthlike appreciation the stock must be trading for Of course several things could change between now and then I would reconsider MSFT closer to the current share price if Microsoft expands in the tablet market with Surface while overcoming Apples NASDAQ AAPL competition or I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
