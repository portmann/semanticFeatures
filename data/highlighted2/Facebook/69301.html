is why theyre preparing by buying up Gold bullion Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Hot on the heels of the apparent defeat of the extension of The Patriot Act Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak reaffirmed his support for digital privacy in an interview over the weekend with Arabian Businesscom When we start to talk about privacy and I ask him whether he thinks NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is a hero or a villain his answer is prompt and unabashed Total hero to me total hero he gushes Not necessarily for what he exposed but the fact that he internally came from his own heart his own belief in the United States Constitution what democracy and freedom was about And now a federal judge has said that NSA data collection was unconstitutional Snowden who revealed classified NSA documents to reporters in is a fugitive from US prosecutors living on a temporary visa in Russia another nation he has criticised for its approach to privacy The judgement Wozniak refers to is that of a federal court in New York which earlier this month found Section of the US Patriot Act which authorised the mass surveillance programmes exposed by Snowden to be insufficient grounds for justifying the NSAs collection of domestic communications data So hes a hero to me because he gave up his own life to do it says Wozniak And he was a young person to give up his life But he did it for reasons of trying to help the rest of us and not just mess up a company he didnt like As stories emerge worldwide of implanted spyware in commercially available hard disks and in SIM cards sold to international telecoms companies security specialists have incessantly offered solutions to the general public as to how to shield private activities and data from prying eyes Wozniak however is pessimistic about the prospects of protection and believes the root cause of the problem extends back to the early years of OS development Its almost impossible to protect yourself because todays operating systems generally get so huge that they can only come from a few sources like Microsoft Google and Apple he says And those operating systems have so many millions of lines of code in them built by tens of thousands of engineers over time that its so difficult to go back and detect anything in it thats spying on you Its like having a house with doors and windows and you have no idea where there might be a tiny little camera Woz is an ardent privacy advocate and bemoans the lost chances of computings fledgling years where he feels it may have been possible to block future attempts at monitoring There is a type of technology that you can fairly securely today run on your computer and someone elses computer which allows you to send them a message and its private the way it should be he says I believe that I should be allowed to send a message to my wife and nobody can know it unless they know our passwords In a system named PGP Pretty Good Privacy emerged for secure pointtopoint data transfer The data to be sent was encrypted on the machine that sent it and decrypted on the destination machine Wozniak decries the technology as a lost opportunity for OS vendors At that point in time if Apple and Microsoft had built PGP into their operating system it would have been a permanent part of email and all email would have been secure he says Now were talking about making laws that you cannot use encryption Its almost like you cant have any secrets anymore And the modern generation just accepts this as the status quo Companies like Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are trying to make money off knowing things about you theyre trying to funnel things to you and make money that way Apple is only making good products that you can choose to buy if you want so I look at Apple as being more the protector of privacy than anyone else Finally Wozniak unleashes some other brutal truths Everything is firstclass in Dubai The United States used to talk when I was growing up like thats what we were The US would look like this if we didnt spend all our money on the military Wed unicorn Wed Seasmoke Wed nmewn Indeed Snowden is a hero Wozniak not so much Maybe hes afraid of getting his fat neck stretched at some point in the future I look Forward to all these hypocritical assholes who were inthe bestpositions toSee something say something having their come to Jesus moment too Wed J S Bach Wed Achilles Heel Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot But the Grinch who lived just north of Whoville did not Wed Freddie I want to believe but Snowden worked for the See Eye Aye and no one leaves I think he is an op against the En Ess Aye as Jon Rappaport said at the time Woz is a good guy and kind of a savant If he thinks Apple are good guys then he is naive Wed Duc actually Snowden left with other whistleblowers Putins got the goods All of it It took months for Snowden and his compatriots to download all of it on broadband Hilarity will ensue when this happens Gonna suck big time to be a US politician when the dam breaks and the River of Shit begins to flow privacy is recognized as a fundamental right in the universal declaration of human rights and the european convention on human rights its in the US constitution not explicitly but its implied in the fourth fifth and ninth amendments its part of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union in the UN general assembly approved a resolution titled the right to privacy in the digital age affirming that our fundamental right to privacy applies online as well as offline and the risk of mass surveillance undermines this right Wed NihilistZero Ive always thought be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures was pretty fucking explicit Then again the Supreme Courts definition of reasonable is wholly unreliable Wed damn hot diggity I know what Im choosing Its Brawndo Because not only is it what plants crave but wait for it its got electrolytes Fucking love this democracy thing Wed Monty Burns Not really Dubai relies on a vast underclass of virtual slave laborers to provide the luxury services In America such people would be living off welfare and producing nothing Wed STP Allow me to help fix that America relies on a vast underclass of illegal immigrants to provide the luxury services In America such people are living off welfare and producing nothing Wed i_call_you_my_base Wed brockhardman Ok so I know the dude cofounded Apple but that kind of smart rarely shows this level of actual intelligence monsanto carpet co is a good investment perfect for american cattle Wed Platinum Im glad this Steve is still around Apple would have been a much better company if Jobs had left instead of him Still love the Apple IIe Odell Lake FTW Wed BoPeople And so we are seeing a cultural change in which the corrupt perverted greed riddled elitists become anathema instead of something to aspire to Wed CHC Wed lunaticfringe Well like him or not at least Wozniak had the guts to defend Snowden to the elite cocksuckers who think they own this place Even though he may number among them It would be refreshing to see a few other folks who like to run their mouths all the time stand up and be counted Wed malek Wed Chuck Knoblauch Wed logicalman Do you think he knew about everything that was going on in the company and that even if he did he would be able to do much about things By the way he left Apple in long before OSs became hugely complex harder to hide nefarious shit in a smaller place Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Sunac HK stops proposed merger with Kaisa
