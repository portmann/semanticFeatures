an important theme for investors in highflying tech names however FBs strong fundamentals outweigh these concerns Seeking Alpha readers were optimistic on Thursday which is indicative of month price action Analysts raised price targets and nonGAAP EPS estimates almost across the board <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is planning to launch a new app Notify but it seems like a nonevent as its not competitive when compared to Twitter Many in the retail community are skeptical of FBs valuation however this isnt well substantiated when based on comparative growth metrics and historical valuations <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB remains one of my favorite investments While the stock wasnt able to sustain the momentum from Wednesdays afterhours trading on Thursday I feel confident in anticipating further upside in While the broader macro can create some uncertainty and broader pricing dynamics pertaining to equities could be derailed by interest rate hikes theres no denying that core fundamentals drive the individual performance of securities whenever market risk takes the back seat Many readers on Seeking Alpha more or less shared the same views in my prior <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>article so sentiment from the buy side seems pretty strong While its not an accurate poll there are many instances where the comment stream does indicate price action for securities over the immediate month timeframe FB continues to outperform when compared to the SP And while this pattern is typically considered abnormal I dont anticipate this to be purely a betadriven play where the stock is priced based on expected return but rather intrinsic and comparative value measures will remain far more indicative While investors should feel rightfully skeptical of a stock moving considerably higher when compared to the broader market I dont think the valuation is stretched given the numerous growth catalysts and growth rate comparisons Large Cap growth has remained a bright spot in just as it was in Typically size is a constraint to earnings growth but miraculously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has maintained healthy growth rates off a sizable revenue base The company maintained similar growth rates from last year when pertaining to both average user monetization and user engagement which defies conventional logic However FB is still in the early innings of saturating the advertising space as the company is uniquely positioned to compete for ad dollars in due to the global reach of the platform and targeting advantages when pertaining specifically to mobile These factors in conjunction with growth in adjacent mobile apps has created a dynamic in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can sustain revenue and earnings growth rates above the tech industry medianmean Analysts were optimistic Thursday morning and many raised their price targets due to changes in Q earnings assumptions The consensus estimate for FY nonGAAP diluted EPS will increase and while this data wont be available immediately the data will be reflected by the major data providers over the next to days Brief rundown of price target changes on Thursday Credit Suisse raises PT from to Oppenheimer Co raises PT from to RBC Capital Market raises PT from to Deutsche Bank raises PT from to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey maintains PT at Mizuho Securities raises PT from to Pacific Crest maintains bull case PT at Raymond James raises PT from to Morgan Stanley raises PT from to The mean price target of analysts surveyed was This compares very closely to my own price target of Maybe I wasnt that optimistic when compared to the consensus view Not so surprisingly everyone reacted to the companys outlook the next morning by raising PTs and nonGAAP EPS estimates Additionally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is planning to launch a new standalone app called Notify Its going to be a notificationdriven app that allows users to quickly access top trending news headlines from FBs media partners While Im not exactly certain of the upside from this app FB is at least attempting to compete more directly with Twitter NYSE TWTR by becoming a more reliable source of current events However I still have to give the edge to Twitter due to their recent launch of Moments as Twitter has put a lot of effort into both curating and analyzing billions of Tweets TWTR is a combination of network effect algorithm and curation versus FBs metoo app thats partnering with a small sample of news publishers Theres really no comparison here but over time it may generate momentum depending on the number of news publishers it signs on and gradual feature improvements I anticipate very little impact on core engagement metrics going forward We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not
