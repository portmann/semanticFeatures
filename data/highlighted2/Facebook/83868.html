for the video advertising market To no surprise mobile video ad spending is expected to surge EMarketer recently provided its outlook for digital video advertising and to no surprise mobile is expected to be the big winner While there are countless companies that will try and hit home runs in this fastgrowing arena <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB certainly looks to be a big winner This year digital video ad spending will reach billion The market will grow but video ad spending on mobile devices will grow much faster at as it accounts for billion of the market Over the next four years mobile video ad spending will continue to outpace desktop spending By digital video ad spending would have surged to more than billion and mobile will account for almost half In other words mobile video ad spending is a future billion market thats up for grabs a market thats expected to maintain a doubledigit growth rate well beyond While Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube has a good opportunity to steal a large share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>looks particularly well positioned With billion monthly active mobile users Facebooks core app is by far the largest on mobile According to comScore the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>app accounts for nearly onequarter of all smartphone activity This use alone is appealing to advertisers who want to get their product to consumers Facebooks presence on mobile devices this doesnt include other popular apps like Messenger Instagram or WhatsApp is a large reason the company has managed to succeed in mobile at a faster rate than any other company It seems almost like ancient history that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was once unable to figure out mobile but today mobile accounts for of its total ad sales up from at the end of last year This further supports the notion that advertisers are flocking to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>mobile and that it has a good chance to grab a large chunk of spending on mobile video ads When you incorporate the speed of video growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>looks like the most obvious winner of this fastgrowing market During Facebooks last quarter it noted that four billion videos per day were watched on its platform Thats up from three billion in the fourth quarter and just one billion in the third quarter Importantly mobile accounts for of views or three billion per day This implies that Facebooks mobile video ads will be highly sought after and that the company has found a delivery of video method that users gravitate too Given Facebooks ability to monetize mobile the expected growth rate of mobile video ads and the rapid adoption of mobile video on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>investors can conclude that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will control a large share of this near billion market opportunity For investors this is great news FBR recently estimated that video ad prices can be x higher than display prices That means higher margins for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and it also diminishes the need to show a higher volume of display ads to drive revenue growth In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>gets more bang for the buck with video ads That said I dont see a mathematical limit to how large <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can grow its video ad business Currently it is hard to tell whats an ad and whats not on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The company has done a great job with autoplay and delivering ads to the targeted user For example if a user likes Nordstrom you might see a video ad delivered on your news feed that actually interests you something you might have watched anyways without knowing its an ad because Nordstrom is an interest This fact should keep demand and pricing for Facebooks video ads quite high The exact pricing for video ads on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is unknown but the rumored amounts range from million to million per day for advertisers to have a hour slot for its ad to be shown If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>sells just one ad per day at million that equals million However if it sells three per day at million thats nearly billion annually If video viewing and advertising demand continue to rise theres no reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>couldnt sell slots a day maybe at million per Then video advertising becomes a near billion a year business The reality is that its success all really depends on demand However given the numbers and expectations discussed herein I tend to believe that demand and pricing will be very high longterm The final outcome is a clear path to where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>owns much of this fastgrowing industry or could singlehandedly exceed even with the most bullish of
