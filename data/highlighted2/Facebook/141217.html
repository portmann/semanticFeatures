class='textDiv'>More Evidence That Uber Is A Money Loser And A Unicorn Bubble Bellwether Uber PendingUBER Seeking Alpha Uber is burning hundreds of millions of dollars per year with losses likely to accelerate The cash burn will accelerate as Uber increases their driver subsidies to compete with other ridesharing services The subsidies war between competitors extends overseas where in alone Uber plans to spend a billion dollars on their China expansion against aggressive Chinese competitors like Didi Kauidi We are skeptical that Uber can use this growth strategy to gain an insurmountable advantage in the ridesharing industry like their valuation predicts When Gawker posted internal documents that prove Uber Pending UBER is losing substantial amounts of money this was Ubers officially provided response in a statement to Business Insider Shock horror Uber makes a loss This is hardly news and old news at that Its the case of business you raise money you invest money you grow hopefully you make a profit and that generates a return for investors Yes its old news that startups burn capital The playbook is to grow like crazy and figure out how to monetize later But still A private market startup valued at billion and still burning hundreds of millions per year with losses likely to accelerate We say the case for a valuation decline is still well intact Uber is spending money at a breakneck rate to crack the China market even paying its drivers more than the fares they collect Fat with almost billion in venture capital Uber based in San Francisco is doling out bonuses up to three times the amount of its fares in a bet that its exceptional rise in the United States can be matched in China NYT Uber spends heavily to establish itself in China Shattering prevailing assumptions really Its a surprise when the core strategy is give away tons of free money If you opened a donut shop in China and gave away with every donut you would probably see record sales too Uber reportedly plans to spend a billion dollars in China in Meanwhile its biggest home grown China competitor Didi Kauidi is also spending in the hundredsofmillions range on driver subsidies There is a giant subsidies war going on fueled by an ocean of venture capital money Uber is fascinating because its such a bellwether for the Unicorn bubble and thus the entire Silicon Valley bubble Nobody knows how profitable this company will actually be From the given reports it sounds like Ubers cash burn is actually accelerating They are literally losing money on every ride and making it up on volume And for what The rideshare market is tough There are multiple competitors both internationally and within the United States In big markets like China those competitors are entrenched wellfunded and ruthless The theory is that if Uber expands rapidly enough it can gain an insurmountable advantage from network effects Get huge then benefit from a combination of scale and lockin like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or Amazon NASDAQ AMZN or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Amazon has network effects because it first established a presence back when credit cards were a dicey proposition on the web People came to trust Amazon as a onestopshop for purchases and then a huge logistics operation got layered on top of that turning Amazon into the everything store which is still barely profitable apart from Amazon Web Services Google meanwhile has developed a permanent advantage in search engine quality with all kinds of useful free services attached as such that there is no reason for the world to switch and a technology moat in that their results will continue to improve faster than anyone can keep up And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has lockin because when all your friends and family are on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and you have dozens of contacts on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>you stick with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>But where is the lockin for a ridesharing app In San Francisco most drivers work for Lyft and Uber simultaneously Does anybody really care what ridesharing app they use as long as the car is clean and the app works And what happens when the driver subsidies stop Trying to compete on price is notoriously low on loyalty Why shouldnt all those drivers getting subsidies switch to someone else when the gravy stops Will they hope to pull an Amazon and stay breakeven for the next fifteen years Will the market tolerate that with so many ridesharing wannabes running around And wont the type of logistical problems Uber solves get cheaper and easier to figure out as the cost of computing power drops Ubers valuation seems an entirely madeup number almost randomly pulled from a hat It wasnt randomly pulled from a hat of course but represents the marginal extreme of what investors are willing to pay And thats why its such a great bellwether At some point investors may say This business is nowhere near as profitable as we hoped and dreamed it would be and whats that say for all these other cash burning companies Source More Evidence That Uber Is A Money Loser And A Unicorn Bubble Bellwether Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
