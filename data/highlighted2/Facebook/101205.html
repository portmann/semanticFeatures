</span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha What Messenger not requiring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>participation does is open up the platform to much wider use and presumably to just about every person in the country It also opens it up to folks having very specific use cases such as using it strictly for its photo messaging video chat and video calling capacities The key point to be made is that Messenger offers all of these services and it can offer them in a very nonsocial network way When you pair this nonsocial evolution of Messenger with an almost nonsocial Moments app which is also collaborative your mind can really get going in speculation Being active in consulting with a focus on SMBenterprise solution deployment the pairing to me at least is very closely resembling many of the workflowcollaboration solutions I work with daily Ten days ago I wrote an article detailing how Facebooks NASDAQ FB Moments App was the new version of Paper It was in that article that I opined that Moments wasnt a serious longterm strategic initiative but a bread crumb in a series of bread crumbs that would lead to something much bigger and more strategic I equated this current Easter Egg in Moments to the former Paper which has now become Instant Articles Facebooks primary foundational offering into the Inbound Marketing space Instant Articles is a big deal whereas Paper certainly was not I also detailed that I thought Moments with it being a collaboration focused app and ondevice learnings mechanism was going to eventually show itself as a business first application This speculation was not taken well But thats where I think consensus and the greater <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>market again fails to see the bigger picture I think thats where the market will show itself once again to have underestimated the scale of Mark Zuckerbergs vision and the fearlessness of his leadership Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>have any business being an SMBenterprise solution Maybe not At least right now outside of Businesses on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Messenger for Business but it has entered the general space and I think it has serious aspirations to serve the space in size Think about it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>already has a customer service platform via its Messenger for Business including impressive integrations it already has a deep roster of corporate partners on the marketing and advertising side and has a comprehensive platform of blendready technologies that could very visibly even from here blend together to create some interesting solutions What triggered todays article was the news that followed my Moments article of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now offering a very Whatsappfeeling Messenger option One that doesnt require a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account only a phone number I believe this is step one in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>consolidating Whatsapp and Messenger but thats subject matter for an article down the road What Messenger not requiring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>participation does is open up the platform to much wider use and presumably to just about every person in the country well keep this article focused on the US It also opens it up to folks having very specific use cases such as using it strictly for its photo messaging video chat and video calling capacities These are important advances no doubt But the key point to be made is that Messenger offers all of these services and it can offer them in a very nonsocial network way with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>no longer requiring membership to its social network When you pair this nonsocial evolution of Messenger with an almost nonsocial Moments app your mind can really get going in speculation Being active in consulting with a specific focus on SMBenterprise solution deployment the pairing very closely resembles many of the workflowcollaboration solutions I work with daily That is if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>were to combine the core technologies of Messenger and Moments But still there are plenty of competitors on the domestic and global front that offer nearly identical services albeit to a much smaller user base either as standalone apps or that could be combined to meet this benchmark None of the above differentiates Messenger or is what really excites me about Facebooks most recent additions to the service What does is that Messenger will do all of the above while offering friendtofriend payments something I believe is the best kept secret at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now involved in the money transfer business the collaboration business on and off device and in the chat business on and off platform If I asked you what the best collaboration solution was currently you might say Slack You might say that because of its incredible and user friendly chat functionality If I asked you what the best file sharing and quasimachine learning app was you might say Dropbox or Box You might say because of the nearuniversal reach of both when combined If I asked you what the best pureplay chat app was that had text photo and video capacity you could list a hundred names and theyd be the usual suspects Messenger would likely be included in that list But if you could white label these products and if I could present to you an app that blended Moments and Messengers core technologies and keep in mind you would also be able to remit money within this blended solution meaning potentially pay an invoice or receive AR would you be able to tell me unbiased that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt at least need to be involved in the conversation I would argue with its network being the tie breaker that Facebooks blended tech would be near best of breed if not best of breed as a comprehensive solution By the way guys I dont believe theres a comprehensive solution offering the combined tech that the blended <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>tech would offer Period So call me crazy Continue to consider that Im way off the mark here and maybe I am but Ive been fooled by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>before I like many passed on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>under share and wont be fooled again Im not looking for a reason to be long the stock because I already am and with leverage Im simply recognizing patterns and using Facebooks prior track record of innovation to guide my thesis here I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is headed into the SMBenterprise solution space Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger Going NonSocial Hints At Enterprise Solution
