FB HD LOW MA S SBUX T V VZ The ETF offers a lower expense ratio than I expected for a momentum ETF The sector allocation combined with a momentum strategy is too dangerous for me The biggest allocations are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Home Depot Amazon and Visa These are all great companies and worthy of serious consideration Investors should be seeking to improve their riskadjusted returns Im a big fan of using ETFs to achieve the riskadjusted returns relative to the portfolios that a normal investor can generate for themselves after trading costs One of the funds that Im researching is the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor Index ETF NYSEARCA MTUM Ill be performing a substantial portion of my analysis along the lines of modern portfolio theory so my goal is to find ways to minimize costs while achieving diversification to reduce my risk level Normally I have been starting with looking at the individual holdings but I want to mix it up this time The following chart breaks down the allocation by sector The consumer discretionary sector has a fairly massive weighting My first thought here is that I would be scared to hold this ETF if this prolonged bull market turned into a bear market Three times in the last year there have been sudden threats for the bull market to come to a screeching halt Im not convinced that we will see that kind of huge dropoff in the economy in the next few years because low interest rates can do a great deal to keep market prices high but I dont think I have the risk tolerance for this sector allocation The top allocations to individual companies are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Home Depot NYSE HD Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Visa NYSE V If we strip it down to only looking at the top holdings within the consumer discretionary sector then the top holdings are AMZN Starbucks NASDAQ SBUX and Home Depot I find the heavy allocation to Amazon concerning given their incredible success at expanding the brand without earning profits but I cant critique them too much because when I need something other than groceries the first place I look for it is Amazon Clearly Amazon has done a great job at conditioning me to look at its website as the first solution to my shopping needs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on the other hand is one of my favorite companies in the information technology space because it has proven to be remarkable at delivering highly targeted advertising that improves the quality of the experience When my wife is on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>she actually looks at the advertisements as she is scrolling because the company has targeted so well to her Its ability to accurately identify customers and deliver the correct advertising to drive consumer behavior is astounding Visa is another company Ive admired for its ability to become a part of everyday life My personal transactions were going through MasterCard NYSE MA but Visa landed a deal with USAA so I started using Visa without any conscious decision It turns out my brand loyalty to MasterCard doesnt run as deep as my desire to use whichever card my bank offers Home Depot is another strong company operating in a bit of a niche market Aside from Lowes NYSE LOW there isnt a great deal of direct competition While the two companies are going head to head constantly the limitation to only one major competitor creates a much better environment for oligopoly strategies to be maintained ATT NYSE T and Verizon NYSE VZ seemed perfectly happy to share the telecommunications space until Sprint NYSE S decided it was unhappy with the current system and launched a price war With only HD and LOW in this niche there is less incentive for a sudden price war For investors that are interested in momentum investing this is one option to get that technique into your portfolio In my opinion the risk of using this strategy is compounded by the aggressive consumer discretionary allocation In a prolonged bull market this fund should be a solid choice Im not predicting a bear market in the near future but Im also not willing to make a play that is this aggressive I just dont think Id sleep as well with such an aggressive allocation Amazon is the most concerning allocation in the top holdings but I recognize that it is growing market share very effectively by operating without a profit or tiny profits while huge economies of scale are established By the time it raises prices a few points to create earnings I
