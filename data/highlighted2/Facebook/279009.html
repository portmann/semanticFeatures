competitive risk to limit iPhone adoption Shift in carrier distribution will further weigh on shipments Apple NASDAQ AAPL finished on a painful note with the stock down vs of the Nasdaq Composite as new iPhone shipments continue to decelerate and noniPhone products severely disappointed the market due to lack of broad adoption performance is a clear reversal from the return in and it appears as though my bear thesis on AAPL is gradually playing out see Apple The Party Is Over Initiating With A Bearish View Investors will no doubt continue to look for positive catalysts in but I suspect they will likely be disappointed again as the reality of decelerating iPhone sales tough iPhone comps and the eroding ecosystem catch on with investors At the end of the day AAPL generates more than half of its sales from a single product that is highly commoditized and faces higher comps and consumer expectations year after year Additionally the gradual acceptance of Android NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL by the mainstream consumers and the overall improvement of the Android OS are key risks to AAPLs ecosystem see Apple The Challenged Ecosystem First noniPhone products and services will continue to see structural challenges that prevent broad adoption I note that Apple Watch sales continue to be immaterial while Apple Pay has yet to drive adoption to a degree many previously expected With rival <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Google and smaller fintech payment peers such as PayPal NASDAQ PYPL quick to act on the mobile payment front Apple Pay is unlikely to gain an edge over its rivals as the iPhone once did back in Second the changes in the smartphone distribution model in North America as carriers shift to equipment installment plans will push out the handset upgrade cycle presenting another challenge for iPhone adoption Although AAPL has rolled out its own smartphone leasing plans it is difficult to see how it can stimulate demand as consumers are looking to lower their wireless bill after the twoyear handset payment period In the light of the risks to AAPLs hardware and ecosystem I would underweight AAPL in and stick with smartphone makers that are gaining share globally namely ZTE Corp OTCPKZTCOY and Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY As for ecosystem plays my preferred pick remains GOOG given the diversified revenue stream and attractive call options in robotics home automation and other moonshot projects Given that Apple Watch has failed to gain mainstream traction Apple Pay is less disruptive than many had anticipated Apple Music lacks material differentiation and Apple TV fails to take as AAPL capitulates to the content owners many investors wonder what AAPLs next gamechanging product will be In short I continue to see new product challenges for AAPL in which places greater pressure on the company to monetize its noniPhone products such as payments the App Store and other digital services On payments AAPL is slowly losing its edge over other upcoming payment products from internet companies such as FB which is already rolling out PP payment services via its mobile messenger Overtime I believe that FB Messenger could follow its Asian rivals such as WeChat and LINE to incorporate merchant payment services that allow users to pay for restaurants auto repair and other local services judging by FBs recent integration of local services into its mobile messenger The key message here is that the North American payment market has multiple contenders such as GOOG Samsung OTCSSNLF PayPal PYPL and Square NYSE SQ to set a mobile payment standard whereas in Asia the market is more mature and gravitates toward a handful of players ie Alibaba NYSE BABA and Tencent OTCPKTCEHY in China Given that AAPL has yet to gain a material firstmover advantage over Android Pay or Samsung Pay the market is wide open for AAPLs rivals to take additional share which is ultimately a negative to AAPLs ecosystem Just last week ATT NYSE T became the latest carrier to shift from twoyear contracts to an equipment installment plan Now all four major US carriers are encouraging EIP I consider this to be a fundamental headwind for iPhone adoption as it pushes out the smartphone upgrade cycle beyond two years when customers will be qualified for a discount on their monthly bills after they pay off their device Its worth reminding investors that under the EIP model a majority of the subs put off an upgrade because there is significant savings ie monthly payment for the device at the end of the twoyear cycle Given that the premium and midend smartphones are becoming increasingly reliable subs are pushing out the replacement rate of their devices over time and this will significantly impact AAPLs replacement cycle in with increasing magnitude becoming evident in early Additionally there is growing evidence of the enlarging used smartphone market where consumers purchase refurbished iPhones over the latest model While the bulls may argue that this is a positive as it highlights the attractiveness of the iPhone ecosystem I would argue that the growing demand for refurbished iPhones would ultimately impact the demand profile of new iPhones For the skeptics we can just simply take a look at the yy smartphone activation rate that is taking a turn in recent quarters a clear sign of lengthening upgrade cycle and this is a negative to the iPhone adoption AAPL is facing a shrinking ecosystem as handset shipments decline and I believe one solution is to unbundle its services by allowing them to be available on multiple platforms AAPL Musics availability to Android users in China is a clear example of how AAPL is trying to expand its addressable user base when faced with a maturing handset market It makes sense for AAPL to unbundle its services from the hardware to drive higher penetration of its ecosystem and increase its noniPhone revenues Mass commercialization of Apple Pay will be particularly necessary given that AAPL is on equal footing with Android and Samsung Pay in mobile payments in North America similar to that of the competitive dynamic AAPL is facing in China where it is competing against Tencent and BABA That said it is necessary for AAPL to introduce an Apple Pay app for Android to drive payment penetration in noniPhone devices The integration of merchant services such as movieentertainment food delivery travel booking and so forth is a logical step given how FB recently embedded local services with ecommerce functions in its mobile app Failing to scale up its services will likely make AAPL lose out against FB in mobile payments Looking at other AAPL services I can argue that Music iTunes iBooks and Apple TV lack material differentiation against those offered by rivals so it does not make much sense to isolate its services only on the iOS platform Ultimately I see Apple unbundling other services such as iTunes Movies and Apple Pay to drive adoption of its services I note that AAPLs decision to make iTunes mainstream planted the seed for the adoption of its ecosystem well before the launch of the first iPhone The mass commercialization of Apple Music is the second catalyst for this trend and we can certainly see the unbundling trend to flow to iBooks Movies and Apple Pay could potentially be a rocky year for AAPL investors in light of risks on higher iPhone comps poor traction in noniPhone products and decelerating iPhone demand due to the shift in carrier distribution models I remain cautious on AAPL stock and prefer FB and GOOG as my top tech
