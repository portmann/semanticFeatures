class='textDiv'>The Flowerscom <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger Bot Could Be A Game Changer FLOWERSCOM Inc NASDAQFLWS Seeking Alpha The company produced a bot for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger which allows users to place an order in under minutes Having a bot handle orders should save on labor costs and allow for higher margins The companys gourmet food segment is growing very strongly and looks to be a real growth engine in future quarters We believe there is upside over the next months But if the bot is more successful than we imagined this could take the share price higher We have been following Flowerscom NASDAQ FLWS for a few months now and weve been pleased with the progress it has made Now with Mothers Day just under a week away we have decided to look at the progress it has made and recent developments that we believe may allows it to produce bumper revenue growth next year Since we invested in the company there was an exciting development which we believe will be a great boost to sales in the future In truth it may take some time but eventually we see the potential for big things from the companys decision to build a bot for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Messenger This will allow users to order flowers directly from inside the app via the bot We were very impressed with the companys innovation and look forward to seeing how it performs in the future The fact that Mark Zuckerberg showed it off as part of his keynotes speech was a nice bit of promotion for the company also The world of chatbots may be relatively new to a lot of us but many believe it will be the next big thing in technology Whether it be transferring money to friends or booking travel tickets the future of bots looks like making life and technology ever more integrated TechCrunch suggested <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messengers Bot Store could be the most important launch since the Apples App Store Although there will be numerous competing bot platforms we feel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a real advantage at present with Messenger already heavily in use We have little doubt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has plans to monetize this in the future possibly by taking a cut of any sales and thus we feel sure it will help bot makers like Flowers gain the valuable exposure they need to grow revenue through it The company already has a strong presence on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which we feel it should be able to leverage to grow its bot use We should hopefully learn more about Flowers bot in the next quarterly update in August We certainly are very keen to hear how it is progressing and any projections the company has From what we have read so far from those that have used it the feedback is very positive with reports that it takes around minutes to place a personalized order If this does take off the savings that Flowers will make on labor will be a big boost to margins Despite the companys name Flowerscom is far more than just flowers We believe there is a great deal of growth in its Gourmet Food and Gift Baskets segments It posted impressive quarterly results recently In its third quarter the segment grew sales by yearoveryear to million making it account for of its sales in the quarter dominated by Valentines day This was especially pleasing considering the weak US retail sales data We expect to see the segment continue its strong performance in the fourth quarter with Mothers Day being especially busy We feel the rise of Flowers gourmet food segment is very promising for the company As the charts above show the business is largely seasonal But because gourmet food can be enjoyed all year around rather than flowers which tend to sell most at key events such as Valentines day and Mothers day eventually revenue may be more evenly spread throughout the quarters We still believe a price to sales ratio of is fair for the company Eventually we feel investors will be willing to pay upwards of times sales but for now is the right fit in our eyes We have maintained our full year sales forecast of billion which gives us a price target of This is based on the assumption of there being million shares outstanding at the end of the fiscal year Looking to next year we think the positive momentum from its gourmet foods segment will keep sales growing and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>chatbots growth will come into play helping ramp up full year earnings to billion Based on the same assumptions as before this gives us a price target for FY of a return We believe the Messenger bot could be a real game changer for the company and give it a competitive advantage over every other florist in the United States A great investment today
