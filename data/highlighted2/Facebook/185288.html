class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>And Instagram Whats The Upside And What Are The Risks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha The trend in growth is astonishing but the management team also is missing out on a lot of opportunities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues to grow but has become more mobile app dependent which has proven to be a sound strategy Adblocking has become a meaningful risk factor and while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is wellpositioned to tackle these problems PC ads may generate lower CTRs and CPMs over time However revenues and earnings are still growing at a healthy pace and the company is much better positioned to handle the risk factors when compared to other media companies Things have become a lot more interesting when it comes to Instagram lately and Im well aware that many of you already know that they have reached million monthly active users It was a few years ago when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB was also floating around the same levels However many things have changed in the advertising space over those years and as such its fair to say that every incremental user gain that Instagram experiences will add substantially more to topline growth than in the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>back in However there also sre things that the management team has been slow to execute upon as users are extremely sensitive to advertising in the Instagram feed That being the case native advertising seems to be the most effective form of advertising for mobile devices and as such I anticipate more and more publishers to adopt native advertising However integrating these type of ad formats becomes somewhat difficult for programmatic ad exchanges and while many publishers are sensitive to the commoditization of ad inventory the advantage to thirdparty attribution also offsets some of the downside to commodity like pricing These days there are advanced technologies to track user behavior from one website to the next and if the user clicks on an advertisement its likely that the advertisement will continue to follow the user from one web page to the next Hence advertisers want to know how to effectively attribute conversions and retarget ads at their intended audience However the only way to really understand the impact of an advertisement is through pooling data onto a thirdparty network that tracks behavior across multiple web publishing platforms In other words programmatic ad networks are the way to go Ad networks have become much more crucial in this day and age and to address this issue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has devised Atlas which is a very promising technology but it doesnt have as extensive of a publishing network as perhaps Double Click Ad Manager Going forward attribution is key to the growth potential of Instagram and as such it would be fair to say that the company really needs to develop a strategy for integrating its adbidding system into a broader network so advertisers can understand the behavior of the user and whether that user decided to purchase a product after viewing the ad maybe days or months down the road Of course if a user purchases the product then Instagram will get a cut off the action via conversions and it substantiates the CPMs they charge to advertisers Of course none of this has actually happened yet and only a small group of advertisers are allowed to purchase ads on Instagram The mobile app tends to operate on an older Madison Avenue model of selling ads directly to companies Of course they offer a user interface and custom backend dashboard for advertisers to understand the effectiveness of their campaign but its not like data can be pooled together into a comprehensive ad campaign manager Therefore the potential to further monetize Instagram is there but obviously the lack of involvement in programmatic adbidding will start to take a toll on growthr even as platform specific advantages and growth in audience metrics were to offset some of that impact The growth in mobile programmatic has been huge and while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is typically integrated into some programmatic ad managers Instagram is left in Facebooks shadow In a sense this has limited the growth rate of Instagrams ad revenue and its why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt report Instagram results separately as its a small fraction thats less than of the consolidated companys revenue Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt in any hurry to quickly monetize Instagram as the core social platform generates enough growth to keep shareholders happy However any extra bit does help and its fair to say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>needs to develop Instagrams monetization model if it wants to sustain mid growth for the next couple years Furthermore there are some threats to the business model and while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is well positioned to combat those risks theres no denying that ad blocking software has been a consistent reoccurring risk factor amongst web publishers In alone it has been estimated that billion in ad revenue was lost to ad blocking software according to the Adobe ad blocking report Native advertising on mobile devices seem somewhat resistant to these risk factors However going forward it becomes a lot less effective to advertise on web browsers and conventional PCs Mobile web browsers also are starting to block ads and of mobile Firefox users currently block ads Not to mention of the US online population blocked ads during the second quarter of I anticipate that there will be meaningful growth in adsensitive users and the bestknown workaround is to package the webbased experience into mobile applications and sell the ads via a thirdparty ad network or sell directly to mobile advertisers Apple NASDAQ AAPL also has backed these efforts by integrating software tools into the iOS developer kit so ads can be blocked on the Safari mobile browser Of course Apple has plenty of incentive to block ads because its not dependent on an admodel and would weaken tech rivals that rely on advertising to fuel investment into software and product development Of course there are losers in this transition and all of the major publishers are losing money as a result of Apples attempt to black ads on Safari So going forward its easy to anticipate Facebooks core web audience becomes a lot less efficient in terms of CPMs and CTRs and its likely that mobile DAUs and MAUs become a much bigger factor to growth going forward hence the importance of Instagram because its a mobile only platform Do all these risk factors make the stock a sell Not really For the most part <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a stalwart among web publishers primarily because they have already addressed this issue in its business model more effectively than any other web publisher Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has much better data and it is able to market that advantage to advertisers while also integrating that data into programmatic admanagers like AdRoll for example The stocks you really have to be wary of are the ones that have a very limited mobile presence or face competitive dynamics that are very difficult to overcome and have not successfully transitioned to a webpublishing model Good examples of this include News Corporation NASDAQ FOXA New York Times NYSE NYT and CBS NYSE CBS To conclude it would be fair to say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a solid play on mobile and desktop advertising The company has a number of successful platforms that are more intuned with what consumers want and as such the business has generated substantial growth in an environment where conventional media players are total losers As such I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation despite risks to the current business model and competitive threats from other publishing platforms We
