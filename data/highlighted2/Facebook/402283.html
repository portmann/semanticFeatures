one particular metric should not go unrecognized The companys ad revenue lean is clearly towards mobile and one more element will soon push it past critical mass In an article I wrote on March this year called Why Shorting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Now Is Not The Right Strategy I argued why I thought shorting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB would be a disastrous idea despite the fact that I still held the opinion that the company was overvalued per current revenue streams My case was built on the following Their video advertising plans are still in a nascent stage and theres a lot of work left to be done before they can reap the benefits User growth was still significantly high because of multiple platforms but they need to be tapped to their full potential The crux of my argument was that since there were too many unknown factors for an investor to dismiss their high valuation as fantasy or wishful thinking it would be a bad idea to short the stock That argument was validated when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock showed a near doubledigit jump after their Q earnings report where they showed improvement on every single metric possible <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>definitely had a stellar quarter as recent articles on SA observed Monthly active users and mobile monthly active users jumped and year over year respectively Total revenue for the quarter jumped by a whopping YoY to reach billion while operating margin expanded by percentage points to touch So the performance was not just user base and top line growth but also bottom line as well But there was one metric that caught my eye more than anything else and it has huge implications for the company not to mention its investors And that is mobile advertising revenue As you can see from the chart below overall ad revenue has steadily grown over a period of time But more to the point mobile ad revenues are contributing in greater and greater measure to overall advertising revenues and thats been the case for at least the past four years as you can see To put it another way you could say that the growth in advertising revenue has been fueled by the growth in mobile advertising Mobile ad revenue as a of total ad revenue now accounts for up by when compared to Q One of the biggest challenges for any social media company is the ability to monetize its user base Ask Twitter NYSE TWTR and MySpace and theyll tell you its true In fact not only has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cracked that code but to boot theyve penetrated the mobile ad space in a way very few companies have If PCs and other nonmobile computing devices were to decline to zero this would be one of the few companies left standing and growing faster than anybody else Again as Ive said before the part of their user base that sits outside of existing revenue streams is where the high valuation is coming from Were at the beginning of a golden age of online video Video isnt just a single kind of content We think its a medium that allows people to interact in a lot of new ways So thats why in addition to normal Internet video were also focusing on more interactive video experiences like Live and video Im a big Game of Thrones fan and the other week HBO and our Oculus team came out with a video of the opening sequence of the show And its now the most watched video on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in any hour period with more than million total views Earlier this month we opened up Live to everyone Live is just one part of our overall video effort but we think it has a lot of potential Friends go Live because its unfiltered and personal Actors and news anchors go Live because they can reach bigger audiences in some cases than they can on even their own shows And if we do a good job we think its something that people will associate with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with interacting with people and not just watching content One example is Toyota used <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for the launch of the RAV Hybrid with Saatchi in Los Angeles They used a very broad video to drive brand awareness They reached over million people in a target demo within three days Then and this is where it gets even more interesting they retargeted people who watched the video with over personalized video ads which were optimized for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram So they were creating a direct response campaign to get people to take specific actions like requesting a quote and finding a specific dealer We saw a point lift in ad recall a sevenpoint lift in message association And right now were using the Lift tool to continue to measure their sales for the and days beyond the campaign to see what happens And were pretty excited about what that shows in terms of how video can be used in a really broadbased way but also a more personal way Despite their excitement over where their video business is going its the ad revenues that theyre going after As they dominate the mobile ad space video will start contributing in a small way at first then start growing in double digits until it finally finds its rightful place as Facebooks chief revenue earner Right now theyre building an entire ecosystem around video and ad revenues from mobile video viewership are the epicenter of that ecosystem Investorspeak How to Invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is clearly positioning itself as a mobile first video first company much the way Microsoft is doing with its mobile first cloud first strategy Because of its massive user base across several social apps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is probably the only company in the world that is in a position to rival Googles success with video advertising via YouTube But Google has hit a wall because they dont have that social element going for them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is going through that wall on to the other side where the real money is YouTubes gross revenues are expected to go from billion in to billion in The moment <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is able to fully monetise its video channels it will be directly targeting YouTubes advertiser base to catch up to that kind of revenue level The bulk of that is going to come from mobile because thats the trend theyve exhibited for regular ads If they can manage that in the next two years itll be yet another feather in a cap thats already starting to resemble a bird But as I slowly drift back to earth from Facebooks current position I see their valuation as being still high but could ultimately be justified One dont even think about shorting FB stock right now because they will be adding new and strong revenue streams over the next two years Two if you cant wait to get in use a dollarcost averaging method to build your position over a year period Your stock buys during any future earnings misses should ideally compensate for elevated levels at other times In the long run youll benefit from owning a piece of a company that will define our online social world over the next several decades Thanks for reading this article and I invite you to follow me by clicking on the Follow link next to my name at the top
