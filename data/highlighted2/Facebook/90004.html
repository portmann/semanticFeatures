opinions expressed are her own June Reuters Some people showed up before dawn Others spent an hour waiting on a line that stretched out the door That was the scene last month when hundreds of job seekers converged on an Amazon hiring event in Chattanooga Tennessee All hoped for fulltime work picking packing and shipping orders at the online retailers local distribution center a warehouse the size of football fields Im blessed to be here one smiling yearold applicant told television reporters That spectacle could be coming this summer to a city near you On May Amazon announced new fulltime job openings at of its distribution centers Many are in communities that doled out generous tax credits and other incentives including million in Kenosha Wisconsin alone to bring Amazon jobs to town So its a good time to ask Are Amazons warehouse jobs worth lining up for Should they be subsidized with taxpayer dollars And what do they mean to the longterm economic health of their host communities On his jobs tour President Barack Obama stopped to deliver a speech at the aforementioned Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga The audience cheered when he called for restoring the middle class through good jobs with good wages But today that same warehouse is hiring at an hour Thats annually or below the poverty line for a family of four Hourly wages at the other warehouses listed in Amazons recent hiring announcement range from in Jefferson Indiana to an hour in Robbinsville New Jersey and Windsor Connecticut Even by industry standards those are some thin paychecks WalMart pays distribution center employees an average hourly wage of said a spokesman for that company Meanwhile Amazons treatment of warehouse workers has been under scrutiny since when an investigation by the Allentown Morning Call newspaper revealed what were quite literally sweatshop conditions When summer temperatures exceeded degrees inside the companys Breinigsville Pennsylvania warehouse managers would not open the loading bay doors for fear of theft Instead they hired paramedics to wait outside in ambulances ready to extract heatstricken employees on stretchers and in wheelchairs the investigation found Workers also said they were pressured to meet evergreater production targets a strategy colloquially known as management by stress Amazon declined to answer the newspapers specific questions about working conditions in the warehouse but eight months after the story was released company officials announced that theyd spent million to retrofit warehouses with air conditioning In my own interviews with dozens of Amazon warehouse workers Ive heard reports of repetitive stress injuries pain and exhaustion Some called themselves Amazombies Others said they tried to think of the job as a free fitness program Those issues relate to job quality What about job quantity On the same day Amazon announced new hires teams from around the globe competed in the firstever Amazon Picking Challenge in Seattle Their goal Build robots that can pick shelved items in this case the objects ranged from rubber ducks to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with enough dexterity to someday replace human hands Amazon already has some Kiva robots that transport shelves of merchandise to human pickers but the act of picking has proved much harder to automate Amazon maintains a very low headcount for its sales volume which rose to billion last year Amazon creates just jobs for every million in sales according to figures in its annual report Compare that with traditional brickandmortar retailers which create jobs at more than twice that rate positions for each million in sales according to an analysis of census data by the nonprofit Institute for Local SelfReliance From a regional perspective this is clearly not a path to greater employment and more economic activity said Stacy Mitchell the organizations director Your particular community may come out a bit ahead in terms of job numbers but it comes at the expense of your neighbors She and other community development advocates worry that with its lowcost merchandise and expanding sameday delivery service Amazon will eviscerate smaller businesses that put more of their earnings into hiring workers The company is already famous for pursuing massive growth while accepting razorthin profit margins Amazon already has an edge over traditional brickandmortar retailers in the states where it pays no sales tax And local governments have also strengthened its advantage lavishing Amazon with more than million in tax credits and other incentives since according to Subsidy Tracker a database created by the economic watchdog Good Jobs First Tossing out tax incentives for Amazon jobs might be good shortterm politics but when it comes to lasting employment let the buyer beware In the city of Coffeyville Kansas showered Amazon with more than million in infrastructure improvements and cash incentives for a millionsquarefoot distribution center Soon Amazon was one of the areas largest employers But its sales strategy kept changing Since sameday shipping requires distribution hubs that
