class='textDiv'>Next Quarter Could Be A BackBreaking Event For Apple Shareholders Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha UBS published a report on Friday clarifying their recent claims on ASPs and while the data only pertains to the United States the evidence is convincing I still anticipate the iPhone C inch variant to be a negative headwind on gross margins and pricing mix I believe a cheaper device will not unlock incremental unit demand This is primarily due to device cannibalization along all the pricing tiers as a inch model will not only sway highend buyers but the lowend as well The top institutions have trimmed their Apple holdings throughout and the various concerns expressed by institutional investors have not been resolved In other words nobodys buying Tims story Finally the weakness in price action could be exacerbated if Analog Devices offers below consensus guidance for Q I maintain a highly cautious outlook In an article I published yesterday with regard to Apple NASDAQ AAPL I found some fault with the UBS analysts research when pertaining to ASPs However in a research note released last Friday Steve Milunovich helps to clarify the ASP dynamic for the upcoming quarter and for the most part the survey data is somewhat reassuring in that it indicates storage per unit had increased in the past quarter to offset the unit mix shift to prior generation models As such there may be much more momentum to the pricing than I had originally anticipated However Im not exactly certain about unit growth on aggregate going into the next quarter as this data only pertains to the United States so the data wont be reflective of China Japan and rest of world Consumer Intelligence Research Partners CIRP has updated its survey findings of initial USonly iPhone s demand for the first days and compared it to the introduction a year ago The results confirm a slower uptake of iPhone s than of the iPhone but the associated ASP decline appears to be offset by increased spending on storage The mix of the newest iPhone models is less in that the older s still are of sales compared to the s at just a year ago Average storage per device registered at GB up YoY and a new high For the most part the US segment will generate a flat quarter in terms of iPhone ASPs Whether that carries over into the rest of world is a different issue After all the United States isnt nearly as price sensitive when compared to other foreign markets When using the data from UBS I come up with a retail price point which is about lower than UBS at The reason for this discrepancy is due to their inclusion of GB variants of the iPhone and Plus which is not a model currently sold via Apple Verizon NYSE VZ or ATT NYSE T The only carriers offering the GB variation of prior generation are TMobile NASDAQ TMUS and Sprint NYSE S which collectively combine for market share of the US telecom market Therefore I found the device mix assumptions to be a little aggressive for GB as its more likely that Sprint and TMobile are clearing older inventory and Apples actual sellin of GB variants of prior generation ended in Q FY Of course its hard to verify this but I arrive at this assumption due to the lack of an iPhone and Plus GB listing on the Apple retail website Furthermore the I come up with is around lower than the weighted average retail price that UBS recently published The prior year is easier to work with because ASP data is readily available When working off of prior year figures I believe the retail markup is currently which means Apples ASP from each iPhone approximates to This amounts to a reduction in ASP from prior year from just the United States alone Thats a reduction in pricing from prior year which indicates that storage upgrades offset the impact from prior generation unit mix The degree to which it helped relieve the ASP dynamic is startling but I believe that the sale of a to variant iPhone C with current generation parts will mitigate ASPs this year Credit Suisse believes that a lowerpriced variant will generate million unit sales over the course of FY When working off of those figures my ASP drops to roughly inline with my prior comments This drop in ASP assumes no further incremental improvement to demand as there are plenty of older version models that would be cannibalized by the C Furthermore based on that unit mix billion in iPhone revenue seems likely which compares to billion in the prioryear For Apple to report yearoveryear growth inline with consensus views Apple would need to generate million iPhone C shipments totaling to million unit shipments in FY Thats million more iPhone shipments than prioryear with the backdrop of weakening supply chain orders Not to mention million units from iPhone C without the usual CY Q holiday season lift Wow Id have to be delusional or believe in the existence of fairy tales and dragons to buy into that model assumption It also seems highly probable that consumers will buy the smaller screen size to avoid paying the premium for a bigger screen as it would appeal to Apple purists that prefer smaller phones They still gain the features of current generation models However the C will have one drawback as it wont have force touch capability which indicates that Apple is trying to minimize on some production cost The differential in sales price and costs isnt really closed with the exclusion of components and a smaller screen so there will be negative impact on gross margins Force touch is not a must have and from personal experience I noticed very little difference in functionality with my MacBook Pro in comparison to my MacBook Air In other words the refresh in Apple products between and inclusive of better processing cam OS and force touch will do little to convince recent buyers unless theyre a real diehard like me In CY Q the institutional weighting of Apple amongst top holders declined from to qoq according to Morgan Stanley Research This implies a reduction in holdings among the top institutions in the span of three months The stock cratered in response to falling institutional interest across the board and I know some of you on Seeking Alpha have accused individual investment banking firms but quite frankly everyone is exiting the Apple trade with the exception of nonactively managed funds that are index weighted Some hedge fund managers have added to their positions but the consensus view among managers has been to sell Apple and buy other alphagenerating tech names Companies like Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN trade at much higher multiples but offer distinct opportunities that arent as tied to hardware These are three names I have consistently recommended over the course of while I have had to revise my price target and stance on Apple on numerous occasions Ill explain my thought process on that in a different article The stock has not generated alpha when compared to the SP The weakness in performance will likely continue given the low probability of a meaningful sales and earnings beat for Q FY and concerns over unit demand throughout the course of FY Institutional investors are interpreting the weakness in orders as both a Q and Q headwind I think the reduction in orders is going to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly due to guidance that will be below consensus Yes below consensus because the sellside is extremely hesitant to model weakening sales as evidenced by recent reports Its almost like Apple is set up to fail due to the midcycle iPhone weakness and lack of confirmation of any meaningful improvement in Apples supply chain While many of the analysts are backing up their analysis the sentiment has been underwhelming In some cases stock prices can be a good leading indicator Analog Devices NASDAQ ADI is expected to report earnings on November th tomorrow from the time of writing and quite frankly analysts are anticipating a cut in guidance for next quarter which corresponds to weakening mix of iPhone SS variants It will be easier to ascertain global mix as opposed to the US mix following Analogs guide Assuming Analog does come in with a weak guide we have even more evidence from the Apple supply chain that things are in fact worsening Thats pretty bad and quite frankly Tim Cook has lamented about analysts in the past He even openly declared that he flat out disagrees with the financial models of analysts on the prior conference call Despite the flamboyant gesturing made by the CEO no one is buying his tune this year with the exception of the retail crowd Now either the top holders of Apple are flat out stupid or maybe they caught a whiff of what is likely to happen next year My guess Theyre getting flashbacks of and if we see a repeat of weakening sentiment in conjunction with weak results the stock will crater As such I continue to maintain my hold rating The risktoreward doesnt become very compelling until we see the stock floating at to In other words I truly believe this next quarter could be a backbreaker for investors and due to that fact Ive changed my stance quite considerably This isnt for the sake of sensationalism In fact I realized that at some point I would have to change my tune on Apple I just didnt realize to
