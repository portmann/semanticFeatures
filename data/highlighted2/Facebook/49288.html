style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is facing political pressure in the developing world over net neutrality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is also trying to avoid the problems Google had in offering publishing content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now a dominant player in social but will have to reach a mature valuation to be worth buying Given that technology is now our dominant industry it is inevitable that any fastgrowing tech company will at some point have to master politics and on a global scale This is now the challenge at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has managed in its short life to gain a huge footprint in many international markets like India Thus it now faces the issue of net neutrality It was the US FCC decision upholding net neutrality the idea that Internet access should not favor one companys content over others which began the controversy That is because Facebooks InternetOrg initiative which is aimed at opening up access to the very poor around the world does not offer open neutral access to the resource CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been forced to defend that proposition and to personally back down from Indian protests saying that he is turning Internetorg into a platform rather than a walled garden featuring <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and other services like the BBC it chooses to support By letting other Internet Service Providers rather than just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>choose what content to support <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>hopes to deflect criticism away from its choices This is being sold as pushing the service out to developers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is also facing increased pressure from publishers who are demanding a bigger cut of ad revenues on articles people reach using the service The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>response is an Instant Articles feature where publishers posting stories directly to the service will get of the ad revenue from them or all the revenue if the publishers sell ads themselves Whether either of these initiatives work in stifling political criticism isnt nearly as important as the fact that politics will continue to hamper growth going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has seen how companies like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL can get into costly political trouble offering something free that people no longer had like search and it is determined to navigate those political channels more successfully This is happening against the backdrop of a market where all social stocks including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are in trouble due to the financial stumbles of companies like Yelp NYSE YELP and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD leading to a general disenchantment with the social networking space in which people rather than data points are the focus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself has not yet stumbled Its March quarter revenue of billion was up from last years quarterly revenue of billion and while net income fell yearoveryear to million from million its heavy investment in cloud infrastructure is making it independent of companies like AmazonCom NASDAQ AMZN thus more selfsustaining than other social platforms Still relative margins are declining growth rates are declining as numbers naturally get bigger and the stock is under pressure down from a recent high of share to the current level of This is nothing compared to the disasters at LinkedIn and Yelp both of which lost of their value after earnings and have yet to get a bounce back <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now considered the established leader in social just as Google is the leader in search giving it a premium valuation Should it manage to just maintain its present revenue pace however delivering billion in sales for all of it would have a pricetosales ratio of The expectation built into the stock then is that it continues to grow rapidly bringing the forward pricetosales ratio below and any failure to hit that mark will be punished severely My prediction is that politics will play a role in slowing Facebooks growth going forward and you will be able to catch it at lower levels later this year Source Can <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Win At
