#A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>reached billion DAUs Upon closer examination DAUs have decelerated and growth rates will trend slightly lower <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has already saturated of the market And if growth were to continue at the current pace Facebooks saturation will reach in Without significant reductions in PC and bandwidth prices Facebooks MAU growth will eventually stabilize at per year Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can offset some of this impact through pricing and other mobile products Also theres some potential for more rapid Internet penetration so Im still bullish In a recent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>post Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB had accomplished billion in daily active users Of course the daily active users figure isnt exactly going to be billion when they do report in the next quarter because they use a day average to express their engagement growth Needless to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>reported million daily active users in Q which would imply usage growth based on their recent milestone announcement which compares to usage growth between Q and Q When working with averages you need both a combination of both lower values and higher values so the mean can gradually improve In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would need to have billion users by the end of the third quarter for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to report billion in daily active users when averaging million users with billion users The daily active user figure would have to increase by approximately million so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can average out to billion daily active users This would sustain sequential growth and a yearoveryear growth rate This is pretty important because its much easier to sustain ad monetization when both the user base and the amount of engagement per user increases Furthermore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been able to increase ad pricing on ad units which correspondingly compounds the growth of the top line Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would need to see some acceleration in terms of daily active users over the course of September as it would take million in additional users to sustain the sequential growth rate Keep in mind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has increased its DAU figure by million units in the past two months so some compounding or seasonal factor would have to play into the companys ability to sustain its DAU ramp Otherwise investors will have to factor some deceleration in adoption which will reduce growth expectations in the second half of the year The transition between Q and Q tends to be swing quarters sometimes the DAU metrics accelerate and in other cases they decelerate In FY there was deceleration whereas FY had some acceleration It was estimated that in there was saturation of Internet users which implies the potential market is billion in daily active users However Chinese Internet users totaled million so when excluding those users Facebooks total saturation potential was billion in By the end of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>reported billion monthly active users which implied that the product had reached market saturation At this point Facebooks total market size will need to grow more quickly than the remaining pool of viable users otherwise growth will continue to decelerate eMarketer estimates that by the number of total Internet users will grow to billion in from billion in at a growth rate In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will reach a point where its fully saturating every additional Internet user that comes online When excluding China I estimate there will be billion Internet users in And if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues to grow users at a growth rate the company will reach billion users by Thats a saturation rate Theres no way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can exceed saturation This indicates that longrun growth of MAUs will eventually revert to a growth rate unless cheaper PCs are sold into emerging markets and bandwidth costs decline more substantially I go over the implications of lowercost PCs in an article I recently published But basically growth in PC adoption is the biggest determinant to Facebooks MAU ramp over the next five years Without a massive shift in PC and bandwidth pricing growth in users will be limited However the company can offset user deceleration by increasing the amount of activity on other social properties and through higher pricing on ads So I dont anticipate revenues to rapidly decelerate even as I anticipate a meaningful rate of deceleration between FY and FY Therefore I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation as the good still outweighs much of the
