class='textDiv'>No Mind Of Its Own Seeking Alpha Disclosure I amwe are long FAST MS MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Oil continues to be the only story that matters or that at least has a tight association with the direction that stocks take Rather than looking forward as conventional wisdom may still believe stocks have become more reactive than ever as its difficult to see what catalysts may be ahead Last weeks spike in oil and stocks may not have had any catalyst other than having been oversold It will take more than that to sustain a rally With the early part of the Republican primaries having focused on one candidates hair it reminded me of that old complaint that people sometimes made that their hair had a mind of its own For better or worse the political hair jokes have pretty much finally run their course as the days tick down to a more substantive measure of a candidates character and positions on more weighty matters While it was nice seeing some gains for the week and finally having some reason to not curse theres no mistaking the reality that the stock market hasnt had much of a mind of its own after the first trading days of the new year Bad hair days would have been a lot easier to take than the bad market days that have characterized much of the past weeks The combination of China and the price of oil have led the market down and up on a daily basis and sometimes made it do flips during the course of a single trading day With the price of oil having climbed about during the week from its multiyear lows the market did what it hadnt been able to do in and actually put together back to back daily gains Maybe it was entirely coincidental that the hours that saw the resurgence in the price of crude oil were the same hours that saw the market string consecutive gains but if so that coincidence is inescapable While thats encouraging theres not too much reason to believe that the spike in the price of oil was anything more than brave investors believing that oil was in a severely oversold position and that its recent descent had been too fast and too deep That pretty much describes the stock market as well but what you havent seen in is the presence of those brave souls rushing in to pick up shares in the same belief Of the many factoids that were spun this week was that neither the DJIA nor the NASDAQ had even a single stock that had been higher in That may have changed by Fridays closing bell but then the factoid would be far less fun to share Instead oil has taken the fun out of things and has dictated the direction for stocks and the behavior of investors If anything stocks have been a trailing indicator instead of one that discounts the future as conventional wisdom still credits it for doing despite having put that quality on hiatus for years That was back when the stock market actually did have a mind of its own Now its more likely to hear the familiar refrain that many of us probably heard growing up as we discovered the concept of peer pressure So if your best friend is going to jump out of the window is that what youre going to do too With earnings not doing much yet to give buyers a reason to come out from hiding the coming week has two very important upcoming events but its really anyones guess how investors could react to the forthcoming news There is an FOMC announcement scheduled for Wednesday assuming that the nations capital is able to dig out from under the blizzards drifts and then the week ends with a GDP release With a sudden shift in the belief that the economy was heading in one and only one direction following the FOMCs decision to increase interest rates uncertainty is again in the air What next weeks events may indicate is whether we are back to the bad news is bad news or the bad news is good news mindset My bad may be an appropriate start with the economy not seeming to be showing any real signs of going anywhere With corporate revenues and unadulterated earnings not being terribly impressive the oil dividend still not materializing and retail sales weak the suggestion by Blackrocks NYSE BLK Larry Fink last week that there could be layoffs ahead would seem to be the kind of bad news that would be overwhelmingly greeted for what it would assuredly represent When the FOMC raised interest rates the market had finally come around to believing that a rise in rates was good news as it had to reflect an improving economic situation If the next realization is that the improving situation would last for only a month you might think the reception would be less than effusive As usual the weeks potential stock selections are classified as being in the Traditional Double Dip Dividend Momentum or PEE categories Last week was the first week since or that I made no trades at all and had no exdividend positions No new positions were opened nor were any call or put rollovers executed Other than a few exdividend positions this week Im not certain that it will be any different from last week I havent opened very many new positions of late having to go back nearly months for a week with more than a single new position having been opened Unlike much of the past years when market pullbacks just seemed like good times to get good stocks at better prices the past few months have been offering good prices that just kept getting better and better If you had been a buyer those better and better prices were only seen that way by the next series of prospective buyers who themselves probably came to bemoan how less they could have paid if only they waited another day or two The gains of the final two days of last week make me want to continue the passivity Anyone having chased any of those precious few days higher lately has ended up as disappointed as those believing they had picked up a bargain At some point it will pay to chase stocks higher and at some point it will pay to run after value The biggest interests that I have for the week are both earnings related trades Both Apple NASDAQ AAPL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB report earnings this week If youre looking for a stock in bear market correction over the past months you dont have to go much further then Apple Along with some of his other holdings Apple has punished Carl Icahn in the same manner as has been occurring to mere mortals Of course that decline is far better than the decline fro just a few days ago before Apple joined the rest of the market in rally mode Interestingly the option market doesnt appear to be pricing in very much uncertainty with earnings upcoming this week with an implied move of only Since a ROI can only be achieved at a strike level thats within that range I wouldnt be very excited in the sale of out of the money puts prior to earnings The risk reward proposition just isnt compelling enough for me However if Apple does drop significantly after earnings then there may be reason to consider the sale of puts There is some support at and then a few additional support levels down to but then it does get precarious all the way down to Apple hasnt been on everyones lips for quite a while and we may not get to find out just how little it has also been on peoples wrists Regardless if the support levels between and are tested after earnings the put premiums should still remain fairly high If trying this strategy and then faced with possible assignment of shares an eye has to be kept on the announcement of the exdividend date which could be as early as the following week While Apple is almost lower over the past months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been virtually unchanged although it was almost higher over the past year Its implied move is next week but the risk reward is somewhat better than with Apple if considering the sale of puts prior to earnings as a ROI for the sale of a weekly option could be obtained outside of the range defined by the option market As with Apple however the slide could be more precarious as the support levels reflect some quick and sharp gains over the past years For those that have been pushing a short strategy for GameStop NYSE GME and it has long been one of the most heavily of shorted stocks for quite some time the company has consistently befuddled those who have had very logical reasons for why GameStop was going to fall off the face of the earth Lately though theyve had reason to smile as shares are lower although on a more positive note for others its only trailing the SP by in Theyve had some reasons to smile in the past as well as the most recent plunge mirrors one from years ago As with Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>perhaps the way to think about any dalliance at this moment as the trend is lower and as volatility is higher is through the sale of put options and perhaps considering a longer time outlook A week contract for example at a strike level below this past Fridays close could still offer a ROI If going that route it would be helpful to have strategies at hand to potentially deal with an exdividend date in the March cycle and earnings in the April cycle One of the companies that I own that is going exdividend this week is Fastenal NASDAQ FAST Ive long liked this company although Im not enamored with my last purchase which I still own and was purchased a year ago As often as is the case I consider adding shares of Fastenal right before the exdividend date and this week is no different What is different is its price and with a day market rally that helped it successfully test its lows I would be interested in considering adding an additional position With only monthly options available Fastenal is among the earliest of earnings reporters each quarter so there is some time until the next challenge Fastenal does however occasionally preannounce or alter its guidance shortly before earnings so surprises do happen which is one of the reasons Im still holding shares after a full year has passed In the past months Fastenal has started very closely tracking the performance of Home Depot NYSE HD While generally Fastenal has lagged in the past months it has outperformed Home Depot which was one of a handful of meaningfully winning stocks in Finally Morgan Stanley NYSE MS is also exdividend this week Along with the rest of the financials Morgan Stanleys share price shows the disappointment over the concern that those interest rate hikes over the rest of the year that had been expected may never see the light of day This weeks FOMC and GDP news can be another blow to the hopes of banks but if I was intent upon looking for a bargain this week among many depressed stocks I may as well get the relationship started with a dividend and a company that I can at least identify the factors that may make it move higher or lower Premiums Enhanced by Earnings Apple PM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>PM Remember these are just guidelines for the coming week The above selections may become actionable most often coupling a share purchase with call option sales or the sale of covered put contracts in adjustment to and consideration of market movements The overriding objective is to create a healthy income stream for the week with reduction of trading risk
