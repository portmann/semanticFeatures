Alpha Currency exchange headwinds figure prominently this earnings season impacting many reports thus far <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>lost of revenue growth to currency headwinds The dollar has weighed on many companies thus far this earnings season Although there has been recent weakness in the dollar against other currencies we see it impacting many companies this earnings season DuPont NYSE DD was able to outperform expectations largely because the US dollar weakened against most currencies in the first quarter of this year Unfortunately for DuPont the dollar was still strong enough to shave off sales Mondelez International NASDAQ MDLZ the maker of Oreos and Cadbury chocolates was another recent victim reporting EPS lower by cents Management forecasted currency to shave points off revenue but this is down from the points previously expected Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL seemed to be smacked pretty hard by the negative impact of currency Management reported a negative currency impact on our revenues YoY of mn or mn after the benefit of our hedging program Lets revisit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and see how they fared as well as examine some other features of their earnings report issues April th Facebooks Rest of World revenue growth and the growth generally was largely impacted by currency headwinds once again Foreign exchange headwinds shaved off Q ad revenue to growth instead of on a constant currency basis Q total revenue lost as well from growth on constant currency down to because of the strong dollar In the Europe and rest of world regions ad revenue was particularly impacted by foreign exchange headwinds Setting aside currency headwinds all regions exceeded constant currency ad revenue growth So although FBs revenue growth was largely robust the dollar remains a culprit Hundreds of millions of dollars are lost to the foreign exchange phenomenon and it does not show any sign of letting up What else do we see impacting FBs price action <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced a proposal to create a new class of stock CEO Mark Zuckerberg was relatively straightforward in his reasoning Ill be able to keep founder control of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>so we can continue to build for the long term This nonvoting Class C capital stock is intended to mitigate succession risk and voting dilution over the long haul while encouraging Mark to remain involved with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in a leadership role Each Class A and B share held by stockholders will receive two new Class C shares as a onetime stock dividend The difference of course is that Class C shares are nonvoting shares and the proposal will be subject to shareholder approval in June Investors familiar with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are no doubt aware it has overcome the challenge it previously encountered with mobile In the most recent quarter mobile ad revenue constitutes of advertising revenue Last years high watermark was eclipsed by over YoY Mobile MAUs were bn a YoY increase and total MAUs reached mn In essence what we are seeing is a continued adoption of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>properties as a robust advertising platform Only a few weeks ago the advent of Instant Articles and chatbots for Messenger appear to be further catalysts to attract ad dollars Last week industry reports showed online ad revenue in the US alone reached bn in a increase from We see that mobile is continuing to attract a larger share of those dollars not only reflected in Facebooks earnings mix but also from independent observers like PWC The single most impressive metric we saw in Facebooks report is its Average Revenue Per User Obviously an important statistic that demonstrates how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is monetizing its over bn users ARPU helps investors understand what a user is really worth to <span style='background-color:

are generating from each user especially while overall user numbers are continuing to grow is very impressive We did not receive much color on the rollout of Instant Articles to all publishers We first covered this new feature some time ago explaining that widespread embrace could catalyze further advertising revenue growth since publishers will be compelled to use the native experience and display ads through Facebooks ad service Importantly we expect time spent on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to rise as a result of Instant Articles This feature makes it so that any publisher around the world now can deliver a really great native experience instantly with no latency in loading it And were just seeing that people like to engage with that a lot more Higher engagement should help ARPU inch higher as well We were buyers ahead of the earnings report on the recent weakness because of how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is uniquely positioned as the main competitor to Google in digital advertising Although we believe the PE of remains expensive we believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has some
