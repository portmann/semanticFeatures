impartiality of Facebooks news feature is being called into question This time the social network claims itaccidentally obstructed all links to the leaked Democratic National Committee emails published by Wikileaks just ahead of the partys convention This past Friday morning the infamous publisher of anonymous leaks released nearly internal emails between members of the formal governing body of the Democratic Party The news where it was seen provoked outrage especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders who was shown to have received unfair treatment by officially impartial party
