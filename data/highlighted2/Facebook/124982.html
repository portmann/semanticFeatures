PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL Includes AAPL AXP BABA EBAY FB GOOG GOOGL by Opportunity Hunter The company has an extremely wide moat in mobile payments which is of great value to potential acquirers Although pricey acquiring PayPal means the acquirer would have access to hundreds of millions of users and a dominant position in mobile payments PayPal NASDAQ PYPL was recently spun off from Ebay NASDAQ EBAY and for the first time in over years both the public market and companies will be able to own a stake in the mobile payments behemoth I firmly believe that PayPal will become a major target for acquisition by companies who are heavily pushing into the mobile payment space Of the many firms that are developing their own mobile payment solutions the primary companies with enough cash to acquire PayPal are Apple NASDAQ AAPL Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Alibaba NYSE BABA and American Express NYSE AXP This article will lay out why acquiring PayPal makes logical sense for each of these companies and how the acquisition would fit into their game plans Whereas Ebay has been an underperformer recently PayPal continues to grow impressively and has accounted for much of Ebays growth over the past several years Notably PayPal recently eclipsed Ebays core marketplace business prior to the spinoff But that isnt all PayPal is forecasting revenue growth over the medium term while Ebays core marketplace continues to grow at a mere annually in revenue From any acquirers standpoint a PayPal acquisition means buying in to a business that has robust growth and would place the firm at the top of the leaderboard in the competitive digital wallet space Not to mention PayPal is closing in on million active users In a June study PayPal was far ahead of any other digital wallet firms solution in terms of usage note the following graph excludes Apple Pay which has yet to demonstrate much usage around Apples user base In fact almost of iPhone users with access to Apple Pay have never used it In some ways Apple seems like it really doesnt need to acquire PayPal and is unlikely to do so altogether The company already has an installed base of its Apple Pay solution across every iPhone iPad Air iPad Mini and Apple Watch and this infrastructure will only increase by millions of devices each quarter On top of this Apple has partnered with the major credit cards Visa Mastercard and American Express as well as with a large amount of banks to support its mobile payments efforts This gives it the greatest level of overall depth into mobile payments out of the other potential acquirers further pegging the question of why acquire PayPal For Apple it is all about competition I think that dominating mobile payments could be the next big step in delivering a crushing blow to Android achieved through maximizing the mobile utility made available through the Apple ecosystem Simultaneously Apple has also had difficulty with adoption of its Apple Pay system among consumers so integrating Apple Pay with PayPal and having the two in Apples portfolio would almost inevitably lead to much higher adoption of Apples own platform We also cant ignore the pink elephant that lies in the amount of cash Apple has With over billion Apple is in the best financial position to acquire PayPal seeing that an acquirer would likely have to pay a sizeable premium to the billion market cap PayPal currently has For every other acquirer they would either have to issue a meaningful amount of stock andor utilize the majority of their cash position With this in mind however Apple has demonstrated strict discipline regarding acquisitions with management seeming to prefer unlocking shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends Google could greatly benefit from acquiring PayPal for many of the same reasons Apple could Googles Android Pay and Google Wallet platforms trail Apple in the depth of financial institutions covered For Google a PayPal acquisition would be largely driven by a push for Android to be more competitive with the Apple ecosystem Google has over billion in cash and has been far more aggressive than Apple with acquisitions and has historically had a very diversified pipeline of product and service offerings in comparison to Apple In fact Google has spent a total of nearly billion over the course of its lifetime acquiring companies Android beats iOS in terms of volume and due to the low priced offerings available within the Android ecosystem this trend is unlikely to change in the medium term With the volume oriented approach Android took to the smartphone industry Google could leverage the sheer growing mass of Android users that have access to Android PayGoogle Wallet alongside PayPal to produce an impact that could very easily place Google far ahead of Apple in the mobile payments space It is also worth noting an interesting competitive dynamic between Apple and Google that raises the likelihood of a PayPal acquisition from either end This is the dynamic of service offering where one company introduces a product or service and the other feels compelled to develop or acquire its own to stay competitive For example Google Play and Google Photos are responses to Apples iCloud platform Something that demonstrates Googles degree of seriousness regarding staying competitive with Apple was its planned billion acquisition of Spotify that came very close to closing but was then called off This would have been the largest acquisition Google has ever made with its Motorolla purchase in setting the company back billion Google may not have as much cash as Apple but they certainly have the track record of pursuing large acquisitions To be fair Googles new CFO Ruth Porat seems to be very serious about keeping costs under control predominantly by reducing operating expenses through hiring less people so PayPals more than employees may clash with what Porat hinted at during Googles most recent conference call You can read about this shift in Googles strategy in a recent article I published here An acquisition of PayPal makes a ton of sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>because of the billions of users they have across each of the platforms they own With over billion people on its primary <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform million people using WhatsApp million people on messenger and million on Instagram Facebooks platforms have the most impressive people infrastructure on the planet Mobile payments is an arena that is naturally of great interest to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as the company doesnt really face a chicken and egg problem Each social network or communication derivative <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>owns has already experienced the wondrous power of the network effect so adding in a mobile payment solution is extremely easy The challenging part however is always adoption and that is where an acquisition of PayPal could be just what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>needs Apple and Google would have to wait a rather long time to match the capabilities in mobile payments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has since Apple and Android Pay currently require phones that either run the newest OS or have near field communication NYSEMKT NFC technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is no stranger to acquisitions and in fact has made the single largest acquisition out of the five likely PayPal acquirers The companys billion war chest of cash is growing quickly and is a good starting point for making another large acquisition After paying billion for WhatsApp in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>showed that it was willing to bet big on future growth When asked what his strategy was regarding monetizing WhatsApp Zuckerberg responded Were not looking to drive revenue from WhatsApp in the near term Instead were instead focusing on growth I dont anticipate trying to aggressively grow WhatsApps revenue until the service reaches billions of users The type of strategy Zuckerberg gravitates toward makes an acquisition of PayPal seem to fit even more with his end game plan Scale and grow users explosively and then build a network of product and service offerings around that infrastructure Indeed PayPal fits into the Zuckerberg playbook quite well The Chinese ecommerce giant could very possibly be an acquirer of PayPal mostly to serve as a horizontal consolidation move that would extend the scope of Alipay to a more international scale Alibaba has had massive success with Alipay in China effectively dominating the third party online payment market with nearly market share Alipay has over million registered accounts more than double that of PayPal What Alipay lacks however is international presence Sure PayPal looks relatively small in comparison to Alipay but it definitely has the international breadth Alipay could associate itself with to penetrate nonChinese markets Alibaba has over billion in cash and arguably has the poorest financial discipline out of the other potential acquirers listed in this article Sorry Jack Ma but buying of a Chinese soccer team for nearly million isnt exactly the shrewdest capital allocation Nonetheless Alibaba invests heavily across many tech companies leading many late stage venture rounds in private companies such as Snapchat Lyft Jet and Didi Kuaidi PayPal seems like a great fit for what Alibabas objectives with Alipay are but it will likely take greater financial discipline from managements end to go through with the acquisition due to how large of an undertaking it would be for the company Lastly American Express could be a logical acquirer of PayPal It seems as though more and more places are no longer taking American Express and although the company is the largest credit card firm in the world explosive growth from Visa and Mastercard has recently put the company on the semidefensive All of the major credit card companies are pushing heavily into the digital wallet space and realize that tangible credit cards will eventually become obsolete in much of the developed world A bold acquisition of PayPal from American Express achieves twofold greatly boost growth especially in mobile and prevent Visa Mastercard or any other competitor from gaining even more traction Granted Visa and Mastercard have billion and billion in cash respectively which is miniscule in comparison to American Expresss billion but Visa and Mastercard are growing their cash piles quickly and it wont be long before they are in a financial position strong enough they probably already are to acquire PayPal Out of all the potential acquirers American Express faces the most near term uncertainty in its core payment business as competition is becoming fiercer by the day Acquiring PayPal might be just what American Express needs to reassess its dominance over its payment rivals In fact due to the conditions American Express is in Id argue that it is the most likely company to acquire PayPal PayPals reentrance into public markets makes it a key acquisition prospect for Apple Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Alibaba and American Express The companys strengths uniquely play into each of the acquirers strategy and although the price tag of billion is pricey the deep moat and growth opportunities PayPal brings to the table justifies paying the premium for the company depending on the acquirers position PayPals management isnt be overly enthusiastic about the company being acquired anytime soon as after all it just broke free from Ebay Regardless PayPal is an extremely attractive company to many potential suitors and will eventually be acquired Source Why Apple Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Alibaba Or American Express Will Acquire PayPal Disclosure I amwe
