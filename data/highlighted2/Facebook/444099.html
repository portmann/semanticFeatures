class='textDiv'>Facebooks Crash Can Be Your Gain <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha It has been years since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had significant negative momentum International exposure can lead to lower share price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has experienced strong downward trending in its stock price after reaching a week high of share Today two days after the Brexit and after weeks of pressure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trading at approximately share Is it time to pull the trigger As I will discuss below I am waiting for a better price before considering beginning a position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I like to begin with momentum and how the stock and surrounding sentiment has been performing over the short term When a stocks day moving average crosses BELOW its day I consider this a negative indicator and a sign that the stock has further to drop If instead there is a bullish crossover and the day crosses above the day this can be indicative of positive momentum and higher prices in the future Where does FB stand Taking a look at Facebooks moving averages gives us a somewhat inconclusive result The day has been above the day for the entire calendar This seemed interesting so I expanded the time frame to cover the last years back to July What this revealed was even more stunning Facebooks day moving average has NEVER crossed below its day for the last months It simply has not had a long sustained selloff period and bulls have come in to buy up shares whenever the stock languishes On this factor I believe bulls will do the same before FB languishes for much longer and I rate this a plus for the stock I encourage readers to take a look at the analysis of Facebooks most recent quarter and the impact of a strong dollar Although the quarter saw the dollar weakening from its high the recent Brexit has the dollar strengthening once more As a result I know expect currency to have a worse impact than it did the previous quarter and as a result numbers are going to be lighter than expected Unlike this recent post on FBs users I dont see how a Brexit or even a resulting Eurozone recession will affect people from using and shopping on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The fact remains that people are more likely to purchase something due to a recommendation from a friend and that is the premise that Facebooks advertising model is built upon People still go to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram to see what their friends are doing what their idols are doing and for ideas on what to buy Furthermore digital advertising is expecting to continue growing advertisers may spend less during a recession but onlinemobile ads continue to be the preferred option given their low cost compared to ads like billboards TV commercials and radio spots <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has several positive initiatives to continue attracting advertising dollars Just this past week in fact Facebooks presence at the Cannes Lions advertising event in France where companies like Google Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>have become increasingly part of the show <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>debuted its Creative Hub a new tool an online interface where agencies can play with different ad formats for online and mobile that will help ad creators on mobile And followers of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are familiar with the fact that mobile advertising accounts for over of Facebooks ad revenue It makes sense the company continues to innovate in ways to attract even more ad dollars What I find most appealing about the Creative Hub is the ability for advertisers to create for Instagram if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can continue to open up Instagram and attract ad dollars it will stay competitive in this space Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>claimed of the nearly bn online advertising revenue pie in I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to continue to grow share with tools for Instagram as well as for the total online ad spend to continue to experience double digit growth last year was a increase Growing share in a growing market is a signal for a growing stock price Last week Instagram announced it reached mn Monthly Active Users MAUs with growing international adoption I will point readers to this excellent post in Instagrams trajectory suffice it to say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is in the early innings of monetizing Instagram Coupled with the experience it has in avoiding any kind of alienation of users with increasing ad load I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be smart with Instagram so that it does not turn users away <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has several good things going for it I hope its international exposure leads to further short term weakness in the stock because it is still too expensive trading at a PE Only below its highs I want the stock to get back down into the s before I can spring for some Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself
