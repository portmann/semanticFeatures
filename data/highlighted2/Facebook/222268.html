everything was awesome with iPhone sales in China Days later channel checks appeared to call Cooks statement into question Several day ago one of Apples component makers Dialog Semi issued cautious guidance strongly suggesting iPhone sales momentum was weakening Apples earnings produced disappointment as China sales rather notably fell but was quickly dismissed by analysts as US sales rose and now perhaps most worrying of all Taiwans Pegatron Corp maker of Apples nextgen iPhone S and iPad has halted hiring in its Shanghai factory as workers note sales of iPhone S have been disappointing In May Pegatron became the new FoxConn as then new Chief Executive Tim Cook Apple divided its weight more equally with a relatively unknown supplier giving the technology giant a greater supplychain balance Pegatron Corp named after the flying horse Pegasus will be the primary assembler of a lowcost iPhone expected to be offered later this year Foxconns smaller rival across town became a minor producer of iPhones in and began making iPad Mini tablet computers last year Back in June everything was awesome Two companies that assemble Apples iPhones and iPads are on a hiring spree a signal that orders from the Cupertinobased group are ramping up ahead of the launch of a new device Taiwans Pegatron Corp which employs people said on Monday that it is expanding its workforce in mainland China by per cent to keep up with the production of smartphones But now in October the huge facility at Pegatron Technologys factory in Shanghai sports a deserted look as China Daily reported moments ago The facility which at its peak employed around people has temporarily suspended hiring as demand for Apple products has waned considerably The winding passage that leads to an interview room is all but deserted Rather than excited faces one can see young employees trudging out of the facility with fatigue and despair written large on their face Zhang Libing a yearold from Anhui province told China Daily that he had just resigned from his job at Pegatron as he was exhausted and fatigued with the long working hours Next to him was a huge electronic screen that kept flashing the message that the company has put on hold all fresh hiring for the time being We are not surprised at that Zhang said The sales of iPhone S have been disappointing I am afraid that if we do not leave now we will be laid off soon China its biggest market outside the United States accounted for nearly onefourth of its total revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter because of its robust handset sales in the country But fresh concerns have arisen over whether the company would be able to sustain the sales momentum Fading enthusiasm for iPhones in China has dragged down the device prices in the parallel market and hit new orders to the supply chain partners Pegatron was planning to hire roughly workers for its Shanghai plants in the summer when Apple entrusted it with the iPhone S and iPad manufacturing The current employee strength of the company remained unclear It appears things have changed dramatically in a very short period of time Cai Xiaoshuai left his hometown in Luoyang of Henan province and landed a job at the assembly line in Pegatron four months ago But the yearold man said he had had enough His basic wage was yuan per month and he had to work overtime for hours every day to make sure that his salary would get close to yuan Some of my friends went to Kunshan in Jiangsu province to try their luck there But it seems that the electronics industry there is in an even worse shape So I am thinking of staying on and checking out other opportunities in Shanghai But I will definitely not work in any electronics company I have had enough said Cai Which leaves us asking as we did when doubts began to surface about Cooks letter to Cramer It all depends on China if the worlds most populous nation can get its stock market its economy and its currency under control then this too shall pass The problem is that if as many increasingly suggest China has lost control of all three At that point anyone who thought they got a great deal when buying AAPL at will have far better opportunities to dollarcost average far far lower Oh and to anyone still holding their breath for AAPL to file a public statement which may well contain an outright lie you may exhale now Mon Buckaroo Banzai In fairness to Tim Cook like most homosexual men he does spend a lot of time and energy looking to get his cock sucked Heterosexuals should be forced to sit in a corner and stare at the walls for a few hours a day to level the playing field Theres only hours in a day and when youre spending of them on Grindr it makes it a little tougher to get real work done China is economically doomed but do they hold the ultimate trump card in k tons of gold The pivot by BRICS OPEC etc turning away from US Treasurys to initiate and maintain ongoing physical gold purchases coincided with a simultaneous and ongoing collapse in the price of gold golds price peaked in July and has fallen by a third since Suffice to say when the price of something collapses on ongoing record physical demand and the price of something else rises on a collapse in demandthese are not typical free market responses When the largest and most fundamental markets act contrary to supply and demandwhen the cornerstones of a market are seemingly removedthe validity of the market signals in general are clearly up for debate Mon Anopheles China has an internal debt upwards of TRILLION dollars That money has gone into their own infrastructure the past couple decades to pay for the rapid urbanization of China Look up ghost cities in China tonnes of gold Thats PEANUTS k tonnes is only billion dollars And tell us what happens to gold prices if they try and SELL some of their stash Which means the USAs tonnes is To be fair the figure is the official measure and the highest of all nations on the earth but as to your comment how would you describe the US holdings in relation to an T frn debt with the principle growing at T frn per year Were adding our entire Au value to our debt every days according to your calculations Tue COSMOS Dont worry the Media will make it seem like Apple is booming and get the Pension funds to buy more stock till the trap door collapses Mon Fukushima Fricassee Mon Buck Johnson Mon yogibear Frequented bath houses in his younger days Now he has Air Force one to fly around to his gay meetings Mon ZD In fairness to Tim Cook like most homosexual men he does spend a lot of time and energy looking to get his cock sucked Maybe he has to spend a lot of time and energy because there arent many gay men who want to suck an older man with a limp micro penisunless they are getting paid well Mon Chris Dakota Not only that but gays have to spend at least one hour per day making comments on news articles pointing out how bad gays have been treated in the past Mon Id fight Gandhi Sodomy is not love its a vice and an evil Its one of the major sins that cries to God for vengeance We live in a country eyeball deep in all of them How long will God stay His hand from vengeance Tue VegasBob Tim Cook strikes me as a nelly princess I suspect hed much rather take cock up his ass than getting his own cock sucked Mon yogibear Mon Skateboarder iPoops they are at the th generation Cost and material optimization has made a slimmer more brittle phone over the years and after about two generations of iterative fleecing later the iPhone generation was the peak of iPoops the customers may be finally starting to wake up to the idea that hey its the same fucking clownshit that they sold last year So theyve teamed up with service providers to offer things like your iPhone is free forever just keep trading it in so long as you pay your phone bill etc They do have to show sales somehow Mon kliguy The Clownasssniffers that stand in line for this shitphone will become increasingly laughed at until the final I phone has just one last sniffer in line when it goes on salethen and only then will the CNBS pumpers stop pumping this dead company Tue Skateboarder I hate Apple with a passion for many reasons and their gayass takeover and shitting all over my childhood hometown of Cupertino CA fuels the fire a millionfold During the course of my electronics engineering job I grew accustomed to using a Macbook as my primary computer The model is a pretty decent piece of hardware and Parallels is an excellent productivity booster for those who need to work across multiple Windows and Linux environments Shit just works Under the impression that Apple still makes shit just works products I purchased an iPad Mini for my grandparents so they can Facetime their kids and grandkids Ive been trying to make this shit work all morning trying to make facetime work between my Macbook and the iPoop It does not work no matter what I try Ive had much better experiences making dissimilar nix systems come together What a waste of time Mon Anopheles Cell phone companies in the US and Canada have been backing away from subsidizing phones for the past couple years Its now going to up to the phone companies themselves to subsidize their own phones if they want which for Apple means lower profits Mon nidaar Replica iphones are doing pretty good in China actually Maybe Apple should produce a replica of its own iCrap that would boost sales for a while Mon thegazzman my personal projections are sometime between now and next earnings the only trick in their arsenal to bring back sales a larger screen has been played watch the chinese phone producers make massive inroads into western markets in the next months and subsequently watch AAPLs margins get wrecked Mon Freddie I think the powers that be are levitating AAPL and SPY They are all that matters along with the crony zio companies that also get held up like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>AMZN GOOG and a few others Mon nmewn Andthe highfreq algos go insane in a milisecond with Android users from the Hamptons to the Bahamas doing battle with the iphone users in Bali and Fort Lauderdale via their brokers Mon jerry_theking_lawler Mon williambanzai I say this not based on reports from factories or emails from Tim Cook but observations of luxury brand stores in Hong Kong where of Mainland luxury purchases previously took place Uoscale hotel occupation and retail traffic is way down and room rates and rents are being hammered Macau Casinos are the new ghost towns although my question is how much of this is related to the graft crackdown no one wants to be seen flaunting wealth anyone can be in the partys crosshairs or is it more related fundamental reasons Anticorruption crack down and antimoney laundering in PRC big impact on high roller traffic I do not think the appetite for highend phones is satiated Young Chinese now look at their phones as the most important marker of face to the exclusion of traditional items like watches However many Mainland Chinese are now learning the meaning of frugality Mon Freddie Hopefully that fk Adelson will go broke We can all hope He likes funding NeoCons and pretending he was not for Obola Tue jcdenton Mon joego Mon i_call_you_my_base The guy making the iphone would have to use two months wages to buy an iphone I think that might be the issue Mon Freddie Mon DirkDiggler Yea the only problem Freddie is Mr Cook would like to have another Iphone shoved up his ass Tim

appropriate medical equipment markup Mon dock Mon Rikky Youre missing the point bub This is about a one trick pony whos been doing his dance for a lot longer than most thought starting to get split hooves Its astounding theyve been able to take a commoditized product and still rack up the kind of revenue and margins thus far but every good tale must come to its end and unless theres some gotta have it over the horizon this puppy has only one direction to go Mon Anopheles That said the iPhone is a good piece of hardware Id never buy one its just way overpriced and too proprietary But reality is that Apple is desperate for the next big thing They havent had a hit for almost years and that was the ipad They tried the iwatch and now barely months later that iflop went from being sold at exclusive apple boutiques to being hawked at Best Buy Mon dock LOL Haters So typical Apple makes a fine device They market well Its called capitalism Something you freaks usually support Mon Anopheles
