up questions around cable network business Disney owns valuable content franchises that will always earn a premium price I am developing a passive income stream from dividends to generate financial independence Im proceeding down the path of steadily accumulating a set of highquality dividendpaying stocks My strategy is quarterly accumulation of stocks through a lowcost brokerage with a few thousand dollars invested across all these stocks at a time Disney NYSE DIS is one of the businesses in my dividend portfolio that I am accumulating I started accumulating Disney in very small amounts in mid as part of my accumulation strategy Most recently I purchased the stock as part of my dividend accumulation portfolio in July Im very interested in generating a sustainable longterm income stream therefore I want solid dividend growth prospects Disney offers a dividend yield of just under The company has seen a dividend growth rate of almost annually over the last years according to longrundatacom The stock has a longterm track record of delivering excellent returns for its investors In fact a investment in DIS made in would be worth M today This reflects a return over time of just under annually Disneys unique content franchises and customer loyalty creates a strong moat that competitors are unable to breach Disneys recently reported revenue and earnings were a widely perceived as a disappointment by the market Q revenues were up year on year to B while net income for the quarter was up year on year to B In terms of segment performance Studio Entertainment had a particularly strong quarter with revenue growth up almost year on year while interactive revenues tumbled some year on year What was particularly notable for the quarter was the relatively poor performance of ESPN which was estimated to have lost some M subscribers over by Nielsen Disney derives a significant amount of revenue from the affiliate fees which are paid to it by broadcasters such as Comcast NASDAQ CMCSA NASDAQ CMCSK which is a function that is partly based on the number of subscribers for Disney content and packages With millennial viewers increasingly preferring other forms of content and entertainment such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Buzzfeed and Vice the viability of affiliate fees as a long term source of revenue for Disney is open to question In addition broadcasters such as Verizon NYSE VZ are introducing skinny bundles into the market which often dont feature Disney content If these lower cost skinny bundles become more popular they may jeopardize Disneys long term affiliate revenues from cable It will be interesting to see how Disney responds to this secular shift that appears to be taking place in the market As the owner of some premium exclusive content franchises I believe that it owns some very valuable properties The company may need to look at partnerships with emerging venues of distribution and consider alternate business models but Disneys content will likely always command a premium in the market given it is unique and differentiated Disneys virtuous cycle provides a solid moat Excluding Disney broadcasting assets the key to its success in my opinion is the successful identification and development of a continuing stable of character franchises These characters then get run through a virtuous cycle of consumer products games and figurines inclusion in theme parks and then their own debut on the big screen via studio entertainment To get an idea of just how successful this model is consider that Disney now owns more than franchises with sales exceeding B Mickey Mouse Winnie the Pooh Star Wars Monsters SpiderMan Cars Disney Jr and the Princesses account for more than B each in sales volume Each successful character franchise reinforces the success of the Disney moat It means a new set of characters to take through the companys fixed cost production and marketing activities in game and figurine production and movie development Its another set of characters to add value to existing theme parks giving users yet another reason to visit As long as Disney can continue to either organically develop new franchises or acquire them at reasonable cost it will continue to have longterm success As a result of market concern over Disneys recent earnings Disney appears to be trading at a valuation that looks compelling Disney currently trades at a PE ratio of and a forward PE ratio of just over Disney is trading slightly above average multiples over the last years including price to earnings and price to sales Morningstar rates Disney stock at stars at present Disney stock has risen since I first started my accumulation My first couple of purchases were done at
