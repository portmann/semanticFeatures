seriously by Intel I only went long on Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM last month because I realized that Intel NASDAQ INTC was not going to successfully persuade Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and Xiaomi to abandon Snapdragon mobile processors My longterm bet on Intel was due to its almostmonopoly hold on desktop and server processors However Qualcomms recent announcement that is sampling out its first core ARMbased server processor definitely made some Intel investors nervous Last Fridays trading saw INTC dropped by more than which I believe was an adverse reaction to Qualcomms bold plan to slug it out with Intel on data center server processors Qualcomm previously announced last November that it was indeed building servercentric ARMbased processors The preproduction core server chip that is now being handed out for testing is a loud warning that Qualcomm is very eager to go for the jugular of Intels most lucrative x chip division Qualcomm facing stiff competition from lowcost mobile chip producers like MediaTek and Rockchip is now expanding toward the territory of the Intel Data Center Group The margins on server chips are definitely higher than on entrylevel Snapdragon and Snapdragon chips for mobile phones The chart below illustrates the reason why Qualcomm is betting big on servercentric ARMbased processors Intels server processors generate billions of dollars in quarterly and tout operating profit margins Intels Xeon processors now dominate the lucrative server market Nonx server chips like PowerPC and MIPS are the big losers from Intels successful campaign toward dominating the server processor industry Aside from the pricey Xeonitanium Intel deftly addressed the threat of lowpower ARM server processors with its energyefficient Avoton x Atom chips in Intels quick action to create and sell the cheap Avoton server processors helped the x architecture maintain its upward sales momentum The chart below illustrates that in spite of the presence of ARMbased server products from Cavium NASDAQ CAVM and others and are again banner years for Intels highlyprofitable Data Center Group Qualcomm is ready and willing to fight an uphill battle again Intel Qualcomm unlike Cavium Applied Micro NASDAQ AMCC and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD has tons of cash for RD and marketing purposes Qualcomm is smart and rich enough to deliver a quality serverclass Snapdragon that could match the costcomputeefficiency advantage of an Intel Xeon AMD keeps delaying its ARMbased processor product precisely because it doesnt have the cash to developmarket it properly Qualcomms initial success came from creating ARMbased processors that were more energyefficient than Intels x mobile chips In the same manner the energy efficient core server chip based on the bit ARMvA architecture is perfect for largescale microserver deployments The razorthin margins of many cloud computing operators could force them to embrace the small savings from an economy of scale deployment of cheap ARMbased microservers Budgetlimited firms would obviously prefer the better compute advantage of expensive x server solutions but they could not afford them The potential savings from hyperdense microservers full of very energyefficient Qualcomm server chips could outweigh the advantage of a traditional server rack full of Intel Xeons Qualcomm recruited Xilinx XNLX to help it create a custom FPGA Field Programmable Gate Array for its core processor Xilinx will help Qualcommpowered microservers offer the best performancewatt deal while also delivering a flexible configurable design The operating expense of server farm operators is not limited to the purchase price of servers The total cost of owning and maintaining servers will eventually benefit from a lower electricity bill It is true that massive server farm operators like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Google NASDAQ GOOGL might not be willing to risk porting their critical networks from x to ARM architecture However I opine that new server farm operators are likely not going to mind playing test guinea pigs for a ARMbased data center The future of Qualcomm as a server chip supplier would likely be in catering to new and smaller firms This is the more believable scenario rather than Qualcomm being able to steal major clients away from Intels Data Center Group New data center operators on a tight startup budget would consider going for ARMbased microservers if it helps improve their operating margins Focusing on lowcost microserver solutions is the easier path for Qualcomm Annual sales of microservers is estimated to enjoy a CAGR of until Four years from now the nascent microserver industry could be worth billionyear Qualcomm is the best firm that could lead the ARMbased server processor group get a huge chunk of the fastgrowing microserver market I admit that Intels overwhelming dominance in server processors is currently unhealthy for the entire cloud computingdata center industry Qualcomms entry as a server chip provider will therefore benefit the smaller players Competition from Qualcomm could lead to Intel lowering the price tags of its powerful but pricey Xeon processors Intel might also be forced to spend more money for RD to improve its lowpower Avoton Atom chips so it will remain competitive with Qualcomms ARMbased processors In the long run the ultimate winners will be ordinary consumers Cheaper and more energyefficient processors will lead to lower operating costs for server farm operators A data center provider that is profitable could provide optimal service to its customers without the dark cloud of higher peruser fees We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We do not sell
