Semiconductor Sector Index has been in free fall since the beginning of the year Investors are reluctant to step in as the outlook for PC shipments and notebook sales are on the decline Semiconductor stock shareholders may have a new worry as a data center server chip war looms between Intel and Qualcomm Top holdings in SMH could be impacted by data center server chip innovations and pricing thus impacting the ETF performance The Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF NYSEARCA SMH which tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index NASDAQ SOX topped out at per share in early December and has been in free fall since the beginning of the year Investors are reluctant to step in after Gartner said in early January that the outlook for PC shipments in is for a decline of compared with with the potential for a soft recovery in late The PC market is still in the middle of structural change which will reduce the PC installed base in the next few years said Gartner in their report Notebook sales arent doing so great either according to Chris Danely of Citigroup who downgraded the chip sector this week citing that Taiwan notebook ODM shipments declined monthovermonth in January below the threeyear average of being down on a monthtomonth basis Investors may have a new worry besides PC and notebook sales as a data center server chip war looms Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM announced in midJanuary that it had entered into an agreement with the Chinese province of Guizhou to create a joint venture called Guizhou Huaxintong SemiConductor Technology Co Qualcomm plans to enter the server CPU market that Intel NASDAQ INTC dominates with a customer processor chip built using the ARM architecture which is less expensive and may also consume less power Intel immediately fired back several days later with an announcement of a new joint venture to design chips through a research partnership with Tsinghua University and Montage Technology Global Holdings Intel will put million into the venture Investing in ETFs such as SMH or iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF NASDAQ SOXX should eliminate nonsystemic risk involving the ownership of individual securities Nonetheless investors may want to pay close attention to the SMH ETF top holdings as their products and services overlap each other which in turn impacts ETF performance Technical Overview About of the holdings in the SMH ETF are the five big cap semiconductor companies Intel Corp Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg Co Ltd NYSE TSM Qualcomm Inc Broadcom Ltd NASDAQ AVGO and Texas Instruments Inc NASDAQ TXN with a combined market cap of over billion as of February Since early the SMH ETF has been trading in a symmetrical triangle chart pattern as investors cant decide in what direction the ETF will move next Most of the gains in the SMH ETF in early came from speculative buying driven by rumors that Intel was buying Altera and that Avago Technologies was merging with Broadcom with the new entity now called Broadcom Ltd BRCM The SMH ETF just bounced off the trendline support and continues to move higher as historically the semiconductor stocks perform well during the first quarter of the year There are two trendline resistances at around the and levels that investors should be aware of Intel As of February Intel has a weight of the largest holding in the SMH ETF The company reported that the fourth quarter revenues from its lucrative data center group DCG which makes microprocessors chipsets SoC and multichip packages that are used in servers storage and switches to power data centers and cloud computing rose just yearonyear while most analysts had expected a doubledigit percentage gain Intel also said the average selling prices ASPs of their data center server chips declined yearonyear meaning the ASP per performance could drop even more The acquisition of Altera by Intel was completed in early fiscal year and Altera has emerged as a standalone unit called the Programmable Solutions Group Intel once said that the company had a plan to create a hybrid XeonFPGA chip that will plug into a single processor socket As competition in the data center business is heating up it is highly critical for Intel to convince Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and others to switch from the graphics processor unit GPU chips to the Intel hybrid XeonFPGA chip to power their artificial intelligence tools including speech recognition image recognition and natural language processing Technically INTC has been trading along with the SMH and shows a strong positive correlation with the SMH ETF over an eightyear period The stock is under selling pressure lately as analysts have raised concerns over PC and notebook sales during the first quarter Rumors that Google will start designing their own chips will not support Intel shares much either Qualcomm Qualcomm has a weight of in the SMH ETF Qualcomm recently released its fiscal first quarter earnings report which came in well above expectations but a license dispute with LG surfaced and fiscal second quarter guidance disappointed due to the impact of a challenging macro environment Qualcomm just confirmed via a tweet that their flagship Snapdragon will power the latest LG G to be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February Shares of Qualcomm remain a drag for the SMH ETF as they have performed poorly during the past years QCOM bounced off a fouryear low at a share last week and the stock is now trading at the a share resistance level The stock can make a breakout if it can close and stay above a share There are walls of resistances between now and the a share level A Bloomberg report in early February that Google was poised to endorse Qualcomms server chip efforts turned out to be a rumor Hence we expect that Intel will step up with their data center server chip innovations and pricing which will put more pressure on Qualcomm shares Conclusions SMH the Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF which tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index has been in free fall since the beginning of the year but investors are reluctant to step in as the outlook for PC shipments and notebook sales are on the decline Shareholders of the bigcap semiconductor companies may have a new worry as competition in the data center business is heating up and a server chip war looms between Intel and Qualcomm Intel may escalate their data center server chip innovations and pricing which will put more pressure on Qualcomm shares which in turn impacts the
