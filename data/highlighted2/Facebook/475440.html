class='textDiv'>Yahoo Lessons The Big Picture August am by Bob Lefsetz He not busy being born is busy dying That which is highflying today might crash tomorrow Always be looking in the rearview mirror especially in tech where everybody has the tools and the barrier to entry is low Dont take on an undoable task Where does Marissa Mayer go from here Probably home to take care of her children Everything cant be saved Despite the compensation and the accolades youre better off passing if its a Sisyphean task Do due diligence As in the board should have found out that despite all the press Ms Mayer had been pushed aside at Google Theres the media story and the real story and they frequently dont align Beware of the publicity hog running the gauntlet of news is very different from running a company Know what you are Im not sure what Yahoo is are you Is it a content search or email company And its not number one in any of those fields Online second best is not good enough youve got to be primary in one profitable field or you die For information we go to the source or to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Gmail is good enough it superseded Yahoo mail People dont come back when the tide turns you move on Furthermore Mayer fixed Yahoo Mail and ruined it Todays breakthrough is tomorrows antique Yahoo made sense of the web via curation The concept of searching and getting the result you wanted instantly was a pipe dream But once you could do that search you no longer needed the directory And search today is so good you rarely look past the first hit Machines do it better than humans No one wants to hear this its disturbing But Spotifys Discover Weekly playlist is better than any handcurated recommendations And Amazon fired its editorial team when it found out computers recommended book titles better and got better financial results Yahoo was a brand built on people in a world dominated by machines Beware the flip Yahoo focused on content when all the money turned out to be in advertising Thats why Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>dominate they have the best advertising platforms Mayer tried to catch up it was too late Vision is everything And usually the founder has the best one in tech Kinda funny if you think about it this has hurt music theres too much executive meddling Youve got to pick the best talent and invest in it The Yahoo founders were the best people to run the company its just that their vision was superseded like hair bands in the eighties Their replacements were a joke Does anyone remember the Terry Semel era when the Warner Brothers bigwig tried to turn Yahoo into a content platform Thats like Michael Jordan trying to play baseball only worse More like an automobile designer trying to run the space program Theyre different worlds Lack of reinvestment will kill you Yahoo skated too long on what was Mayer tried to shift the emphasis to advertising but it was too late Dont take the check David who Thats right David Pogue then one of Americas highest profile tech scribes ensconced at the New York Times jumped to Yahoo and was instantly forgotten As for Katie Couricone can argue her career was already in the dumper but Yahoo did her no favors Dont sell to the highest bidder but the best fit Tumblr was the new <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a social mediablogging platform ready to eclipse <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter remember when John Mayer jumped from Twitter to Tumblr saying that was where the action was It isnt anymore Tumblr is moribund great for porn nearly useless for everything else Dont sell out for short term money Yahoo outsourced search to Bing Got a check but gave up its future Furthermore Bing is seen as secondrate and intheknow surfers refrained from using Yahoo search But this lesson is not limited solely to tech Cities have outsourcedsold their parking meter business And no one is happy You balance the books today you give up revenue tomorrow and the forprofit enterprise jacks up rates and takes away rights like the ability to park for free at night and citizens are enraged Judgment day comes eventually It came for Yahoo But Marissa Mayer made triple digit millions in the interim the company should have been sold eons ago Take the money Microsoft offered so much Yahoo said no Dont get emotionally attached sometimes its right to sell when youve run out of runway and the people running Yahoo should have seen that they were gonna hit a wall Kinda like Nokia The Finnish icon sold its device business to Microsoft it had already lost in smartphones its nearly nonexistent now Deep pockets will overpay because theyre scared of the future Not only Microsoft above but Verizon the highest bidder here and now the owner of the moribund AOL Come on Tim Armstrong couldnt make his vision come true remember Patch and you hand him the keys I guess in the land of the blind the oneeyed man is king Armstrong knows more about ads than those running Verizon so he got his way You cant stand still Verizon was known as the MercedesBenz of cell phone companies Its still the best but its competitors are creeping up behind it But once again the visionarybuilder is long gone and the present management team is flailing Suddenly Verizon a company with too much cash is in the content and advertising businesses Give em credit theyre moving forward could work but one would feel better about the company if it merged with one that was already a highflier in the space Verizon and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Verizon and Google Then one plus one equals three maybe But adding the minuscule advertising footprints of AOL and Yahoo to a company that doesnt do that Kinda like adding Skrillex and Diplo to En Vogue Common decency counts Showing up on time and giving respect is key when youre the CEO The stories of Marissa Mayers faux pas superseded her efforts to turn the company around Kick the tires first spend later Mayer spent so much on new hires so early many of whom washed out that she looked amateurish and tainted the company No one likes a downer Our nation runs on optimism The media wanted to believe Yahoo could be resuscitated but sometimes a mercy killing is the best way to go Barry L Ritholtz
