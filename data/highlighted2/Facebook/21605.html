California dismissed a nearly yearold classaction lawsuit against Hulu that alleged the streaming video service illegally shared personal user information with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The original complaint PDF filed in July accused Hulu of violating the federal Video Privacy Protection Act VPPA which was created to prevent video rental and sales companies from knowingly disclosing customers personally identifiable information to any third party without consent As Plaintiffs viewed video content on Hulus website Hulu transmitted their viewing choices to a number of third parties including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>market research firm Scorecard Research online ad networks DoubleClick and Quantserve and Google Analytics In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Hulu included Plaintiffs and Class Members <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>IDs connecting the video content information to Facebooks personally identifiable user registration information the complaint contends arguing that these users reasonably expected that Hulu would not disclose their video choices to third parties and that these users did not authorize any thirdparty disclosures But Hulu maintained that it wasnt deliberately or actively sharing this information with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Rather this information was until June being transmitted via the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Like button If the Hulu user had logged into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>using certain settings within the previous four weeks the Like button would cause a c_user cookie to be sent to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>writes the court in its order PDF dismissing the lawsuit So even if the Hulu user didnt click the Like button its mere presence on the Hulu page would send the users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ID in a numerical format that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could understand along with the URL and other info for the video being watched on that page Hulu did not send <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the Hulu User ID or the Hulu users name writes the judge In considering whether to grant Hulus motion for a summary dismissal the court asks whether the plaintiffs met the two conditions to demonstrate a violation of the VPPA First Hulu would have to have knowingly transmitted this data The term knowingly connotes actual knowledge writes the court It is not enough as the plaintiffs suggest that a disclosure be merely voluntary in the minimal sense of the defendants being aware of what he or she is doing and not acting because of some mistake or accident In the courts opinion merely being the transmitter of the code doesnt necessarily imply a conscious sharing of personal information The second standard for applying the VPPA is threepronged requiring that Hulu knowingly disclosed a consumers identity the identity of specific video materials and the fact that the person identified requested or obtained that material The point of the VPPA after all is not so much to ban the disclosure of user or video data explains the judge it is to ban the disclosure of information connecting a certain user to certain videos The court held that the data transmitted via the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>like button is not the same as a video store clerk handing a reporter a list containing customers name and their recent rentals The users identity and that of the video material were transmitted separately albeit simultaneously reads the order explaining that Hulus sending of this information is not connecting the user to the content Hulu did not disclose information that identified a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials This connection between the videos and the user would have to be done on the receiving end contends the court This means that even if both elements were sent to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>they did not necessarily disclose a user as having requested or obtained specific video materials unless <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>combined the two pieces of information In terms of this case if Hulu did not actually know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>might read the c_user cookie and video title together then there cannot be a VPPA violation concludes the judge Speaking to The Recorder the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in this case says an appeal is in the works We think the order of the lower court would undermine fundamental statutory privacy rights if allowed to stand explained the attorney for the plaintiffs How Did The Hot Dog Get Such A Bad Rap Consumerist
