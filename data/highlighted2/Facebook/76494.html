simply too much of an emerging growth opportunity for tech giant Apple to ignore and not partake in Apples NASDAQ AAPL acquisition last week of Metaio a Germany based firm that is one of leading augmented reality software developers may signal the tech giants next product line Over the next to months I expect Apple to leverage Metaios augmented reality knowledge and enhance the companys nearterm product launches In the longterm I expect Apple to bring an augmented reality smartglasses product to the market by Apple was granted a smartglasses patent in January and the acquisition of Metaio should improve Apples augmented reality bench strength and shorten the time to market The closing of the Metaio transaction means a few things to Apple Apple is aware of the massive augmented

trucks by enabling them to visualize the space Spatial benefits are not just limited to trucks but can also be applied to equipment within the processing facility allowing users to maximize space and minimize potential issues Other benefits outlined in the report include facial recognition locating packages performance of truck maintenance providing urgent updates related to trafficcongestion and critical delivery route information Google NASDAQ GOOG made a wellknown public attempt at developing the consumer mass market for smartglasses but failed miserably Googles Glass product failed on arrival and the project supporting the first generation of Google Glass was suspended in January Googles decision to suspend its Google Glass product was not a result of a collapsing market opportunity but as a direct result of an ugly and design flawed product The commercial use industrial use case for smartglasses is moving from developing market into the very early stages of a mass adoption market Googles glasses due to a flawed design were not able to handle the volume and use within industrial applications As far as the consumer market is concerned the glasses were so ugly

product offerings and create a marketplace for the next wave of technological product advancement The augmented reality space and its estimated B annual revenue by remains virtually untapped by Apple
