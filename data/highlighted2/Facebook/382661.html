speech at the F keynote that laid out Facebooks year road map The theme of bringing people around the world together was progressed in this keynote and the path toward doing so is now much more clear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has served up incredible returns since its IPO in May of Its because of the visionary Mark Zuckerberg that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been able to expand and diversify so rapidly and F takes that vision a step further a year road map Whats to be understood with this road map is that it is subject to change The direction taken on a particular project identified by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>right now could be very different than the direction in a few years from now Additionally the road map does not include potential acquisition activity even though acquisitions are some of the largest positive additions to Facebooks offering like WhatsApp and Oculus With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now keen on capturing the purest form of an idea or experience the companys potential to connect and generate growth for shareholders is far greater The thirtytwo minute video can be found on Mark Zuckerbergs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page here I advise all shareholders current and prospective to watch this video because it was one of the most wellcrafted speeches in the tech world Ive heard since Steve Jobs Stanford commencement address back in By now investors are familiar with the companys primary VR product the Oculus Rift and before that Gear VR While the company will be releasing Touch which provides more functionality within the Rift by having controllers in each hand this is hardly the focus of takeaway Creating sound VR and AR offerings for users is on Facebooks year road map Unfortunately the technology for AR isnt there yet Whats reasonable for investors to expect from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on this level irrespective of financials is multiple versions of the Rift over the next few years with each one creating a more immersive VR experience Additionally one of the largest breakthroughs will be form factor where the size of the end VRAR product will be as simple as a pair of reading glasses and look far more natural than it is now AR will allow individuals to completely alter the reality before them and open up new chains of interaction that have not yet been seen While itll be a race between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and other ARconscious companies to produce a refined product there is going to be a long delay before this even becomes feasible In terms of AI <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to use this underdeveloped tech to improve services While its already embedded in many different services right now like diagnostic medicine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to completely expand its reach to areas that are not yet known That kind of uncertainty can be daunting but also profitable if executed correctly I recognize this to be one of Facebooks strongest growth catalysts For example being able to expand a virtual picture in your hands and show it to a friend Everything will be shared or so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>envisions By utilizing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself as a core ecosystem the Company can expand to perfect their product offering which includes Messenger WhatsApp and Instagram You can see this flow below A more specific monetization timeline for WhatsApp and Messenger was not given but we now know its on the list of things to do within the next five years Leveraging these users is going to be key to share price appreciation especially with the large scaling that video is seeing Zuckerberg noted that Facebooks benchmark to accept a project is whether or not they believe it can scale to billion users Consider that the companys minimum positive NPV In the mean time these platforms will be perfected For example Zuckerberg unveiled that users can now contact services directly through a message and place orders for goods and services all through the Messenger platform These so called Messenger bots will be key to unlocking faster transaction speed and more monthly average users This beta platform also allows users to receive quick personalized updates from their requested news source all through text As more ecommerce gets executed on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and the company can start taking a percentage of these transactions off the top then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stands to maintain and even surpass the strong previous revenue growth rates Zuckerberg made a key point four billion people around the world dont have internet access due to lack of availability lack of affordability or lack of awareness In order for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to keep growing its topline and MAU amount across all platforms at such impressive growth rates the Company needs to find new massive pools of users Human life is a scarce resource but with four billion potential MAUs being untapped at the moment Zuckerberg sees this as a huge opportunity Developer growth in Africa is booming according to Zuckerberg and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is taking its own steps to make sure this growth continues The Company is launching an internetdelivery drone called Aquila and is experimenting with ground internet sources like Aries and Terragraph A past problem with developing country access to Facebooks platforms has been that it uses too much data <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has now unveiled lite versions of its core platforms along with Free Basics both of which lower the data costs by up to and allow users to connect in a meaningful way While Free Basics hasnt expanded to a massive amount of users yet its already in countries and has million people online These initiatives going to allow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to scale more rapidly than ever over the next decade Based on Facebooks notes to expand into these untapped markets investors should expect meaningful appreciation not only in the MAU mobile statistic as well as in the companys equity price The average PT on the stock right now is which represents about appreciation from the current level If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can directly show their efforts affecting the MAU amount each quarter while simultaneously boosting the topline Id say that PT is more than attainable inside of two earnings reports I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Internet Information
