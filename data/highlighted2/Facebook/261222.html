ago the latest high profile media figure to boldly go into the rapidly spreading Trump ban Muslims scandal was none other than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>CEO Mark Zuckerberg who in a post on his social network took the other side of Trump declaring that Muslims are always welcome here and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will fight to protect your rights and create a peaceful and safe environment for you It was not immediately clear if the community he was welcoming Muslims to is the United States or the online world of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ad clickers His full <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>post which has so far been liked over K times is below After the Paris attacks and hate this week I can only imagine the fear Muslims feel that they will be persecuted for the actions of others As a Jew my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities Even if an attack isnt against you today in time attacks on freedom for anyone will hurt everyone If youre a Muslim in this community as the leader of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I want you to know that you are always welcome here and that we will fight to protect your rights and create a peaceful and safe environment for you Having a child has given us so much hope but the hate of some can make it easy to succumb to cynicism We must not lose hope As long as we stand together and see the good in each other we can build a better world for all people To some online commentators the statement rings of hollow cynicism since the gentrified Palo Alto enclave for uber wealthy tech millionaires where Zuckerberg lives is hardly the diverse melting pot of social ethical and religious strife and tensions which have come to characterize many of the worlds geographic areas where cohabitation between Muslims and other religions has in recent months unleashed an unprecedented backlash especially in Europe against Muslims To others Zucherbergs statement comes as a surprise that the social media mogul who has until now resisted involvement in any openly political debates has decided to so loudly wage right into this one The reason is that according to a just released poll nearly twothirds of likely GOP primary voters support Trumps proposal to ban Muslims from coming into the country The latest Bloomberg PoliticsPurple Strategies PulsePoll released Wednesday reveals that the real estate moguls latest remarks are backed by percent of likely GOP voters When told both sides of the argument support for Trumps proposal remained relatively unchanged at percent The online poll conducted Wednesday also found that about percent of those surveyed would be more likely to vote for the businessman after his call to temporarily halt Muslims from entering the United States until elected leaders can figure out whats going on The risk that Zuckerberg is taking is that by openly endorsing the other side of the argument while making an ethical stand he is also jeopardizing a business model which relies on the goodwill of its users many of whom may be openly antagonized by Zuckerbergs moral stance And since that of GOP potential GOP voters whose ideological position is now diametrically opposed to that of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>CEO is in the tens of millions of Americans one wonder just how many of the million in North American Daily Active Users Zuckerberg is willing to sacrifice in order to make his stand Meanwhile even as support for Trumps proposal appears to be widespread within the republican constituency others dont share that view as can be seen by what Atlanta police have dubbed to be Trump Swastika which have been reported in various locations in Atlanta Finally taking a campaign that has been unorthodox to say the least from the start late yesterday one of the biggest losers from Trumps relentless popularity Jeb Bush went on twitter to speculate that Trumps campaign is nothing but a conspiracy with Hillary one which will put here in the White House Maybe Donald negotiated a deal with his buddy HillaryClinton Continuing this path will put her in the White House httpstcoAlvByiSrMn Could Donald Trump be doing all this to wreck the Republican Party and clear the path for his old friend Hillary Clinton to take the White House Heres the supporting evidence such as it is As recently as Trump said this of Mrs Clinton Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman I am biased because I have known her for years I live in New York She lives in New York I really like her and her husband both a lot I think she really works hard Trump previously donated money to Mrs Clinton in and Trump has donated more than to the Clinton Foundation Trumps daughter Ivanka is close friends with Chelsea Clinton In Hillary Clinton attended Mr Trumps wedding to Melania Knauss his current wife in Florida Trump was a registered Democrat between and before switching to the Republican Party It all adds up for Jeb Bush whose campaign has been killed by Trumps popularity Bush said Maybe Donald negotiated a deal with his buddy Hillary Clinton Continuing this path will put her in the White House According to the Chief Investment Officer of CalSTRS a presidential matchup between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton could sap a full percentage point from anticipated growth in the gross domestic product the chief investment officer of the secondlargest US pension fund said Can you imagine a whole year of Trump and Hillary going at each other Christopher Ailman who manages the California State Teachers Retirement Systems billion portfolio said Tuesday on Bloomberg Television Its going to be a drag on the economy Ailman said percent of the US economy is based on consumer sales and a divisive presidential campaign is likely to depress consumer confidence He didnt comment on Clinton but said Trumps statements reverberate across the global economy The Republican realestate mogul who leads in all national polls for his partys nomination this week called for a ban on Muslims entering the US Im worried about said Ailman who has a degree in business economics If you took everybodys GDP projections of to percent growth Im sad to say you could probably take a full percentage point off of that In a year in which a record El Nino is expected to make the GDPcrushing harsh winter a distant memory perhaps a Trump vs Clinton campaign is precisely what the soon to be much weaker US economy needs as the Fed is in urgently need of an alibi when the expected growth resulting from the December rate hike fails to materialize and in fact leads to just the opposite outcome and the Fed is forced to backtrack instead launching either NIRP or more QE or both Thanks to Trump and Hillary going at each other of course What the answer is we dont know although as US society appears ready to split along racial social cultural and religious lines we have somehow never felt quite so entertained even as society is quietly tearing itself apart Wed nuubee Wed tmosley He loves the kind helpful and respectful tiny minority muslims Hes probably not going to like the convert or die large majority Muslims Wed HowdyDoody Wed The Juggernaut All this fear is from the Neocons anyway A lot of the mainstream Repubs are falling into this Neocon generated fear that if we cant generate aggresion to invade oil rich nations well just scare them into in The popular belief that a gigantic clash of civilizations explains todays conditions fits well into the propaganda efforts of the neocon inspired American Empire Ron Paul Fear is the tool used to galvanize a people into supporting war while sacrificing liberty Exaggerations and propping up groups who falsely claim to represent percent of Muslims serves the interests of those in the West who want the clash of civilizations for their own selfish purposes Current US and Western support for ISIS in Syria even though its denied is designed to remove Assad This policy is in the tradition of our foreign policy of recent decades Aligning ourselves with the creation of Hamas and the mujahedin Taliban is well documented Ron Paul Wed Fredo Corleone Yet another example supporting the fact that Trump owns the

ofNWOoligarchyare trying to preserve the USA as the only world superpower this is mostly big businesses like the US militaryindustrial complex This group does not want to see the USA destruction but is so far is quite passive Potentially Trump and Hiltery on the same side and represent the second group This is why Trump must help to stop Bush and destroy the Republican party who became a Party of political prostitutes Palestinians arent Muslims are they Hell no Zuck bulldozing homes on the West Bank is a sign of unending friendship Wed Titus Exactly If the fucker wants to welcome Muslims send them to his private Hawaiian compound That fucker should be secured enough that the cannot escape Wed order Youre always welcome here please sign up so we can collect your data and make it easier for

support the Sunni extremist rebels in Syria al Qaeda and today that shitforbrains at the Pentagon Ashole Carter says special ops personnel will be sent to train more al Qaeda in Syria Now why are we unwashed masses paying more attention to the only American on the political scene who makes any sense Donald Trump Could it possibly be because we scored higher on the math achievement tests and intelligence tests You dont put any of this in the context of as a False Flag Operation by IsraeliNeocons controlling the US government which seems like you might not be paying attention to the important political things in America Donald Trump hasnt mentioned that small event in the proper context either so maybe that is why you dont appear to know about it If peace reigns IsraeliNeocons around the world hang for treason Think that might have anything to do with events Wed Shizzmoney Trump and Zuck are both scam artistsits just which twisted version of morality they choose to uphold is the different variable of failure Why are neoliberals getting scared Because Trump is the only person Hilary can beat in a general election Xenophobia that Zuckerberg makes money off of in the first place Huh You have to explain that AND provide a link which twisted version of morality they choose to uphold is the different variable of failure You will need to explain each and how they are variables of failure Wed krispkritter Wed besnook people on facebook are too stupid to matter except that they represent the bottom half of the class and thet decide where things goand they wont stop
