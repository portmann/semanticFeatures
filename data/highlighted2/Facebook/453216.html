OTCPKEADSF OTCPKEADSY I provide a monthly overview and analysis The May report can be read here In this article I will have a look at the orders and deliveries in June Figure Boeing deliveries up until June Source In May Boeing booked orders June saw a lower order inflow which partly has to do with some order announcements being held off until the Farnborough Air Show that will start on the th of July Boeing received orders wide body orders and narrow body orders FedEx NYSE FDX ordered Boeing Freighters part of the mega order it placed with Boeing unidentified customers ordered Boeing MAX BBJ each Okay Airways ordered Boeing MAX part of a deal that Boeing announced in February The updated Boeing figures show that Boeing has been able to gather orders for the Boeing in the first days of July Disappointing in June is the loss of orders for the Boeing At list prices the orders are valued bn but after discounts the market value is closer to bn Compared to June order inflow fell The months June and July however are months that you cannot compare Last year the biannual Paris Air Show took place in June This years biannual Farnborough International Airshow takes place in July So it is not possible to make a meaningful yearoveryear comparison this month During the first months of Boeing received orders versus orders in the first months of an decline This figure is also skewed by the Paris Air Show last year in June but also shows that Boeing is doing quite well maintaining a strong order inflow Figure Boeing deliveries up until June Source AeroAnalysis For Boeing guided slightly lower reflecting lower production rate on the Boeing program and the transition towards the Boeing MAX combined with a gap on the Boeing NG In June Boeing delivered aircraft valued at bn Deliveries increased by units compared to last month Split between narrow and wide body deliveries was a split Freighters were delivered to FedEx Korean Air took delivery of Boeing I Higher deliveries is caused by higher delivery volume for the Boeing and Dreamliners were delivered of which were Boeing s It can be concluded that the Boeing will have the upper hand in the Dreamliner deliveries which bodes well for Boeing as the aircraft has higher profit margins and brings in more cash Delivery volume was above the monthly average In order to reach its delivery target Boeing will need deliveries per month for the remaining months this year Just like in Boeing is targeting a booktobill ratio In June Boeing booked orders and delivered air frames resulting in a booktobill ratio of Yeartodate the booktobill ratio including cancellations is In todays customer spotlight we have Okay Airways Chinas first privately run airline Okay Airways is a Chinese lowcost carrier that primarily operates within China but does have destinations in Japan Thailand and South Korea The airline started commercial service in March and now has a fleet of aircraft Boeing and Xian Ma In February the airline reached an agreement with Boeing for the purchase of Boeing ER Boeing MAXs and Boeing MAXs The deal was subject to approval from the Chinese government The aircraft that are listed by Boeing in the order overview of June likely are the orders for the MAX This brings the total outstanding orders for Okay Airways to while the remaining aircraft that were part of the agreement still await approval Figure Wall Street Horizon WallStHorizon Create your own custom event calendar today The reported deliveries will have an impact on earnings that according to The Wall Street Horizon event calendar will be reported on the th of July before marketopen Order inflow was naturally weak prior to Farnborough International Air Show which is used as stage to announce big orders Deliveries were higher than expected Boeings booktobill ratio is there is some work to do for Boeings marketing team In Boeing achieved its booktobill target at the very last moment Despite lower anticipated deliveries in I expect Boeing to be facing a challenge to achieve its booktobill target In April I published an article in which I stated that the order books of jet makers are not bubbles but should decline at some point In that article I shared my thoughts and expected order inflow to decline in a few years from now With oil prices having declined ever since chances are the order books will decline sooner than I expected at first With Boeing just barely meeting its target last year might be the year in which Boeing will not achieve its booktobill ratio Boeing is currently on its desired booktobill ratio but Boeings marketing team still has to sell almost aircraft to reach its target However given that orders tend to increase from Q and onwards it can be said that things are looking OK for Boeing While I do not expect a whole lot of orders from this years Farnborough Airshow this years airshow will tell a lot about Boeings ability to reach its desired booktobill ratio If you would like to receive
