Web pioneer and setting the stage for a big new internet push by the telecom giant Verizon will combine Yahoos search email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with its AOL unit which it bought last year for billion Verizon has been looking to mobile video and advertising for new sources of revenue outside the oversaturated wireless market The No US wireless operator is betting that it can take data on more than million unique monthly visitors to Yahoo sites many of them on mobile devices and combine it with data on million or so unique monthly AOL users and data on its own user base of over million wireless subscribers to offer a more targeted service for advertisers Barclays said last month Verizon could save million a year in costs of acquiring internet traffic and other expenses by buying Yahoos internet business The deal likely means more investment in popular content sites such as AOLs Huffington Post and Yahoo Finance when they become part of a much larger entity It now becomes somewhat easier to justify investing in content said Brian Wieser an analyst at Pivotal Research Verizon said it would provide more detail on the strategy behind the acquisition when it announces secondquarter earnings on Tuesday The deal came after activist investors led by Starboard Value LP lost faith in Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer who was hired in and forced what became a protracted sale process Yahoo founded in was a dominant player in the early days of the internet but has long lost its leadership position in internet search and

deals close Marni Walden head of product innovation and new business at Verizon will head the combined internet unit and said no decisions had yet been made on the management team Yahoo gives us scale that is what is most critical here said Walden adding that the companys audience will go from the millions to the billions We want to compete and that is the place we need to be Mayer in an interview with Reuters said she still saw a path to growth for Yahoo especially in mobile Whats exciting about the Verizon transaction is that it brings us back to growth sooner she said She said she was openminded about a possible role with the combined companies But analysts expect AOL CEO Tim Armstrong like Mayer a onetime Google executive to be the driving force behind the combined companies Yahoo

Meanwhile traditional web banner advertising long Yahoos strength has become much less lucrative in the age of mobile and video Its a decade of mismanagement that has finally ended for Yahoo said Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner Its the continuation of an extension of Verizons strategy toward becoming a wireless internet player and a move away from telecom regulation for Verizon into an unregulated growth industry Under Armstrong AOL has beefed up its advertising technology with a string of acquisitions and launched the mobile video service go Verizon has not disclosed how financially successful the unit has been but Armstrong known as a formidable salesman has clearly won the confidence of Verizons leaders The integration of Yahoo will not come without challenges In
