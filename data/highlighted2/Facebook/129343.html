The "slowing" is really a breath to regain energy, and when the company finishes that breath, it will again be running, but this time faster.And when it does, those who are invested and have been invested in the company will be thankful for this investment year because of the growth it provided both short term and years afterwards.All in all, this investment year is to be taken in stride.While we will sit through a few more subdued earnings, we will start to see the light at the end of this investment tunnel in another six months.The idea is to keep a long-term view of the company - and stock - as these expenses and reinvestment into the company will produce something larger on the other side.That something larger will be explosive growth in the form of revenue and net income - not to mention some new products.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Source : <b>Facebook</b> May Report Subdued Q2 Earnings But The Outlook Does n't Change Disclosure : I am/we are long FB .
