style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues trading teen users on their different social platforms causing higher costs The company is still predicting higher cost growth for the year and will be a key indicator on the Q earnings report It definitely isnt news that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has a teen issue but it clearly hasnt hurt the stock The real issue is whether the stock is worth billion if the group of social networking sites is only swapping out users including teens The bull case continues that any teens leaving the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>site are going to Instagram thats owned by the social giant The bear case is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>gains nothing by having a user transfer sites and in fact might actually lose out by having higher costs to remonetize the user on another site According to the report from Frank N Magid Associates Inc users in the to yearold age range in the US slipped on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The study found that users dropped for the second consecutive year The concerning part for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is that the trend accelerated this year down percentage points to from in The teen usage drop began from a peak at in The trend is a mixed picture for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with the teen group moving to competitors like Twitter NYSE TWTR or Snapchat while also transitioning time to other media properties owned by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>like Instagram and WhatsApp Possibly most concerning is that only described <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as safe or trustworthy As an example Pinterest ranked much higher with agreeing that those words describe that service The concern should exist that users transfer those issues toward the other properties of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom may attempt to keep a firewall from the privacy issues that are rampant with the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>site but it ultimately is difficult for the influence and mindset to not impact user feelings about that site as well With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>only reaching around billion in revenue this year the story to obtain a billion valuation is the growing and substantial user base of all the properties owned The company bought Instagram and WhatsApp with fast growing user sets and it even spun off Messenger into a separate app in an attempt to further establish a differentiated user base The company has provided the following users totals for each sites <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>billion users as of March Instagram million at start of December Messenger million users as of March WhatsApp million users as of April One point to understand with these varying services is that a general link exists between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Instagram and Messenger Time spent on either app is time not spent on the other Sure it is better to have a teen leave <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for Instagram instead of Twitter or Snapchat to keep that user in the ecosystem but it doesnt add value to the company What it does is keep from subtracting value or does it A big part of the accelerating costs is the company has to now support what is four different services instead of one Also it has to figure out how to monetize the nonFacebook services and to a large extent it has to figure out how to monetize a user that left <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for Instagram So in theory a North American teen on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>earned the company during Q and now earns the company virtually from transitioning to Instagram At the same time Instagram adds one more user to MAUs and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>probably doesnt subtract a user due to the teen still randomly visiting the site in order to count as a MAU On the Q earnings call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>released that costs in would still growth at least and continue cutting into margins Based on the projected cost growth analysts now forecast earnings only growing to Revenues are going to grow around to billion so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is losing leverage built up the last two years by the platform switch Analysts do forecast earnings surging back to growth next year but that is yet to be proven Investors are clearly willing to look past these escalating costs and assume the increases are transitional Sure <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is doing a solid job of capturing teen users transitioning away from the main site into other owned sites like Instagram but investors need to understand it has a cost Constantly buying social media platforms and transitioning users is better than the alternative but it doesnt create a lot of longterm value The goal should be building a platform that maintains the users Paying over x forward earnings is too expensive for the earnings growth and a stock with a market value approaching billion Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Trading Teens Doesnt Add
