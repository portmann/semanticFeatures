products in the US As the FT notes and as previous articles in other publications have pointed out it would be particularly difficult for Apple to increase US manufacturing We discuss why and present a few hedges for Apple shareholders concerned that the increasing prospects of Trump becoming president might weigh on their shares In a recent Seeking Alpha article Time To Consider Trump Insurance we mentioned Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps tariff threat against United Technologies NYSE UTX subsidiary Carrier Carrier came up in a March th Financial Times article requires registration Trump Hits List Of Corporate Targets On Campaign Trail but so did a company we hadnt mentioned in our Trump Insurance article Apple NASDAQ AAPL The FT summarized Trumps case against Apple in the tweet screencaptured below but the article includes an interesting earlier Trump complaint about the company Mr Trumps biggest problem with Apple was with the size of their iPhones I have a lot of Apple stock and I miss Steve Jobs he said in a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>post Tim Cook must immediately increase the size of the screen on the iPhone he urged or Apple would lose a lot of business to Samsungs larger smartphones The article goes on to note that Apple ended up offering larger iPhone screens the following year unlocking huge new growth for the iPhone Trumps suggestion about screen size in counters the claim made by some that he isnt a savvy businessman But how would Apple react to a Trump trade policy that punished it for manufacturing most of its products outside the US In our earlier Trump insurance article we mentioned that a company like Carrier which recently announced plans to shutter an air conditioner plant in the US could decide to reopen that plant to serve the domestic market But as the FT suggests Apple would face more challenges increasing manufacturing here Only one Apple product the highpriced Mac Pro desktop computer has its final assembly in the US today but the company sources several components domestically Nonetheless increasing its US manufacturing base has not been without challenges for Apple In one highprofile case in it invested m in an Arizona supplier of sapphire GT Advanced Technology But GT filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection in after struggling to meet Apples production standards The FTs description of Apples manufacturing challenges in the US brings to mind Jordan Weissmans Atlantic article Why the United States Will Never Ever Build The iPhone Weissman quoted Tim Cooks statement that Apple had moved production to China because of Chinese manufacturers ability to scale up faster and then drilled down to what that actually means What does it mean to scale up faster For Foxconn the global manufacturing behemoth Apple pays to assemble its products its the ability to hire thousands of new workers in a single day Its being able to wake up employees herd them out of the companys onsight dorms and order them pull a midnight shift fastening glass screens onto phones In China workers are cheap plentiful and most importantly mind bogglingly compliant in ways that Americas culture and its tightly enforced labor laws simply wouldnt allow If youre concerned that the prospect of a protectionist US President could start to weigh on Apple shares as Trump gets closer to winning the Republican nomination or if you are just wary of a market pullback consider a few different hedges for an Apple long position For those who would like a refresher on hedging terms please see the section titled Refresher On Hedging Terms in our article on hedging another tech stock Tesla NASDAQ TSLA Limiting Tesla Risk After Citrons Short If you know the future direction of the market or of a particular security with certainty then you dont need to hedge Hedging is for those of us who arent certain of what is going to happen If you knew with certainty that Trump would become president and that that would hurt Apple you wouldnt want to own Apple at all Instead you might want to short the stock Hedging Apple is for those who remain bullish on the company but want to limit their downside risk in the event their bullishness turns out to have been wrong We use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find optimal puts and optimal collars to hedge AAPL below but you dont need the app to do this You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if youre willing to take the time and do the work Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app an additional piece of information youll need to supply along with the number of shares youre looking to hedge when scanning for optimal puts is your threshold which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance When we last looked at hedging Apple we used a threshold of This time well be more conservative and use a threshold of If you are more riskaverse you could use a smaller threshold And if you are less riskaverse you could use a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge These were the optimal puts as of Tuesdays close to hedge shares of AAPL against a greaterthan drop by lateOctober As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value Since this cost is fairly high we are including this hedge mainly for illustration purposes A couple of points about this cost though To be conservative the cost was based on the ask price of the puts In practice you can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and ask The threshold includes this cost ie in the worstcase scenario your AAPL position would be down not including the hedging cost When searching for an optimal collar youll need one more number in addition to your threshold your cap which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge For example if youre hedging over a severalmonth period and you think a security wont appreciate more than over that time frame then it might make sense to use as a cap you dont think the security is going to do better than that anyway so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that Last time we hedged Apple we tried using Portfolio Armors website to get an estimate of AAPLs potential return over the time frame of the hedge But at that time Apple didnt pass the two screens to avoid bad investments that the site runs on every hedgeable security in the US so the site didnt calculate a potential return for it This time Apple passed those two screens so the site did calculate a potential return for it albeit a low one Since we were able to raise that to without raising hedging cost we used as the cap for the first collar below if youre concerned that is too low of an estimate fear not well use Wall Streets higher estimate in a second optimal collar As of Tuesdays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of AAPL against a greaterthan drop by lateOctober while not capping an investors upside by less than As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or as a percentage of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was or of position value So the net cost of this optimal collar was negative meaning an investor would have collected more from the call leg than he paid for the put leg an amount equal to of position value Similar to the situation with the optimal put to be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls In practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have collected more than or of position value when opening the hedge Although the threshold takes into account positive hedging cost as in the case of the put example it doesnt take into account negative hedging cost as in this case So assuming conservatively that the negative hedging cost here is the worst case scenario with this hedge wouldnt be but Similarly the best case scenario wouldnt be the level of the cap but For those who feel is too low of a potential return well use a potential return derived from the median Wall Street price target on Apple as provided by Yahoo Finance the screen capture below is from Yahoo That median price target of represents about a increase from Apples Tuesday closing price of but those price targets go out year and were going to be hedging Apple out about months So weve used as a cap ths of below As of Tuesdays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of AAPL against a drop by lateOctober while not capping an investors upside at less than As you can see at the bottom of the first part of the collar the cost of the put leg was or of position value But the income generated from selling the call leg was or of position value So the net cost of this optimal collar was or of position value As in the case of the two previous hedges the cost here was calculated conservatively so an investor likely would have paid less than to open this hedge And as in the case of the put hedge the threshold here includes the hedging cost so in the worst case scenario an investor would be down not including the cost of the hedge Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
