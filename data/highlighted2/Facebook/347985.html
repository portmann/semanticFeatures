with Siamese twins its a risky proposition for one country to have too much dependency on another The story on Wall Street and CNBC continues to be that were in a correction and this is a buying opportunity Even Warren Buffett joins the chorus of stock market cheerleaders for the skeptical Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Back in October when hedge fund Starboard went activist on Darden Restaurants it had a simple proposal for the companys preeminent restaurant chain Oliver Garden overhaul the entire menu These were some of its suggestions Some parts of the menu can be flavorforward with fresh ingredients extra virgin olive oil lemons ripe tomatoes an array of colorful vegetables lean meats and fresh fish Portion sizes may be gradually reduced as guests will begin to equate Olive Gardens value proposition more with quality and excellence at fair prices than with massive quantities of barely edible fried items excessive cheeses and heavy cream sauces Olive Gardens breadsticks are part of the brand equity as they come to every table The breadsticks need to be of the highest quality with a better taste and a frimer texture and each table must receive hot breadsticks The pasta at Olive Garden must be significantly improved It must be prepared at the proper water temperature boiled in salted water precisely timed to not overcook and tossed with sauces for each dish instead of the current practice of ladling sauce on top of heaps of coagulated pasta We must rethink the amount of items from the flyer Most fried foods are not authentically Italian and it slows service A year and a half later Starboard clearly unaware that the time of activist has passed as cheap debt that fundamental currency of all activist investors is now a luxury has just unleashed a campaign seeking to overthrow the entire board of Yahoo because the fund which clearly was a nutritional expert in late now thinks that its in YHOO stock hodlings entitle it to the intimate knowledge of just how to fix Yahoo Perhaps the thinking goes all it takes for people to start using Yahoo again is a new board A LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF YAHOO INC Yahoos Current Board has Failed to Deliver Results for Shareholders Significant Board Change is Desperately Needed to Hold Management Accountable and Properly Oversee any Operational Turnaround Plan Separation or Sale of Assets The Board Refuses to Embrace the Need for Significant Changes at Yahoo Starboard is Therefore Nominating a Slate of Nine Highly Reputable and Extremely Qualified Directors for Election at Yahoos Annual Meeting Starboard Value LP together with its affiliates Starboard currently has an ownership interest in approximately of the outstanding shares of Yahoo Inc Yahoo or the Company representing an investment of approximately million and making us one of the Companys largest shareholders Starboard Value is an investment management firm with a long and successful track record of investing in underperforming companies and then driving changes that result in significant value creation We believe that Yahoo is deeply undervalued and opportunities exist within the control of management and the Board of Directors the Board to unlock significant value for the benefit of all shareholders Unfortunately as we have outlined in previous letters we have been extremely disappointed with Yahoos dismal financial performance poor management execution egregious compensation and hiring practices and general lack of accountability and oversight by the Board We believe the Board clearly lacks the leadership objectivity and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders To that end we will be delivering to Yahoo today a formal nomination notice of our intention to seek the election of nine highly qualified director nominees at the Annual Meeting These nominees have been carefully vetted and selected following a severalmonth long process that included the evaluation of over qualified potential candidates As described in detail later in this letter this group of individuals collectively has an extremely impressive and diverse set of skills spanning finance operations industry knowledge mergers and acquisitions expertise board governance and oversight as well as decades of experience serving on wellperforming public company boards Importantly this group of nominees if elected is prepared to serve the shareholders of Yahoo and ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance It is unfortunate that this action is necessary As you know from reading our prior letters we have been attempting to work with Yahoo for the past months Over this time frame we have repeatedly requested an opportunity to work with the Company including offers to join the Board and work constructively with the current directors At every step of the way management and the Board have pushed us away The management team and Board of Yahoo have repeatedly failed shareholders Time and again operating results have been decidedly negative and materially worse than managements guidance and external expectations In fact even after management publicly stated that EBITDA had troughed in the third quarter of and would grow going forward EBITDA actually fell yearoveryear This atrocious performance is even more appalling when you consider the billions of dollars spent in recent years on what has proven to be wasteful acquisitions and research and development expenditures As an example Yahoo has spent over billion on acquisitions since and has already written down billion relating to those acquisitions Looking beyond the operating results Yahoo has failed in many other respects including abysmal payforperformance significant conflicts of interest and egregious hiring and governance practices Yet now the same management team and Board that has failed shareholders for years wants shareholders to entrust them with one of the most crucial decisions yet to be made the outcome of the strategic review process for the core Search and Display advertising businesses the Core Business and the eventual fate of Yahoos minority equity interests in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan These are highly complex issues with many potential options some of which will likely involve serious conflicts of interest for management and certain Board members We have offered repeatedly to provide additional bandwidth and capability on the Board while also providing shareholders with increased confidence in the independence of the Boards deliberations and the integrity of the process We believe this is crucial not only to reach the appropriate conclusion but also to ensure that potential buyers believe the Board will take their interest seriously and impartially Thus far all of our offers have been rebuffed There are good reasons for shareholders to be highly concerned about the current strategic review process Despite what appears to be strong interest from large strategic and financial buyers as referenced in the media nearly two months have gone by since Yahoo officially publicly announced its intention to pursue strategic alternatives for the Core Business and it seems little progress has been made Bidders are uneasy over what was described as an uncharacteristically long document three to four times longer than usual without inclusion of private financial information Yahoos asking for restrictions without offering information said a sector banker An NDA is a twoway promise The buyer agrees not to talk and the seller agrees to disclose private information However in this case according to the banker Theres no quid pro quo for Yahoo bidders As referenced in the quote above Yahoo is only now beginning to engage with prospective bidders on NDAs and appears to be demanding onerous and offmarket terms Further it has been wellreported that Verizon normally a conservative company has utilized every public appearance to state its interest in Yahoos Core Business Yet as recently as March th Verizon representatives stated that they have not actually received any information from Yahoo with which to consider a bid So there has been no discussions at all And look what I have said in what Lowell has said is its interesting Butuntil we get under the hood and really see whats there theres really nothing to talk about at this point So well have well let the process flow and when the process is announced and theres a due diligence room well take a look and then well decide what we need to do Francis Shammo CFO of Verizon Deutsche Bank Media Internet and Telecom Conference March These issues should be troubling to shareholders and also cast doubts for prospective buyers of the Core Business as to whether the process is genuine and whether they should commit the time and resources to evaluating a bid and making a proposal This is why we believe it is critical to elect a new Board that would provide muchneeded credibility to a process that has been publicly criticized repeatedly for being too slow fraught with conflicts of interest and very difficult for highly qualified and motivated strategic and financial buyers to access much needed diligence information Given that the strategic review process is underway and the Annual Meeting will not take place until late June we were hopeful that we could reach a mutually agreeable resolution with Yahoo that would allow us to get involved sooner to ensure a good outcome for all Yahoo shareholders We remain open to continuing those discussions with Yahoo We believe our continued involvement is crucial to ensure a full and fair sale process and to put the best possible Board in place in the event a transaction for the Core Business is not achieved in the nearterm We cannot envision a scenario where the shareholders of Yahoo would entrust the current management team and Board with executing a standalone turnaround plan given the years of failed attempts under the current leadership We are confident that you will find the team of professionals we are nominating to be incredibly wellqualified to serve as directors of Yahoo We have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees below Over the coming weeks and months we intend to share our detailed views on

any rate it will be too inclusive for rightwing nutjobs who loathe everyone and everything which doesnt remind them of themselves Sociopathic narcissism comes to mind Yahoo would already be liquidated if it hadnt lucked out with an Alibaba lottery ticket And thats all these companies areissuers of lottery tickets purchased by the rich hoping one out of gets a hital la Facefuck All Yahoo has done has been to throw tens or hundreds of millions at start ups hoping to hit the right one Would be interesting to see how things worked if the CEOs where kicked tothecurb penniless if they wrecked the
