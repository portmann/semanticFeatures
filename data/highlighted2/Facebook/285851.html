long position in MSFT over the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Microsoft is preparing its payasyougo Windows mobile data service The first version of the Windows Cellular Data app from Microsoft only works with laptops and tablets It also requires a Microsoftbranded SIM card Windows tablets with SIM card slots makes them more competitive against the iPad and Android tablets Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT might be plotting to augment its business by creating its own prepaid cellular data service The Cellular Data app is hinting that manufacturers would eventually release Windows products with SIM Subscriber Identification Module card slots The Microsoft SIM will let people choose and buy prepaid mobilecellular data plans from different telecom providers I like the probability that the company could one day become a competent MVNO in the US The MVNO industry in America is very healthy with many players piggybacking on the nationwide networks of ATT NYSE T Verizon NYSE VZ TMobile NASDAQ TMUS and Sprint NYSE S If dozens of players in the industry have been able to survive in America Microsoft could also certainly build its own nichefocused MVNO Alphabet GOOG GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL now sell their own brand of SIM cards It is only proper that Microsoft also builds its own MVNO division There is money to be made in an MVNO service that could be leveraged through the companys excellent pool of enterprise clients Even with the revenue sharing deal between Microsoft MVNO and the telecom partners the economic benefit of millions of people doing repeat purchases of prepaid cellular plans is a longterm winning proposition for Microsoft If we estimate the company will get cut from its MVNO partnerships the future global annual revenue stream could be substantial Microsoft given its vast resources and clients base has the potential to build a worldwide MVNO business with million or more customers If we estimate that a Microsoft SIM customer spends an average of on his prepaid monthly cellular data the companys potential monthly cut could reach million My billionyear estimate is reasonable because of the stilldeveloping global MVNO market Unlike other developed countries the US is also a growing market for these services According to a report pdf download link from McKinsey there were MVNOs or nonnetwork operators in the US but they only have market share of the mobile internet business Focusing On A Lucrative Niche Market Like Business Users The Microsoft MVNOs initial buildup could be done through enterprise channels The company and its Windows OEM partners could bundle the Microsoft SIM with hardwaresoftware packages Aside from selling software and hardware to enterprise clients it could make good money from also selling cellular data services to corporations The threats of industrial espionage and random hack attacks means theres a niche market for MVNOs who could provide flexible cellular data services Public access WiFi hotspots in hotels airports and other unsecured locations are not ideal for travelling employees whose laptopstablets contain sensitive data The business of mobile internet services is no longer the sole monopoly of telecom operators Hardwaresoftware vendors like Microsoft Google and Apple are the best cellular data providers for consumers Microsoft could offer many freebies to attract and retain the loyalty of MVNO customers The other benefit of selling the Microsoft SIM is that it would also help improve the market viability of Windows laptopstablets The pricey Surface ProBook Windows products are popular among business users However they still do not have cellular data capabilities By making Windows products SIM cardfriendly the Surface computers become more attractive than SIMcard equipped Android and iOS tablets I expect the company to also encourage its OEM partners to produce Windows products with SIM card slots locked to work only with Microsoft SIMCellular Data app Thirdparty carriers like Verizon will have to sell prepaid cellular data plans exclusively through Microsofts Windows store Microsoft gets a commission from productsservices bought through its app store The Microsoft MVNO will eventually serve Windows phone users too The Cellular Data app and Microsoft SIM should also work in Windows Mobile devices The idea is similar to what Cherry Mobile did here in the Philippines Cherry Mobile the biggest smartphone vendor in my country launched its own prepaid SIM card in partnership with Globe Telecom last November Cherry Mobile excelled in selling lowcost AndroidWindows phones and tablets It also has its own appmedia store for mobile phones users However the company still needed the extra income from putting up its own MVNO brand to improve its operating margins The same scenario applies to the emerging MVNO ambitions of Microsoft This company has longterm benefits if it could also monetize the mobilecellular data usage of all Windows device owners It is given that smartphones will always outsell tabletsnotebooks The growth prospect of the upcoming Microsoft MVNO is therefore a lot better if it also caters to all future Windows Mobile handsets The people who only buy unlocked sub Windows phones are still potential customers for the Microsoft SIM They could become repeat customers who spend month for prepaid cellular data plans On the other hand the people who buy expensive Surface Pro products are the ideal customers for a postpaid Microsoft SIM Xiaomi launched its own postpaid month Mi SIM service last September in China Microsoft could also replicate this and offer a postpaid version of its SIM card Microsoft doesnt have a competitive mobile advertising business that could catch up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Alphabet It also has a far weaker app store economy compared to the iOS and Android platforms An MVNO business might therefore be the better course for the company to find new sources of revenue Like Apple and Alphabet Microsoft has vast resources to help improve the growth of virtual mobile networks in America Instead of relying mostly on tier carriers to sell its products the company should instead build its own MVNO to directly market its hardware and services Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
