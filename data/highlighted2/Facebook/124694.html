class='textDiv'>Twitter The Growth Misperception Twitter Inc NYSETWTR Seeking Alpha Investors have a misperception that Twitter is a slow growth company Twitter had the fastest growth rate of any tech stock its size So many investors spend their time focusing on the user base of Twitter NYSE TWTR versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB that the growth and valuation is misunderstood Most investors focus on Twitter not having the user ramp similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but at the same time miss that in reality the company has market leading revenue growth Since everything in the market is relative over the long term investors need to keep in mind that Twitter is only worth nearly billion and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is over billion The difference is massive and no longer indicative of companies that should be compared outside of arms length In the article Twitter Still Cheaper Than You Think the case was made for catalysts that make the stock appealing at these levels This article will focus on the misperception of the growth of the company relative to other tech stocks and primarily <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The most common comparison of the two companies is the amount of active monthly users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>leads in this category by a long shot with Q MAUs topping billion Twitter weighed in at only million or million if including the fast dial users from emerging markets like India Using quick math one can see that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has nearly x the users on the core sites The stock though is worth more than x the valuation of Twitter The key to the focus on the core sites is that those are the only ones that generated material revenue for either company Over the next five years both will compete with secondary sites such as Instagram versus Periscope Though the market constantly slams Twitter for the lack of users matching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it isnt like the core <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>site is growing at any fast rate with MAUs only up for Q Mostly investors review the revenue growth and the user growth of the noncore sites of Instagram and WhatsApp to extrapolate positive longterm growth With Twitter investors take the faster revenue growth and ignore it due to the meager user growth of the core site The question is whether a hot livestreaming app like Periscope will give the company that carrot to rally momentum investors For Q Twitter had million users for an growth rate over last year Notice how the Twitter user base is actually growing faster than the core <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>While investors can debate the focus on user metrics the actual revenue numbers arent debatable Twitter has some of the highest revenue growth rates in the market as the social media company continues to ramp up monetization of traffic Analysts forecast Twitter Q revenue growth of versus only for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>For Twitter again wins with growth rates versus only for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Twitter is the clear winner based on these metrics which of course could change with actual numbers It is very possible that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>closes that gap if Twitter again disappoints Without a permanent CEO Twitter might struggle to maintain that fast revenue growth Moving beyond the comparison to just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Twitter had the fastest revenue growth rates of tech companies with market caps above billion The past isnt always indicative of future growth and some of these numbers dont actually capture proforma numbers that accurately account for acquisitions and divestments As an example Avago Technologies NASDAQ AVGO was removed from the below chart because the data showed revenue growth due to a merger The key is that the chart above highlights the misperception of Twitter It is constantly viewed in the light of user growth instead of the actual improvements in the financials where it leads the largecap tech sector Twitter probably wont ever be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but it doesnt mean that the stock wont close the valuation gap The market has a misperception that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is somehow growing at a faster rate than Twitter but that isnt the case with users or revenue The great wild card is whether the popularity of the Periscope app can reinvigorate the stock and grab some of that momentum that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>obtains from other sites like Instagram The stock will be volatile the rest of as the search for a permanent CEO unfolds but Twitter is in a much better position to head higher than the market perceives Source Twitter The Growth Misperception Disclosure Iwe have no
