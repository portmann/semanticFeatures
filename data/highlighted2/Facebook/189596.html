coverage of more than stocks many of which have little or no coverage elsewhere Rocksolid balance sheet with m in net cash Movado trades at x next fiscal year EVEBITDA FY MOV trades at lower multiple than its peers The Apple Watch turns out to be a much milder threat than expected Movado is an assetlight business It doesnt manufacture watches Its a cashrich business Movado Group NYSE MOV is one of the worlds premier watchmakers Movado Group designs sources markets and distributes fine watches in almost every major category comprising the watch industry You have seen some of its many wellknown brands Its portfolio of brands currently comprises core brands such as Concord Ebel ESQ Movado and familiar fashion licensed names as Coach Watches Scuderia Ferrari Watches HUGO BOSS Watches Juicy Couture Watches Lacoste Watches Movado and Tommy Hilfiger Watches The watches are fabricated through independent contractors in Switzerland and Movado is headquarted in Paramus New Jersey Movado is an American company but has the majority of its watches manufactured in Switzerland and it has been a tough year for Swiss watchmakers For the past year Movados stock price has taken a major fall Movado is under attack on two different fronts technology and the rise of the Swiss franc Chinas recent stock market turbulence also took its toll on the stock The introduction of the Apple Watch combined with a surge in the Swiss franc have sent Movado stock price from the s to a low of But the single largest factor behind the decline is due to Apple NASDAQ AAPL entering the Smartwatch industry Apple is casting a giant cloud over the entire industry Apple has a history of disrupting and dominating an industry once it enters iTunes mobile tablets you name it etc Apple Watch is the most personal device weve ever created We set out to make the best watch in the world said Tim Cook on September during the Apple Watch announcement According to the fiveyear performance chart above the stock has seen better days In November Movado hit a peak of per share and traded in the s range weeks before the Apple Watch announcement The stock has been on a downward trend most of the year to hit a low of in August The stock has since recovered with the release of good Q results on August By looking at the graph you might wonder about certain sharp fluctuations The severe drop in November was due to disappointing Q results and revised downward guidance However Q results turned out above the revised guidance and the stock picked up to to only make its way down afterward YTD the stock is down and the year return is down Apples entry into watches is definitely a concern but the Apple Watch turns out to be a much milder threat than expected Theres positive side to the Apple Watch story First it got millennials interested in watches or at least talking about them One needs to look at a company like Shinola which prides itself on manufacturing its watches in Detroit its a major hit among hipsters and I should mention that the companys watches are good old quartz ones not smart Swatch Group AG OTCPKSWGAY said the company has been trying to sell its smartwatch since Now that Apple is there demand for Swatchs smartwatches has boosted Second concerns about smartwatches are driving innovation across the Swiss industry which could help longerterm sales Most brands are coming out with some kind of wearablesmart device Some will be hits some will be mostly misses However this innovation will plant the seeds for the future of the industry There will be trickledown effects and lead to better products down the line Movado doesnt have significant exposure to Asia with only of net sales The US a strong and growing watch market is responsible for of Movados sales Swatch Group AG probably Movados most comparable competitor has a lot of exposure in Asia Swatch posted a drop in firsthalf profit and noted weaker demand from markets such as Hong Kong but net sales increased to billion swiss francs from billion swiss francs Updates from the Compagnie Financiere Richemont OTCPKCFRHF and Prada OTCPKPRDSY were better than expected despite the turmoil gripping China Basically this is saying that Chinas thirst for luxury goods is still there There are many things that I like about Movado It is a business that has good or improving economics and often generates sales and profits in multiple jurisdictions Movado is cheap It is attractively valued at x next fiscal year EVEBITDA and a price to earnings of x detailed valuation below The balance sheet is mostly cash and inventory The company carries net cash of m Thats a lot of cash when your market cap is about m At the moment Movado is completing a m share buyback program Its expected to continue to aggressively buyback shares with a renewed program in November Usually when you buy of the float it should fuel EPS higher Movado trades at x book value and no value is given to its own brands Movados brands Ebel Concord ESQ and Movado are given no intangible value on the balance sheet They are obviously worth something on the open market since they bring so much cash to Movado The business model is assetlight because the capital intensive process of manufacturing watches is done by somebody else The latest quarter revealed that the Apple Watch threat was overblown Sales were up over the same quarter last year and thats taking into account a m hit because of the currency fluctuation Movado also maintained its fullyear guidance for this fiscal year As for the smartwatch threat Movado is entering the arena in Q with its own smart device And last Im not a watch connoisseur but I really like the look of the classic Movado Museum style I find a lot of watches to be jampacked with info and too crowded Movado has those too I just need a watch that looks good with a suit or to go out to a dinner not a tool to control a space station Its clean simple and elegant Theres an intangible there Movado watches looked great forty years ago look great today and will look great in forty years I want to make it clear that Movado does not manufacture any of the products it sells just like Nike NYSE NKE doesnt produce any shoes Movado employs a flexible manufacturing model that relies on independent manufacturers to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences Except for certain models mentioned below Movados watches are manufactured in Swizterland through an independent third party Movado with the exception of Movado BOLD Ebel and Concord watches are manufactured in Switzerland by independent thirdparty assemblers All Movado ESQ Movado Ebel and Concord watches are manufactured using Swiss movements All of Movados products are manufactured using components obtained from thirdparty suppliers ESQ Movado and Movado BOLD watches are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia using Swiss movements Coach Tommy Hilfiger Hugo Boss OTCPKBOSSY Juicy Couture Scuderia Ferrari and Lacoste watches are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia Movado is said to be highly selective in its licensing strategy and chooses to enter into longterm agreements with only powerful brands The following table sets forth the brands licensed by Movado Movado Group portfolio of brands Source K Movado Group sells all of its brands in the US wholesale market primarily to major jewelry store chains such as Helzberg Diamonds Corp and Sterling Inc department stores such as Macys NYSE M and Nordstrom NYSE JWN as well as independent jewelers Sales to trade customers in the US are made directly by the Movados US sales force and to a lesser extent independent sales representatives Internationally Movados brands are sold through a combination of department stores its own sale force and independent distributors The company also operates Movado Retail Group which has outlet stores located in centers across the US The current Movado Group was founded by Gedalio Grinberg Mr Grinberg is a legend in the watch industry for recognizing the potential cachet of luxury watches and marketing them accordingly Mr Grinberg was born in Cuba and escaped to Miami in after receiving death threats from Fidel Castros secret police With two other refugees he set up a Piaget distributorship in New York The company known for years as the North American Watch Company first distributed other companies Swiss watches It then acquired watch companies including Movado and Concord to build its own portfolio of bands Movado went public in Mr Grinberg helped developed the status watch market Watches were considered utilitarian and Americans unlike Europeans regarded watches as a gift for high school graduation Mr Grinberg helped changed that perception In Forbes said Grinberg helped make Americans conscious of their watches and made the glint of gold on a male wrist a status symbol Mr Grinberg said he wanted people to believe that a watch on a wrist could be as impressive as a Cadillac in a driveway Watch Time said Mr Grinberg had led a revolution in watch marketing in America Movado was a struggling brand when it was acquired by Grinberg in Sales that year totaled just million The Grinberg team created a new product line around the Museum Watch and a new advertising campaign aimed at a younger more educated audience with an interest in culture and arts The formula worked In Movados sales reached million Since then it has become the core brand and flagship of Grinbergs company which officially became known as the Movado Group in His son Efraim Grinberg the current Chairman and CEO joined the company in and is running it from the early s as the COO and became CEO in His two other kids Alex Grinberg and Miriam Phalen also worked for Movado and together they control the company through Class A shares which is entitled to x votes per common share I dont believe the market consensus that smartwatches is the major threat to the traditional watch industry They are a threat but milder than expected Plus the industry is responding Like Movado Frederique Constant and Mondaine announced they will sell a smartwatchdevice Compagnie Financiere Richemont SAs Montblanc brand introduced an eStrap and Swatch Group AG has smart devices Economic volatility is more of a threat to sales than Apples latest fashion experiment In August according to the Fdration de lindustrie horlogre suisse FHs report Swiss watch exports decline of compared to August Shipments to Hong Kong the largest market declined while China registered a decline Meanwhile the important markets of the US Japan Germany and France all registered growth in excess of You can get a lot of Swiss watch industry statistics here The report also goes on to explain the value of exported watches fell by only volumes for their part contracted by In both cases steel products determined the overall result The only significant improvement concerned the value of precious metal watches and goldsteel watches were down The price category that was hurt the most are watches costing between francs USD USD CHF USD while the francs category remained close to the sectoral average with a decline in value of Sales of watches costing more than were up Source Fdration de lindustrie horlogre suisse FH Basically what I noted from the report is that sales are down because of a very large drop in the Far East For the rest of the world in particular the US and Europe watch sales are doing fine How does this relate to Movado If the data is accurate Movados licensed brands were the most affected by the Asian summer slump They are mostly metal watches and cheaper than Movados luxury brands On the other hand its owned luxury brand portfolio the and up watches wasnt impacted and maybe probably benefited Also Movado is not as exposed to Asia as its competitors In fiscal only of sales were in Asia and in the US a more favorable growing market Q which included results in July showed increased sales in both luxury and licensed categories We will know in November the exact impact of the volatile summer on the numbers Part of this segment was derived from my blog and does not affect Movados valuation I offer my opinion on the Apple Watch and various devices so feel free to skip it With phones tablets and other devices do you really need a watch to remind you to check your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB notifications A watch is a fashion accessory We obviously know that buying a watch has nothing to do with knowing the correct time if it did we would buy a Casio plus isnt what a smartphone is for There are plenty of wrist devices on the market but in this segment I mostly focus on the Apple Watch since its the product generating the most buzz At the moment wrist gadgets are a trend That might change in the future but at the moment just like a dumb watch the Apple Watch is a fashion gadget accessory Apple might think the company is in the luxury watch segment but it is not The Apple Watch I get it and it will get buyers Its a gadget a toy something cool to have at not k The gold Apple Watch I dont get it and Im not alone When I talked to other people about the highend k watch their first reaction is not OMG I cant afford it but its more wow thats stupid whos going to buy that Clearly not the same reaction when you see a Rolex Its probably one of the rare bad decisions Apple made along with Apple Map and free U album Apple will not succeed in the luxury watch market You cant be a mass consumer product company and pretend to be the Bentley of watches at the same time Apple wont disclose how many smartwatches they sold for competitive reasons This isnt a matter of not being transparent but a matter of not giving our competition insight said Tim Cook Apple didnt break out watch sales separately as it does with iPhones and iPads However Apple is not shy to tell us every three months how many iPhones they sold Who cares now about giving competition insights iPhones sold in the first two days after it was released at the end of the quarter The iPhone is off to a great startwe hope to sell our onemillionth iPhone by the end of its first full quarter of sales said Steve Jobs Same thing with the iPad when it came out Apple didnt mind parading around their great sales A fine luxury watch is cool classic and never goes out of style A highquality watch is a timeless collectible piece of microengineering A watch remains a status symbol and an important asset A legacy watch is supposed to project success and lust The kind of asset that keeps its value over time and that you might want to pass on with pride to your grandchildren one day I cant picture myself donating the Apple Watch or you favorite wrist device as part of the family heritage in years or so Imagine kids in fifty years receiving their grandpas first gold Apple watch Which would answer the question of what I did with their college money but at least you could salvage the gold Anybody who wanted an Apple Watch bought one by now We dont hear anything about Googles Android Wear or the Garmin smart watch that you can buy at the Dell store Im surrounded with friends who are Apple lovers Im referring to the company in Cupertino not the fruit and I believe they are formally known as Mac Addicts These Apple lovers Im referring to have all the devices but have no interest in the Apple Watch High quality expensive Swiss timepieces will remain a means for the wealthy to distinguish themselves With Apple playing the fashion card it means that it could be unfashionable At the lowerend of the segment smartwatches have an impact on the market In the highend luxury segment having a piece of software telling you how many steps you took waters down the prestige element Movado conducts its business primarily in two operating segments Wholesale and Retail The Wholesale segment includes the designing manufacturing and distribution of quality watches and revenue generated from aftersales service activities and shipping The Retail segment includes the Movados outlet stores Movado also operates in two major geographic locations US operations and International Movado has divided its watch business into two principal categories the luxury and the licensed brands categories The luxury brands category consists of Movados own brands Ebel Concord Movado and ESQ Watches in the licensed brands category include Coach HUGO BOSS Juicy Couture Lacoste Tommy Hilfiger and Scuderia Ferrari Key drivers are new product innovation and strong marketing Movado has two major selling seasons The spring season this includes school graduations and several holidays and most importantly the Christmas and holiday season Major selling seasons in certain international markets center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring Historically sales have been higher during the second half of the fiscal year with of Movados net sales of sales were in the US That includes wholesale and retail The rest was on the international market The international sales are pretty diversified During fiscal Europe accounted for of sales the Americas excluding the US Asia and the Middle East for During FY whole sales to US grew while international sales were flat Retail sales are up which is primarily attributable to the opening of new stores Comparable outlet stores increased from prior year sales All outlets locations are in the US For the first sixmonths of fiscal net sales increased to m compared to m Source Movado Group Inc at the th Annual ICR XChange Conference Presentation We are currently in fiscal and it ends on January That means theres quarters left of results to achieve their objectives How is Movado going to achieve that On the revenue side Movado Group wants to hit m in sales by January On the strategic plan that represents a CAGR on revenues of on fiscal to Where are we now Pretty far TTM revenues are at m and guidance for FY is m two quarters left half year sales are at m Movados gross margins are primarily affected by four major factors brand and product sales mix product pricing strategy manufacturing costs and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates in particular the relationship between the US dollar and the Swiss franc Movados gross margins may not be comparable to its comps since some companies include all the costs related to their distribution networks and other expenses Movado includes those as its SGA expenses Watches in the luxury category generally earn higher gross margin percentages than watches in the licensed brand category The difference in gross margin percentages for the licensed brand category is primarily due to the impact of royalty payments made on the licensed brands Movados cost of sales consists primarily of raw material component costs royalties labor assembly costs depreciation amortization and unit overhead costs associated with the companys supply chain operations in Switzerland and Asia The Swiss francs appreciation has hurt Movado The currency has risen more than against the euro since the Swiss National Bank SNB dropped its cap in January As Movado manufactures its watches in Switzerland with a cost base largely in Swiss francs and a portion of its sales in foreign currencies the SNBs decision raises problems Swiss watchmakers which have long touted production in Switzerland as a guarantee of quality cant shift production to cheaper countries In response Movado have been selectively raising prices but it hasnt been enough to compensate for the slight margin erosion Below is a table of Movados gross profit and margins On a fiveyear basis from to Movado has improved its gross margin and profit However it has slightly been dipping since A large part of the dip is due mostly to the unfavorable impact of fluctuation in forex A small part in the dip was due to severance agreements from Movados operating efficiencies initiative The decline was partly offset by the shift in product mix price increases and certain sourcing improvement Operating income and margin a key metric has improved over the last couple years in part because Movado has been focusing on becoming a more efficient and productive company Because of reasons cited above margins have dipped a couple basis points Movados goal see slide above to achieve operating income margin by FY a goal that wont likely be achieved but at least the company is heading in the right direction A reverse of the Swiss franc would definitely help And since the goal of achieving m in revenues wont be accomplished the goal of m in operating income wont be attained Movado had a goal of achieving EPS by Again another ambitious goal that I doubt will be achieved With sales growing slower than expected the main EPS driver will be aggressive share buybacks and cost cutting Analyst consensus for FY EPS is Thats a growth rate over this years target This years EPS guidance of includes a reduced share count but not for next year So EPS could be higher if Movado renews its share repurchase program The Grinberg family doesnt have a lot of common shares but have control because of its Class A shares Power is concentrated in three peoples hand Efraim Grinberg Alexander Grinberg Miriam Phalen Each Class A share is entitled to ten votes per share Unfortunately management doesnt hold a lot of stock Richard Cot the Vice Chairman and COO is also the largest holder and is currently selling As of September he holds shares after selling shares Hes gradually selling his stake but he remains the person with the largest stake Of course I dont like it when management is selling its shares but Movados aggressive buyback gives me confidence Above is Movados largest shareholders as of June Most of them have been longterm holders A few of them hold close to of the common share even though you cant influence anything One noticeable shareholder is Royce Associates LLC with a of the common shares in the company Royce Associates is highly regarded small cap value investor Chuck Royces company The Royce Funds is a family of funds that focuses primarily on smallcap investing and has been considered one of the industrys most experienced smallercompany stock pickers Having Chuck Royces family of funds as shareholders is a vote of confidence Another noticeable shareholder is Epoch Investment Partners Inc which is another respectable fund manager By the way Sigma Capital Management LLC is not a shareholder I dont know why it shows you because as you can see the latest data is Movado Group screens pretty well Now I just have to make sure its not some kind of value trap Companies that trade at such low multiples usually warrant it We are in a market where its really hard to find good companies trading at good prices Its a pretty tough environment to be a luxury watch manufacturer First thing I did is that I made a comps table that you will find below Its difficult to find pureplay comparables Watchmakers and luxury apparel companies trade all over the world and they operate in many different fashion segments watches jewelry apparels Some of the comps above own several of the worlds leading companies in the field of luxury good in jewelry and luxury watches Swatch Group AG is the most similar watchmaker to Movado Group Its a global company with many different luxury watch segments The cheapest stock of the group by valuation metrics Fossil NASDAQ FOSL deserves its valuation since its not performing very well and has been lowering guidance Without Fossil the groups EVEBITDA average is x instead of x just to show how much Fossil drags the groups average down Movado Group is by far the smallest company of the group and the only one with a market cap under one billion What does it all mean Fossil the struggling company is trading at x trailing EVEBITDA You could make the case that Fossil is also the worst performing company of the group Movado which is performing relatively well is trading at x EVEBITDA As discussed above Q results have demonstrated that the company is navigating the difficult context pretty well Swatch Group AG which has a lot of exposure to Asia sales and despite the recent difficulties is trading at a much higher multiple of x EVEBITDA MOV cant command an EVEBITDA over x like the Compagnie Financire Richmond SA Kering SA OTCPKPPRUY or LVMH OTCPKLVMUY because we are talking about companies operating in a different league It wouldnt be fair to apply their metrics to Movado I dont believe it would give you a reasonable valuation range This brings me back to the x Swatch Group AG is trading at The major difference between the two is size Swatch is a b market cap company and Movado is hovering around m Theres a potential discount for the lack of control The Grinberg family Efraim Alex and Miriam hold voting power through their Class A shares Its good to have insiders that are heavily invested in the company but on the other hand one must wonder if their interest is aligned with the shareholders Back to the EVEBITDA multiple Movado looks attractive in a takeover situation because of its small size and lack of debt Movado could command a x EVEBITDA The FY EBITDA derived from estimated FY sales of m analyst consensus I apply a EBITDA margin below the average of the last three fiscal years I used a lower number to take into account the lower Swiss franc and other negative pressure The projected sales is far from the m goal that was established in their strategic plan Even if I used m in sales up from m for FY at x EBITDA I get an implied share price of for a return of This is a very reasonable conservative approach My valuation assumes a lower FY revenues m vs m analysts lower EBITDA margin vs three year average and a lower EVEBITDA multiple x vs x average vs for Swatch Movados strategic plan called for EPS of by FY Just like the sales target I believe this is overly optimistic Analyst average estimate is FY EPS which I believe is reasonable It could be higher depending on how aggressive the next share repurchase program is During Q MOV repurchased approximately shares under its share repurchase program As of July the company had m remaining under the m share repurchase authorization I assume that Movado will use the rest of the m At current price I estimate that between k to k will be repurchased The FY EPS guidance is not affected because it already includes a reduced share count Movado might renew a m repurchase program and it could go as high as m again if it wanted to Below theres a table on the repurchase program for FY I also assumed a and repurchase average price It sounds paradoxal but the lower the share price the more beneficial it is to longterm shareholders I know that my analysis below is a very straightforward linear example and life doesnt work out in a linear path Theres a lot of assumptions going into this such as if they renew the share repurchase program getting the average cost right and hitting earnings estimates The point Im trying to make is not projecting the right numbers but to demonstrate the effect of share repurchase on EPS On a pricetoearnings approach I relied on analysts consensus for FY Its could higher depending on how aggressive is the next share repurchase program mentioned above Under this approach the low range estimate derives an implied share price of per share for upside A x multiple to earnings would deliver a return Under my valuation approaches I get a share price range of to I think Movado is worth a share which would represent a return without dividends MOV currently trades at x next fiscal EVEBITDA and provides a free cash flow yield Theres enough of a margin of safety to take into account potential misjudgement and protect against the downside The brands Ebel Concord ESQ and Movado must be worth something on the market The balance sheet doesnt reflect that since theres no intangible recorded Also my valuation assumes a lower FY revenues m vs m analysts lower EBITDA margin vs three year average and a lower EVEBITDA multiple x vs x average vs x for Swatch Movado has a rocksolid balance sheet with lots of cash A lot of that money is being used for an aggressive share repurchase program Five consecutive years of growth in sales Movado realized a compounded annual sales growth of during that period Movado has been decreasing operating expenses from to of sales Movado continued to gain market share domestically US in the to price range Movado manages to grow in a weak economy and intense competition Movados portfolio of fashion brands are some of greatest brand names in the world have recognized Movado for its competency to develop its watch business Very diverse portfolio that caters to many different demographics MOV has developed strong new product pipeline A smart device is expected in the fourth quarter Movado brand a leader in the to price category in North America continued to gain market share Constantly introducing new products Good product mix Undertaking several advertising campaigns to market its products US sales of fine jewelry and fine watches increased by percent in July according to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce June sales gains reflect a modest increase The Deloitte survey showed that Swiss watchmakers optimism about sales in the US home of the smartwatch was at a record high The rise of the smartwatch After reading my article my views are clear However they remain a threat and compete for the consumers dollar The strong Swiss franc is a concern Extreme fluctuation in foreign currency exchange impacts results Movado is particularly affected by currency swing because most of its production is in Switzerland The Swiss franc has risen more than against the euro since the Swiss National Bank dropped its cap in January Luxury spending in two major markets HongKong and China is significantly down A report by Deloitte showed that pessimism about the economic outlook was at its highest since at least Millennials who often dont wear watches Traditional watches are not exciting If the Movado loses any of its license agreements there may be significant loss of revenues and a negative effect on business The Grinberg family owns a majority of the voting power of Movados stock They control the family through Class A shares where each Class A shares is entitled to votes That might at times be in conflict with shareholder interest MOV is targeting EPS of in Fiscal Even if they come close to hitting it the stock remains cheap on a F PE basis A drop in the overvalued Swiss franc Market realization of Movados own brands There are no intangible on the balance sheet Although this is a challenging period for disciplined value investors I remain confident that Movado will deliver satisfying results over time This is not a pitch about a highgrowth company with bluesky forecasts Its simply a case of market mispricing Movado remains unloved or overlooked by the broader market today The Apple Watch threat to the industry is overblown Movados first sixmonth results were encouraging Despite the Apple watch storm and the Swiss franc storm instead of getting slaughtered Movado still managed to increase sales It seems that the Apple watch buzz is over Anybody who wanted an Apple Watch already bought it Baselworld the annual ComicCon of watch turned out to be a success and pretty much shrugged off the Apple Watch The market expected the worst but the worst didnt come Instead of a F hurricane Movado was hit by clouds When will the market change its mind Well Apple does cast a pretty large shadow Movado cant control what Apple does or markets sentiment But what Movado can control is its financial performance If it can keep delivering on the results side then the market will realize that Movado is fine MOV maintains its guidance for fiscal So thats a good sign Movada expects net sales to be in the range of m to m gross margin of and operating income to increase approximately to m to m Net income should be in the range of m to m or EPS to The SNB decided to keep its main interest rate at saying that the Swiss franc was still significantly overvalued The SNB wants to make the Swiss franc much less attractive A lower Swiss franc is in Movados interest since a big part of its cost base is in Switzerland As explained in the article the higher Swiss franc has caused havoc in the watch industry Lower cost base means better margins and better results And better results should result in a higher stock price There are several catalysts that could push Movado higher The first one and immediately effective is Movado continuing to aggressively buyback its shares Movado is finishing a m share buyback program its expected to renew it in November Another m to m in buybacks would shave of the shares outstanding and would fuel EPS higher Obviously the two main factors is how big the share buyback program is and the average purchase price Another catalyst is a market normalization of Movado valuation metric MOVs valuation metrics are lower than its peers and is not warranted Movado trades at x trailing PE versus x for its peers Next years PE ratio is a low x At the current price Movado could be a nice takeover target Its a small target with global reach it has m in net cash and generates plenty of free cash flow with a FCF yield of Of course the only issue would be convincing the Grinberg family to sell Another observation is that the market doesnt seem to attribute any value to Movados own brands On the balance sheet there are no intangibles recorded The brands Ebel Concord ESQ and Movado must be worth something on the market if sold Movado currently trades at an attractive entry point Under my valuation approaches I get a share price range of to I think Movado is worth a share which would represent a return without dividends Movado currently trades at x next fiscal EVEBITDA Theres enough of a margin of safety to take into account for potential misjudgment and protect against the downside My valuation assumes lower FY revenues m vs m analysts lower EBITDA margin vs three year average and a lower EVEBITDA multiple x vs x average vs x for Swatch While you wait you can rely on the small but growing dividend to compensate for your patience Movado will be rewarding to the patient investor Editors Note This article
