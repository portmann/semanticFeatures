class='textDiv'>Disney A Sum Of The Parts Arbitrage Opportunity The Walt Disney Company NYSEDIS Seeking Alpha A sumoftheparts or breakup assessment suggests upside potential in Disneys stock price from current levels This assessment is viewed in a case of a potential restructuring spinoff splitoff tracking stock or an equity IPO carveout Restructuring lens is only meant to highlight hidden value Its undervalued because of wrongful industrial designations scale makes it susceptible to numerous headline risks and lack of deeper dive into its segments while performing DCF PTA or MA assessments A sumoftheparts SOTP or breakup analysis suggests that Disneys NYSE DIS stock price has potential upside This value is hidden in segments within the five major segments In spite of having billion in market cap Disney has continued to move the needle stock price appreciation and yy average dividends growth rate in the last years Disney has managed to become a disruptor stake in Hulu starting DisneyLife and a benefactor of traditional media by creating great content making accretive acquisitions investing and partnering with disruptive companies such as Netflix and Amazon In addition Disney has a significant brand equity and owns a portfolio of lucrative cashgenerating Intellectual Properties IP It also has a seasoned management team with a lot of skin in the game with the CEO owning shares Outside of their core business Disney also has a small real estate empire with a land mass in acres larger than Manhattan and of San Francisco The value of assets greatly improves when you include the value of its attractions IP buildings and equipment The surprisingly part about Disney is that the stock has more than enough coverage However the underlying value of its businesses is highly undervalued This undervaluation is a function of Disneys scale Scale has negatively affected Disneys valuations mainly because investors only focus on a tiny aspect of one segment last year it was ESPN and because assigning industry multiples to Disney is misleading It is misleading because of the diverse nature of its business segments Disneys year revenue growth rate was used to estimate the stocks fair value for The fair value was then broken down by segment Each segment was then assigned an EPS estimate based on its revenue contribution to Disneys total revenues Disneys year average annual EPS growth is The company had EPS of for FY end Using the projected EPS is This is a reasonable estimate because Yahoo Finance has Disneys TTM EPS of Graph shows Disneys yy EPS growth rates between Data was derived from Morningstar and graphed as shown below To estimate a fair value for Disney we also need to consider the impact of dividends Because aside from stock price appreciation Disney also returns value to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks Disney has grown dividends yy on average in the last decade I opted to use lowest growth rate in the last years over the average for two reasons dividends using is too high and growing global uncertainties such as slow economic growth and the postBrexit ramifications might hinder growth Graph showing Disneys dividend growth between The company has grown dividends at an average of yy in the last years Data was taken from Morningstar and graphed This section assigns a rough EPS estimate for to each of Disneys segments Yahoo Finance has Disneys forward PE ratio at x and I am using as my calendar EPS Capitalized at x and accounting for in dividends we generate in expected value upside to Disneys current stock price For each segment we added EPS plus dividends to get Then distributed using contribution to sales to each segment to get and for Media Networks Parks Resorts Studio Entertainment Consumer Products and Interactive respectively MEDIA NETWORKS Accounts for of TR Overview segments that make up Disneys Media Networks segment Media Networks is an important segment of Disney not only because it accounts for of TR but because it has valuable stakes in Hulu Fusion and ESPN The segment breakdown is as follows Cable networks ESPN owned Disney Channels owned ABC Family owned AE Television Networks owned the Hungama kids entertainment featuring anime Hindilanguage series and game shows and UTVBindass networks in India Broadcasting Domestic broadcast network television production and distribution operations and eight owned domestic television stations This segment has two major great investments A interest in Hulu LLC Hulu A Netflix like joint venture with Fox Entertainment Group and NBCUniversal that acquires and produces film and television content and distributes it on the internet A effective interest in Fusion Media Networks LLC Fusion a news pop culture and lifestyle television and digital network targeted millennials The other is owned by Univision Media Networks can be a huge standalone business with billion in annual revenues almost half the annual revenues from Time Warner and TwentyFirst Century Fox and with higher revenues than Viacom The PE ratios for competitors are forward PE of for Viacom Inc NASDAQ VIAB for Time Warner Inc NYSE TWX and for TwentyFirst Century Fox Using EPS of for Disneys Media Networks and capitalizing it x x and x we get values of and respectively But the most likely range is and here is why Back on April Capital CitiesABC closed trading at share That is larger than the top range above Accounting for inflation that is equivalent to share today This is important because back in Walt Disney acquired then Capital CitiesABC Inc for billion Which was the second largest takeover in US history at the time Assuming that billion did not increase in value and only taking into account inflation ABC Family would be worth billion today Looking at Capital CitiesABC today with respective to revenues it could have traded between Viacom and Time WarnerFox For example Time Warner trades at share and had sales of billion in FY Viacom trades at share and had billion in sales in FY And Disneys Media Networks had billion in sales in FY It is possible that it could have been trading higher than Viacom but less than Time Warner Implying a fair value somewhere between Meaning is too highTherefore to be conservative we will stick with the range However I think the aggregate value of Media Networks could be more Media Networks has five major hidden assets stake in Hulu stake in Fusion stake in ABC stake in AE Television Networks and stake in ESPN Overtime these assets could be worth a lot higher than share as standalone assets The postacquisition value for Capital CitiesABC should be more than billion or greater than share as shown above Meaning that my fair value estimates grossly undervalues Disneys Media Networks Second the calculation does not take into account postacquisition synergies These might include margin expansion as different segments collaborate and streamline Such an omission could cause a lower estimate given that companies with higher margins tend to trade higher Third increased competition can depress margins moving forward For example the growth in the number of networks distributed by MVPDs has resulted in increased competition for advertising revenues both in the broadcast and cable networks Fourth Media Network is also facing higher acquisition costs for sports and other live programming Take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter for example they have also started competing for live sports programming These new entrants will eventually cause acquisition costs to surge and they also put Media Networks current contracts at risk Disney currently has sports live rights agreements with the NFL college football and basketball MLB NBA the Wimbledon Championships US Open Tennis soccer and the Masters golf tournament Parks and Resorts was the second highest growing segment for Disney in FY The segment owns the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida the Disneyland Resort in California Aulani a Disney Resort Spa in Hawaii the Disney Vacation Club the Disney Cruise Line and Adventures by Disney Parks and Resorts has a growth catalyst in play for Disney recently opened the acre Shanghai Disney Resort A resort positioned to fuel topline growth for Disneys Parks and Resorts On another note the Parks and Resorts segment is bigger than public traded competitors such as Six Flags Entertainment Corporation NYSE SIX SeaWorld Entertainment Corporation NYSE SEAS and Cedar Fair LP NYSE FUN For example in FY Disneys Parks Resorts reported annual revenues of billion higher than billion from Six Flags higher than billion from SeaWorld and higher than billion from Cedar On a valuation basis Cedar has a forward PE of SeaWorld has a forward PE of and Six Flags has a forward PE of Going back to the Reference table above the estimated EPS for Parks and Resorts is Capitalizing that at x x and x you get values of and That means that Disneys Parks and Resorts could be worth between share to share By October Disney planners acquired acres of land in central Florida But in its annual report the company acknowledges only acres of land for its Disney World Resort in Florida The Table below shows a list of properties that Disney owns and leases The total number of land owned in the table below is acres acres in California acres in New York and in Connecticut Disney also owns acres in Anheim California bringing the total number of acres in California to roughly acres According to data taken from a report by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and reported by Wall Street the average value of land in Connecticut is per acre in New York it is per acre in California it is per acre and in Florida it is per acre Therefore Disneys properties in these areas will be worth acres in Florida is That is a total of million in land But my list is not conclusive because in its annual report Disney values its land at billion Disney has a real estate empire Disney land in Florida alone is more than the size of Manhattan or the size of San Francisco acres Disneys Parks and Resorts have sales in excess of billion than competitors because of the diverse nature of its revenue streams This diversity in revenues enables the segment to reduce sales volatility in any given year Another important point to note is that these Parks and Resorts are built to last for decades to come Their revenue generating ability is not capped Making them an excellent and reliable cash generating machine for years to come A business model competitors should mimic Disney management should sustain innovate and shareholders should cherish Furthermore this segments has a lot of other businesses For example the segment generates revenues from the sale of admissions to theme parks sales of food beverage and merchandise charges for room nights at hotels sales of cruise and other vacation packages and rentals of vacation club properties I think this is a robust stable business segment which happens to contribute to Disneys total revenues Given that the segment is x greater than competitors above the range from to seems fair Disneys Parks and Resorts faces a lot of risks The segments theme parks resorts Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club faces stiff competition from all forms of entertainment businesses lodging tourism and recreational activities These competitors can diminish margins by getting a share of the sales from Disney Another detrimental effect of these competitors for Disney is a high fixed cost amidst declining revenues For example Disney invests a tremendous amount of money into its theme parks and resorts To run them efficiently Disney incurs a lot of fixed costs such as utility costs Meaning that any topline sales decline could greatly depress margins due to high fixed costs In addition Disneys theme parks in other countries face a lot of political risks Governments in those countries can decide to increase corporate taxes force a higher wage for employees on the company or impose other stringent rules for Disney to operate in their countries Also the business is seasonal Peak attendance occurs during school vacations like over the summer and in earlywinter and springholiday periods This could be dangerous during economic downturns As people spend less on vacations during uncertain times This year we have the election headwind and the postBrexit effects that might reduce consumer spending power Studio Entertainment Consumer Products Interactive I combined the last three segments because any Studio has to have all three segments within it For example studios produce content Studio Entertainment and then engages with licenses publishers and retailers to develop promote and sell that content Consumer Products Because of their IP portfolios these studios then leverage their IPs across interactive media platforms such as games Interactive Let us talk about the Studio Entertainment first Disney acquired Pixar back in for billion Marvel Entertainment and its associated comic assets for billion in Lucasfilm for billion in Adjusting for inflation Pixar could be worth billion Marvel could be billion and Lucasfilm could be billion That would be a total of billion in acquisitions today DreamWorks cites three major competitors on its website Disney Pixar Studios Foxs Blue Sky Studios and the Weinstein Company DreamWorks forward PE is Other competitors such as Foxs Blue Sky Studios and Weinstein Company are private companies and Pixar Animation was acquired by Disney back in Looking back to the Reference table above the aggregate estimated EPS for the three segments is Capitalized at x we have a value of Before Disney acquired Pixar Pixar traded at x estimated earnings But x is a very high multiple Hence the reason why I did not use that multiple In addition DreamWorks PE only raised dramatically after Comcast announced its billion acquisition of Dreamworks for roughly share This caused DreamWorks stock price to surge from share to currently share This surge raised DreamWorks PE Meaning that we need to apply a discount to to get share For the medium price range I took the average of the two and to get share Disney faces a lot of litigation costs The company has to continuously exploit and protect against infringement on its IP portfolio Moreover Disney also faces cyber attack threats The company holds millions of peoples personal information Any compromise to this information may force the company to incur additional costs lose potential opportunities and damage its brand as clients start to doubt Disneys security Disneys Interactive media compete with other aggressive publishers of console online mobile games and other types of home entertainment Although this is a high growth area the race to stay ahead of competitors and to be price competitive can compress margins Lastly box office revenues are very volatile This sales volatility makes it harder to predict how profitable the studio can be done the line Disney needs to continue creating great content every year just to stay relevant But the success of that content is dependent on other factors such as movies playing time of the year and other entertainment events that can grab peoples attention Conclusion Sumoftheparts SOTP or BreakUp analysis The risks embedded in my analysis emanates from the fact that some assets were not accounted for and valuations were relatively low In addition a deeper dive into segments of segments can be done to extract a more precise estimate Moreover I used competitors and not necessary comparative companies This can cause a mismatch in estimates because of varying underlying economics of the companies being compared However the findings are intriguing The analysis reviews that a low estimate would suggest an upside to Disneys current stock price upside for the medium estimate and upside for the high estimate Activities such as spinoff splitoff tracking stock or an equity IPO carveout could unleash tremendous value in Disney These restructuring suggestions are unlikely to be nearterm outcomes but they are meant to give a picture of what each segment could be worth as a standalone company Most importantly they are meant to emphasize the idea that Disneys stock price is undervalued One major misunderstanding leading to low valuations is industry classification Research from Credit Suisse The Street and Ford Equity Research defines it as an Entertainment company Others assign it the Entertainment Diversified sector name Others say it is in the Media industry and others Broadcasting industry The problem becomes which multiple to assign its overall business Although Media Networks makes up of total revenues it is still less than half of Disneys total revenues Meaning that we cannot strictly define it as a Media company Parks and Resorts make up together with Media they make up of revenues But finding an industry madeup of Media and Parks Resorts similar to Disney is virtually impossible I believe that because analysts need to assign an industry to facilitate Comparable Company Analysis Precedent Transactions and DCF calculations Disneys stock price has gotten low multiples because of being assigned to low growth industries Lastly another important observation is that of Disneys market capitalization can be attributed to its IP portfolio and tangible assets In addition Disney values its attractions buildings and equipment subtracting accumulated depreciation at billion Meaning that of its market cap can be attributed to tangible physical assets This is not including the amount of money these assets can bring to the magic kingdom Furthermore Disneys acquisitions of ABC Pixar Marvel and Lucasfilm would be worth billion in todays money Currently Disneys market capitalization is billion Looking at Disneys acquired IP portfolio notice that their aggregate value today accounts for of Disneys total market capitalization Meaning that of Disneys market capitalization can be attributed to its IP portfolio and physical assets Another important point to remember is that Disney has thus far had great management These guys are visionaries staying ahead of trends and creating the future Back in when Disney acquired Pixar piracy was at its peak Other media empires were running away from spending billions on IPs because of piracy But Disney saw the potential ahead and it is still payingoff handsomely Furthermore management has had a longterm outlook which they consistently brought to life For example the newly opened Shanghai Disney Resort has been more than years in the making from negotiations to completion Over the years this will generate significant cash for Disney The last significant positive attribute about management is that they have been shareholder friendly They have grown dividends by an average of yy since In between Disney has issued billions of dollars in stock buybacks in an effort to increase shareholder returns And because of its superb performance Disneys stock price has surged by in the last years Considering that the stock is way below its highs down in the last months and worth a lot under an SOTP or Breakup analysis this is a great opportunity to buy a superior business at undemanding valuations Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it
