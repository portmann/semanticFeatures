quarters LinkedIns actual earnings exceeded where expectations stood on February hence rendering the February decline of over in LinkedIn shares unjustified In a recent article we published on prior to LinkedIns NYSE LNKD latest earnings announcement Microsofts rebirth could boost shares by more than we had stated that we believed that Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT purchase of LinkedIn was a bargain Now that LinkedIn has announced its earnings our assessment is confirmed LinkedIn announced its earnings after the market closed on shattering all expectations Net earnings for the quarter ending in June came in at share vs consensus estimates of share a beat by a whopping share Compared to same period one year ago where LinkedIn had net earnings of share LinkedIns latest net earnings results represent an increase of Meanwhile revenues came in at million an increase in excess of over same quarter last year and exceeding consensus estimates of million All of LinkedIns business lines recorded impressive results Talent Solutions revenues increased yearoveryear to million beating consensus estimates of million Marketing solutions revenues increased yearoveryear to million beating consensus estimates of million Finally Premium Subscriptions revenue increased yearoveryear to million beating consensus estimates of million LinkedIn stock price year chart Source Yahoo Finance As LinkedIn is being acquired by Microsoft for billion share LinkedIn shares had a muted reaction in the aftermarket hours following earnings release However if LinkedIn had not been acquired by Microsoft what effect would such earnings have had on LinkedIns stock price On February LinkedIn shares dropped by over in a single day from to a drop of almost erasing over billion in market capitalization Such drop materialized despite LinkedIn announcing net earnings of share for Q beating consensus estimates of share and revenues of million beating consensus estimates of However LinkedIn provided a future outlook below expectations as it announced it expected net earnings of share on revenues of million for Q vs consensus estimates of share on revenues of million At such time LinkedIn CFO Steve Sordello said Prior to Microsofts announcement of its acquisition of LinkedIn the social network companys shares were trading at on June The latest earnings announcement from LinkedIn beat consensus estimates by a much wider margin than the outlook disappointment provided for Q at the release of Q results such outlook disappointment guided net earnings share below expectations while the latest earnings exceeded expectations by share Furthermore earnings for Q actually turned out to be share closer to analysts initial estimate of share as opposed to LinkedIns guidance of share In other words the massive selloff of February was totally unjustified as LinkedIns statement that caused the selloff actually turned out to be not true If we actually combine LinkedIns actual net earnings results for Q along with its latest results for Q the combination of such results turned out to exceed by share where analysts expectations for such two quarters stood on February before LinkedIn had provided the erroneous outlook To add insult to injury LinkedIns earnings for Q which had also exceeded expectations by share were totally overlooked due to LinkedIns erroneous outlook Hence the three quarter combined Q Q and Q exceeded expectations by share Given that LinkedIns shares stood at on February prior to LinkedIns announcement of Q results we estimate that ceteris paribus had LinkedIn not provided such outlook and had Microsoft not announced its proposed buyout of LinkedIn LinkedIn shares would be today at least at We derived such value by taking the share earnings exceedance during the combined last three quarters annualizing them to share and multiplying by a modest PE ratio of while LinkedIn had been trading at a much higher PE ratio than on February Naturally there are a lot of nuances and an exact science does not exist to determine exactly what would have happened and where LinkedIn shares would be today following the latest earnings release for Q if the controversial outlook was not provided by LinkedIn in February and if Microsoft had not made an offer for LinkedIn However we believe it is a fair and modest methodology Interestingly most recently Victor Anthony from Axiom Capital Management stated on Bloomberg that he believes that LinkedIn shares would be up by as much as if LinkedIn was not being acquired by Microsoft Using LinkedIns preacquisition stock price of that could place LinkedIn shares at assuming LinkedIn shares had recorded no change between June preMicrosoft acquisition announcement and August preearnings announcement If we assume LinkedIn shares would have appreciated by NASDAQs appreciation between such two dates LinkedIn shares could be at according to Mr Anthony Our own derived number of from the previous paragraph is higher as we are also incorporating the scenario of excluding the controversial outlook provided by LinkedIn in February Using our own derived price for LinkedIn of and adding an acquisition premium of which we believe is a fair general acquisition premium as per NYU paper we arrive at a fair acquisition price of per share We also believe we are being conservative as Microsoft actually paid a premium of for LinkedIn vs its market price However Microsoft may have had an inside look at pending results for Q which we had incorporated into our price of and hence had LinkedIn been trading at they may have been less aggressive on the premium In other words we believe that Microsofts acquisition price of share is quite a bargain vs our estimated fair acquisition price of share representing a savings of over billion Given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB currently has a market capitalization of billion Our derived acquisition price of over billion for LinkedIn about th of Facebooks market capitalization seems quite modest This is especially true considering that LinkedIns million members are more than a quarter of Facebooks members of about billion while LinkedIns latest results point to accelerated growth while Facebooks CEO stated that he expects slower growth in the next two quarters Furthermore Facebooks Q net earnings of beat estimates of share by while LinkedIn beat estimates by We believe Microsoft got a bargain of at least billion on its LinkedIns acquisition Furthermore Microsoft stands to benefit from LinkedIns improved performance as we had already stated in our prior article referenced in the introduction As a result we continue to favor owning Microsoft shares as we believe that LinkedIn will provide a boost to Microsoft shares despite LinkedIns small market capitalization relative to Microsoft Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in MSFT over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship
