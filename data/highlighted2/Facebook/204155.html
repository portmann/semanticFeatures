Risks To Facebooks Dominance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>investors need to think about one number minutes If Facebooks future is in search Zuckerberg seems to have popped this speculation bubble One thing the last few days in the stock market has taught investors is even great companies can lose their value quickly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB along with many other tech stocks lost more than of its value in a very short time Many shareholders likely believe this is a temporary setback However there are some challenges that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shareholders need to be aware of Unless the company can give investors convincing answers to these questions the stocks shortterm decline could turn into a bigger problem Facebooks dominance is difficult to question In the companys last earnings report it reported daily active users were approaching billion To put this into perspective Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL reports that its core services like Gmail and YouTube have over a billion users Think about those numbers for a minute Each day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>gets almost as many users as are registered with Gmail and YouTube Everyone knows that Twitter NYSE TWTR is struggling to meet investors expectations Twitter grew monthly users by to just over million but this wasnt enough and the stock got crushed Think about this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has three times the users each day as Twitter gets in a month On the one hand investors might believe this dominant user base gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a competitive advantage More users means more data and more data means better advertising However there is a key number that shareholders need to think hard about Mark Zuckerberg CEO said that people are spending more than minutes per day on average between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger and Instagram This sounds like great news but the first problem facing Facebooks dominance is how much more can the services really be used The average user spends many hours a day between sleeping and working Those same users have to eat spend time with friends pay bills commute and more Given that Facebooks three main services are taking up just under an hour of each day can users realistically commit to much more Though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can continue growing its user base growing its time with users will be a difficult task The second risk to Facebooks dominance is the company must find a way to diversify itself Bullish investors might suggest Facebooks future is in search Three months ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>said it was handling about billion searches a day In the companys recent earnings call this number jumped to billion per day Googles search business seems to be holding up well but at the expense of cost per click In the companys recent results paid clicks increased by annually but cost per click fell by In a similar manner Twitters data capabilities are growing The companys ability to catalog and provide informative data to businesses can be seen in its data licensing results Twitters ability to sell its data stream helped the company to increase its licensing revenue by yearoveryear Now there is just one big problem According to Zuckerberg the majority of Facebooks billion daily searches are focused on people If search isnt the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>then what is Some investors might suggest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can become a payments platform The simple problem with that idea is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself doesnt seem to believe the thesis In the last quarter payments represented just over of revenue and declined by annually The company dismissed shortterm growth by saying it expects payments to decline further In addition the payments space is very crowded Whether its the newly independent PayPal Google Wallet or Apple Pay <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt even an afterthought in this industry Great businesses if you dont want to advertise Many investors would probably scoff at the idea that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has to do anything outside of social networking However this brings us to the third issue facing Facebooks dominance The company owns multiple services like Messenger Instagram and WhatsApp Unfortunately none of these businesses is particularly suited to selling advertising space Google gets the majority of its revenue from advertising and Twitter gets more than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>generated almost of its revenue from advertising last quarter The point is if the company cant sell more ads or more expensive ads growth will be challenging To be fair Instagram seems the easiest business to transition to an advertising base However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>said with million users it didnt seem like it was the right time to push advertising This is particularly ironic considering Instagram and Twitter have almost the same size user base When it comes to Messenger and WhatsApp the future for advertising looks much worse Both services have hundreds of millions of users However consumers dont expect advertising in their messaging app To make the point even more clear WhatsApps homepage actually says Why we dont sell ads If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has any inkling that it will use this app for advertising the core message of the brand will have to change The bottom line is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the dominant social media company Users are on the service for nearly an hour a day already However users dont seem to use the service for searches that can be served up at a cost to advertisers In addition users dont seem to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for payments Where Facebooks other properties are concerned they dont seem like hotbeds for increased advertising growth How does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>expand beyond being the dominant social network Unfortunately for investors there doesnt seem to be a good answer As Facebooks user growth continues to slow as it reaches larger scale shareholders need to start asking the hard questions
