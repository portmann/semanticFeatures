class='textDiv'>Court Says <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Cant Challenge Search Warrants For User Data Consumerist Whoops It looks like portions of our site are being blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator If a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>receives a subpoena for user data in a civil lawsuit it can make its case to the court about why it should not have to oblige But when that information request is in the form of a search warrant in a criminal investigation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt have that option Thats according to a New York appeals court which ruled earlier this week that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>lacks legal standing to challenge a batch of search warrants seeking data on users related to a criminal disability fraud investigation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>went public with its fight against these warrants last year saying the company had only agreed to comply with the warrants after facing contempt charges The Manhattan District Attorneys office was seeking detailed user data including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>posts and photos for more than users including some retired police officers and firefighters suspected of having feigned mental illnesses in the wake of September Because warrants have to go through the process of having a judge determine whether there is probable cause their validity can not usually be challenged before the warrant is executed After a lower court found that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>lacked standing to fight the warrants it appealed claiming that because the warrants were served on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and not directly on the users they were no different than subpoenas and therefore eligible to be disputed in court before being executed But the appeals court labeled this a distinction without a difference explaining that while the manner in which the materials are gathered may deviate from the traditional Facebooks reason for seeking to quash the warrants does not What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ultimately seeks is suppression of the materials obtained from it a determination that would necessarily impact the subsequent criminal actions The court points out that if it were to accept Facebooks argument law enforcement would only be able to serve search warrants on physical locations The inclusion of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in the warrant process is necessary because the police have no other way of obtaining the evidence they seek to obtain for their investigation It is hard to imagine how a law enforcement officer could play a useful role in the Internet service providers retrieval of the specified online information writes the court <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also contended that the Stored Communications Act gives the company the right to challenge these warrants However the appeals court held that the SCA only gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the standing to fight subpoenas and court orders and that the law specifically distinguishes these disclosure devices from warrants The court notes that an order or subpoena obtained pursuant to the SCA requires only that the government show specific and articulable facts that there are reasonable grounds to believe the information sought will be relevant and material but a warrant requires the government to demonstrate probable cause Here a finding of probable cause was made by the reviewing judge and thus the warrants are akin to SCA warrants not SCA subpoenas or orders explains the court Thus Facebooks argument that it has the right to contest the warrants based upon the SCA is contradicted by the express terms of the SCA The court acknowledged the spirit of Facebooks attempt to challenge these warrants Our holding today does not mean that we do not appreciate Facebooks concerns about the scope of the bulk warrants issued here or about the District Attorneys alleged right to indefinitely retain the seized accounts of the uncharged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users reads the ruling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users share more intimate personal information through their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>accounts than may be revealed through rummaging about ones home These bulk warrants demanded all communications in broad categories from the targeted accounts Yet of the targeted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>user accounts only were actually charged with any crime In a statement to Ars Technica <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>said it continues to believe that overly broad search warrants granting the government the ability to keep hundreds of peoples account information indefinitely are unconstitutional and raise important concerns about the privacy of peoples online information <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Govt Requests For User Data Up In First Half Of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Testing
