the Messenger platform looks a lot like Siri in textform and we see benefits in textifying Siri within the Messenger forum In the longterm we think the shift to mobile conversational commerce is inevitable and see Messenger services as the most natural platform to universally connect merchants to consumers In the future we believe we will see most if not all of Facebooks million active businesses create and actively use chatbots within the Messenger platform At its F conference <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB launched a developer platform for creating automated chatbots that can conduct transactions and provide information within Messenger We have written on this before and believe the creation of these chatbots is the first step in turning Messenger into a consolidated communication forum connecting merchants and consumers We think this is a marketchanging catalyst that should give investors yet another reason to be bullish on the stock Users can access these chatbots by typing in a business name in the search bar of the Messenger application or through searching for a business on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and hitting the message icon on the businesss <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page This will bring the user to a Messenger chat with the business After the user sends the first message the chatbot will reply almost immediately The user and chatbot then enter a dialogue As they stand the chatbots are actually quite complex The bots can send text structured messages images links and calltoaction buttons Users however cannot yet make transactions directly through Messenger The Messenger platform currently does not allow payments directly through a credit card added to Messenger so users are required to redirect to the web to pay for an item To make sure users retain control each chatbot has a block button so the user can silence the chatbot by simply selecting that button <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has also made it relatively easy for merchants to have their own chatbot Merchants can either build their own bots or work with Facebooks Bot Engine Bot Engine built on Facebooks acquisition of natural language interface startup Witai makes creating a chatbot relatively easy for all merchants regardless of size or technical savvy All merchants are required to do is give the Bot Engine sample conversations and the Bot Engine will learn to handle similar conversations with users on its own There are currently three featured chatbots on Facebooks website Those include Spring Poncho and CNN We have used all three and will explain each chatbot briefly here We do recommend however all our readers try these chatbots for themselves to get a better understanding of the secular transition at work here Spring acts as a personal shopping assistant on Messenger At first the Spring chatbot prompts the user if they are interested in mens or womens clothing The user then enters a dialogue with the Spring chatbot wherein the chatbot will recommend certain articles of clothing to the user based on what the user asks for For example the photo below details an individual who is interested in shoes priced in the to range The individual messages this interest to Spring and the Spring chatbot replies with recommendations of shoes in the to price band Poncho meanwhile provides users with weather updates via Messenger Users can prompt Poncho with questions regarding the current and forecast weather in certain places and Poncho will reply with a text or image answering the users prompt Users can also set automatic weather update times when Poncho will message the user relevant weather updates at a certain time every day The most wellknown of the featured Messenger chatbots is the CNN chatbot The CNN chatbot is designed to deliver the latest headlines and curated news coverage to the user The chatbot is set up to deliver top headlines to the user on a daily basis as well as to provide suggested stories based on the users input and activity What It All Means For The Future Of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>From the three featured chatbots alone a user can message a friend order a pair of shoes check the fiveday weather forecast and catch the latest headlines all through the Messenger application This is on top of users already being able to order an Uber from the Messenger app We believe this is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is attempting here which is essentially creating a consolidated communication forum connecting all merchants businesses with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>pages to all consumers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users In its initial stages Messenger platform looks a lot like Siri in textform to us While this observation might appear as a knock on Facebooks originality we actually think textifying Siri is a powerful first step According to one survey of iPhone users dont use Siri This seems in accordance with what we observe on a daily basis We hypothesize that Siri usage is so infrequent because people have found it inconvenient and often intrusive to talk to a phone nearly impossible to do so in public without interrupting others In the same way that texting has replaced much of phonetophone calling we believe text chatbots within the Messenger platform will be more widely adopted than a voiceoriented Siri Moreover we believe consolidation here and in this form makes sense To avoid repeating ourselves we will point readers to our previous article to understand more indepth why we feel this way Below we have briefly listed our main points from that article for sources on our points please refer to our linked article where we source all facts The app enigma people love smartphone apps but dont download that many An average phone user spends of his or her time in just five apps and those five apps are dominated by social media and messaging apps Brands are struggling to engage consumers within their own apps so they are attempting to engage consumers in places where consumers spend a lot of time like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Fewer apps that do more individually are ideal for the user because it reduces cluttering The user is required to learn fewer interfaces has less visual and information cluttering and is able to perform multiple tasks without the inconvenience of switching applications This reduction of cluttering is especially important in the commerce space where the clutter reduction extends to saving payment and shipment info only once in one location as opposed to reentering that info multiple times in multiple locations Consolidation is the best way to universally answer the question of what is the best way to order from or get in contact with this merchant It will more seamlessly connect merchants and consumers People spend a significant amount of time texting and instant messaging so smartphone users are already accustomed to a conversation thread Thus it makes logical sense to consolidate commerce in a conversational forum A conversation thread also keeps track of prior interactions and does so in a forum consumers are naturally accustomed to Consolidation on Messenger will make it even easier for people to shop on their phones something that is becoming increasingly popular Messenger has million users reaching just under of the worlds population In the longterm we think the shift to mobile conversational commerce is inevitable Pretty soon Americans will be doing their Holiday shopping by sending messages through their phone We think Messenger is currently the most natural platform for this consolidation due to its size and alreadyestablished chatbots In the future we believe we will see most if not all of Facebooks million active businesses create and actively use chatbots within the Messenger platform This should provide a noticeable boost to user growth as shopping through Messenger becomes more of the norm Sponsored messages messages wherein the merchant pays <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to send messages to users offer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>another monetization route and this should markedly boost ARPU Overall we believe chatbots significantly extend Facebooks runway for user base and ARPU growth We are long FB and remain bullish on the secular trends supporting the companys longterm consolidation plans I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology
