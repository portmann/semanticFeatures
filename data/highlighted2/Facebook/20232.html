advertising ARPU to surge from in to over by We expect international ARPU growth to outpace overall ARPU growth over the longrun as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still underpenetrated in international markets In our latest model for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB we estimate advertising on the core <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform to account for the bulk more than of our valuation We expect advertising revenues on the core platform to rise from billion in to over billion in the terminal year of our model While this will be driven by increases in both users and average revenue per user ARPU on the platform the latter will be responsible for more than of this increase in the topline in our view We estimate Facebooks overall advertising ARPU to surge from in to over by driven by the rollout of better and more targeted ads high demand for social media and mobile ads an increase in user base and monetization on Messenger and Search These factors together will further propel both ad inventory as well as ad pricing on the social networking platform Moreover we expect international ARPU growth to outpace overall ARPU growth over the longrun as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still underpenetrated in international markets In the event Facebooks overall advertising ARPU rises much higher to by the end of our forecast horizon then it will drive a more than increase in our price estimate Rollout Of Better And More Targeted Ads Will Propel Ad Pricing We think the introduction of better and more targeted ads will continue to drive higher monetization on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Video ads are expected to gain prominence on the social networking platform in the coming future since autoplay video ads were rolled out internationally during the fourth quarter of The number of video views per day on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>surged to over three billion as compared to one billion as recent as September With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continuing to push videos on the platform the recent F conference saw the introduction of embedded videos letting users embed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>videos onto webpages and spherical videos that provide degree videos we believe video views will rise sharply over the coming years Together with better ads we also expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to improve ad targeting and measurement tools with investments in Atlas and other tools High Demand For Social Media And Mobile Advertising Will Boost Ad Pricing The Internet advertising market is increasingly gaining traction owing to increasing ubiquity of smartphones and PCs coupled with an improvement in ad measurement techniques Sized at over billion for the nine months ended September the digital advertising market in the US is forecast to rise at a CAGR of between the years and to reach billion according to Forrester Research Much of this growth is expected to be fueled by rapid rise in mobile and social media ad spending Though the mobile platform presently accounts for a small share of the advertising market its share is estimated to rise to in the overall US ad market by according to Forrester Moreover social media ad spending is expected to outpace the overall Internet ad market and grow at around CAGR during We think social media and mobile ad spending could accelerate in the international markets as well following the trends in the US market We believe these demand trends will support higher ad pricing on Facebooks platform On account of the above given factors we estimate average ad pricing to rise at a CAGR of around over our forecast period Increase In Ad Inventory Though the number of ads delivered on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>rose by and in and respectively it decreased by in because of increased proportion of fewer but more prominent news feed ads and shift towards higher mobile usage where lesser ads are shown While we expect the number of ads delivered to decrease in we forecast it to rise at CAGR during The key factors driving our estimate include We estimate the overall monthly active user base to rise at around CAGR during We think this could be the base level of growth for ad engagements on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as more users will directly result in increase in ad inventory In addition we believe the number of ad engagements could surpass user growth as monetization on other platforms including Messenger and Search will provide additional ad inventory on the platform Recently during the F conference <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced various new features on Messenger including businessoriented features and integration with thirdparty apps We believe these developments could also translate into advertisements within the Messenger platform leading to higher ad inventory Moreover we think engagement levels for international users will rise over our forecast period with faster net connectivity across developing markets and increased adoption of smartphones All these factors will lead to increased ad engagements on Facebooks platform In the event the total number of ads delivered rises by annually as compared to our current estimate of over our review period then our price estimate grows higher to ARPU Growth Could Pick Up In International Markets Over The LongRun Though ARPU was seen at in the US and Canada during Q it was recorded at much lower levels of and in Europe AsiaPacific and Rest of World respectively We think this spread in ARPU levels across different markets could decrease somewhat over the longrun as we expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to ramp up advertising in international markets once its advertising business in the US starts moving towards maturity Hence we expect growth rates in international APRU levels to surpass those in US and Canada
