Popular names are dropping more than average The current situation is not the end of the world so stay focused on the longterm The sharp selloff last week had momentum stocks dropping more than average as compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the SP indexes The reality is that the market was due for a correction after such a strong consistent runup from through The Dow average has now officially corrected by from the high of The SP is now down from its high of The momentum names such as Apple NASDAQ AAPL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Netflix NASDAQ NFLX Amazon NASDAQ AMZN The Walt Disney Company NYSE DIS and Tesla NASDAQ TSLA have fallen more than the market indexes The good news for momentum investors is that these names typically increase at a greater rate than the averages once the market rises again So although momentum stocks have more volatility than the market the companies that are growing at an above average pace will outperform the averages over the longterm So it is best not to panic during sharp selloffs and keep your eyes on where the stocks are likely to be a few years down the road The selloff can be used to buy stocks that are on your watch list for a longterm investment I think when you look back at this selloff a few years from now it will most likely prove to be a good time to buy Things looked bleak back in during the European debt crisis but we can look back at that now and see what a great buying opportunity that selloff created It was Barron Rothschild who was credited with saying The time to buy is when there is blood in the streets Rothschild made a lot of money by buying in the panic that followed the Battle of Waterloo So now that the market is in the red it is time to start looking at your buy list While fears are focused on a slowdown in China Apples stock has been punished However the people in China tend to have a strong love for American products and Apple products are among them Fellow author Mark Hibben recently pointed out that Apple is likely to continue to grow at a strong doubledigit pace in China I think that this is likely due to the love for the Apple brand among aspirational people in China I also think that the fear over Chinas slowdown is overdone Even if Chinas GDP slows to below in future quarters it is not likely to cause the wealthier citizens to stop buying Apples iPhones I also dont think that the yuan devaluation will make the iPhones too expensive for these aspirational citizens What typically holds true for momentum names with strong fundamentals is that the stocks are a buy after sharp selloffs Although Im not a fan of the valuations for Amazon Netflix and Tesla those stocks will probably bounce back significantly after the markets bleeding has stopped These three stocks have defied normal valuation levels and will probably continue to do so Disney has been selling off sharply this month In addition to the overall market selloff Disney investors have been worried about the companys media segment One concern is that some cable customers are cancelling their service which would reduce revenue sources for Disneys channels such as ESPN and the channel bearing the company name However I think that this worry is overblown The media segment increased for Q and for the first fiscal quarters Although there are concerns within the segment I dont think that cord cutting will have a significant negative impact on the company The new Star Wars movie The Force Awakens is a likely catalyst for Disney for the next fiscal year The movie debuts on December and is expected to bring in billion in revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>still has strong doubledigit revenue and earnings growth which is likely to continue going forward The company consistently rakes in plenty of operating and free cash flow So I expect the stock to perform well after the current correction ends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is constantly coming up with creative ways to implement ads which is likely to translate into future revenue growth To conclude the current correction in momentum stocks and the market in general is creating a great buying opportunity It is good to keep some cash on hand to take advantage of these selloffs We only use your contact details to reply
