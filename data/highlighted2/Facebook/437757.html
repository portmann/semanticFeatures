class='textDiv'>Intel ARM Servers To Renew Their Attack Intel Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha Intels data center business is about to come under attack by a new generation of ARM based servers This new generation will be fabricated on nm processes and be competitive in performance energy efficiency and cost I expect ARM eventually to win in the data center based on cost just as it did in mobile devices Up until now server chips based on ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH architecture have had little impact on the data center market and Intels NASDAQ INTC Data Center Group has continued to grow ARM server vendors are preparing the next wave of server chips based on nm FinFET technology These will be much more competitive and energy efficient and could start to erode Intels share of the data center by I have not been very optimistic about the business prospects of ARM servers in the past and I was initially very skeptical about Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM decision to enter the server arena The main ARM server companies Cavium NASDAQ CAVM and Applied Micro Circuits NASDAQ AMCC both lost money last year Furthermore by the time that AMDs NASDAQ AMD Seattle server chip appeared it was almost pointless Yohan De Gelas a Senior Lecturer at HOWEST University in Belgium wrote a recent review of the Cavium ThunderX server processor in Anandtech Equipped with ARM bit cores the ThunderX proved competitive in performance to comparably priced Intel server offerings such as the Xeon E v Maturity of the Linux based software stack has held back ARM servers and De Gelas still found problems with the current stack on the ThunderX He was able to get everything working but it took a lot more effort than for Intel servers He noted that Linux on ARM has come a long way but its still a work in progress The main disadvantage of the ThunderX proved to be energy efficiency ThunderX is fabricated on a nm process so its two generations behind the Broadwell based E which is fabricated on Intels most advanced nm process Power consumption especially at idle was much higher for ThunderX by almost a factor of compared to the E Undeterred by the lack of market success Cavium and Applied Micro are about to unleash their next generation of server processors These will benefit from the nm FinFET processes now available from foundries such as Samsung OTCSSNLF Global Foundries and TSMC NYSE TSM Last November Applied Micro announced the XGene which will be fabricated on TSMCs nm FinFET process The XGene is expected to be available by the end of the year At Computex Cavium announced on May the ThunderX which will be fabricated on a nm FinFET process probably by Global Foundries using the process licensed from Samsung No time frame was given for availability but its probably first half of Qualcomm has not made any announcement of commercial availability of its server chips but its likely that Qualcomm will move to Samsungs nm process before going to market with them Qualcomm is relying on Samsung for fabrication of its industry leading Snapdragon smartphone system on chip SOC All of the ARM server chips will be fairly massive SOCs with substantial IO capability integrated into the chip Memory interfaces PCIe Gen and multigigabit ethernet will be common In addition to the basics Cavium is promising hardware accelerators for virtualization security storage and networking in the SOC Even though Intel claims with some justification that it still has the lead in process technology the output from the various foundries on the nm node indicates that the next generation will basically eliminate the x efficiency gap of the ThunderX Its clear that the hyperscale data center customers such as Alphabets Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB are very open to alternative architectures and welcome competition with Intel Google is reported to have responded very positively to Qualcomms prototype server The hyperscale users build their own server hardware and Google has even gone so far as to design its own ASIC the Tensor Processing Unit for Alpha Go This openness also extends to other nonIntel architectures such as Nvidias NASDAQ NVDA Pascal GP accelerator Software maturity will be an ongoing concern even after the new generation arrives and this will probably blunt their initial impact I also expect Intel to fight aggressively to maintain market share so the first impact will probably be felt on the operating profit of the Data Center Group This impact should begin to manifest in Ultimately the battle for the data center will be won on the basis of total cost of ownership TCO and this is a somewhat more difficult problem to unravel than it was in the case of Intels mobile processors Based on architectural differences between ARM and x as well as Intels experience with its mobile device losses I have argued that ARM architecture has a fundamental cost advantage compared to x By the beginning of the year I argued that Intel had been forced to capitulate in mobile devices based on ARMs advantage By the end of the first quarter Intel had confirmed this by discontinuing its Atom mobile processors for phones and tablets Will ARMs cost advantage carry over into server chips It probably does in terms of chip costs but TCO may be more driven by software configuration and management costs which currently favor Intel But eventually this advantage will go away as the software stack matures The continuing declines in PC unit shipments presage the ultimate fate of x PCs continue to decline because they arent cost competitive with ARM based mobile devices These devices continue to become more powerful and take over a larger share of the users attention and time The ARM based smartphone is now becoming capable of fulfilling most of the roles of the traditional PC and can even be connected to a desktop monitor and keyboard They are also less expensive than the new x tablets as well as being more energy efficient Intels answer to the ARM server threat appears to be to try to get into peripheral data center areas such as storage and networking Intel wants to be a onestop shop for all the data centers needs I doubt this will work for the hyperscale customers who seem to want to mix and match components as they see fit That leaves software maturity as the last remaining barrier to ARM server adoption and this can be expected to fall by the wayside in the next year Although the battle for the datacenter is likely to be long and bloody I consider Intels prospects for victory to be poor I rate Intel a sell Disclosure I amwe are long QCOM NVDA I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than
