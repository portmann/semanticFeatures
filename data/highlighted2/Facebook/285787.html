Inc AAPL By SA Eli Hoffmann SA News Editor A little perspective please Apple only offers a paid option and at M is halfway to Spotifys number This doesnt take into account the millions of users still on Apples free trial at last count over M But really it doesnt matter if Apple surpass Spotify Music is the only thing Spotify does and they lose an incredible amount of money doing it Apple has several sources of revenue each of which is incredibility profitable I suspect that given Apple offers a pay only option that Apple is more profitable in this area as well Who do investors think is in a better position here This talk about who leads in market share gets so tiresome Android has of the smartphone market Well Google gives it away for free and since it is better and more useful than any individual vendor can develop its prolific Never mind that Apple takes of the industry profit and that the few Google branded phones and tablets sell in minuscule volumes ie Nexus Never mind that the top Android vendors are struggling to earn a profit and maintain share Never mind that Google has no presence in China that the ver of Android used their is forked and in no way benefits Google My cousins friend has Apple Music in his Honda Civic He says he could crush Garys beemer in a race Granted its a small of their total but given that it only been around a year or two thats not bad at all While Apple Music may represent only a small of their total right now the bigger story here is how Apple was able to leverage the strength of its ecosystem to so quickly build out a new subscriber service Subscription services are the future and a strong ecosystem of potential subscribers including the ones with the most money is the most valuable asset to build them out Apple Music demonstrates proof of concept in this regard and shows that the value of each Apple user is demonstrably higher than the market gives the company credit for Cnc agree market prices AAPl as a one trick pony placing no value on its Eco system which gives them a wide moat advantage over competitors Spotify may have to raise price to pay for pending lawsuit That could help AAPL M could move the stock price if thats indeed true Thats outstanding and bodes well for how it will compete in the space they cant bring it back to the US without paying taxes Now if they bought an irish company then they can bring all of it into the US tax free I am on trial and like the service but iTunes needs some work Like Maps and past releases that were not perfect I am sure they are hard at work As the late Sam Ervin Senator from Texas once said regarding the U S Budget deliberations A billion here a billion there pretty soon youre talking about real money And Wall St continues to downgrade AAPL They make billion almost every quarter and according to Wall St analysts theyre concerned What exactly is the problem And Im well aware they say AAPL cant keep up with the IPhone numbers they have put up in the past I suppose if AAPL comes out with a quarterly profit below billion they downgrade it some more PE is about or lower What more do they want Apple right now is perceived as an iPhone company due to the enormous revenue and margins accounting for well over of net profits The stock is taking a huge hit due to perceived iPhone sales declines for the ensuing quarters They need to employ some of the B which right now is doing shareholders absolutely nothing as evidenced by the PE being is so incredibly lowand yes they can borrow on the B especially while rates are relatively low The naysayers are not rational That is why there is so much pushback from the fanboys Apple is deploying some of the B It is returning B to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks It is adding categories and features to existing products It is adding jobs and new buildings and stores worldwide What more does a reasonable person expect Sounds like just as good a reason as any other for it to fall another Still in the any news is bad news cycle Gap down on this at the open They want disruptive innovation They want an AAPL vision for the future where AAPL is leading the way They want something they can see and feel at least in their imaginations They want to be inspired PE just isnt enough anymore it hasnt been for some time This cant be true Apple is a one trick pony on the verge of collapse The only thing Apple has going for it is the iPhone and even that is going down the tubes Wilco you beat me to the punch But Im sure the negativity will be out in full force shortly Something along the lines of why would anyone use Apple Music The repatration of cant be so simple as buying an Irish Company Can it As I said forget the analysts These individual products a billion here three or four billion there are not stand alone needle movers but together with everything else Apple has going forget about the analyst just keep counting your money I would be surprised if spotifys M number didnt go down since they last reported it its been quoted as fact for a long time now I switched from spotify to apple music the day it came out And i love it Im not the only one Spotify is toast Not trying to prove anything Just saying what I think Pretty sure thats what a forum like this is for Thanks for the sarcastic comment Hope it was worth your valuable time The idea that it has only one pony is not only limited since as long as the pony produces sales of million unite a quarter is not bad Also many other companies are more vulnerable to their own one pony Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>etc depend more than on advertising I think youve completely forgotten that one of the biggest continents on earth remains largely undeveloped Africa will lead the next commodities and economic boom thanks to once again China China has no problems making deals China with any type of government Unlike Western Powers who are still suffering from a guilty trip of the colonization era and therefore stay away There now more than a million Chinese living in Africa driving growth and economic trade and development Industry leader Spotify said in June it has M paying subs Most people will focus on the result its good its badblah blah The result ultimately takes care of itself What makes Apple special is that they really dont focus on the result they focus on how people feel When products and services make us feel something positive then we use buy them more often Im at Chilis hear a cool track pick up my iPhone ask Siri what song is playing she tells me links me to Apple music and I add it to my new music playlist from which I can relive that moment each time the song playsall for mo and the all important iPhone Heck id pay for just that one experiencewhybe it made me feel really happy Its this philosophy that keeps and will keep Apple at the top of the list of best companies ever Stop counting stop seeking Alphastart listening for laughter and looking for smiles Theres a lot of positive news for Apple but the stock price is only affected by the negative views of the iPhone I suspect that the stock price will have a lot of upside in the next two weeks though as investors anticipate hearing the dec quarterly results by Jan ETF Screener Search and filter by asset class strategy theme performance yield and much
