are being blocked Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator if at first you dont succeed facebook privacy lawsuits ILLINOIS Earlier this month a federal court gave the goahead to a lawsuit alleging that Facebooks photoscanning facialrecognition feature violated Illinois state law Having lost that legal battle it looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may be trying to get out of the lawsuit by simply changing that Illinois law The law in question is the Biometric Information Privacy Act which sets restrictions on the collection and storage of biometric data At issue is whether Facebooks Tag Suggestions feature which scans users photos and then tries to match that data to previously tagged users should be considered as biometric data under this law The BIPA does currently state that photographs do not count as biometric identifiers but does that mean a physical photograph or any image of a human Is there a difference between a photo that is archived without any sort of analysis or data gleaned from it versus a photo that is scanned analyzed and compared to millions of other similarly uploaded images The BIPA does not say and that is a dispute that would likely make for lively debate at hearings or in a trial However yesterday some members of the Illinois General Assembly introduced a rider piggybacked on a bill about unclaimed property that amends the BIPA in such a way as to effectively win Facebooks case before it gets to court First the amendment revises the term photographs to make it clear that it means both physical and digital photographs are exempted from the definition of biometric identifiers The rider then goes on to clarify that you cant create a biometric identifier from these photographs meaning all data collected from scans of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>photos is exempted from the law Perhaps most importantly the rider adds an entirely new definition to the law If passed a Scan would only refer to data resulting from an inperson process whereby a part of the body is traversed by a detector or an electronic beam Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would not be scanning users photos under the law because it would be taking information from a digital version of a photo The Illinois legislative session is drawing to a close in the coming days so this rider will likely come up for consideration soon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has not yet replied to Consumerists request for comment on this story but we will update if we hear anything back The company did provide a semistatement to the Wall Street Journals Law Blog <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>points out that a cosponsor of this amendment Sen Terry Link was also behind the original BIPA We appreciate Sen Links effort to clarify the scope of the law he authored explains the company which did not address the question of its role if any in the lastminute introduction of the rider The social media site had previously tried to get the Illinois case dismissed by arguing that all the plaintiffs had by okaying the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>terms of use agreed that California law governs any disputes with the company California does not have a law similar to BIPA While the court found that the plaintiffs had indeed agreed to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>terms of use it ultimately determined that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could not use this clause to negate the Illinois state law There can be no reasonable doubt that the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act embodies a fundamental policy of the state of Illinois explained the court noting if California law is applied the Illinois policy of protecting its citizens privacy interests in their biometric data especially in the context of dealing with major national corporations like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would be written out of existence Court <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook
