class='textDiv'>Yahoos Outlook Was Solid Anticipate Upside From Mobile Search Yahoo Inc NASDAQYHOO Seeking Alpha While earnings figures missed expectations I see reasonable upside in its MAVENs business Pricing trends are starting to stabilize and audience statistics are starting to trend higher particularly in mobile search The mobile business will drive a respectable growth rate in both earnings and sales over the foreseeable fiveyear period The core business is extremely undervalued and some of its core investments ie Alibaba and Yahoo Japan put a firm floor beneath the stock price Yahoos NASDAQ YHOO EPS and top line missed consensus analyst expectations While the company doesnt always have a great track record when it comes to earnings announcements the business is starting to show positive signs of life particularly in the MAVENs mobile video native advertising and social segment Also the stock is extremely undervalued on a sumoftheparts basis The core business is cheap and has reasonable growth prospects therefore I continue to reiterate my positive stance on the company When looking at the firstquarter highlights Id have to say the most pertinent information comes from the MAVENs segment which combines the revenue from mobile video native and social ads These ads are extremely important as mobile is a growing platform that has size constraints its really hard to advertise on to inch screens On the other hand mobile has high levels of engagement as indicated by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Twitters NYSE TWTR gangbuster growth Yahoo needed a mobile strategy for quite a while as various market forecasts indicate that more and more ad revenue will be driven by native mobile ads over all other formats Assuming this side of the business continues to scale and grow at quite a considerable rate the company should be able to stabilize its growth trajectory to a respectable midteen growth rate The company has reoutfitted a variety of its services with new features which puts it down the glide path of becoming a tech company rather than a media property This approach is very different from what prior CEOs have had Admittedly not everything about Marissa Mayers approach is attractive as various fund managers and analysts have complained about her micromanagement and lack of communication Also high turnover at the upper levels of management have put a strain on longterm strategic planning as many of the prior executives werent given enough time to put into effect a turnaround at the company This is why Yahoo looked clueless when all the major social and search platforms migrated to mobile However the company isnt a sinking boat yet and promising data in its core business gives me reasonable suspicion that the stock will likely outperform post spinoff of the Alibaba NYSE BABA holding company This is because the PC adbusiness has shown signs of stabilization following the recent Mozilla Firefox deal In Q Yahoo Mobile Search had share of search traffic according to eMarketer Whats surprising is that Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL foothold in desktop search isnt transitioning to mobile search as effectively which indicates that Yahoo may gain back some of its lost momentum as a search provider if it focuses more of its energy on developing the mobile side of its business Furthermore impression trends are starting to improve which has offset the decline in pricing for the first time Global search increased paid clicks by and increased pricing by The display business on the other hand has increased ads sold by offsetting a reduction in CPMs Yahoo reported Q nonGAAP EPS of which missed consensus analyst estimates by The company reported revenue of billion yearoveryear revenue missed by million The shares are starting to move higher in the afterhours as outlook and improvements in the core business offset the disappointing results Also commentary on its Japanese stake and its exploration of options with regards to some of its other core assets has intrigued investors in the afterhours The Q GAAP revenue outlook of billion indicates that there will be some yearoveryear growth This is driven by the MAVENs revenue ramp paired with stabilization in desktop ads So its a little easier to make a prediction on sales going forward Im starting to warm up to the idea of owning Yahoo following the spinoff of core assets An apt comparison of Yahoo to Google is perhaps the showdown of Chris Weidman prior to him knocking out Anderson Silva at UFC Many thought Weidman was the underdog as Silva developed a track record of being the best pound for pound fighter in the world In other words investing into Yahoo is driven by whether Yahoo can sustain search query share in mobile search Assuming Yahoo can supplant some of Googles dominance in search especially on the mobile side mobile ad growth is the next logical outcome Therefore I reiterate my positive stance on the stock I dont really have a price target in mind but may offer one in a future article Source Yahoos Outlook Was Solid Anticipate Upside From Mobile Search Disclosure The author
