and years of watch time per day It is worth million if you compare its watch time to YouTubes watch time I have been writing about and using Twitters NYSE TWTR Periscope ever since it was available on the App Store on March th Live streaming will be the biggest trend in social media and internet content creation in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has been overly focused on spherical video while not seeing the trend in live content Its not surprising that the company has had an awkward response to this trend seeing its failed response to Snapchat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may tell you it has been working on live streaming for a while but I dont believe them I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trying to counter the success of Periscope and Meerkat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>started out only allowing this feature to be used by celebrities but it has now expanded it to all verified accounts This was the reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>recently verified so many users something I discussed in my last article I think this move will limit Facebooks livestreaming growth I have seen some bloggers predict <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may expand livestreaming to its Messenger app I dont see how this could work because this would only allow your friends to see your stream This would be where Snapchat has a core competency Snapchat livestreaming would be far better than livestreaming on Messenger if you only wanted your friends to see the video Of course this assumes Snapchat gets involved in the space which I think is a reasonable prediction Periscope has a similar capability by allowing the user to limit the comment ability to only the accounts the user is following You can also film a private broadcast which can only be seen by the accounts you select This probably isnt the best use of Periscope because its main benefits are connecting with people who you ordinarily wouldnt bump into This type of content overlaps with a closed conference call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a large platform The best explanation of this situation is the quote with great power comes great responsibility <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt have a place for live content because it doesnt want to overwhelm the newsfeed with poor content It also doesnt have a platform where people who dont know each other can connect Instagram is the closest thing to this type of platform but generally most users following list consists of their friends Livestreaming deserves its own separate app on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to allow users to connect if it wants to grow exponentially This is the same situation with regular video content <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>videos uploaded natively will always do well because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has such a large audience but it can never compete with Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube because it is its own separate platform with better features and a proper partnership program <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>livestreams will always get large audiences because it has over one billion users but it will never be able to compete with the features on Periscope The other player in the space is YouTube Samsungs OTCSSNLF new Galaxy Note and Galaxy S Edge has the ability to directly livestream to YouTube This is a powerful message that YouTube believes in the livestreaming trend In the nearterm this will have a negligible effect on YouTube because it only works on these phones but it will eventually be available on all phones YouTube needs to improve the quality and latency on its livestreams to properly compete in the space YouTubes lack of a hour deleting function on its livestreams makes the videos take up valuable real estate on a popular YouTubers channel YouTube may want to further section off the livestreamed content to make it easier on the viewer and the content creator YouTube also has recently added a notification button to let subscribers know when a new video is released This would be perfect for the expansion of livestreaming Snapchat YouTube <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and even Meerkat will all benefit from the livestreaming trend but the biggest winner will be Periscope We were given the first update on the metrics of the app after its first few months in a scope by the CEO of Periscope Kayvon Beykpour The number of users on the service is million and there are million daily active users The time watched per day is years By dividing the amount of time spent on the service by the number of daily active users you get the amount of time spent per user It is minutes This compares to the minutes per day users spend on YouTube Considering the vast difference in both quantity and quality of content this is great accomplishment for the app I also did the math to figure out a rough estimate of what Periscope is worth as of August nd the last day in the data set by using the amount of watch time on YouTube as a reference I assumed YouTube is worth billion YouTube last gave out the number of hours watched per month in Assuming YouTube grew by about to the billion hours watched per month in turns into about billion hours per month in Comparing this valuation to watch time ratio would give you a valuation of about million for Periscope While this valuation may see low keep in mind if the growth continues the valuation will increase as well As you can see from the chart the years watched has gone from years to years in about months At years the valuation starts to make an impact in Twitters valuation by reaching million This valuation is clearly a rough estimate because the monetization of Periscope will be different than YouTubes model The big jump in the chart at the end of May is because of the launch of the Android version The chart showing the time watched as well as the chart below which shows the total number of daily active users shows no meaningful bump on May nd which was the day of the fight between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr This proves the endless articles about pirated content from this fight and Game of Thrones episodes have been way overblown I think the media likes this type of story because it generates views What is a much bigger problem is sexually inappropriate content and comments The streams are easy to block so theyre a smaller problem then the comments It is not enough to just give broadcasters the ability to block a commenter because these trolls are high in number If the account gets blocked by one user it will just troll another broadcaster These accounts need to be banned in quicker fashion The situation is serious because there are often minors filming streams Its impossible to weed out of the issues but a better job needs to be done at limiting the problem Almost every broadcast has a troll in it In his Periscope explaining this release Kayvon said he is aware of this issue and is working to resolve it Other topics were raised on the scope as well He said the company is working on a landscape mode and improving the people section The app is also working to improve search His answers to these questions gave me the impression that the company has the right priorities and will continue to push out great app updates The fact that Kayvon can use his own app to field suggestions on how to improve it is a great advantage It is similar to the way John Legere uses Twitter to learn about the pain points his customers are having Kayvon was also asked about improvements to video quality He said quality must be measured against latency since increases in quality increase the lag time for viewers I think Periscope has found a happy medium considering the network restraints and the sometimes poor smartphone camera quality He mentioned scopes would never be in p because it would put unnecessary strain on networks The most important question which was asked was whether the company was going to allow for Periscopes to last more than hours He said having them delete keeps the content fresh but sometimes a great scope should be allowed to be saved because it was so compelling Users who want to save their scopes and Meerkat streams can use Katch to automatically upload them to YouTube to do an endaround this problem I think a perfect solution is to allow each user to save one scope permanently That would prevent content from becoming stale and would allow a great scope to be saved This would be the equivalent to a channel trailer on YouTube When a user goes onto a Periscope account they are allowed to watch the recent scopes in the past hours If no scopes have been filmed the profile is empty Having one scope permanently there would allow users to see a glimpse into the type of content that is on the account When asked about integration with Twitter Kayvon said more announcements would be on their way soon This insinuates a possible integration on Twitter when Project Lightning is released in the fall Integration could also include improvements to the desktop version Allowing users to comment and heart content on desktop needs to be added Even without this feature the desktops capabilities are impressive The web version of Instagram was only just recently updated to proper usability This took over years from the launch The desktop metrics werent included in the watch time Based on my scopes I would guess this is about of the users on Periscope Not surprisingly Periscope is growing much faster than Instagram This is because smartphones are more prevalent now than in Other technology improvements have also been made such as the increased popularity of G networks Even with this knowledge in mind it is still impressive to compare it to Instagram As you can see from the chart below after months from the launch date users were spending minutes per month or minutes per day on the app By March Instagram still hadnt reached the minutes per day users spend on Periscope This makes sense because Periscope is the type of app users will spend a long time on because of the nature of the content As you can see from the chart Instagram only had daily active users in April when it was acquired by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Its growth accelerated afterwards Periscope didnt have to wait a year after launch to be acquired by Twitter which explains the quicker growth The goal of the company to focus on watch time instead of downloads is the correct focus Creating a great app that people want to use should be what the company is aiming for Using gimmicks to get downloads would hurt the app in the longterm because it would have no compelling content which is what brings people to the app in the first place Kayvon described the two focuses of Periscope to be truth and empathy Truth because the content is unedited Empathy because you can see what the content creator is seeing through their eyes and get to react as if you are friends with them Periscope connects you with others better than any other app I have used It fills the void Twitter has because often times it is difficult to find users to follow since most of the great accounts are run by people who you dont know personally YouTube viewers make you feel like you are friends with the creator Periscope deepens this connection because it is a twoway conversation Disclosure I
