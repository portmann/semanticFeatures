style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has decided to take the path of least resistance to growth and thats a good thing for shareholders I recently detailed how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>added Snapchatesque photo overlays to its photo uploader for its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform so far no indication these overlays are coming to Instagram and how it appears that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is past the point of being too proud to simply mimic its competition into the grave <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>outright stealing ideas isnt Snapchats only problem good look monetizing that demographic with the current platform capacity zero text ability and limited content visibility but the creation of a Snapchatlike service do we see this coming to Moments soon should at the very least be concerning Snapchat good luck with that It looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is keen on the idea of taking the best ideas from the current best platforms and deploying them on its own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is out with news that in a followon News Feed algorithm update to its recently announced algorithm updates updates in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced it will track data like time spent viewing posts and who users elect to prioritize seeing content from it will begin tracking a huge spectrum of video data points First are we seeing a pattern yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has drastically stepped up its incremental News Feed algorithm testing efforts as of late This also happens to coincide with the companys massive push to international markets and its ancillary testing of apps like Moments Instant Articles and a nonsocial testing of Messenger Does anybody reading this think that none of this is connected Were seeing testing efforts on the largest scale since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>came public and from my knowledge of history at the company maybe ever or at least since the early days of the company when the platform itself was evolving to current state I think a couple things are happening on a much wider scale The first thing thats happening is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is continuing to optimize its platform for Content and Inbound Marketing That much is clear and I dont think is arguable All of the testing efforts can be backed out to the general idea that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trying to optimize the News Feed to optimize engagement to optimize effective advertising Thats a pretty obvious concept <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now tracking video data points like full screen expansion time viewed in full screen muteunmute time viewed in muteunmute HD viewing time spent HD viewing as well as traditional metrics of shares likes comments etc will only further that dialingin of its most monetizable asset the News Feed This again will be good for investors as the data will likely increase the attractiveness of the data a very productive cycle For those skeptical of the longterm viability of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>like it or not if the company can show increased levels of engagement even if in nonmonetizable ways users viewing cat videos users never clicking ads but showing increased key metrics etc the value of the platform and the network will still continue to increase But what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>placing a premium on these types of metrics also does is skew the ratings and the News Feed visibility to high quality content especially the HD viewing and full screen metrics I know plenty of folks with smart phones andor GoPros that can shoot some pretty high quality video but doesnt it stand to reason that big money marketing and advertising firms will be able to create this type of video this type of stay watching me in HD full screen with the volume turned on content in volume Especially when they get adept on how to Inbound market as they are growing adept with Instant Articles I really think it does So now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is going to get to have its cake and eat it too Well eventually it will <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be able to continue to optimize its content visibility efforts it will be able to further drive engagement it will be able to get users I think so at least to prioritize high quality content I speculate even some created by marketers and advertisers and it will be able to track it all for repackaging and selling And therein lies the shareholder value creation of it all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt just doing this to do this maybe it already has been doing this driving the video metrics and broader platform engagement with this type of content but we would have never known <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has admitted that its tracking has been buggy and even inaccurate to the downside of metrics attractiveness never embellishing at times Thats been a big friction creator for video ad and marketing adopters Facebooks data tracking and reporting capacity was atrocious as well something it very importantly fixed with the rollout of new data tracking and reporting dashboards for Page admins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has fixed what ailed it when it comes to video at exactly the moment of inflection With the most recent data out of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>showing that the platform is on track in to deliver twothirds as many video views at Googles YouTube but growing at an exponentially faster view rate this is a shot in the arm for the company on the verge of what I believe is finalizing the next evolution of total platform advertising Content Intent and Inbound Marketing from transactionaltraditional If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is first the well when it comes to the new normal I think it will be nearly impossible to unseat It isnt in the high traction periods of evolutionary cycles that disruption happens but during the transitions just ask Myspace newspapers etc about that But maybe equally as important and equal in total addressable market is the now very overt Big Data positioning of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Yes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has always been in Big Data but its largely been in this business for itself With the somewhat recently expressed willingness to share this data with marketers and advertisers and its now focused efforts on making the data easy to collect view and analyze via the above mentioned dashboard additions I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is parallel refining its nonconsumer endeavors as well Facebooks video Big Data rollout and Page updates to dashboards in conjunction with what I believe is nonconsumer testing of Messenger and Moments sounds very BI to me Ive already speculated multiple times in previous <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>writings how I believe a collaborationworkflow solution is in the works at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>that will eventually launch in an effort to build out its customer service platform Messenger for Business Businesses on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Dashboards for viewing data the ability to silo sort and refine data for analysis and the ability to have deep realtime data is an expectation in the BI space and has become an expectation for inapp analysis for even nonBI solutions <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is clearly addressing these requirements in sample size with video data and Page updates I guess the broader point of this article and the big takeaway for readers is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is moving forward across multiple fronts all at once I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could be announcing a total teardown makeover of platform and platform capacity within the next twelve months I also believe readers should be long the common stock at the very least and readers with experience using leveraged vehicles should add longdated leverage The longdated should be added in case Im wrong or wrong on timing The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Jan CALLs which I purchased at days ago see below have exploded higher Im now up just under on the position as I think the market realizes what Im seeing is actually happening and as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares managed to jump a major technical hurdle to alltime highs I still like todays spot for adds if youre considering I continue to
