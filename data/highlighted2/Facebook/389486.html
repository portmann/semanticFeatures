act encryption scotus crime news As you may have heard on Friday afternoon the US Department of Justice backed off its efforts to compel Apple to aid in unlocking a criminal suspects iPhone for the second time in only a few weeks While some have heralded this as a significant victory for Apple or at least as a loss for the government its really just a tiny unresolved spat in what looks to become a protracted legal battle for both sides In a letter PDF to the US District Court judge in the case on Friday the DOJ explained that it no longer needed Apples aid in unlocking an iPhone belonging to a man already convicted of drug charges because an individual provided the passcode to the iPhone at issue in this case With that code there was no longer any need for Apple to break its own encryption That is neither a victory for Apple nor a loss for the DOJ It merely kicks the can down the road until the next time the government cant open a smartphone without potentially erasing all the soughtafter content Federal prosecutors have already successfully used the All Writs Act a law that allows a court to allows a judge to compel a person or group to provide a reasonable amount of assistance in the enforcement of a court order dozens of times to require the assistance of Apple and Google But beginning in both companies began updating their mobile operating systems to remove any sort of backdoor access meaning that a secured device could not be unlocked without the usergenerated passcode Apple and its supporters now contend that the All Writs Act does not give courts the authority to require tech companies to weaken their encryption but so far there is no legal consensus on the matter In February a District Court judge in California initially granted the FBIs request under the All Writs Act and ordered Apple to help unlock an iPhone that belonged to one of the terrorists in the Dec massacre in San Bernardino CA Apple was in the process of contesting that court order when the prosecutors withdrew their request because a third party at a cost of million was able to bypass the encryption without Apples involvement While this was going on a federal magistrate judge in New York flatout said no to a similar DOJ request for aid in unlocking an iPhone belonging to a man already convicted on drugrelated charges Ultimately the question to be answered in this matter and in others like it across the country is not whether the government should be able to force Apple to help it unlock a specific device wrote the judge in his ruling it is instead whether the All Writs Act resolves that issue and many others like it yet to come I conclude that it does not Now that the DOJ is no longer pursuing this order it leaves the magistrate courts ruling uncontested but that would not prevent the government from trying again especially since some of the reasons for denying the request Apples lack of connection to the crime the fact that everyone involved had already entered guilty pleas were specific to this case In a piece for The Verge Russell Brandom makes the argument that the government now has an uphill battle if it wants to go after Apple again Next time a locked iPhone comes up prosecutors will have to make a very convincing case that there is no other way to find the subjects passcode and no lingering vulnerabilities waiting to be discovered explains Brandom In both cases it will be very hard to say for sure As any security expert will tell you there are always more undiscovered vulnerabilities out there This sentiment was echoed by attorney Craig Newman who told the Washington Post that since the DOJ has demonstrated that it can get around encryption without Apples help the bar just got higher and the government will be hardpressed to argue again that Apple is its only alternative They may indeed be correct that the DOJ would have to say why it needs Apples help and the government will undoubtedly try to use what it learned from the San Berardino workaround to avoid courtroom fights but if the FBI DEA or some other federal law enforcement agency believes that the only way to obtain vital data on a locked iPhone is with Apples help we cant imagine the Attorney General taking the All Writs Act option off the table because of one ruling from a single magistrate judge in one district The California case involved an iPhone C and the FBI has said that the workaround it paid million for will not work on anything newer than an iPhone S meaning the government will soon be several generations behind Even the New York case which did not require any tech intervention was an older model iPhone Given the unrelated popularity of both crime and iPhones its inevitable that the DOJ will eventually run up against a criminal with a device they cant unlock At that point prosecutors will likely have to demonstrate that they have exhausted all nonApple options just as Apple will have to once again list all of its reasons a court order should be denied There will be phones the government just cant gain access to and theyll be able to say truthfully We need the data and we have no way to access it attorney Michael Sussmann tells the Post The fact that in these two cases they found a way in or got lucky wont change that With its financial and legal assets Apple seems to be the most likely candidate for a tech company that could challenge the legality of an All Writs Act order all the way to the nations highest court But it may ultimately be some other tech company challenging the DOJ As mentioned previously the DOJ has used All Writs orders to compel Googles help in bypassing security on Android devices however the company recently said that it has not yet received a request that would require it to weaken its encryption Ifwhen it does receive such an order Google said it would strongly object Facebookowned messaging service WhatsApp recently upgraded its system to provide endtoend encryption meaning that no one at the company has any access to what WhatsApp users are communicating in their chats The service is already the target of All Writs Act orders and the DOJ is reportedly waiting for the appropriately headlineworthy case to push the issue in front of a court There is also the possibility that tech companies wont be challenging the authority of the All Writs Act but of a recently introduced piece of bipartisan legislation that would require tech companies to design their encryption with builtin weaknesses so that law enforcement investigators with warrants could have ready access to the data they seek Apple Why Should We Help Unlock iPhone Of Someone Who Has Already Pled Guilty After Unlocking iPhone On Its Own Government Drops Effort To Compel
