gold isnt doing any better when it comes to preserving buying power than currencies such as the Swiss Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Moments ago the Permanent Committee on Intelligence launched a hearing on the topic of World Wide Threats whose unstated focus is whether Apples encryption makes these threats worse While AAPL employees are not present yet among those testifying will be Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Director of the Central Intelligence Agency John Brennan Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James Comey Deputy Director of the National Security Agency Richard Ledgett Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart and Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Nicholas Rasmussen In other words the whos who of everyone who wants to break into your iPhone The opening statement can be found here Here are some of the already noted highlights FBI DIRECTOR COMEY SAYS APPLE DISPUTE COULD IMPACT OTHER CASES COMEY SAYS HE WANTS TO KEEP FBI OUT OF POLICY MAKING ON DISPUTE COMEY SAYS FBI IS USING ALL LAWFUL TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE CASE COMEY NEED ROBUST NATIONAL DISCUSSION ON ISSUES IN APPLE CASE COMEY APPLE CONFLICT HARDEST QUESTION I HAVE SEEN IN GOVT Thu Looney The GOV doesnt care about that particular phone its all about the PRECEDENT If its done once they dont need to go to court against every single phone manufacturer big or small they can just cite this case and force all phonecomputer makers to decrypt EVERYTHING I think Thu TradingIsLifeBrah Meanwhile there are a whole lot more devices waiting in the wings in the hands of state and local law enforcement The Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr says hes asked Apple to unlock a whopping iPhones If the government wins in San Bernardino Vance told PBSs Charlie Rose recently he would absolutely try to get Apple to help get data off those devices too Thu Father Thyme Throw away your cell phone And stay home Preferably far away from other people Stay well armed Thats the key to living relatively normal lives according to government research On one side well get threeletter agencies lying about their shortterm and longterm intentions and on the other side well get the mobile computing device manufacturers lying about their technologiescomplicated by the fact that these sides spend just as much time working together as they do at each others throats Meanwhile we have a rather unique situation where getting the information off of this particular phone might actually be constructive to national security but nobody on either side seems to give a shit because theyve turned this case into a political football Thu pods There is not going to be any new info found on this phone Only precedent and the possibility of having the keys to the Apple castle Every statist in the land has a raging hard on to get at tech like this to help with any and all cases and no doubt spy on their wives and girlfriends Thu JRobby The fact that the story has gotten to this point shows that Apple has not been keeping up their political contributions Thu Boris Alatovkrap Government and law enforcement are like sponge absorb any and every individual liberty in name of protecting citizenry when really main objective is preservation andn expansion of state Thu Father Thyme Thu Boris Alatovkrap Thu Firepower Thu junction The same Cyrus Vance who working with then Mayor Bloomberg and the New World Order framed Dominique StraussKahn for rape instead of soliciting a prostitutehotel maid DSK phoned the hotel after he left it asking if they had found the Blackberry he left in his room DA Vances guy told the hotel manager not to tell DSK that the police wanted to talk to him Instead they let him go to the airport where they arrested him claiming he was a fleeing fugitive Then Criminal Court Judge Melissa Jackson a hack Bronx ADA Bloomberg appointed to the bench no one else would have had an excuse to jail DSK without bail And Christine LaGarde became IMF Director even though everyone knew she had been paid off by Bernard Tapie in the Credit Lyonnais bank case Thu Boris Alatovkrap Sorry Boris is not uptodate remember USSA political event but is not James Clapper previously lie tell less truthful in front of Congress This is absurd theater of Kabuki Apple has reportedly fixed a problem with its iOS operating systemusers reported that setting their clock back to January bricked the device Apple has not offered an explanation of the exact problem or even announced what it has done to fix the problem but iOS beta now available to developers and public beta testers appears to solve the problem by disallowing users from setting their clocks to any time before December Some have speculated that the problem arose in iOS devices because the operating system is UNIX based where the first day of UNIX time is coincidently January Since the devices keep track of time by noting how many seconds have passed since UNIX time began they became locked in a loop trying to figure out what time it really was Others have suggested there was an improper connection to time zones The bug was discovered by an unknown person or persons who used that knowledge to cause problems for otherspostings on Chan urged users to set their clock to January st to get a special Easter Egg and an even better surprise after they rebooted their device Note After dealing with years of problems with Microsoft I switched to Apple and have been pleased with both the mac and iphone No glitches outside of my eyes getting a little old and fat fingers on the iphone Ive got the Otter case and it is difficult to press on the screen in the corners to get it to do what I want Thus is why a lot of my comments dont use correct caps etc Free advice When the government says just the tip dont believe them Cant wait until they force someone to do this and it gets out in the wild It will fucking decimate an entire OS Thu Boris Alatovkrap What Boris is hearing is state power scramble to constrain outlet for personal liberty and freedom Always is some urgent need to strip liberty from individual war on this war on that Oceana is always at war with EastAsia citizenry is should be content with benevolent ration of chocolate issue by government Thu EarthShine Thu junction I notice FBI Director Comey has a new hair dye job no bottle black hair that looks like a shoe polish color On CNBC Jim Cramer made a groveling comment about Comey then left Between live coverage of the hearing there is former FBI flack Shawn Henry lying his head off about what is going on Comey claimed the FBI cant hack the iPhone What about the NSA The performance of these government clowns putting on an act reminds me of the end of the movie Enemy Of The State Even after their spy and murder plans went smash the surviving government spies in that movie were still lying their heads off covering up their crimes Just like now at the hearing with Comey and Clapper pretending they follow the law Thu NuckingFuts I agree with father thyme on this one I own no smart phone I do not text I do not use social media I do not store personal information on a portable device Yet I still am self employed successful enough to meet my needs and stack By example my kids learn bring a book to a waiting room not your phone Even the yo has no <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page not because we dont allow it but because he has learned from us how dangerous and stupid it is I dont care how convenient you may think it is or how much you think you need it throw that shit away and free yourself And many call me a recluse antisocial misanthropic etc But people suck Less people in my life makes me a happier person Comey answers Are you calling me on the cellular phone I dont know you Who is this Dont come here Im hanging up the phone Prank caller prank caller Criminal

nothing but Zionist propagandists I wish a few Russian jets would veer off course and bomb Saudi Arabia Israel back to the stone age the region and indeed the world would be a far far better place for it Thu Zinu I dont hate russians and I cant hate a country teritory that is absurd What I hate is criminal regimes like hitler mao stalin putin kim jonun etc And I can expose their crimes and lies Thu Sandmann Thu dervish Russia doing something that would help mankind Nope wont happen Them Satanists will get their way but will fail miserably in the end And the end is all that counts Hope its near
