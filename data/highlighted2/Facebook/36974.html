site The Saudi bombing of Yemen is another flash point and will deepen tensions between the US NATO allies and Russia and indeed China Geopolitical risk remains high and the region remains a powder For now EIA still estimates that total US crude oil production will fall in May But we think the current oil prices are enough to get the shale EPs excited The era the phony recovery narrative has come unhinged We have now entered a cycle of actual price discovery in which financial assets fall to more accurate values This will eventually result Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Back in December following the Sony email leak the world was granted a second again uninvited glimpse into the private life and thoughts of the person who had previously suffered another email leak this time exposing his fraternity days explots Snapchat founder and CEO Evan Spiegel And while many have been quick to mock Spiegel for some of his boyish ways the reality is that the not only is the yearold the worlds youngest billionaire but he has quickly won the admiration of Silicon Valleys brand names like Twitter CEO Dick Costolo who has said I really think he is one of the best product thinkers out there right now The reason we bring up the Spiegel email leak again some months after the fact is that while the publics attention when the email was first released focused on his strategy surrounding the growth of Snapchat there was another far more important aspect to Spiegels email One that in the aftermath of last nights <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>earnings has proven to be spot on Recall that in the latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>earnings reported last night the company posted its slowest growth in quarterly revenue in two years coupled with higher spending on research and development ate into profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has warned of heavy investments in as it steps up efforts to expand a collection of products that include messaging service WhatsApp photosharing service Instagram and virtual reality headset maker Oculus Rift In other words while many focus on Facebooks topline and eyeball growth far more importantly Facebooks spending on user acquisition is soaring As a result Facebooks operating expenses rose in the first quarter as RD costs jumped percent and marketing and sales spending nearly doubled This is precisely what Spiegel warned about back in December in an email to Benchmark Partners executive Mitch Lasky which was leaked as part of the Michael Lynton a Snapchat director and Sony executive email hack This was Spiegels accurate forecast in December <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has continued to perform in the market despite declining user engagement and pullback of brand advertising dollars largely due to mobile advertising performance especially App Install advertisements This is a huge red flag because it indicates that sustainable brand dollars have not yet moved to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>mobile platform and mobile revenue growth has been driven by technology companies many of which are VC funded VC dollars are being spent on user acquisition despite unknown LTV of users a recipe for disaster This props up <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>share price and continues to justify VC investment in technology products based on abnormally large mkt cap companies ie If this company attracts just of users that FB has it will be HUGE fuels spend on user acquisition as user growth is tied to values But why is this relevant after all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at a market cap of billion is just barely off its all time highs The answer is because the good times wont last especially if yesterdays jump in user acquisition costs is indicative of a new secular trend for the site which alleges to have nearly billion monthly users This is what Spiegel thinks will happen then When the market for tech stocks cools <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>market cap will plummet access to capital for unproven businesses will become inaccessible and ad spend on user acquisition will rapidly decrease compounding problems for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and driving stock even lower Instagram may be only saving grace if they are able to ramp advertising product fast enough More importantly Spiegel brings up an absolutely critical point for the second tech bubble fueled by socialmedia stocks there simply is not enough ad spending dollars in existence to support the gargantuan market caps Total internet advertising spend cannot justify outsized valuations of social media products that derive revenue from advertising Feedbased advertising units will plummet in value in the case of Twitter advertising spend may not move beyond experimental dollars similar to earlier devaluing of Internet display advertising And finally linking it all together and confirming that Spiegel is far more mature than his youthful years is his take on what happens to the tech bubble once the Feds Koolaid ends and what follows Fed has created abnormal market conditions by printing money and keeping interest rates low Investors are looking for growth anywhere they can find it and tech companies are good targets at these values however all tech stocks are expensive even looking at years of revenue growth down the road This means that most valuedriven investors have left the market and the remaining increase in market value will be driven by momentum investors At some point there wont be any momentum investors left buying at higher prices and the market begins to tumble May be correction or something more significant especially in tech stocks All of this was said back in December by the person many consider to be at the forefront of the social media bubble Is it clear now why central banks are literally going allon to monetize everything and anything around the globe just to keep said momentum investor bid going Because without it and all bets are off not in our words but in those of Silicon Valleys very own poster child Thu ZH Snob Total internet advertising spend cannot justify outsized valuations of social media products that derive revenue from advertising Feedbased advertising units will plummet in value in the case of Twitter advertising spend may not move beyond experimental dollars similar to earlier devaluing of Internet display advertising Experimental dollars Who knew the USD had these kind of subtle shades Or can they all be characterized as experimental If so the experiment would appear to be one of gullibility and greed Thu ilion He might be a billionaire all right but I have to admit not a dumb billionaire The things

The truth is marketing to a broken already in debt middle class what its all about and where the revenue dollars USED to be vast isnt profitable Another truth is people eventually become worn out about tech after awhile I mean the urge to keep everyone informed about your every move on otherwise limited purpose social media becomes tiresome for all but the most selfabsorbed among us At some point most normal people start to wonder why anyone gives a damn about what someone else is doing That means new things hopefully things of far more and lasting value than social media eventually catch our attention and ultimately advertising dollars attached to them Its not hard to create new iterations of what is eg all the latest aps and other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>spin offs like Twitter and Instagram and all the rest Whats hard is to create something like a light bulb or a telephone or a transistorwhere no such thing ever existed before and which truly revolutionizes human life THAT takes something special social media produces dont have And THATS the kind of real innovation we need today Given where our heads are today it would seem
