the Nokia brand on feature phones to Foxconn Microsoft has the right to use the Nokia brand on feature phones and Nokia X on AOSP phones until On the other hand Microsoft has perpetual ownership of the Lumia smartphone trademark and the Asha brand for featurebasic phones Microsoft should also license or sell its Lumia brand to another smartphone vendor The latest gossip is that Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT will shut down its feature phone business and sell the right to use the Nokia brand to Foxconn Microsofts purchase of Nokias phone hardware division gave it the right to use the Nokia brand on feature phones until The Lumia smartphone trademark and Asha feature phone brand are already owned by Microsoft My own takeaway therefore is Microsoft should also license Lumia to Foxconn or another firm In this age of sub Android phones feature phones are endangered species Foxconn is unlikely to make decent gains from selling Symbian OSpowered feature phones Foxconn is better off using the Lumia brand to sell Windows smartphones rather than Symbian OSpowered Nokia N units Theres also the longterm potential of Microsoft getting derivative income app sales subscriptions ads from Windows phones made by Foxconn Microsoft Should Really Quit Making Entrylevel Phones The future of Windows on smartphones is better if Microsoft quits making Lumia hardware The decisive move is to recruit another firm to takeover entrylevel Windows phones Right now it is selfdefeating for thirdparty phone manufacturers to support Windows Mobile if Microsoft itself is selling sub Lumia phones Dumping Lumia on another willing partner will cut operational costs Microsoft can save money by layingoff most of its Nokiainherited employees It can then focus its resources on highend Surface phones Let Foxconn do the gritty job of selling massmarket Lumia handsets Foxconn is wellqualified for this task Aside from assembling iPhones and other phones Foxconn actually has its own InFocus brand for sub Android phones The Lumia brand is certainly more wellknown than InFocus Foxconn could leverage Lumias alreadyestablished mainstream market branding Just over a year ago Microsoft managed to sell million Lumia handsets Unfortunately Microsoft have yet to build a viable mobile advertising platform to offset the contra revenue of selling dirtcheap Windows phones Foxconn with its dirtcheap labor force in China could eke out a decent margin selling Lumia phones Microsoft could charge Foxconn royalty fee per Lumia shipped Keeping the Lumia brand alive is still important The longterm viability of Windows Mobile requires it to be present on all product categories not just highend ones Windows Mobile will suffer the same walkingdead status of BlackBerry OS if it only attracts business users Cheap Foxconnmade Lumia phones can help Microsoft gain a bigger share of the billionyear global mobile ad business Microsofts freemium approach on mobile devices is not optimal if theres no significant number of Windows Mobile device users Making it big in mobile requires building a large population of captured device users Its true that Microsoft could gather Office subscriptions from Android and iOS users of its mobile apps However Microsofts entire freemium strategy on mobile means it still needs a healthy number of active users Ad buyers will always go for platforms with decent audience population More importantly Very few advertisers will buy ad placements on crossplatform Microsoft mobile apps because they cant get highlypersonalized data from them Due to the protected platforms of Android and iOS Microsoft can never gather indepth personal data from users of its nonWindows mobile apps Microsoft doesnt have a billionstrong social network like Zuckerberg has Microsoft has little chance of delivering hyperlocal hypertargeted ads to the AndroidiOS users of its mobile apps The other scenario I would love to see happen is for Microsoft to license the shelved Nokia X phone design to Foxconn Nokia X was an Android Open Source Project AOS handset It received million preorders in China in The Nokia brand still has legions of loyalists in that country Since Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG Google Mobile Service is absent in China that country is perfect for an AOSP phone Microsoft and Foxconn can share the proceeds from embedded Microsoft Mobile Services inside new models of the Nokia X Microsoft or Foxconn can open a Chinaspecific Nokia X app store and entertainment servicesThey can imitate the acts of local phone vendors who also operate their own app stores Xiaomi Oppo Vivo and Huawei all have their own Android app stores in China An AOSP phone is free from Alphabets meddling Microsoft can farm personal data of Nokia X customers without any hindranceLicensing Nokia X to Foxconn can also preempt any future plan of Nokia to build and sell Android phones Nokia can build and sell smartphones again under its Nokia trademark this Q Nokias CEO hinted that brandlicensing will be the preferred method for his companys comeback on smartphones The most important thing now is for Microsoft to find ways to match the mobile advertising reach of Alphabet and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB I am strongly in favor of Microsoft licensing or selling its current smartphone brands to another partner firm The savings from this move will allow Microsoft to grow organic or through MA its own mobile advertising business Theres been no updates over Microsofts alleged billion offer to buy InMobiMaking a higher offer might help persuade the private stakeholders of InMobi Fortunately there are also other leading mobile advertising players that are good targets for acquisition Unity Technologies the game engine maker and operator of No ranked Unity Ads only has billion valuation I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Application Software </div></body></html>
