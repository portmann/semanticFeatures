Seeking Alpha The news media companies should accept Facebooks offer of hosting their content The billionplus user base of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a very rich monetization avenue for news sites Advertisingdriven news dissemination is more viable than paidsubscription Majority of people still do not want to pay for digital news I believe that the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB brand is too rich and famous for news media to ignore While media companies like the New York Times NYSE NYT and CNN have established a strong online presence none of them could monetize online news as smartly as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could Zuckerberg believes he can monetize newsrelated content on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and media companies should trust him The sheer number of Facebooks daily active users already make the social network potentially the biggest newspaper on the planet Yes there is the fear that CNN or New York Times would lose much of their online audience when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>starts hosting news articles instead of referral links However Zuckerberg will still share advertising revenues with media companies for the content they will host on Facebooks website It is the next step of evolution that news sites would have to be colonies of Facebooks empire Social networks now drive of referral traffic to sites including newscentric sites The Shareaholic charts below says <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the runaway Emperor of referral traffic My point is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has lots of users that are very interested in reading or watching the news The issue now is that Zuckerberg wants to lessen the number of clicks that users will need to make to get their daily dose of news Displeasing the new emperor might prove catastrophic for news content sites Even the mighty nytimescom which has a healthy number of paying subscribers gets of its traffic from social referrals <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is again the top social network referral traffic provider for New York Times The news sites that have benefited from Facebooks mighty referral traffic might not be maximizing the monetization potential of their digital content hosted on their sites My opinion is from an analysis made by a MondayNote contributor Based on ComScores US monthly unique visitors data <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>makes revenue per one monthly unique visitor far higher than NY Times and Guardians <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has proven itself as a master of digital advertising Next only to Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the most amount of advertising partners that would pay for sponsored posts on local national and global breaking news There are now more than million advertisers using Facebooks platform Facebooks number of advertisers grew in just three years News media companies should trust the wisdom of Zuckerbergs addriven business model for news dissemination Majority of people are still very reluctant to spend money to get their digital newspapers The subscription model will eventually get reduced to niche status Even the rich countries of the UK Germany and Japan have less than of users who are willing to pay for digital news Majority of the young people years old in America are also not interested in paying for news Young Americans are actually more likely to sign up for paid subscriptions to printed newspapers than digital ones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the audience reach and advertising expertise to better monetize digital news content The paid subscription model is a weak monetization method Recalcitrant news media organizations could suffer dire consequences if they do not comply with Zuckerbergs addriven vision for digital news distribution <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could switch off the referral traffic pipeline of any news site <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is also rich enough to create its own news site We should remember that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has enough cash hoard to do anything it wants Look at the chart below <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could even easily afford to buy New York Times billion market cap Digital advertising is a competitive industry but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cakewalked its way to a solid gold balance sheet with billion cash The advertisingdriven business model of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a very profitable venture Facebooks gross margin on digital advertising could also help news sites improve their bottom line Zuckerbergs team knows how to extort better deals from advertisers judging by Facebooks stellar gross margins I agree with the Buy recommendation for FB that TipRanks analysts made <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could become a multimedia empire that will not subjugate content publishers But instead <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could help content publishers like the New York Times make more money The bullish outlook of those highlypaid analysts are also supported by Facebooks very favorable longterm technical indicators Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Is Too Rich And Too Famous For News Publishers To Ignore
