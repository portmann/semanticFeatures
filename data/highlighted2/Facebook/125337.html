Microsoft most recently has done with its BI platform combo Power BI and the formerly named Designer (now called Desktop).Why do I think Microsoft has any intention of dropping Send into Power BI and Desktop (formerly Designer)?<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Because in its most recent Summer Update for Power BI, which goes live in two days, Microsoft updated Power BI and Desktop to have much improved collaboration - including "support for groups, enabling team collaboration and sharing of Power BI content across work groups" and what I've called a quasi-chat function in which groups can view and share data (presumably comment as well?) (Uncertainty) </span>.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As I stated in my Power BI update, quite a bit about the collaboration update is still unknown but my guess is whatever is enabled at this point is just the beginning of something great. (Uncertainty) </span>I've often opined in articles covering Tableau (NYSE: DATA ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Qlik (NASDAQ: QLIK ), and Dell that chatting and collaboration are the single largest missing pieces to BI.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I believe the larger plan for Send is to develop it into a Power BI chat/collaboration function that is meaningful. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Or maybe we'll find out in two days that Send, or a version of it, is already integrated with Power BI as a part of the chat/collaboration update. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Maybe Send as a stand-alone app is simply front running the Power BI Summer Update release as a seeding and awareness initiative. (Uncertainty) </span>It will be interesting to unwrap the new Power BI in two days and find out.In any case Send, and especially where it came from - Microsoft's internal innovation incubator the Microsoft Garage, shows that Microsoft is back to being innovative and more importantly innovative in a real-time relevant way.Microsoft is looking at ways that it can either create products (as it has done with Power BI and Desktop) or improve on products (as it's doing with Send) that can aggregate broad bases of users.Google has more than a handful of products all with over a billion users (Chrome, Search, Gmail, Maps, etc.) and has turned this wide-net user aggregation into what is seemingly a perpetually expanding market cap and defensibility.Microsoft would do well to follow this strategy.Microsoft can also greatly further its single most focused on and strategic current initiative of unifying its total platform as a whole if it can get Send to show traction over time.I explained why this is important to Microsoft prior in stating, "Microsoft has one goal right now and that's to unify its platforms into one, synergistic, closed-loop ecosystem".<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Send, if it can show traction, would be an easy to use and device agnostic app that could be a huge new user base introduction funnel into the Microsoft product ecosystem. (Uncertainty) </span>Again, Microsoft clearly understands that this is a must-do in order to survive going forward and has deployed Power BI and its other SMB/enterprise freemium products in an effort to cover lost ground.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>So far Microsoft has done this quite effectively I might add. (Uncertainty) </span>Most people, especially recently, view productivity as productivity.Instead of reaching for a brand what polling and usage rates are showing is that more and more users are simply picking the best product.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Send can evidence itself to be the Slack-mobile that even Slack to this point hasn't proven it can be or if Send can show to the markets that it being integrated with Power BI is the difference maker in the BI arena that's going to matter in a big way for Microsoft as a whole. (Uncertainty) </span>Again, at the very least it shows a strategy and a culture shift from our "grandfathers Microsoft" to one that can be much, much more relevant in the new tech normal.I have great expectations for what Send and think that its progress is something Microsoft investors and enthusiasts should watch.I'll update readers as developments come along.Source: Microsoft: Send, Slack, And Power BI Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, AAPL, FB, TWTR.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
