almost identical to the S on the outside but features some internal improvements Samsung OTCSSNLF unveiled the Galaxy S and S Edge at a lavish event on Sunday February just prior to the start of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona The S turned out to be less formidable than many expected As if in acknowledgment of this Samsung is throwing in a free Galaxy Gear VR headset with every preorder In effect Samsung has already cut the price of the S before it goes on sale on March This price cutting will undoubtedly be effective in the near term and now we can see the wisdom of Apples NASDAQ AAPL March quarter guidance Initial takes have found the S design underwhelming Its very little changed from last year Samsung has reprised the aluminum and glass case from the S While the S Edge features a larger screen the S and S look almost identical Apparently this is an s year for Samsung as well as Apple Like the iPhone s the S changes are mostly under the hood Samsung has restored the microSD card slot which many Samsung customers missed Samsung has improved the water resistance of the phone so that it can even be immersed completely in water for up to thirty minutes The most important change is the upgraded processor either the Samsung Exynos or the Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM Snapdragon in North America In some early testing the S equipped with the Exynos improves its Geekbench performance over the previous Samsung Exynos in the S Here Im showing the Snap Geekbench results separately since only the Galaxy S with the Exynos processor had been tested as of this writing The dual core A processor of the iPhone s continues to score the best in single core performance while the effectively quad core Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon perform better on multicore Based on very limited graphics testing the graphics performance of the S with Exynos doesnt appear to be improved and lags considerably behind the iPhone s A processor as well as the new Snapdragon The presence of the Snap in the North American version of the S will pose somewhat tougher competition for Apple However I dont see it changing the fundamental dynamics of smartphone upgrades in the North American market Owners of older Android phones might be tempted by the S but probably not any iPhone users When more extensive benchmarks become available such as the test suite that Anandtech uses well probably see iPhone s outperforming the Exynos version of the S in most tests as it did the S when Anandtech reviewed the s back in November This is because most real world situations as well as benchmarks benefit more from single core performance Whether the Snapdragon equipped S will best the iPhone s is another matter In Anandtechs review of the Qualcomm development system for the from which I derived the graphics benchmark the iPhone s came out roughly even on CPU tests while the was ahead in graphics It has been pointed out the iPhone performs better on many benchmarks that Anandtech uses especially ones that are browser and Javascript based because of Apples operating system This isnt a bad thing It really highlights the advantage Apple has in controlling both the operating system design as well as the processor Also the day before the start of MWC LG announced that its new G smartphone would feature the Snap processor The fact that LG and Samsung will be fighting it out for top dog status in the Android world with similar or identical processors depending on the market may actually help Apple at least in perception LG and Samsung will probably split market share more evenly producing some loss of market share by Samsung The other major change to the S was in the main rear camera which was claimed to have considerably better low light capability as well as a faster autofocus system than the iPhone s The focal plane pixel count for the new camera has actually been reduced to Mpixel from the Mpixel of the S exactly the same number as the iPhone s I couldnt help but chuckle over this After reading innumerable reviews and blog posts dismissing the iPhone s camera as inferior for having fewer pixels I wonder what the reviewers will now say In fact the Mpixel count was never a particularly good metric for assessing camera quality DXOMark provides very comprehensive testing of smartphone cameras and found that the Galaxy S Edge Plus scored only a few points better than the iPhone s Plus vs on DXOs testing scale I doubt this amounts to a significant difference to consumers and is certainly not a reasonable basis to claim that iPhone ss Plus is an inferior smartphone Every smartphone maker is a system integrator that has to decide where to put product development resources Apple has emphasized its custom processor development while it depends on Sony NYSE SNE for its cameras Much of the decision making regarding cameras is based on packaging constraints Apple could certainly equip its phones with better cameras since the Sony Xperia Z also has the top score of in DXOMark The new camera in the S is undoubtedly an improvement and this will likely elicit a similar improvement in the next generation iPhone camera Perhaps the one area where Apple is truly lagging Samsung is in VR To emphasize this fact Mark Zuckerberg of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB put in an appearance at the event Samsungs Gear VR headset which uses a Galaxy smartphone as the display was developed in cooperation with Oculus which FB owns The Gear VR is actually a very clever device that makes use of the processing power and high resolution display of Samsungs smartphones to provide a very convincing VR experience that doesnt require being tethered to a computer Apple has done some hiring in VR and Tim Cook acknowledged interest in VR during Apples last earnings conference call Some virtual reality or augmented reality product is probably in the works at Apple but theres no telling when it will arrive In many respects the Galaxy S represents Samsung playing catch up In processors in services such as payments in operating systems the S represents needed catch up with the iPhone s Samsung seems to be banking on the camera and VR capability of the S to put it ahead of the iPhone s along with undercutting the price of the s These moves can all be expected to have some negative effect on iPhone sales in the near term Probably the most significant effect will be in the March quarter when the initial wave of Ss hits the market Despite some indication that iPhone sales are slower than anticipated I expect Apple to make its revenue and gross margin guidance for the March quarter Without more extensive testing of the S its difficult to gauge its impact on the June quarter Ill have a better feel for this once I see some full reviews of the S which should come out pretty soon When Apple rolls out the iPhone in September it will be an all new phone with a new processor operating system camera etc At that point I expect iPhone sales to rebound I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving
