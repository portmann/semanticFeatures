predictable outcomes with the highest efficacy Twitter NYSE TWTR has announced just hours after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB made a substantially similar announcement that its shifting its advertising model to favor and place a premium on directly influenced outcomes most notably app installs Put simply and summarized Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are now offering advertising campaigns to be run and priced for only driving off platform traffic Meaning for transitioning a user from the platform of advertising to the appwebsitecall to action of the advertiser This is a very marked pivot from the current advertising campaign status quo that mixes both defined outcomes and engagement clicks likes favorites shares retweets etc This appears to be socials new gauntlet although as of the writing of this article just Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>have made Link Clickpredictable outcome advertising announcements That being said I dont see how other platforms cant follow this model Both Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>have agreed to run the outcomegauntlet in order to prove to advertising and marketing partners that theyre the platform that can drive predictable outcomes with the highest levels of efficacy To this point using largely vague poorly tracked and lowROI proveout campaign mechanisms has done little to differentiate Big Social from a platform and ecosystem standpoint This has left advertising and marketing partners with only sheer campaign volume and overall network size as differentiators when deciding a launch partner clearly this should often favor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Measuring outcome efficacy and scheduling pricing menus around definitive actions like app downloads will do well to change that The big difference between Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>referencing the platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>not the company as a whole inclusive of Instagram Whatsapp etc is that Twitter is a place of exploration similar to Instagram in that respect and a place of bursts of high emotion For the most part though Twitter is a low emotion low attachment transactional platform for users Users are coming to Twitter in a much defined mindset one that varies greatly from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on the other hand is a place of intimacy familiarity with steady mid to high levels of emotion driven by familiarity and intimacy and high attachment Its my opinion that Twitter users treat the platform like the common areas of a dorm residence while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users treat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>like their actual dorm room Thats a big difference and that matters This platform difference offers substantial outcome driving advantages to Twitter that I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is afforded the same channels of delivery Ill explain Understanding what Twitter does well is realtime helps further explain its transactionaldiscovery usermindset Users can have complete anonymity on Twitter which makes the discovery process safer and more easily facilitated The same anonymity claim could be made for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but it would limit the users total experience Very few times will a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>user engage with an anonymous profile or a profile outside of its familiarity circle Twitter users also have access to information in realtime feeds without the feed being sorted by an algorithm like that on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>This too aids in the discovery process as the user isnt trapped within a social circle or searchinformation circle like one could say Googles algorithm places a user in Finally users visiting Twitter often have preset use cases such as streaming tweets from a sporting event a breaking news story etc The combination of user discovery mindset and user preset use cases arms Twitter with two highly useful utilities to build out its outcome matrix Put another way Twitter has two very important head start data points that it can use to drive payoffs It knows its users are open to new things and it knows its users will at points be in states of high emotion Emotion for those whove never sold anything is a very powerful sales tool Twitter can and should tailor its advertising and marketing campaigns to target users at the times of highest discovery mindset and times of highest emotion With its overall data social graph and new machine learning I dont anticipate finding targeting and executing campaigns at these times will be a problem And remember these are tools the discoveryemotion tools which largely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a platform doesnt possess I also reiterate that Twitters platform is better suited to facilitate both having no algorithmic sorting of information This is why I believe Twitter should see a great deal of success with its new advertising pivot focus and why I believe the success level will increase over time Twitter has invested heavily in being able to become more realtime with its investments in Periscope and Beacon Marketing tech and in improving its learning As Twitter grows its overall useruse case footprint this will be greatly aided by the launch of Project Lightning so too should its total outcome driving efficacy More data more refining wider net It all sets up to be very productive for Twitter in making itself more attractive to advertisers A more attractive platform to advertisers driven by being a more attractive platform for users which I just stated I believe Twitter will become with recent integrations means a more attractive forward looking longterm viability That of course means a more attractive looking equity You see where Im going with this Twitter should benefit greatly from this higher visibility marketing shift that Big Social has elected to offer While I dont think this makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>andor Google losers in the scheme of things I think that this made very specific how Twitter advertising should be used from a campaign standpoint Advertisers and marketers like specificity and they like predictability Being able to turn to Twitter for specific uses should increases its uses overall especially if Twitter shows the outcome driving ability I think it can I think Twitters best days are ahead of it not behind it I think the shift to proving out predictable outcomes will go a long way in making that a reality Source Twitter Entering The Outcome Influencing Gauntlet With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Disclosure I amwe
