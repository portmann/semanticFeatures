encouraged investors to ignore the noise surrounding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and its perceived inability to execute With Q earnings issued it was clear the noise was simply that noise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is singing a pretty tune while its tech peers are fumbling for the right music sheet Some may say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is priced for perfection but its hard to quantify perfect when the company is the one defining it Two weeks ago I wrote an article which affirmatively and confidently advised <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB investors to ignore the noise In the aftermath of Facebooks Q results I ask you this question hows the music sounding Most investors are hearing some pretty good tunes SA Editor Rocco Pendola for example might be enjoying some Elliott Smith if he happens to be a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shareholder thats a joke because hes listening to him either way The rest of us are hearing beautiful notes emanating from the income statement The point in my previous article is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is delivering great results regardless of facts and noise certain sources proclaim are chinks in the armor So my articles come full circle and the truth continues to be heard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>delivers That delivery looks like revenue growing to B without forex adjustments mind you and net income growing a staggering to B or per share Oh and thats GAAP by the way little room to argue those numbers The difference between other tech giants like Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Apple NASDAQ AAPL and their melodic tunes are pretty staggering this earnings season While those two tech giants had missteps in their growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has only turned on the Marshall full stacks to blow away estimates The growth is definitely in California but its concentrated in Menlo Park Lets outline where exactly this outperformance came from Mobile advertising revenue was B Now by itself that sounds like it could go either way either decent or something to be desired When you put it in perspective and realize that it grew year over year it becomes a little more serious Serious growth that is Its clear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has turned on some afterburners for their mobile advertising business CFO David Wehner attributes this to Facebooks News Feed but I think theres more to it than that Instagram now has more than advertisers according to Mark Zuckerberg Those advertisers are not loitering around but instead putting their marketing budget to work Kenshoo believes that a billion in revenue a year is likely this year Not only that but clickthrough rates are the best of any social media platform as users are two and a half times more likely to click an Instagram ad than one on any other platform This is likely the new instrument were hearing in Facebooks song which may take a lead role in future quarters In the meantime though its likely providing a nice boost to the top and bottom line Another set of numbers I want to touch on are the user metrics If I turn off my noise filter I can hear chatter that goes something like Facebooks user growth has to slow at some point or User engagement is falling and users will leave I counter that with the consistent growth that we again see in Q of this year With B monthly active users this is an increase of from s Q and up from Q Even more impactful is that this is an acceleration from the that Q saw sequentially But this still misses the point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the website and the above user metric pertains to that This misses out on the other meaningful assets that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the company is bringing online Were not even talking about the user growth on platforms like Messenger WhatsApp and Instagram where the latter two have one billion and M users respectively To focus only on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and claim the growth has limited room to run shows a lack of a wideangle perspective to form a complete analysis on the entire company What Im seeing in the tech industry right now is a company that is steadily on top and pushing the peak higher one that is laser focused on what needs to get done but also focused on what theyre good at Alphabet on the other hand has its tentacles in many places and distracts them from becoming a better search engine and advertising company Apple is in a period where innovation has stalled and their business is reliant on a physical product in which margins are pressured no matter how premium the product is software enjoys lucrative margins <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been a standout in this challenging market environment and exceeds even the best expectations mine included Some may say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is priced for perfection My problem with that statement is you cant quantify what perfection is when the company is the one defining it I might be adding that to my noise filter as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues to deliver and exceed market expectations as noted by the stock price marching higher Remember theres always going to be noise The idea is to filter it out and tune in to the melody that is producing the right notes Otherwise you may be hesitant to start singing and miss out on the reward If youd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and other tech companies then I encourage you
