building a secret team for VR However Apples silence has left analysts confused on how much the company has progressed in this field Apple NASDAQ AAPL is secretly building a team to kick start its VR virtual reality initiative reported The Financial Times The iPhone already contains gyroscope and accelerometer for position sensing and tracking head movements Apples recent acquisitions may help the company place additional sensors inside the iPhone for making the device capable of providing a degree immersive experience However Apple remains tightlipped on its VR initiative leaving the analyst community in uncertainty about how it would use VR in its upcoming products Ben Wood an analyst at CCS Insight said Id wager that there is a substantial team within Apple figuring out how the company will play a role in this technology It certainly cant let rivals such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Google and Samsung run away with the market particularly given the groundswell of momentum building around smartphonebased virtual reality The upcoming VR headsets such as Facebooks NASDAQ FB Oculus Rift Sonys NYSE SNE PlayStation VR and HTC Vive are all set to take VR mainstream this year In the initial phase VR will target the gaming industry Mark Zuckerberg said But this is just the start After games were going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor facetoface just by putting on goggles in your home Amid such an exciting environment why is Apple refusing to comment on VR Does this silence mean Apple has gotten left behind or progressed ahead of competitors Well evidence suggests that the latter is more likely As an investor I carefully observed what Apple and its competitors have done in the past one year to commercialize VR Samsung OTCSSNLF Apples nearest competitor in smartphones has embraced smartphones to enter the VR world unlike Oculus HTC and Sony Samsungs Gear VR which is already commercially available uses Oculus Rift as headset and its own Galaxy smartphone as display Oculus Rift HTC Vive and PlayStation VR will offer users handtracking input devices such as a touch controller or a joystickmouse to interact with their systems However handtracking is a drawback for a complete immersive experience and eyetracking is what we need Milpitas Californiabased startup Eyefluence is developing eyetracking technology for making VR a degree immersive experience The technology will allow tracking the eye based on the expansion and contraction of the iris Eyefluence is aiming at offering its technology to VR headsetmakers which the headsetmakers I just mentioned will incorporate in the subsequent versions of their devices A year ago Apple was granted a patent for a device that is similar to Samsungs Gear VR Subsequently it made two acquisitions Faceshift and Emotient startups that are developing technologies that can capture emotional facial expressions Finally Apple hired Doug Bowman who served as the director of the Center for HumanComputer Interaction at Virginia Tech Bowman is one of the top VR researchers in the US These observations made me believe that Apple has already progressed well ahead of competitors in VR with its iPhone The emerging technologies developed by Emotient and Faceshift should be more powerful than the eyeinteraction technology developed by Eyefluence because when facial expressions are captured expansion and contraction of the iris of the eye are also captured Why iPhoneBased VR Is a More Viable Option for Apple I believe an iPhonebased VR system is a more viable option for Apple However in addition to a VRsupported iPhone I expect that Apple will launch a VR headset very much like Samsungs Gear VR A smartphonebased VR system is more viable for both Apple and Samsung because both the companies have a loyal userbase and their users use the smartphones for various purposes such as watching streaming videos and availing healthcare and fitness services For people to whom gaming isnt the first priority a smartphonebased VR system would be more appealing instead of a VR system that Sony and HTC are going to launch Zeiss launched its VR One headset that can use any iPhone between and inches as the display unit Using the VR One headset an iPhone user can enjoy VR immediately However since the headset doesnt have the necessary VRsupporting sensors users wont be able to enjoy complete immersion into the virtual world Nevertheless this is an encouraging development and a right step into the future I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for
