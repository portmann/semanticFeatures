class='textDiv'>Exclusive Egypt blocked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Internet service over surveillance sources Reuters SAN FRANCISCO By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Joseph Menn A man poses with a magnifier in front of a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>logo on display in this illustration taken in Sarajevo Bosnia and Herzegovina in this December file photo SAN FRANCISCO Egypt blocked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Incs FBO Free Basics Internet service at the end of last year after the US company refused to give the Egyptian government the ability to spy on users two people familiar with the matter said Free Basics launched in Egypt in October is aimed at lowincome customers allowing anyone with a cheap computer or smartphone to create a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account and access a limited set of Internet services at no charge The Egyptian government suspended the service on Dec and said at the time that the mobile carrier Etisalat had only been granted a temporary permit to offer the service for two months Two sources with direct knowledge of discussions between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and the Egyptian government said Free Basics was blocked because the company would not allow the government to circumvent the services security to conduct surveillance They declined to say exactly what type of access the government had demanded or what practices it wanted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to change A spokesman for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>declined to comment Etisalat did not respond to a request for comment Mohamed Hanafi a spokesman for Egypts Ministry of Communication declined to comment specifically on the allegation about surveillance demands but cited other reasons for Free Basics to be blocked The service was offered free of charge to the consumer and the national telecommunication regulator saw the service as harmful to companies and their competitors he said Free Basics which is available in countries that have large populations without reliable Internet service is central to Facebooks global strategy The company does not sell ads on the Free Basics version of its website and app but it aims to reach a large group of potential users who otherwise would not be able to create <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>accounts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>said more than million Egyptians used the service before it was suspended and million of them had never had Internet access The main <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>site and app are still available in Egypt which has a population of about million The conflict over Free Basics highlights the delicate balancing act that global Internet companies face in responding to the demands of governments while protecting the privacy of their customers especially at a time of heightened concerns about Internet surveillance and censorship worldwide It represents one of the few known cases in which a global Internet company has received and rejected a government demand for special access to its network and been forced to shut down a service Internet privacy experts say Free Basics has come under fire from Internet activists across the globe most notably in India for violating net neutrality by allowing free access to a select group of websites and businesses thus putting others at a disadvantage Indian regulators issued new rules in February that effectively barred Free Basics after a twomonth public consultation process Hanafi cited the India example in explaining Egypts move but there has been no public debate or regulatory proceeding over net neutrality or the competitive impact of Free Basics in Egypt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in September strengthened the security protections for Free Basics after criticism from privacy advocates that it did not do enough to prevent spying In part the problem was that users could not seamlessly connect over encrypted channels to the secure websites marked by addresses beginning HTTPS That meant that customers using webbased email might have their messages exposed Authorities might also be able to watch who was visiting particular websites Now those using the Free Basics mobile app can connect directly with encryption to secure sites Those connecting via the Free Basics website can connect securely to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which decrypts and then reencrypts user traffic before sending it along to partner sites It is not known whether the new security measures were a factor in Egypts decision to block Free Basics It is also not known if the government has asked other social media companies or Internet service providers for security back doors When Free Basics launched in Egypt there was no mention of a temporary permit or concerns about competition or net neutrality according to people who were involved in the discussions At the time of the suspension <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>said it was disappointed and hoped to resolve the situation soon Some former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>employees said the company has reason to be especially vigilant in defending its customers in Egypt A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page started in by a Google GOOGLO employee in Dubai about the death of an Alexandria man at the hands of police played a direct role in fomenting the protests that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak in In January this year amid a crackdown on dissent in the runup to the fifth anniversary of the uprising Egyptian security forces arrested two people for managing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>pages that they said were used to support the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood and encourage protest The two are still in jail pending investigations on charges of inciting violence and disseminating and publishing false news Any move to shut down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>completely in Egypt would likely bring a harsh popular backlash said Ramy Raoof a digital security researcher and consultant But blocking Free Basics can crimp Facebooks growth among lower income people without alienating middleclass Internet users and businesses Shutting down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>completely is an idea that is farfetched and would lead to great consequences Raoof said Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb and Joseph Menn in San Francisco Additional reporting by Ola Noureldin and
