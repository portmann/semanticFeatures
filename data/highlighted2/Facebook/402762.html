If Youve Got Gold Youve Got Money If You Havent Got Gold Youve Got a Problem Perhaps the one last chance at saving the United States is embracing the truth the truth as it is and not the truth the US Government would have you believe For seven years now weve been told the US is in a recovery However if this were the case the Fed would have started raising rates years ago likely in No other recovery on record saw Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site As Liberty Blitzkriegs Mike Krieger explained last year when fears began to rise over increasing control of news flow <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a private company and has every right to do as it pleases with its platform even if that means pushing a political agenda viaits news feed That said CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been explicit withhis intention to dominate news dissemination to his users For example we learned the following in last years post <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Reveals its Master Plan Control All News Flow In recent months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been quietly holding talks with at least half a dozen media companies about hosting their content inside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>rather than making users tap a link to go to an external site The new proposal by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>carries another risk for publishers the loss of valuable consumer data When readers click on an article an array of tracking tools allow the host site to collect valuable information on who they are how often they visit and what else they have done on the web And if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>pushes beyond the experimental stage and makes content hosted on the site commonplace those who do not participate in the program could lose substantial traffic a factor that has played into the thinking of some publishers Their articles might load more slowly than their competitors and over time readers might avoid those sites One of the ways <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been pursuingits news push is throughits trending tool The idea is that a neutral algorithm determines what readers are interested in and talking about at a grassroots level then place position thosestories appropriately withinthe trending feed Thats how youd hope it work but the reality appearsto be far different We as a company are neutral we have not and will not use our products in a way that attempts to influence how people vote That is a quote from a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>spokesperson given in response to a leaked internal poll which asked what responsiblity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had in preventing Donald Trump from becoming the next president In light of the fact that a former employee is now admitting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>routinely suppresses conservative news stories from its trending news section were curious if that same response will be used An individual who worked on the project told Gizmodo that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>prevented stories about the rightwing CPAC gathering Mitt Romney Rand Paul and other conservative topics from appearing in the trending news section Additionally several former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>news curators as they are known internally told Gizmodo that they were instructed to artificially inject stories into the news flow even though they werent popular enough to be included As Gizmodo reports Facebooks news team is just a group of young journalists educated at Ivy League or other private East Coast universities injecting their liberal views into a news stream that million in the US alone are reading at any given moment Depending on who was on shift things would be blacklisted or trending said a former curator who was one of very few conservatives on staff Id come on shift and Id discover that CPAC or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldnt be trending because either the curator didnt recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz added the individual A list of stories that were deepsixed was provided to Gizmodo which included stories such as Lois Lerner and the IRS targeting Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker anything from the Drudge Report Former Nave Seal Chris Kyle and former Fox News contributor Steven Crowder I believe it had a chilling effect on conservative news the former curator said Another former curator agreed saying it was absolutely bias We were doing it subjectively It just depends on who the curator is and what time of day it is Every once in a while a Red State or conservative news source would have a story But we would have to go and find the same story from a more neutral outlet that wasnt as biased Examples of that would be anything from outlets such as Breitbart Washington Examiner and Newsmax would have to be excluded unless mainstream sites like the New York Times BBC and CNN were covering the story Although there is no evidence that management directed such actions managers did instruct curators to put stories into the feed that management felt were important even if they werent being covered enough to be picked up by the trending algorithms We were told that if we saw something a news story was on the front page of these ten sites like CNN the New York Times and BBC then we could inject the topic If it looked like it had enough news sites covering the story we could inject it even if it wasnt naturally trending We would get yelled at if it was all over Twitter and not on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>said the former curators <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>not only manipulated the trending news flow but also pretended it was covering hard news People stopped caring about Syria and if it wasnt trending on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it would make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>look bad <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>got a lot of pressure about not having a trending topic for Black Lives Matter They realized it was a problem and they boosted it in the ordering They gave it preference over other topics said a former curator So as it turns out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is just another liberal leaning organization with a news platform that is manipulated to show what it deems important to convey to its users As yet another conspiracy theory turns to conspiracy fact this will be a difficult for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to unwind even if Zuckerberg wears his coolest hoodie while trying to do so Mon bfellow Mon LowerSlowerDela But why not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has leftists running They are for good Conservatives who believe in limited government liberty personal
