EBAY FB FDN GOOGL YHOO by Josh Klein PNQI consists of a conglomerate of mature internet stocks The Dot Com bubble is behind us internet stocks are becoming more profitable A recent pullback in price makes this ETF far more attractive Over the past years investors attitudes towards internet stocks have been fairly mercurial In the late s to early s many investors craved internet social media and ecommerce stocks no matter the price Some companies were even trading close to times earnings a number well above the SP s PE However the hype didnt last On January investors began to realize these companies couldnt live up to their growth expectations A strong user base was not enough to maintain a sufficient investment prospect Internet stock suddenly became among the most avoided stocks on the market and they along with the rest of the economy took a plunge into a bear market A huge reason for the dotcom bubble bust was because companies began spending endlessly without generating any real sufficient revenue A few examples include Boocom and GeoCities Boocom an internet fashion company spent million in hopes to expand globally before going bankrupt in GeoCities a web hosting website was bought by Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO for million in and later went out of business in Companies were too centralized around boosting views and members instead of revenue The immense growth prospects began to wither away and Mr Market inevitably crashed Although even nowadays many social media and internet based stocks are highly dependent on registered users there is a much larger focus on revenue this time around Mature stocks such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Ebay NASDAQ EBAY Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Google NASDAQ GOOGL have all managed to boost users while maintaining high profit margins and steady growth That is why the First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund a conglomerate internet fund consisting of mature revenue driven stocks is such an attractive ETF to invest in right now The First Trust DJ Internet Index ETF NYSEARCA FDN is another index fund with large percentage holdings in some of the same internet companies however I believe the PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio ETF NASDAQ PNQI is a better bet for a few reasons The following chart details the percent gain for both ETFs First PNQI is more globally diversified With the Fed likely raising interest rates oil looking to rise and Greek nearing bankruptcy now more than ever it is important to diversify PNQI has stakes in America Asia Europe Latin America and Canada where as FDNs holdings are entirely US stocks Below is a breakdown of the two ETFs by region Second PNQI covers more sectors Although Ive stressed the growing Internet industry it is important not to put all your eggs in one basket FDN is predominately technology PNQI only has a stake in technology <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Amazon and Google are no longer dependent on users They are amongst the largest companies in the NASDAQ and centralize their growth around earnings profits and innovation FB AMZN and GOOGL have market capitalizations of billion billion and billion respectively <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a company with over billion users has focused its attention on monetizing its apps more efficiently After purchasing Instagram and Whats App Mark Zukerburg has focused his attention on further developing his Messenger app and expanding Facebooks services to the news industry Over the next couple of months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>plans to expand its Messenger software from mobile devices to desktops enabling more users than ever before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also intends to further develop Messengers platform allowing app developers to use Messenger as a base for their software coding Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>aims to launch a feature known as Instant Articles to provide direct news to its billion users This feature will enhance the user experience by eliminating third party news extensions Generally a link to an article can take up to eight seconds to load Attaching the article directly to Instant Articles will allow the user to access his or her news quicker leaving more time for surfing Amazon continues to remain profitable despite temporary headwinds from Alibaba They recently released Amazon Echo a voice command object used to control smart devices answer questions and play music Amazon just released a statement announcing that the cloud computing device will be compatible with IFTTT software integrating third party apps and smart devices more efficiently across the board Google is spear heading the Internet of Things revolution There driverless car is amongst the first or our generation and could see very profitable down the road TomTom CEO recently came out with a statement indicating that their maps services is most likely going to be used for Googles driverless car The computer manipulated transportation era is underway maybe its time to jump on the wagon and reap in the investment benefits Twitter and LinkenIn are definitely the weakest stocks in PNQIs portfolio After significant earnings misses both stocks have dropped roughly Many might view this sudden drop as a scare however I view this as an FDN buying opportunity Although Twitter fell due to lack of proper monetization and over exaggerated future expectations its revenue surged since Q and its monthly users were up Similarly LinkedIn dropped due primarily to its over exaggeration of future prospects and missing on growth estimates by a significant number However due to their major sell off I believe a minor stake in their stocks could be profitable I wouldnt recommend buying LNKD or TWTR directly but purchasing FDN could be a great way to increase your stake while hedging your risks Although Netflix has grown in the last decade the value of the stock is currently worth more than it is selling for After reporting earnings the other day Netflix has jumped more than It used to just post unoriginal content strictly alreadyexisting movies and TV shows however the strong boost of original content will push Netflixs user base in the US exponentially Possible Mergers GoogleTwitter YahooPriceline Twitters awful management cant seem to monetize and Google struggles to gain traction in the social media industry quite like Twitter Instagram and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>do A merger would be a logical move for both parties It helps to note that Google has been wanting to buy Twitter ever since it IPOed in November of Yahoo sitting on loads of cash as it parts ways from Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is in desperate need for some growth Priceline has seen some incredible stock growth after increasing its buyback in Although Expedia recently reported impressive quarter earnings and seems to be picking up market share a strong USD and lower gas prices can prove beneficial for Priceline Priceline wants to gain more market value and recently attained OpenTable last year for billion I wouldnt be surprised if a merger gets underway Priceline is reporting earnings in a few days keep an eye out for some good news There is a lot of benefit to be reaped in the internet industry We have come a long way since the dot com era The businesses listed in PNQIs holdings have proven to be mature internet social media and ecommerce stock that base growth on tangible excellence such as revenue and innovation Due to recent event PNQI has dropped a few points making it an even more attractive buy Source Its Time To Get
