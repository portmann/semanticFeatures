on a virtuous cycle that has never been proven The facts suggest the opposite cycle Subscriber growth is stalling content liabilities are skyrocketing and operating expenses are rapidly climbing The income statement is misleading examining cash flows shows the rapidly weakening structure Despite being a loyal customer of seven years I have also been a Netflix NASDAQ NFLX bear for many years since late and surprisingly despite strong domestic subscriber growth and rapid international expansion nearly all of the bear side arguments remain as valid as they were in Bulls often focus on misguided shorts who missed a run from the mids in late to the upper s of today an annualized return of over They are absolutely right Shorting NFLX in late was a miserable call However the underlying short thesis remains intact despite the enormous market disconnect The NFLX market outperformance also ignores the collapse of similar to how government economists like to begin their models in early Despite the rampant gain in stock price when compared to peaks close to NFLX has returned only annually versus SP NYSEARCA SPY returns of almost exactly the same There have been lots of discussions regarding the pricing of the stock market including Robert Shillers warning during mid due to a near record CAPE reading For those unfamiliar Shiller is an economics Nobel Laureate and is famous for correctly calling both the tech bubble and the housing bubble collapse within years His book Irrational Exuberance is a fantastic read and he aptly released his rd edition in January He released his first book in March and the second edition in late Both books preempted the subsequent market crash by mere months Only time will tell whether he will perform a hat trick but fundamentally he has proven right that the market is nearing record valuations This market bubble is compounded in the tech sector Stocks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB LinkedIn NYSE LNKD Twitter NYSE TWTR and Netflix trade with average pricetoearnings PE multiples of nearly x Even by pricetosales PS the multiples are strong ranging from to Ironically of this batch of stocks Netflix is actually one of the cheapest with a PE of around and a PS of approximately Despite common arguments that these are good businesses the current fundamentals and growth prospects do not justify these multiples Intel NASDAQ INTC Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT were all fantastic businesses in yet longterm shareholders still got stuck with abysmal returns due to poor investment timing decisions Regardless of your thoughts on the underlying stock market NFLX is in need of strong subscriber growth and ultimately revenue growth not just to satisfy analysts and traders but to stay afloat financially Netflix has posted impressive subscriber growth over the past years but I believe we are very close to saturation in the US markets and that international markets will continue to prove difficult in regards to profitability The two most recent quarters present striking evidence of this coming brick wall The charts below highlight Netflixs yy growth both domestically and worldwide While the domestic growth was strong throughout there is a clear trend of slowing growth The worldwide figures demonstrate the same trend but the growth is much stronger due to the rapid global expansion of streaming availability and limited competition The worldwide figures show the same trend but growth is still above yearoveryear Netflix is increasingly dependent on international growth to meet analyst targets and investor expectations The chart below highlights the rapid ascent of the unprofitable international subscriber count versus Netflixs total base The entire Netflix bull case boils down to one argument the virtuous cycle The operating results and growth projections can be packaged by analysts in many different ways but the crux of the argument is that NFLX will use its global leverage and scalability to secure longterm favorable content agreements It will then utilize pricing power to boost revenues while simultaneously posting massive subscriber growth This will result in revenue growth that will rapidly outpace content spending ultimately leading to massive profits that justify the current valuations This thesis has zero fundamental support and defies basic business logic Without this thesis NFLX is nothing more than a commodity middleman with a sideline content business Essentially a mixture of a Starz NASDAQ STRZA type bundler and a Lions Gate NYSE LGF type content procurerproducer The below graph shows the yearoveryear growth of revenues versus content cost growth and shows the virtuous cycle thesis has failed to materialize The Q results were the first time in NFLX history that revenues outpaced content liabilities by a mere helped by both phenomenal seasonal results in the US rapid international expansion and a price hike during fall These comparisons ignore the profound juicing that NFLX used via a recordbreaking marketing spend During Q NFLX spent M on marketing and M on corporate expenses annual increases of and respectively What did these massive campaigns yield The lowest YoY subscriber growth in recent history It gets worse as the total content liabilities continue to skyrocket During the last two quarters NFLX posted the two highest annual increases in content liability growth These are in values the nominal growth is even worse This outofcontrol spending commitment is seen below Reed Hastings is a smart man and a brilliant business leader I honestly believe he wants Netflix to succeed and revolutionize the tech world He wants to secure the best possible future for longterm shareholders However to accomplish this with what is obviously a failed business model management and especially sellside analysts he must resort to a shell game of sorts Just as a shell game involves misdirection and appears as a game of skill NFLX results are packaged as sustainable growth and varying metrics are placed forward to demonstrate a flawed thesis This flawed thesis is the proposal of a virtuous cycle based on a flawed representations of cheap and easy growth content bargaining power and consumer pricing power The proof of a virtuous cycle is shifted from egg to egg depending on the most recent results another descriptive word is spin Are analysts focused on raw subscriber growth NFLX plunges into international markets and loses money hand over fist in order to boost these figures Subscriber growth is a misdirection Bears are focusing on a lack of unique content NFLX will spend billions to create a plethora of shows and pay through the nose for Disney NYSE DIS exclusivity Content power is a misdirection Focused on cash flows NFLX says its going towards international growth You have to spend money to make money Bulls point instead to the income statement the biggest misdirection of them all If youve only looked at the income statement with a quick glance the flawed bullish argument wins Growth looks nice there and NFLX appears to be building profits its what Netflixs management and bandwagon analysts want you to look at Just dont peak under the hood and look at cash flows because then the thesis crumbles I peaked under the hood and its ugly The analysis shot is posted below I took publicly available numbers from Netflixs results page specifically this document and rearranged the numbers to prevent obscuration by irrelevant flows Specifically I removed the cash flows from buying selling and redeeming investment securities which have no place in determining underlying profits I also separated out NFLXs juicing of working capital a onetime gainer and common financial sin that I lambasted Angies List NASDAQ ANGI with back in Smartly utilizing working capital is good its pretending these results provide evidence of sustainable free cash flow that I believe qualifies as misleading As seen in the above chart business results are going in the wrong direction fast This chart coupled with slowing subscriber growth and rapidly ascending content costs should have potential investors running for the hills As I think about Netflix investors eagerly awaiting the promised land of profits and cash flow I am reminded of a quote from Gertrude Stein there is no there there In other words once NFLX has exhausted all remaining avenues of subscriber growth and has spent billions more on shortterm content contracts and billions more on exclusive content investors will be left with a failed business model The virtuous cycle that has been promised to the faithful is nothing more than a poorly researched sham The sham is quickly unraveling on both the content above and noncontent side below I urge all interested readers especially if you disagree with me to read my early article in which I refute Icahns thesis for owning Netflix Theres pages of content there of which most is relevant over a year later I also urge readers to check out the bullish arguments for Netflix the most recent of which was posted by James Godbout on April Take the time to review the income statements peruse the balance sheet and examine the timing of debt issuances Read all you can find about Netflix and then come to your own informed conclusion Remember this isnt about the Netflix monthly video streaming offering its about the investment proposition of purchasing the stock for share I believe that Netflix offers a great product to its users and is greatly benefiting the average video consumer However I believe the current business model has multiple holes and the overarching thesis is completely flawed I also believe the recent results have been immensely skewed by NFLX bulls primarily the mainstream analyst community I believe Netflix is similar to Amazon NASDAQ AMZN or Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO in with fantastic consumer offerings but with weak profitability and poor business models Just as those firms were pricedtoperfection prior to the dotcom burst I believe NFLX is currently priced to near perfection despite fundamental proof of weakness I believe a phenomenal crash is coming soon I look forward to what I believe will be a lively discussion below I am not an investment advisor so theres no advice here just a few ways in which I am considering playing what I perceive to be a phenomenal mispricing Shortterm speculatively the outofthemoney options expiring after earnings April such as the puts offer a payout if NFLX drops after results priced around The atthemoney puts are priced for a breakeven at a drop per contract and would give a payout with a drop Longer term if you are as convicted as me the puts trade for around If NFLX hits a growth wall during midlate I believe the stock could easily lose of its current value x and x payout respectively As a pure short for the long term I dont believe its attractive Insurance is always a necessity and atthemoney calls for January cost implied upside in months which would result in a substantial drain on capital if NFLX stays in a similar trend The projected gain on risk share price drop over for the call is a maximum of x and the breakeven is I personally have and puts for April and puts for January purchased over a year ago If NFLX results are as expected I plan to roll profits into Jan strikes If results are different fundamentally positive then I will reexamine my thesis Source Netflix Bull Thesis Is Profoundly Flawed Disclosure The author is short
