link or you will be banned from the site Following a mysterious third partys willingness to show The FBI how to unlock San Bernardino killer Farooks iPhone court records indicate that the US government wishes to cancel tomorrows showdown with Apple filing a motion to vacate the hearing Hours after Tim Cook explcitly told the world marketed his firm would never sell out their privacy For many of us the iPhone is an extension of ourselves Cook said according to USA Today We need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy We did not expect to be in this position at odds with our own government But we have a responsibility to help you protect your data and protect your privacy We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country We will not shrink from this responsibility he added In case the message wasnt clear enough Apples music selection spoke for them At the end of the event Tom Pettys I Wont Back Down blasted through the venue According to the memorandum On Sunday March an outside party demonstrated to the FBI a possible method for unlocking Farooks iPhone The third party and what the possible methods could be involved are both mysteries Did Apple fold quietly behind the scenes Is this how both sides save face with neither side appearing to have given an inch on their defense or persecution of personal liberty Who knows but if the US Government suddenly places an order for million iPhone SEs then we have our answer Mon sheikurbootie Mon jcaz Mon BuddyEffed Mon Pladizow Something fishy is going on here This outcome is of no surprise to the FBI so what were they trying to accomplish Mon Oldwood Did they dig up Jobs They seem to think they can breath life into any dead thing so why not Tue Bunga Bunga Mon zeronetwork Backdoor or frontdoor its all BS Apple google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and all other are fed by gov No one is your friend Mon swmnguy Plad My guess is that theyve always been able to get this information whenever they want it They just want to be able to get the evidence admitted into court They cant do that now necessarily There are ways of course But theyre looking for a court to hand them a precedent they can apply any way they want Im sure they already have everything they might want off of this phone and the phones owner is dead anyway So its a perfect test case for them They dont even have to get into the phone They have to get into the data stream between the phone and wherever everything on it is backed up to We already know they divert every single telecom stream and record it right at the hub Mon wngsmk Something fishy is going on here This outcome is of no surprise to the FBI so what were they trying to accomplish Its all a Marketing ployjust like Xmas hack with the leaking of The Interview every muppet will throw themselves at the new IPhoney cause AppEl is the only one to stand up to the big bad GovLolApple and the DNC are laughing all the way to the bankLOL Now go back to Upvoting some funny oneliner rather than the guy who did his homework and was the st one to break the story on ZH Because thats exactly what most of you phonys did in that story Sometimes the hypocritical selfrighteousness is breathtaking on this site Only a Liberal Progressive or a Conservative BibleThumber is capable of such feats of hypocrisy Mon jcaz Mon swmnguy Tue KirkNCC Youre missing the point Allow me to spell it out for you and Ill type slowly so you can keep up I broke the story on ZH before anyone else did by doing the right thing citing a Source RT Making a contribution like breaking a story on ZH gets you far less credit than a smartass oneliner Sometimes its not so much of a Fight Club but Amateur Hour for aspiring Standup Comedians Humor gets more points than insight or intel That tells you EVERYTHING you need to know about the breeding and IQ of the average blogger No wonder the Founding Fathers opted for a Republic rather than a Democracy The masses can not be trusted to use their brains It feels like this also applies to the ZH masses at times Mon sheikurbootie Really You think for a nanosecond that ANY University is smarter or has more researchers than the government Not a chance I have several University Prof friends in the computer research field and they couldnt figure out how to change a light bulb I worked in government and WITNESSED st hand the magic of satellite handheld phones nearly ten years before the first cell phone went public The government and MIC is light years ahead of any retarded University httpswwwwashingtonpostcomworldnationalsecurityjohnshopkinsres from the article This specific flaw in Apples iMessage platform probably would not have helped the FBI pull data from an iPhone recovered in Decembers San Bernardino Calif terrorist attack but it shatters the notion that strong commercial encryption has left no opening for law enforcement and hackers said Matthew D Green a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University who led the research team Mon rockmanlinux Mon cougar_w That was my thinking from the start FBI probably already had what they wanted days ago That said I dont see what all it buys AAPL except cover They get to say they had nothing to do with it but the episode still ruins their claim of security The only actors anyone cares about are the FBI NSA and the other TLAs And turns out those guys can get in That kinda ruins the whole story for anyone who actuallly follows this kind of thing Not that any of us bought Apples claim in the first place Backdoors are easy hard to detect and cheap Apple annouces a secure phone initiative and hours later gets a call from a nice person at the FBI No fuss no muss Mon monad They get to present what they already had without explaining where they got it Now and in the future make up anything they want Election Election Election Selection Did Apple fold quietly behind the scenes Is this how both sides save face with neither side appearing to have given an inch on their defense or persecution of personal liberty Withdrawal of the legal action is based upon the public announcement that the phone security has been hacked That removes one of the reasons that some have used to justify the purchase The Apple defense of security was really all for show anyway Anything sent or received from the phone was in a NSA file anyway httparstechnicacomsecurityjohnmcafeebetterpreparetoea he outlined the real technique that hed use to crack the phone and it turns out to be a super convenient half hour job McAfee only said itd take three weeks because he didnt want to have to eat his shoe if a cold or flu interrupted him Remember when it wasnt patriotic to oppose the Patriot Act Whos idea what that anyway Did anybody support the patriot act Mon underman Mon new game and you believe they werent going to be spying anyway and who is watching over these ultra high security secret operations if you or I knew half of what our government wasis doing we would be appalled Mon roadhazard Mon flaunt This is one thing people never seem to get through their thick skulls the reason you dont give govt the benefit of the doubt is because you never know when a psycho like Obama will be in charge Even today people say things like well Im glad they have body scanners in the aiport because SECURITY But the cognitive dissonance is alarming when the very same person acknowledges that the US government is purposely leaving the southern border unsecured and allowing criminals and illegal scum to run rampant inside our borders So you trust them with xray body scanners theyre safe really trust us when theyre not even taking basic measures to secure the borders Carry on Mon Liberty Mon freedom Mon freedom Mon I need more asshats Mon me or you Apple is not protecting nobody privacy all this is a great show to make the sheep believe that iPhones are secure if you see all this came after report of iPhones sales crashing all over the world Mon me or you Mon Budnacho Tue Element Face it the suspicious and skeptical have been largely bredout in the West already Theres just the odd throwback who are marginalized immediately now The global system is in the last phases of wiping its bum of nonconformist conception and behavior The ME psychos are putting up a feeble cultural resistance but are in the process of being marginalized sanitized or else destroyed as well stcentury conformity and consensus is all the rage now Just look at any social media or any public institution or private for profit institution school or media outlet It is as mandatorily conformist as Catholicism was in the th century Only now its for everyone And whoever is not in the consensus is the enemy of reason against sanity and by the redefinition an enemy an extremist an enemy of the State As if the State were more important than people as they are and have come to be largely because of the actions of States As far as the state is concerned they can just use the language of extremism poliitical speeches and media to wipe out nonconformists and paint them as evil doers They did the same thing in Queensland over the past couple of years about motorbike riders who belong to a motorbike riders club They were all branded bikie clubs lumped together and ascribed effective presumed criminal status The QLD Government actually removed the freedom to associate for ordinary bike riders a recognised basic human right removed by a legislative democratic parliamentry vote This model will be applied everywhere because they basically got away with doing it the politicians and police simply beatup this evil bikie club boggieman out of all proportion and the public or rather the mass media played it up and cheered them on all the way The people just just let them do it They did almost nothing The politician who got away with it the Premier did so because there are actually bike clubs which are criminal organizations or have significant criminality in them just like every other group of humans on earth Guilt be mere association and manufactured prejudice became normalized Why Because bikies are risktaking nonconformists who just might be bad people They look all rough and tough so they must be bad people who will do every one home Except most of them are just exmilitary people who like to riding bikes Gee maybe its the personality type that the military selects that has something to do with that fact So what to do Oh I know lets treat them like criminals whether they are or not And that is what our treacherous government is doing and is going to do They will try this same trick wherever they want to This is StatePower creation and that power is to eliminate any nonconformist view that challenges popular prejudice and all those prejudices are being tailored and manufactured to order by political scumbags becoming leaders cronies and especially by our unethical senior police civil leaders They are betraying us all as are the Parliaments media and Courts Those are the real extremists those are the real threat to society and to the basic legitimacy of laws governments and social order Those are the real domestic enemies And this is not even the thinend of the wedge any longer this is the thickend of the wedge going through and no one even blinks they dare not say no They may get unLiked on some bullshit gauge of what really matters and their non conformity logged and autoclassified Do NOT follow
