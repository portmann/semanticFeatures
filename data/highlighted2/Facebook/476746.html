class='textDiv'>InstaStory Looks Like A Flop For Instagram <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Instagram copied Snapchats story feature in what I am calling InstaStory The product is a flop as users are using it to promote their Snapchat account In my article Instagram Sees Posts Slowing I discussed why Instagram was losing out to Snapchat Private CHAT To summarize Snapchat is the equivalent of a doodle pad while Instagram NASDAQ FB is like a resume You add to a doodle pad without thinking while you dont change your resume unless something important happened in your career Because of this use case Snapchat has more content uploaded to it Instagram is aware of this problem In order to combat this problem they did the unthinkable Instagram attempted to copy Snapchat with the mindset if you cant beat them join them The one thing that I am now certain of with this launch is Snapchat is causing a decrease posting on Instagram There were some stats on this topic This move supports their findings If you dont use Snapchat every day Ill clarify the important points of what happened before we get into what this change means for Snapchat and Instagram Snapchat started as a messaging app but now messaging is a secondary feature The main differentiating feature Snapchat has is the ability to post videos and pictures to a story which deletes every hours There are no likes and comments so theres no judgment The only feedback you get is who viewed your story Instagram decided to take this story feature and put it on top of the newsfeed There are some small differences but the only thing I noticed was the lack of lens filters I consider lens filters to be the best part of Snapchat because they encourage you to post even if you arent doing anything interesting Snapchat monetizes this feature by allowing firms to sponsor filters which gets users to willingly post ads on their story because they are so engaging It takes a lot more effort to create a filter than a tweet or a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>post but it has shown to be worth it from the initial results I wouldnt go as far as saying this InstaStory my name for it feature will be dead on arrival like Facebooks previous failed attempts at copying Snapchat only because it doesnt have filters To me it shows that Instagram doesnt understand why users are on Snapchat Snapchat will always understand their users better than Instagram simply because it was the original creator of the product That being said the reason why InstaStory isnt dead on arrival because of the lack of lenses is because Im pretty certain Instagram is working on creating them I cant see why it wouldnt just go through with a complete copy of Snapchat The reasoning behind why Instagram would go through with this initiative is the platform has a structural problem with posting It doesnt want to necessarily create a better mouse trap than what Snapchat has It wants to provide a home for users to post more content It wants to increase posting incrementally without making a change to the news feed This would be the same as if Twitter NYSE TWTR provided a separate part of the app to house long form content This longer form blog wouldnt rival the top blog sites but it could provide an increase in posting For those who have huge following on Instagram but not on Snapchat this is a great alternative Instagram has suggested this as a reason for the InstaStory feature There is no way for me to compare the following of various celebrities on Instagram to Snapchat because Snapchat follower counts arent public information However I would say Instagram is a few years too late as users with Snapchat probably have already built up a following From my personal experience my Snapchat friends are more engaged than my Instagram followers This new InstaStory feature can reengage followers Its too early to tell because the feature is going to get heavy usage in the first few days after it is launched because of curiosity with the product The key will be if users keep engaging with the product over time While Instagram wants users to incrementally increase their posting on the app its not a lock to actually happen Firstly users werent exactly clamoring for another version of Snapchat as Snapchat works just fine In the previous analogy I described Twitter expanding the character count on a separate part of the app If you remember a few months ago when this was mentioned as a possibility by Jack Dorsey it was rejected by users There is a risk that users on Instagram switch from posting on the newsfeed to the InstaStory If original posting decreases more on newsfeed than it would relegate Instagram as a Snapchat knockoff My initial evidence based on the users Ive spoken to is the feature is not something theyre satisfied with Sometimes users like to complain about a new feature on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but then continue using it anyway Therefore initial gripes arent a death knell However what I did found shocking was almost all my friends posting on InstaStory uploaded a picture telling their followers to add them on Snapchat including their username I would call that a major backfire as Instagrams attempt to compete with Snapchat actually helped Snapchat A big problem with InstaStory is how blatant of a copy it is of Snapchat Its not like when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>put trending topics in the corner on the desktop This is so obvious that users are noticing and they arent liking it As you can see from the App Store users are not pleased with the new update One reviewer said it best I like both but I dont want Snapchat to be Instagram and I dont want Instagram to be Snapchat Users also seem to be disappointed with the previous update to the app where the chronological order of newsfeed was replaced by an algorithm This makes the InstaSttory update even more despised because it makes it seem like Instagram is trending in the wrong direction To reinforce my previous point a reviewer wrote The new stories is a direct stab at Snapchat but an epic flop that no one uses except to shoutout their Snapchat This update is great news for Snapchat as users are being encouraged by their Instagram friends to share their Snapchat username on Instagram It is better marketing for Snapchat than the company could have done itself Anytime Instagram alienates its users it is a big win for Snapchat as it makes them spend less time on the app Instagram has already lost out to Snapchat as the favorite social media app among teens but this may accelerate its downfall The update is a negative for Instagram The fact that it was done shows how the company lacks innovation Like I said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been able to copy some Twitter features However they were small changes Its not as if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>decided to institute a character limit That would obviously be a bad idea because it would change the makeup of the network Just as I am betting Instagram is going to add new lenses I am pretty sure the company will not be eliminating Instastory unless the results are disastrous At that point it would be too late to salvage the problems it caused Instagram was Facebooks connection with younger users as the main app is more popular with the older generation Now that it is losing popularity it will be harder for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to convert young people into users on the main app This cant come as shock to investors Did anyone think that an industry rife with innovation and change would be easy to compete in As I mentioned in my last article Periscope is now losing out to Lively in the live streaming category If Lively continues its success it can take away potential young viewers who would be watching <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it
