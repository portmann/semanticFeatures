class='textDiv'>Snapchat Is Overhyped Snapchat PrivateCHAT Seeking Alpha Snapchat cannot monetize the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can because it cant target ads Twitter is the better comparison Snapchat will actually have even less targeting than Twitter This article is going to be a combination of the past two social media articles on the Scout account this time with a focus on Snapchat Private CHAT The point made in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB article was that social media is in competition with other websitesapps such as messengers news websites and entertainment Snapchat does have a messenger built into its app but users are now using the story feature more Even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which is the king of monetizing usage hasnt been able to monetize WhatsApp and Messenger to the level of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself The reasoning is simple Ads cannot be targeted to users unless the app reads messages to see what the conversation is about That would make users uncomfortable and shun the app so its not a viable business operation The point made in the Twitter NYSE TWTR article was that Twitter is not profitable because it cannot target ads the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can If Twitter isnt profitable at this point when will it be profitable It needs to cut costs and figure out better targeting methods like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has done Snapchat has both problems listed above Snapchat existing in the social media space has taken share from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but the inherent concept that social media usage will grow forever and never decline is flawed As I showed in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>article there was a total of minutes spent less on social media in America in Q compared to Q UK usage is considered a leading indicator for future trends in social media Usage on Snapchat in the UK fell from minutes per day to minutes Current installs also declined for Snapchat in most markets The side metric on the graph below is the percentage of Android smartphone users with Snapchat installed on their phone In the UK the percentage of smartphone users with Snapchat on their phone fell from to Snapchat is in a similar position to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as Id reckon very few users are on Snapchat specifically to check the news This means original sharing is the glue that keeps users coming back to the app Users just happen to be on the app so they tap on various functions such as news and entertainment Showing additional content to users represents Snapchats goal to incrementally increase usage and to become more relevant as sending selfies to your friends isnt exactly a pivotal part of society The point of Twitter having less ability to monetize users is even more prevalent for Snapchat Snapchat has no ability to find out information about users in order to target ads to them Even worse Snapchat doesnt have a place for advertisers to put links in order to direct them to their websites to spend money The funnel doesnt exist Also a conversation about the product cannot occur as there is no comment section It doesnt take an expert to figure out a disappearing ad is simply not that valuable to firms There are also sponsored lenses which are a unique way to capture users attention This cannot be scaled as it is a difficult process to create a lense as firms cant onboard marketing projects used on other platforms Also only one or two can be shown at a time The more sponsored lenses there are the less each is worth Snapchat has even tried charging for its service such as for different lenses but it stopped doing so as it didnt work since other social media apps are completely free To me this shows the firm is having trouble monetizing Snapchat may be used for more time than Twitter but its monetization challenges are even more difficult You can see the charts of both Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>below on the Scout Finance app <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is up in the past months and Twitter is down Based on this inability to target users with advertising I see Snapchat as following the trajectory of Twitter instead of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Snapchat is currently being valued at billion in the private market The company is projecting revenues of million in and million to billion in If it does hit its lofty expectations its valuation will grow Snapchat is a story stock so if it does go public in then Id expect the valuation to rise further at the IPO price We dont know the specifics of Snapchats bottom line until it files with the SEC but judging by the type of business it is in Id expect the valuations to be absurd Snapchat is closer to Twitter than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in terms of monetization potential Even if Snapchat can grow its total users and time spent to reach the heights of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it will never be as profitable When the hype surrounding the company fades after the IPO a realistic valuation will take hold sending the stock lower I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Short Ideas Technology Editors Picks SA Submit </div></body></html>
