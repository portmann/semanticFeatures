establish if Android will build enough of a usage advantage it might challenge iOS and Apple for development resources In early I wrote an article titled Apple More Data On The iOSAndroid Struggle In that article I covered how Android was still gaining on iOS in many different metrics In most of these metrics Android was still behind iOS and the then recentlylaunched iPhone gave people hope that Apple NASDAQ AAPL could keep Android gains in check This article tries to provide an update on what was discussed at the time and see how things evolved in the following months When I wrote my previous article Apple had just launched the iPhone to great success The iPhone interrupted Androids massive market share gain due to large pentup demand for an iPhone with a larger display Today we can see how things evolved since the iPhone launch What we observe is something along the following lines Source IDC I II III IV V As we can see the iPhone allowed Apple to reverse the market share loss for the entire year However its market share gains have been eroding and by Q or Q they seem likely to stagnate again The yearonyear comparisons are needed because Apples share is seasonal usually peaking in the quarter after the launch of new models In my previous article we saw how Android had caught up with iOS in web usage This is obviously driven by international gains How have things evolved since then with the iPhone launch This validates my thesis from the previous article that Android has become much more usable so Androids massive share led to web usage gains even though Apple narrowed its market share deficit This also is set to continue especially as Apples market share gains stagnate One item where Apple still had a lead when I wrote my previous article was in ecommerce usage as measured by IBM It should be noted that these studies by IBM refer to the US market only And in the US market Apple still leads the smartphone wars Source IBM Commerce US Retail Black Friday Report What we see here is that Androids gains stagnated in what regards mobile usage for ecommerce in the US but they continued in regard to actual sales This in part was due to Android also gaining in terms of average order value As I said this impacts the US market where Apple is particularly strong and in the context of the iPhone Hence the ability to still keep Android in check in terms of usage for ecommerce though with a further erosion in relative online sales With Apples market share stagnation predicted for H I expect Android to erode Apples advantage further in this regard as well This also will be helped by a new generation of Android devices which Will gain from Qualcomms Snapdragon as well as competing lowerpriced offerings from Huawei and MediaTek This will be in stark contrast to where Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM stumbled with the Snapdragon leaving Samsung OTCSSNLF as the only supplier with a modern SoC Samsung pushing the envelope in design starting with the Galaxy S which will force other Android smartphone makers to respond in kind This will make the entire Android flagship space more competitive design wise Also Samsung seems likely to mend its hand regarding the microSD card capability on the Samsung S Will gain from entering the market at a lower price point right at launch This already is seen in Motorolas latest flagship as well as the two new Nexus Phones This is likely to spread to others in the space instead of firstly trying to match Apple on price A similar effect took place in the tablet space and marked the start of the iPads stagnation The trends which were in place when I published my previous article on the AndroidiOS struggle remain in place Apple retook some global smartphone market share from Android with the launch of the iPhone but those gains are already stagnating again This together with my prediction that the iPhone should start shrinking in Q Q FY for Apple leads me to believe that pretty soon Apple will be losing share again The trend regarding actual web usage has now turned powerfully in Androids favor with Androids share now being x larger than iOS share This large relative loss for Apple is happening mostly outside the US so it might not be immediately evident for investors but its a clear reality This change is borne both of Androids massive lead in overall market share and the fact that Android is increasingly usable even in low to midend phones so the overall market share is being turned into an usage advantage Over time if Android gets enough of a usage advantage this will turn into more development resources being allocated to Android which could replicate the PCMac problem for Apple This can start being seen for businesses whose main priority is reach instead of ultimate buying power An example here would be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which already has specialized apps just for Android In the US Apple still leads in ecommerce usage but the lead continues to shrink even with the iPhone s success The iPhone s seems unlikely to reverse that trend This particular risk remains a reality for Apple Indeed its likely that Apple stock will underperform over the next six months due to the iPhone likely stagnating or shrinking over the next six months We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
