class='textDiv'>The Monetization Of WhatsApp Will Catalyze Facebooks Stock <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha WhatsApp has a great potential for monetization over the long term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will likely find effective ways to monetize WhatsApp <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB took a lot of criticism when it purchased WhatsApp for billion last year Obviously the current per year subscription for the app will not provide a good return on investment However I think that WhatsApp will prove to be a wise investment over the long term for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as the company finds an effective way to generate more revenue from it I also think that Facebooks stock will make significant moves higher when the monetization plan is implemented Although it is not yet clear how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>plans on monetizing WhatsApp there are a few strategies that could work Ads could work if they are not overdone For example the st message at the top of the WhatsApp screen could be used for ads similar to the way Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO places ads that appear to be new email messages at the top of users email pages Or the company could randomly place ads in between messages similar to the way they appear in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>news feed Consumers are used to ads on most websites so if done properly these options could be effective After all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>did effectively monetize the website bearing the companys name and the company is highly profitable as a result However if users perceive ads to be intrusive on WhatsApp then it could cause some users to use another app Ads may not be the direction that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to take for WhatsApp monetization As an alternative <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could implement fees similar to how Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Skype does Skype charges fees for making calls or texting to mobile or landline phones Skype earns revenue of about billion annually with million users So we can see with a simple quantitative analysis that WhatsApps million MAUs monthly active users could translate into about billion of annual revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>if a similar monetization strategy was implemented This would pay off Facebooks investment in WhatsApp in four years This could be the path that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>takes if the company determines that ads would be too intrusive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could also implement both ads and charge fees for certain services This would provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with multiple sources of revenue from WhatsApp However I doubt that the company would implement both simultaneously That would probably be too much change all at once for WhatsApps users and cause a negative perception for the app The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>team is expert at processing and analyzing user data and using it for advertisers to implement targeted marketing strategies So I think it is likely that the company will be successful in leveraging and applying that strength to WhatsApp in some form Currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>expressed that it is more interested in growing the WhatsApp user base over rushing to monetize it So by building up the users which is likely to exceed billion MAUs possibly as early as the first half of WhatsApp will have a significant amount of users for monetization WhatsApp added million new users over the past months so if it can add another million over the next months the billion mark will be exceeded in Q I am confident that with Facebooks expertise in processing user data that the company will be successful in monetizing WhatsApp and making it a significant longterm source of income Although it is not clear exactly when the monetization of WhatsApp will take place I would estimate that it will take place within the next years perhaps as early as next year So investors can think of WhatsApp as a strong potential revenue producer in Facebooks pipeline similar to how a potential blockbuster drug may look in a biotechs pipeline Blockbusters produce at least billion in revenue for biotech companies I would expect WhatsApp to produce significantly more than billion in revenue per year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The company could most likely make billion per year just by implementing a Skypestyle fee for services as I mentioned earlier That is like having blockbuster drugs in the pipeline I know that there has been a debate on whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is overvalued or not Some balk at the trailing PE of or the forward PE of without taking a longerterm approach Looking at the trailing PE is looking in the past so I dont place much weight on that Although the forward PE is a better measure of valuation than the trailing PE it is limited since it only measures the current stock price against next years earnings Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has WhatsApp and Oculus in the pipeline for future monetization I would rather take a longerterm view of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as an investment One quick way to evaluate Facebooks valuation for the long term is to look at its PE against its year expected growth The companys PEG of shows that the stock is fairly valued With the PEG at the midpoint between and the stock is priced reasonably for its expected year annual earnings growth of To confirm Facebooks fair valuation I performed an updated discounted cash flow analysis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was left with billion in free cash flow FCF in even after spending billion in CapEx The company increased its FCF by last year over The companys FCF can be used for expanding the business or for share buybacks without adding to debt so I place a high weight on a companys ability to grow FCF Using Facebooks WACC of as the discount rate and estimating FCF growth of for the next five years growth for years and annually thereafter the stock has an intrinsic value of about The current price is so this confirms my thesis that the stock is fairly valued With a fair valuation Facebooks stock is likely to continue trending higher as the companys revenue and earnings continue to increase For the near term before WhatsApp is monetized the stock is likely to increase approximately in line with earnings growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is expected to increase EPS at this year and next year So I think the stock can reasonably rise about annually over the next years If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>significantly exceeds estimates the results could be higher I also think that when the announcement of Facebooks plan to monetize WhatsApp takes place that the stock will make a significant move higher I think it is wise to own the stock before that announcement takes place Source The Monetization Of WhatsApp Will Catalyze Facebooks Stock Disclosure The author is long FB
