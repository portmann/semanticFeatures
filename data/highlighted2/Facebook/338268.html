asking a judge to support Apple Inc AAPLO in its encryption battle with the US government sources familiar with the companies plans said The effort is a rare display of unity and support for the iPhone maker from companies which are competitors in many areas and shows the breadth of Silicon Valleys opposition to the governments antiencryption effort The fight between Apple and the government became public last month when the US Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained a court order requiring Apple to write new software and take other measures to disable passcode protection and allow access to an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters in December Apple has pushed back arguing that such a move would set a dangerous precedent and threaten customer security The clash has intensified a longrunning debate over how much law enforcement and intelligence officials should be able to monitor digital communications The group of tech companies plans to file what is known as an amicus brief a form of comment from outside groups common in complex cases to the Riverside California federal judge Sheri Pym She will rule on Apples appeal of a court order that would force it to create software to unlock the iPhone The companies will contest government arguments that the All Writs Act a broad law that enables judges to require actions necessary to enforce their own orders compels Apple to comply with its request In their joint brief the tech companies will say that Congress passed the All Writs Act before the invention of the light bulb and that it goes too far to contend that the law can be used to force engineers to disable security protections according to a source familiar with their arguments Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook

factions Briefs are also expected in support of the government Stephen Larson a former federal judge told Reuters last week that he is working on a brief with victims of the San Bernardino shooting

Young senior vice president and general manager for Intel Security Group We believe that tech companies need to have the ability to build and design their products as needed and that means that we

Farook and Malik were later killed in a shootout with police and the FBI said it wants to read the data on Farooks phone to investigate any links with militant groups Earlier this week a Brooklyn
