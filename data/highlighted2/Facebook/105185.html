<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is turning out a lot of new features for videos which are set to challenge YouTubes number one position Video creators will get a split of the ad revenue generated the same as on YouTube Facebooks new Suggested Video feature will weave video content into newsfeeds and provide related videos that may be of interest to the user based on data analytics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is kicking its video service into high gear You can feel it by just trying to keep up with all the new feature updates Now that video views on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>went from billion to billion within just one quarter it needs to harness that power and leverage it to drive earnings Thats exactly why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>developers are working overtime to attract original content publishers and businesses to make <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>their first choice for digital ads To me <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a couple of challenges to take the video crown from Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube yet it also has the tools to do so Right now one of YouTubes best points is that it is synonymous with video That just comes with the territory after being the worlds premiere video upload platform for years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may have the title of biggest social media platform on Earth but if you want videos thats not your first choice to head to Its an active process to look for videos on YouTube For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>its passive What is going to change that up for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the plan to add a search engine within the platform Just having videos and ads in the newsfeed doesnt mean theyll be watched at all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also has to add that active dimension that YouTube has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users should be able to do a word search and turn up relevant matches within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as well as on external sites as long as they stay within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to do it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is doing a limited trial of a search feature currently under its add a link feature The company needs to expand it as soon as possible especially with all the new video content expected to come to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>from the new products page feature which allows publishers businesses and advertisers to create a view space for content and products Ad revenues for video creators and uploaders is another issue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>If the potential for making money isnt as good as on YouTube then <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may not be able to dislodge its crown Fortunately the company is tackling this situation with its newly announced revenue split format <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will share the ad revenue generated from its suggested videos feature in the newsfeed on a basis In my view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is being smart and not pretentious by basically adopting YouTubes revenue sharing percentage right from the start It shows management knows how important it is to match or beat Google and isnt assuming that video providers will post content just because its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>If video uploaders dont see a decent return on investment the changeover from YouTube will be slow or simply split between the two platforms In the background of all this activity is the matter of user number growth among Facebooks US and Canada viewers slowing down From Q to Q that regional groups daily active user DAU numbers rose to million Over the following year to Q it grew to million I dont expect to get a good reading out of just two years of data but I will be watching it closely over this fiscal year to see if the tick down is really indicative of a downtrend Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has so many more users in other regions Its just that the US and Canada segment has the largest average revenue by geography A potential user growth slowdown is more significant to total revenue Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Q earnings presentation Again <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is meeting that challenge with new page and video features The new Suggested Videos will appear in user newsfeeds but it wont be the average banner ad fare that users would quickly spot and ignore With data analytics Facebooks algorithms will match up the video content with user preferences or recent activities In salesmans terms its like warm or even hot calling rather than cold calling Viewers will be more inclined to click on items they are interested in and that could generate more ad and ecommerce revenues for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shows off its smarts once more by not trying to show a whole bunch of videos or ads from the start That would either put off users or intimidate them with too much choice What happens is one video or ad content appears in the newsfeed that you might be at least halfway interested in Once selected you are then shown that video plus a group of other related videos Its akin to the collage of related videos you see at the end of a YouTube video just at the beginning I would assume that after seeing the video you intended to watch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will supply a comparable list of other videos Overall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is putting a lot of thought into what features are coming out now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>critics are wondering when the company is going to start monetizing Messenger WhatsApp and Instagram but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is concentrating on its flagship Whatever knowledge and experience the company gets from these changes will be translated over to the smaller platforms in due time Im happy with Facebooks progress and think the stock story is getting better The stock is worth the current premium if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stays focused on the ad revenue generation The more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has original content in products events and videos the more viewers will come If the viewers come then mission accomplished Source <span
