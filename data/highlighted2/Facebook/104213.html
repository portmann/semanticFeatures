(Facebook: Uncertainty) </span>Video ad tech platform LiveRail was acquired last summer .Remember folks, Youtube has never made a profit either, and is already a far superior video delivery service than FB will ever be.And starting very soon all FB and GOOG datamining will be banned or severely restricted on Apple's IOS, so that will immediately cut by 30%+ all revenues for both companies.The market has not priced this in yet but will be sooner or later.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>And right now FB is so overvalued it appears to be the perfect BIG SHORT.
