joining us for the first afternoon session I am Dave Barden Bank of America Merrill Telecom Analyst based in New York And with me very pleased to have with us in London Fran Shammo the Chief Financial Officer of Verizon Thanks Fran for making the trip appreciated And my the format I think well do a little kind of fireside chat here to startoff and lets get to maybe some QA from the guests towards the end and hopefully wrap up it in about minutes or so I guess its an opportunity Fran I guess for us to kind of maybe really checkin here I think at the end of the first quarter call you guys flagged that the function of the strike that was ongoing at the time that you would want to maybe check in later in the quarter and kind of give people an update as to what might have been going on obviously in the interval weve seen a resolution that it appears to be a resolution awaiting ratification along those lines And so I wanted to kind of duly make that check in and see where we stand with the unions and kind of what you saw happen over the course of the quarter and any other color you can share Sure Well thanks Hello everyone First let me just reference our forwardlooking statements thats on our website and in front of you today So lets just start out with coming out of the first quarter Obviously we had about of our wireline employees who went on strike We have concluded that negotiation It was a sixweek long strike And so when we look at the quarter we are looking at potentially a to impact to the earnings for the quarter related to that strike and why is that Its really twofold Number one obviously we have to get management to go out We pay a lot of overtime to our management employees to cover for the strike We also have to hire a lot of contractors that we then have to pay because we didnt fulfilled the contract with them for the duration that we had So there is a combination of that and then the other thing that we find too during the strike is most of our management employees work on repair and maintenance type So we dont do much installation and if you think about accounting rules when you do an installation on FIOS you actually get to capitalize the labor as part of that installation While if you are only working on repair and maintenance jobs and not doing installation then you have a shift between capital to expense So some of the pressure that we are seeing in the PL is that shift and what youll see is wireline capital will actually come down in the second quarter So the cash piece of that is neutral to us but for the PL side youll see about to impact to the bottomline for the quarter As far as the contract goes I will talk more about the contract and some of the parameters around the contract on the second quarter call and the reason I wont do it right now is because the represented force has not ratified the contract which means they have not accepted the terms yet So we cant really talk about it until they ratify The ratification is scheduled for June So well have more to say about that on the second quarter call David All right maybe a couple quick followups on that I guess number one could you kind of talk about any impacts that maybe measurable on kind of the broadband the FIOS the wireless add side as it kind of happened in the quarter Sure So on the wireless side of the half there really hasnt you really wont see any impact on the wireless side of the half So it will be a normal quarter for wireless As far as adds on wireline goes I said we spent most of our times on repairs and maintenance So the actual net adds of wireline will be negative for the quarter Now obviously our employees are back to work where we are doing installations here in the month of June So I dont actually know the exact number that well end in the quarter because now we are in catchup mode because we did have a pipeline build during the strike Its a matter of how much we can get to that pipeline but I would expect TV and broadband to be negative for the quarter And I think I think that there was a question as to how long the strike lasted that it might have an impact on some of the legacy contractual expectations for healthcare contributions and other things that would be a benefit to the second half of the year Is there any risk to that now Is that put that into a degree assuming ratification If we get it ratified Ill talk more about that on the second quarter but that has been put to that if the ratification fall through go through Got it So really what maybe if we were kind of thinking I know we are going to talk about the full year at the quarter but we were trying to kind of wrap our heads around it so maybe a nickel in the second quarter plus whatever kind of residual impact there is from that lag in installs in the second quarter rolling into Q but it sounds contained in general Yes its contained but the to will flow to the end of the year We are not going to make that to up at this point So I would just roll that through And I know that a lot of people out there speaking with you at the conference were kind of asking the question about what lets just ignore the new contract for a second but in terms of growth I think that youve been talking that there would be more normal growth rate in which I think has been mid to highsingledigits kind of conversation Does this is there anything about this exercise materially alter that outlook No I mean when we talk about in our outlook I mean Ive referenced to the fact that I believe we will get back to a GDP type growth company on the topline and I know Ive gotten a lot of questions as to well how why do you think that way Fran Well some of this is just pure math I mean if you look at the Verizon wireless side of the equation Verizon wireless service revenue is under pressure because of the switch from the subsidy model to the unsubsidized model So service revenue is getting compressed here as we shift to equipment revenue Coming out of the first quarter that was decline and weve said that as soon as we hit of our customers on that unsubsidized pricing model which is coming out of the first quarter was As we get to and start to turn the corner on that the service revenue will also start to turn So you are going to go from something less than that and the decline will lessen and as we do our math forecast by fourth quarter of well actually be back to accretion in service revenues So pure math would show there is going to be a lot less headwind in than there was in plus you have the comps And then when you roll in some of the other things that weve been working on like AOL Go Verizon Digital Media services Telematics they start to gain more momentum in So thats what makes me comfortable to say GDP type growth Then from a bottomline perspective what we said is the last two years weve had unusual transactions Vodafone contributed a onetime benefit to earnings per share So as you roll through the accounting benefit of the EIP plan when you get to you get back to more of a equalized growth rate for the bottomline and I am not disclosing what that is You can go back in time and look at Verizons normal growth rates and thats what the box will be put in Got it So I guess another kind of key topic related to the things something you were talking about on EIP is there is a we were talking to ATT about that this morning too as kind of what expectations are for the handset cycle in We saw a very very low upgrade rate in the first quarter Its unclear whether thats because people are choosing to keep their phones longer or because they are waiting to maybe make an upgrade in the back part of the year and so there is this question as to whether will look more like the iPhone upgrade cycle or the iPhone s upgrade cycle Can you give us any color in terms of what your expectations are on that Yes so its actually too early to tell exactly what the trend represents I mean we saw a very similar trend back in the first quarter of where upgrades really slowed and its because people have been trained that there is an upgrade cycle every two years coming out of Apple So we are coming up to that two year cycle at the end of this year Its going to depend on what that that device looks like I have no idea what that looks like So that will drive some of the behavior but the other thing that we dont know is that the slowdown happened because people are expecting another upgrade or this slowdown happened because this EIP thing has been in the makes now for two to three years and our people now saying oh I got a to reduction in my bill I am going to keep the same phone and just pay the service pricing at the reduced rate I cant answer that question because our first generation of EIP just matured at the first quarter So I need some time to see what the trend is on the upgrade cycle My personal view is that I think that the upgrade will look more like than it did in for a bunch of different reasons And keep in mind though that the volume of upgrade now going into the future because of the installment plan in EIP whatever you want to call it there is less impact In the old days when volume went up profits went down Thats going to be more equalized now because you dont have that huge subsidy that you are taking in a high volume quarter So again I would expect the PL to look more like than it did in as the EIP model continues to mature Got it And just on the as you say the maturation of the EIP business I think that youve publicly talked about looking at it looking at financing of handsets or factoring of handsets or financing handsets in new ways is there any update on kind of how thats unfolding Yes so Ive said the last couple of times publicly that we have been looking at for over a year now alternatives to really looking at ways to finance the handsets because I dont want to be in the finance business So weve looked at we have been securitizing through our membership banks on an offbalance sheet type basis So strictly of securitization a couple things with that one that cash then when we securitize which is about billion a quarter flows through cash flow from operations But its generally at a little bit higher cost and its also kind of degrades our rating because the rating industries take that securitization and add it back to our unsecured debt So one of the things that we have been looking at is what if we convert it to the assetbacked security market which is a public market and also using banks to be in onbalance sheet would be more like the ABS type instrument Weve been working with the rating agencies over the last year on how they would view us being more of a assetbacked security in securing these investments and if youve looked at it both SP and Fitch have recently written up that they will treat the industry if you will more of a captive on this type of assetbacked security That actually gives us a benefit in our ratings from a debt perspective because this now wont be added to my unsecured debt It will be treated as a separate pool of financing shortterm assetbacked security debt similar to the auto industry and so forth So there is a benefit from a borrowing perspective because a lot of this will be rated Triple A So there is a benefit to my borrowing cost and it also gives me a rating benefit Now one thing you should be aware of for the second quarter is I will not be securitizing anything in the second quarter on the offbalance sheet method So you will see about a billion swing in cash flow from operations because I am not going to securitize via the old instrument What youll see then though is going into the third quarter so we have a little bit of a timing issue here going into the third quarter youll see us go out to the public market to start financing the old securitization in on the onbalance sheet method So you are going to see this geographychanging cash flow because this will now be included in financing rather than cash flow from operations So you will see a geography change for us as we build up the public market versus the offbalance sheet weeding that off you will continue to see that for about the next year as we move into a full fledged assetbacked security model and then cash flow from operations again will equalize out and get back to a normal view So well talk more about this on the second quarter but we will be changing the way we finance these receivables And what is the kind of cost differential on a couple billion dollars of quarterly financing that you are getting Well Ill wait till we do that and then we can youll be able to see that I am not going to get into the actual cost differential But there is a cost benefit to using the assetbacked security market but its a beneficial because of the highquality of our base and some of this will be rated as Triple S So there is a cost benefit there rather than using offbalance securitization with the banks So its not just that whatll happen it would take this kind of securitization out of the unsecured basket and bring overall leverage down that should probably give us the benefit for the totality of the debt but there is actual cost benefit for the ABS market versus the securitized bank market today That is correct And whats your kind of visibility that the ABS market for these receivables is big enough to accommodate your needs Yes I mean weve done a lot of work I mean Scott Krohn here is in this room with me as the Treasurer and he has done some road shows with individuals and investors who would buy those type of security and from a company like Verizon and the quality of these receivables there is demand out there for this And do you think that thats maybe uniquely the purview of Verizon to kind of develop this market Maybe other you would say that some other handset receivables arent going to make the cut Well I mean I am certainly not developing the market The audio industry has been in this market for years So this is a pretty steady market I mean yes I mean for our industry this is new for the industry but this market has been out there for years So again well talk a lot more about this once we go public with the instrument youll be able to see it and we can talk more about that Got it And so just another kind of more asset and cash flow related to that and weve heard that there continues to be pretty healthy activity in the datacenter sales market We just had a pretty healthy multiple from the Equinix sale the Digital Realty at times CenturyLink has there assets up for sales we heard and they seem to be pretty positive about the activity level around it Its been quiet from Verizon for a little while on this issue I was wondering could you give us an update on that one too Well we are progressing Part of our slowdown was that a lot of the buyers wanted to see financial statements by datacenter and obviously at a company our size we dont keep financial statements by datacenter So we had to go back and put some financials together for the investors to see exactly by datacenter what the revenue and costs were and commitments and so forth So we worked through that and so I would anticipate over the next three months well have more to report whether we move forward or we dont move forward Got it You are going to hate me for doing this but I just have to go ahead and ask you about the Wall Street your article that just came out five minutes ago that everyone just emailed me about to ask you about that we are in the second round now We heard reports about ATT being in the market for maybe these assets What does it mean to Verizon if they win if you win or dont win does it matter to Verizon Look I am not going to talk a lot about the Yahoo process or Yahoo itself But look I mean obviously weve gone on a strategic roadmap here around Mobile First activity while we purchased AOL for the ADTECH platform AOL has brought a lot of viewership to the platforms And you are going to see us over this next three to six months start to a crosspollinate our products utilizing the Verizon Digital Media Services platform and when I say crosspollinate I mean the GO asset more integrated with the AOL asset so that we can broaden the viewership And then really I mean when you get down to it viewership matters because viewership drives advertising dollars which drives the topline revenue So when you think about viewership Yahoo has viewership okay so thats all I am going to say about that Well see whether we move forward or we dont move forward But thats really it doesnt really matter to me whether we do or we dont We have to build upon what we have and build upon what we have is creating more views to our platform to generate advertising dollars to monetize the data feeds that we are talking about and the content that we have So thats really the general purpose of this Great Thank you So I want to use that as a jumping our platform to maybe zoom out a bit and then because I think that in Europe there has been all sorts of quad play models and MVNOs and in the US too weve probably seen a more starkly divided approach to the market There is a national video wireless platform There is some regional video WiFi MVNO platforms that are emerging And then there is Verizon which has basically kind of a nationwide wirelessfirst type of model And I am wondering kind of how you describe the landscape emerging in the US and why the Mobile First strategy is the best one as opposed to having a video like legacy linear video business that goes along with it to private content rights and all those things Yes so lets start at a real macro level So as we look at the world if you will and we look at our ecosystem we look at it that says the world is moving to a broadband wireless world Now I am really when I say world I am really talking the US right So but I do think the world is moving to a wireless world Thats where people are going to consume content thats where people are going to want to consume their data and their TV So when we look at the US broadband wireless thats three to five years thats where people have how people will consume So when you think about the macro and you look at just the broadband piece obviously we believe we have the stateoftheart broadband connection with our FIOS assets But thats East Coastcentric right and well continue to build on that Obviously we said we would build up Boston now because it makes sense from a LTE perspective we can spend million over the next three years to make that more palatable to expand FIOS So we will continue to expand that broadband connection via fiber where it makes financial sense for us The next piece is wireless So when you look at wireless the wireless pie just continues to grow and why does it continue to grow Well if you look at the millennial population how they consume content is mostly via wireless and then secondary broadband If you look at internet of things that is all wireless Now some internet of things will run off of WiFi but for the majority as you look at the mobile world and you think about autonomous cars and you think about smart cities and medical devices that track people I mean thats going to run off of a wireless network And you can already see from the first quarter we launched some in the fourth quarter and we had over a adds and that marketplace is a million vehicles in the United States So the pie is going to grow So if you look at the industry and the pie grows more people are going to want to enter that pie but it doesnt mean that the four carriers who provide wireless service get any less of the pie because the pie grows So the industry itself I believe will continue to grow Now as far as how we play in that we believe that FIOS will continue to penetrate and grow because we are underpenetrated in the marketplaces we have but its a contained footprint Then when we go to wireless why do we think that our wireless strategy is right Well look I mean if you look at the population and how peoples eye just content most people are not going to look at long form content on a mobile device They are going to sit in their house they are going to digest that through a broadband connection linear TV is still here but we all know that linear TV is slowly declining and will continue to slowly decline over time And this population that we are talking about with and below is gradually disconnecting linear TV and going to get their content from other means whether its overthetop or short form content for mobile So when we look at the ecosystem we believe that there is a large opportunity in Mobile First content And so if you look at what weve done with GO it has sports which you consider is long form It has news and then it has its creative content thats bringing some of the viewerships into the view The other thing though too is if you look at what Ive done I am not asking the consumers to subscribe to anything So they are not paying for a subscription Its free to the consumer and you dont need to be a Verizon customer to downloads that often consume that data You can be sitting in your home technically all GO is overthetop and you can be sitting on someone elses wireless network and enjoying that So I am attacking a population that is more than just the Verizon Wireless population I am attacking people who are sitting at home that want to digest that GO content and people who are on mobile that want to digest that mobile content So we believe that the future is I want to fill up the ten times a day that you have minutes free I want you to come to my platform and digest minutes of content from GO And thats really the theory of business case I am not downplaying the overthetop model There are plenty of competitors today whether you look at NetFlix HULU whether it be Apple others who come along the way that want to do overthetop That ecosystem is going to be there but the question is thats going to be so congested and what we are trying to do is create something thats very unique and different than everybody else with linear TV Let me ask just a followup question on it seems like one of the premises of the strategy is that the long form content isnt going to get consumed in the mobile environment because whats getting consumed in the mobile environment right now is short form But are those two things necessarily true Can you not have both with it maybe not potentially be interesting to have both Or are you limited from having both because you dont have million video customers that you can go to the content companies with and fight for those rights and present an option for the customers that they maybe not have today Well I guess I would argue that in most of our long form viewership content is on sports I mean so if you look at NFL you look at the NBA you look at the Mexico Soccer League right now I mean they are watching that for an hour and a hourandahalf and I am not saying they are not watching them on the mobile device they are but its sports So when you think about linear content today whether you are a Comcast subscriber or FIOS subscriber or a Direct TV subscriber you have the ability to take all of that content out of your home today and view it on mobile All you have to do is authenticate back to your subscription in the home And again I come back to the differentiation here is is I am not asking you to subscribe to anything You dont have to pay for a subscription You can just download the APP and watch where you want to watch without authenticating to any other authentication or subscription model And thats really the difference here I am not saying that long form content wont be digested and I am not saying that eventually we may not add long form content But right now out of the gate the concentration is around Mobile First content that short form minutes max to sports is outside of that but its this news and short clip form that we are going after And I know youve talked about maybe sharing more on GO and what its become as a business from a metric standpoint Is there any kind of color you can give us at this stage or is that still down the road So I said that third quarter would be about the timing of to when well start to release some if you want statistics or metrics around the GO platform and maybe some of the AOL assets So well have to mature this as we go but probably in the third quarter and the reason for that is is because weve started out with GO there We had to do some things with the platform That has all now done and if you look at some of the ratings around GO they are starting to go up and it was because of some platform and platform issues Now that we are through that Youll start to see some momentum gain again And we are putting some really creative content out there with some of the complex and Awesomeness TV and Hertz deals that weve done So more to come but end of third quarter is more of the timing that we are looking at Perfect And so so lets kind of take that again and zoom out a little bit which is if what you are saying is right and you believe that kind of where we are moving is a more mobile environment what that does is it suggests that the guys who are in the legacy linear environment want to become more mobile And it just so happens that both of these guys not only have very strong and when I say both I mean the two cable companies have very strong WiFi footprints They also have access to an MVNO of Verizon And a lot of people wonder whether Verizon kind of has written itself into a problem with that relationship because youve enabled the cable companies to get the exact thing that they would need to be able to compete against the thing that you are trying to take away from them How do you put the MVNO with the cable companies in the context Well again I am not going to specifically deal with the agreement itself right But look as I said before this pie grows We went into the MVNO with open eyes when we acquired the spectrum I would do that agreement again today It was a good agreement we would certainly do that again today And weve been in the reseller business whether you call it an MVNO or reseller business weve been in the reseller business for the last years that Ive been part of Verizon So this is not a different ecosystem And look as I said in the very beginning the pie grows and we know that people are going to want to come into that pie Cable may come in others may come in But I think what weve shown over the history is look Verizon is a pretty fierce competitor So there is a quality of service with our network that you cant get with others WiFi is an unmanaged network There is quality of service today on WiFi I mean most people in this room would realize that when WiFi gets clogged quality of service goes significantly down Its an unmanaged network You cant manage that So there are differences in that perspective So when we look at scenario and play up who could come in how could they compete Look we are prepared for that I mean we are not sitting there on our hands saying oh life is good and we are not expecting competition We are fine with competition and we believe we can compete in any environment So we are separating ourselves with other things like GO You look at G we havent even talked about G and the capability that G brings to the table that I think also puts some cable companies on their back heels as potential competition for them So look I mean we are not standing still We are moving forward So let me ask one question related to that and then lets go ahead and talk for a nano thinking about G at the top But on so if you say that the MVNO is a good deal you do it again so as LTEs came to Verizon and said could we please have a deal that youve done with other cable companies Youd say sign on the dotted line Yes I mean we have to I mean we would have to do that because thats part of some of our DOJ and equal and net neutrality type of things So yeah I mean we are perfectly fine with that and the way we set up GO by the way is GO is actually running out lets call it a welfare firm for a better terms we really havent named anything GO actually buys under that same agreement from wireless So wireless itself is an entity that has to generate profit based on the utilization of their network They are wholesaling now to GO and if Comcast does MVNO theyll wholesale through that MVNO to Comcast and so forth So from a Verizon Wirelesss perspective I am perfectly fine with the MVNO Okay So just touching in G for a second I mean look all weve all got very levels of familiarity with the G is supposed to be and what not I think Verizon kind of really catalyzed this conversation and there is a lot of good reason to get regulators off the dime to get vendors innovating But I think as an investor we get kind of confused as to what exactly we are supposed to put into our income statement forecast for because Verizon has got G So I guess there is two ways to look at there is the CapEx side what does it mean to the investment and then what does it mean to the returns Is it something what I should do in my model for G Okay So here is the way you think about it First lets start with CapEx Keep in mind that G is not a replacement technology for LTE LTE will be here for a very long time and be the predominant voice text data platform for mobile Lets classify it that for all enhancement purposes So when you look at LTE currently what we are doing at Verizon is we are densifying the network when I say densifying we are doing a lot of small cells a lot of inbuilding a lot of antenna systems And we are doing that for the densification capacity needs to deliver performance to customers who continue to use LTE You view that as thats a prerequisite to being able to launch G at some point down the road because G is a lineofsight technology It runs off a very high frequency we are looking at gigahertz to gigahertz Its a lineofsight so you have to have it densified network in order to have that lineofsight So when you think about small cells the more small cells you have the better G you will be able to what to create Things are about that so as we are incurring the capital to install those small cells today to deliver LTE I will come over the top and just install G into that cell And then the only that happens beyond that is what happens in the home that I would be doing with FIOS today but at a much reduced cost because there is no labor to dig up your front lawn lay in fiber or be able to fix something whether its on your window or somewhere to receive that lineofsight signal deliver it to a router and then you have WiFi in the home So think about it at that rate So there is really no CapEx increase that comes along with G As far as whats the use case The use case rate now is fixed wireless broadband And it can get is being designed G is designed for gigabit of speed Now I know others will claim a lot more at the same with LTE when you have an empty network you can get a lot of speed out of something that has nobody on it But its being designed for a gigabit of data and thats what being proven in Japan and Korea who are much further ahead than the US in deployment So when you think about the use case its fixed wireless broadband As far as modeling goes I think there is two hurdles that we still have to get through before we start talking about a wide commercial launch here in the US One is the standards have to be set around G Now we would love to set that standard on a global basis and we are working with South Korea and Japan on trying to establish that to get that standards set and the reason you want the standards set is because it makes it much more efficient for everybody to buy the hardware from the manufacturers because they have to they only have to build to one spec and thats beneficial to the industry and beneficial to the manufacturer The second is obviously spectrum because there is no gigahertz to gigahertz spectrum in large slots today thats available to be used other than what we actually have an option on XO And when we did the XO deal which hopefully will close late this year early next year we have an option to buy the gigahertz if the standard is set If the standard is not set at and goes to then obviously we wouldnt exercise that option But we have to work with the FCC The FCC has to work with the Department of Justice to free up that spectrum and get it to the marketplace So the timing of that I dont know but thats in order to go commercial we have to have more spectrum than whats there today And its not like you can probably and its not inconceivable that you could bundle whats there today like AWS but it would be extremely inefficient and very very costly So you need to get and because of the millimeter wave and how you deliver this signal So its spectrum that still have to come We got maybe five more minutes left Is there questions that people want to throw out there or I can keep going Three questions for me all right Next question would be just regulatory kind of real quick maybe we do a lighting round if you want So the special access order I cant I am not so sure I understand does Verizon oppose it but reluctantly endorse a technology neutral push if its going to happen or do you guys now support it and if so for why did you support change Well first off we dont like regulation period right But if we are going to be regulated and it appears that thats where the FCC wants to go then all we are saying is if you are going to regulate then regulate the entire ecosystem and this goes for whether its open access on networks or its privacy Get it across the ecosystem dont pick winners and losers And so thats really the basis of it Okay so you prefer not to happen but if its going to happen better to be technology neutral than not And the upside that you see for that would be well if the cost could potentially some net revenues in territory the opportunity is to leverage the cable platform more independently I guess to deploy fiber builds for G in markets and so there is a the silver lining in the cloud All we are saying is if you are going to regulate Verizon and ATT on access then regulate everybody that has networks which includes the cable companies So dont pick winners and losers So if you are going to open it up to everybody open it up to everybody and force everybody to open their networks dont pick winners and losers And the same with privacy if you are going to regulate the carriers on privacy then regulate the other people on the other side of the equation who dont follow any privacy rules Make the ecosystem equal within across the board and thats what we are saying That was my second one was on privacy So the FCC has assumed some authority to set privacy rules for carriers on the FTC the Fair Trade Commission is regulating privacy for the internet carriers and youve got AOL kind of in the middle somewhere How does that all work for Verizon Well its aligned thats a problem because you have two different regulatory agencies and the FCC requires us to abide by one set of rules and the FCC is much more open So if you look at Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it seems that they can pretty much do anything and not get any penalty for privacy violation We are contained that says we are not allowed to use any individual data unless there is an optin or an optout feature So what we are saying is if you are going to regulate again regulate the entire ecosystem Make a fair playing field across the ecosystem and get it right if you are going to regulate And maybe just a last question Weve been waiting for the kind of open internet order to kind of get resolved in the courts here Any timing update that we are going to see any outcomes kind of intelligence that youve gotten from the ground I dont have any timing at this point but the one comment I would make is look this doesnt really change the way we do business I mean net neutrality we abide by net neutrality There is no carrier out there that has ever been accused of prioritizing data So the way weve set our operations up we are in full compliance with it Again we just dont think regulation benefits innovation than anyone else
