youre like us you like your TV Sure you do But lets say youve been busy youre all caught up on the big prestige dramas There are no secrets or spoilers left for you in Breaking Bad Game of Thrones or Orphan Black Theres a TVshaped void in your life to fill and endless reruns on cable just arent cutting it You need something that can really occupy your time Not just a few hours but days Weeks You have months to kill and you need something to bingewatch right now And lots of it Law Order SVU episodes currently available on Hulu Plus totaling around hours If you watched hoursday it would take you days to watch and more shows are coming CSI episodes currently streaming through Hulu Plus At hours that would take more than hour viewing days to get through Hawaii FiveO Original Netflix has episodes of this classic crime show meaning youd need around hour days of bingeviewing to watch all hours Star Trek Try to watch every episode of every Star Trek series online and youre talking about a hour binge watch At hoursday youre talking nearly two months in front of the screen And this doesnt include the movies many of which are available for streaming And so what we wondered is the longest possible single bingewatch you can swing We dug deep to find out Theres a lot of TV out there and narrowing it down was tricky There are two main criteria we decided programs needed to meet to make the list First the shows need to be regularlyreleased scripted narrative programming That ruled out among other things game shows reality shows educational or howto shows competitions or sports commentaries or talk shows church churchlike or religious programs news newslike or newsmagazine programs or sketch and variety programs Second the programs have to be available to stream with a subscription to Netflix Amazon Prime andor Hulu Plus Being able to buy episodes individually from iTunes Amazon or another service doesnt count These have to be series you can plant yourself on the couch and blow an entire weekend on without racking up a fourdigit credit card bill Within the boundaries of a single series that bar was much harder to cross than youd think The longestrunning scripted narrative shows by far are soap operas Guiding Light has been running continuously since and Days of Our Lives and General Hospital both started in the s However the soaps arent available on Netflix Hulu or Amazon and so for our purposes they dont count Likewise the UKs venerable Doctor Who of which only about of the classic series is available to watch digitally Animated programming also has a way of hanging on forever it turns out but you cant catch The Jetsons in a properly futuristic manner anywhere just yet Famously longlasting primetime cartoon The Simpsons finally dared to stream recently but only on a proprietary service and so Springfields favorite family also doesnt make the list And of course contracts change Shows leave streaming services or get added to them all the time This list may be accurate in a years time or it may be a brief and fleeting snapshot All data were accurate as of the end of the business day on April These are not the longestairing series in TV history But within our criteria they are the ones you can sack out in your living room for the longest with Ended still running season will wrap up in May If you guessed Law Order and its episode run would take it youre almost right except you cant currently stream the original series However its youngersibling spinoff is happy to take the crown The runtime of most SVU episodes averages at minutes With episodes available at the time of writing thats minutes of crimebusting If you set yourself to a Benson Stablerathon without commercial breaks and playing episodes continuously youd be streaming for hours or just shy of full days The procedurals strike again this time in Las Vegas Yes CSI really has been on that long Of the episodes are currently available on Hulu Plus The episode lengths vary a little in the minute range but assuming a minute average runtime for paritys sake thats minutes of Gil Grissom and Company Do the math on that and youll be squinting in a dark stylish lab at am Vegas time for hours or just about days Procedurals seem to have this way of being unkillable and also of being available on Netflix The rebooted show can only hope for the longevity of its ohsoseventies predecessor If you want to book em Danno you can do it for minutes straight on Netflix Thats hours or about days Murder She Wrote episodes minutes days Netflix NYPD Blue episodes minutes days Amazon Prime But if you really want to kill some time youll need more than one series Youll need a series of series And for that we have Some shows lend themselves really well to spinoffs reboots sequels and related media Science fiction is particularly known for it and wellrepresented here If you have not just days to fill with endless TV marathons but weeks or months these franchises are for you Gene Roddenberrys original optimistic vision of a spacefaring future lasted only three seasons before being cancelled And yet if any show could ever be considered to have boldly gone into the wide world of greater media Star Trek is it Show Star Trek The Original Series Show Star Trek The Next Generation If you set yourself a continuing mission to explore strange new worlds youre going to be at it for a while The five main series add up to a total runtime of minutes Thats hours of Klingons off the starboard bow more than days three weeks of impassive Vulcans and rascally Romulans The venerable and prolific CSI has not only run for years but also spawned three spinoffs Not all are available to stream but one of them CSI Miami is only a few seasons shorter than the original Together the two make a formidable force If you decide to challenge yourself to a CSI marathon youre going to need to set aside more than two weeks of your life The two shows together boast minutes of programming Thats hours or about days Power Rangers purists may argue that the adventures of their heroes should be considered a single series and not a franchise However the seasons have had different titles different casts different episode lengths and run on different networks That breaks them up into discrete chunks more like a franchise than like a continual single series in our judgement The program also exists under a whopping different names not even counting the currentlyairing season so were going to take the highly simplified version of the list Show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Not including the questionable major motion picture release or the remastered version of season one you can watch minutes of ninja dino and magic morphin mayhem Thats hours or days Stargate shows Stargate SG Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe Total minutes days Amazon Prime Hulu Plus Cheers shows Cheers and Frasier Total minutes days Netflix sleep
