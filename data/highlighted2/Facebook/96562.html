style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The company plans to take the convergence of increasing mobile usage and expanding online video capabilities to win the advertising dollars of businesses With ad revenue the biggest driver of Facebooks business the company not only has to safeguard its source of income but move ahead to where the clear majority of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users are using the social media platform through smartphones and tablets In a previous interview CPO Cox said Youre starting to see a lot of new interactions on mobile Were trying to spend a moment looking at some of these trends and imagining what theyll look like in next few years Were trying to give marketers a canvas thats more engaging The exact changes are still being worked on but CPO Coxs presentation at the festival gave more insight in the elements that will be part of those changes Businesses and advertisers will be able to set up an interactive and fullybranded page in the style they choose These clients want to be in control of every little detail when it concerns their brand and products Videos can be mixed with music

search for the products and businesses they are looking for without leaving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Also once at the business page the company links dont have to direct the user outside of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to that companys website since product viewing and purchasing can all be done on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can attract more advertising spending from vendors who see this as adding extra marketing value and product exposure Build up internet search content within the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform so that users dont inadvertently leave <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and shorten their time on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Create new ways to place ads and buy buttons into the content viewers are actively searching for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now has many more user videos uploaded onto its site rather than embedded links from other sources like YouTube Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has had years to develop features within videos that can drive online advertising and purchases UKbased media search and data analytics company Ampere Analysis contends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has to make itself more flexible in the way advertisers want to build brand awareness and control how the ad messages are presented and viewed Also it has to be cost effective Ampere Analysis research director Richard Broughton said If the social networks own video ambitions are to be realized and if it is to convince content owners it is a viable alternative to YouTube it must deliver comparable returns One way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is making the returns better for content providers and advertisers is to split ad revenue with them For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>made a deal with the NFL to show clips of football game highlights last December In exchange the NFL will get part of the revenues from ads that follow each clip Those kinds of revenue streams can be expanded for businesses ad campaigns and special events Whats the value proposition for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>investors For one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is recreating the way ads are displayed to make them more relevant and personalized to users The internet will become the dominant media avenue for advertising and surpass TV in key markets according to mediabuying firm ZenithOptimedia industry research Facebooks US monthly active users MAU generate the biggest average ad revenues out of the other world markets but growth in the number of MAUs is slowing down At the same time more users are viewing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>through mobile devices which are harder to advertise on because of the limited screen space <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>potentially can increase the ad revenue volumes by increasing the time users spend logged in on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Videos and original content news keep users engaged and provide a platform for more online purchases Over the past year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares are up to and are currently trading at times fiscal forecast earnings Piper Jaffray raised its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>price target to up from the previous That would be equal to a share price gain if correct Fiscal consensus forecast earnings growth is for so Facebooks valuation is looking attractive if it can deliver such growth I think owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares as the company expands as both a social media
