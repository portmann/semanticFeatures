class='textDiv'>Apple Who Said Buffett Didnt Pull The Trigger Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha We think Berkshire Hathaways intrinsic value would fetch a target on Apple We dont think the Apple purchase is a change in direction for Berkshire Hathaway If Apple used cash for a takeover it would be dilutive Their only hope for cash is a major tender We think Buffett may be in to encourage such a direction Upgrade to hold We cant go to a buy rating yet because of our below street estimates but we feel valuation catalysts could be setting up Click to enlargeDecisions Apples NASDAQ AAPL management needs to make regarding their large cash position are not easy Many choices may be dilutive hurting shareholder value Warren Buffett may see a different opportunity There has been speculation that Warren Buffett was not part of the decision process to buy Apple at Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB Buffett has been famous for admitting that he doesnt understand technology Many have said that the recent Apple purchase may have been made by other managers at the firm We think there was a fair chance that Warren Buffett himself was a part of the decision process based on a Berkshire measure called intrinsic value On his own company Warren Buffett has been reported to say that he expects to make a large repurchase of his own shares up to as much as of book value When looking at Apples book value however you may not find the will to dive in at But intrinsic value may be Buffetts key In the shareholder letter Berkshire Hathaway wrote that page intrinsic value is extremely important when buying back shares But never forget In repurchase decisions price is allimportant Value is destroyed when purchases are made above intrinsic value The directors and I believe that continuing shareholders are benefited in a meaningful way by purchases up to our limit We think the limit may refer to book value That said the communication above specifically cites intrinsic value of Apples intrinsic value would be or upside from current levels Thats in Buffetts wheelhouse Cash Position May Be Holding Back Apple Value Need Of A Tender Because of Apples low PE by definition any acquisition they make will be dilutive to earnings Because of their size to move the needle they would need to make a larger purchase Taking the two together a large acquisition would elevate the PE lower the earnings per share and could be an initial hit to the valuation When we spoke to Apple they said they were not afraid to make larger acquisitions When asked if they would make a dilutive acquisition they said they would consider it The company views any acquisition that is strategic as accretive That implies that earnings accretion is not their focus We understand that based on our low PE comments above any acquisition would be dilutive Unless Apple does a more meaningful tender or buyback the current pace is having a very small impact to overall earnings You can see from the above chart that the overall impact to earnings of buybacks is under Their current pace is not helping the overall valuation or PE The buy backs are not supporting the stock price either If they were to increase the pace or buy back a more meaningful amount in one shot that would make a bigger impact on the shares and create real shareholder value Apple spent a billion dollars on Didi recently CEO Tim Cook said the move was for a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market This speaks to the value of cash at a company What multiple do you put on cash When cash is being spent on new initiatives based on ones core competency it is valuable We value a company based on their ability and flexibility to continue in pursuit of their expertise A companys cash position gives the company the latitude to grow and build out what it knows best When that cash is spent on new and different avenues of business Didi the value of that cash is worth closer to its nominal value or worse a degradation of value because of the risk involved with newer projects and dilution Cash does not deserve a multiple for being spent in newer projects unless the company has proven to be successful in adapting those purchases to bottom line performance Apple has had success in smaller technology tackon acquisitions but hasnt proven itself in larger acquisitions in new directions We know the cash position that Apple owns is powerful but does it make them stronger Can it make them stronger Is there the type of acquisition that they would make that would enhance the value of the Apple brand and more importantly strengthen the company Heads likely turn to critique <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB in comparison <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>spent large amounts of money on new strategies but those strategies actually fit into their core strategy of as we previuosly wrote their desire to own human interactions Which has proven to be successful and profitable We think the latest move investing in Didi and rumors about auto although the company did not confirm such moves to us are signs that Apple is looking for the next big thing The problem with that next big thing is that if it is not going to be made in house it could be something that reduces their exposure to their smartphone dominance The strategy of diworsification Moving from your core strategy into new areas increases the risk profile to earnings and is a clear sign that the next big thing isnt necessarily iPhone The Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report said This whatwilltheydowiththemoney factor must always be evaluated along with the whatdowehavenow calculation in order for us or anybody to arrive at a sensible estimate of a companys intrinsic value Thats because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of the companys earnings If a CEO can be expected to do this job well the reinvestment prospects add to the companys current value if the CEOs talents or motives are suspect todays value must be discounted The difference in outcome can be huge A dollar of thenvalue in the hands of Sears or Montgomery Wards CEOs in the late s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton This is an amazing statement when put into the context of their Apple investment Based on our analysis it sounds like you can erase the and put in and see that they could be referring to any company including Apple We think that Berkshire Hathaway sees the value in a bigger buyback and sees the risks in a larger merger or acquisition We think Berkshire Hathaways investment in Apple could help guide Apples management We think Apple can stand to use a little direction with their cash position from the best of them We think and hope this will be the direction of Apples board If so we think this will have positive ramifications on Apple stock When reviewing businesses we like to look at what is the core product or segment that is driving the growth and margins We like to see what opportunities are coming from those core franchises In house we talk about the McDonalds NYSE MCD Test No copywrite all the time Their main business is burgers and anything that goes with a burger A major move or change from the core is problematic It may sound too simplistic but we constantly analyze companies in all sectors using the McDonalds Test Is the company selling burgers or pizza Success requires adapting around a core expertise Based on Cooks comments these investments seem to be based on discovery rather than core strengths Investors and analysts are hoping to make a story how Apple services will now be able to expand in cars or through Didi but generally you dont need to buy your way into a new segment for expansion Apple already is selling into auto suppliers without Didis help You need to make great products and maybe have important strategic relationships and partnerships in core categories That is what best enhances value What The PE May Imply Need Of A Tender Street numbers for September are for At stock price that is an xPE The repurchase of more meaningful amounts of shares would lower the share count raise the earnings and lower the multiple further making it an even more attractive purchase for investors The fact that Apples cash has been widely reported to be held overseas may be holding back a major buyback The company needs to fund share buybacks with US cash To endrun around the issue they have to issue debt here in the US We think they have many ways to fund a buy back with their outside cash and probably can get more creative through swaps or hedges In the end if Apple did want to do a more meaningful tender we think they have the ability and recourses to figure it out We hope the Berkshire Hathaway investment can speed up the pace of buybacks We dont see any other meaningfully accretive use for Apples money Its certainly nice to have a pile of cash but we want the use of it for earnings accretive purposes The only solution we see is a more aggressive share buyback which we hope can be encouraged by Apples newest famous owner We hope it will not be used for a large acquisition We are changing our rating from Sell to Hold We think the valuation story is something in process Our nearterm offset however is that our expectations are below the street as we wrote ahead of last quarter and a few days ago So for now we are on the sidelines with a Hold Rating but we think there
