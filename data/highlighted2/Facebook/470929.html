People are breaking out of the false realities built for them and they are growing backbones and are asking for no DEMANDING change by Steve H Hanke Jul PM Its no surprise that Renzi has his eye on banks Its also easy to see why he is worried and ready to pull the trigger on a statesponsored bank bailout While we like everyone else were stunned by Facebooks financial results which showed torrid growth in virtually every metric from user growth to revenue to earnings to eyeball monetization one specific number sticks out according to Mark Zuckerberg there are now million daily active users in the US and Canada Considering that there are about million Americans and about million Canadians this means that every single day half the population of the US and Canada uses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at least once And just as mindboggling with million monthly active users in these two countries it means that nearly twothirds of every single American and Canadian uses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at least once a month While we have no reason to doubt the validity of these numbers we hope economists who still are confused why Americas productivity is going down the drain will finally figure it out FireBrander SimpleJackBlack Jul PM The wife uses it everyday but shes never bought anything through the ads Also electicity is cheap around here wind generated and companies like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are throwing up billions worth of datacenters borrowed money and of course the local politicians are giving away the farmrezoning free infrastructure construction roadswatersewerelectgas via tax abatement total ass kissingall in the hopes the place is still in business years from nowtake away all those freebies and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was bankrupt long ago Bastiat FireBrander Jul PM Same here She likes to keep in touch with family around the country I dont touch it Hedge is addiction enough walkre WTFRLY Jul PM The bell has just been rung at the top of FBs and other social media valuations FireBrander walkre Jul PM terrorists coordinating geographical dropoff points for payments using cellphone applications such as WhatsApp and Kik Not only can WhatsApp be used around the world but crucially it incorporates a GPS mapping tool that makes it easier for terrorists to communicate their exact locations to each other Kik offers the added benefit of allowing terrorists to register a username without providing a phone number that could identify them Affiliated ISIS Twitter accounts openly publish their Kik usernames I use the toilet every dayif only they had a way to get some advertising to you every time you flushed smacker ejmoosa Jul PM Of course they have to update their status Theyd use it a lot more except theyre too busy using their smartphones to send text messages and play games The question is how many people block the ads Advertsiing with FB must be the worst investment ever Why dont companiess see this problem I kinda feel a little lonely I never once used FB No account avatar nothing I do text and use the phone to communicate I just like my privacy And I forgot what do they produce in this country <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a great way to share content with people Its just another tool Use it wisely no need to be ignorant of it I dont have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account and it hasnt affected my life a bit Still have a healty life style still got a job still can feed my family still can work from home The most telling feature about FB is its delete post functionality One at a time multiple clicks for each deletion No mass delete or select multiple And even if deletedthey are just archived like gmail You cant tell me that delete all or multiple missing from the feature set by some of the top programmers around
