own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Microsoft might experience headwinds in stemming from its own valuation and the general market environment This article introduces a simple yet effective rule to improve the risk profile of a Microsoft investment during volatile sideways markets This rule doesnt require the analysis of historic data like technical analysis nor is any other financial or macroeconomic data needed as input Only the current price is relevant In my opinion Mircosoft NASDAQ MSFT is oscillating between value and growth too expensive for a value stock while its multiples do not seem to fully reflect its potential growth yet Microsoft gained over in It currently trades at a trailing PE of and forward PE of Its PEG ratio of is higher than Apple NASDAQ AAPL Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB which all have PEG ratios below two Microsoft returns a dividend yield of too low for dividend investors It seems that MSFTs valuation has started to move into levels consistent with a growth stock As such the stock performance will be determined by the successful execution of its stated growth strategy in mobile and cloud Disappointment is this area could lead to downside However unlike pure growth stocks with much loftier valuations Microsofts price tends to be supported at lower levels by its dividend yield and established cash flow Source for all numbers in this paragraph Yahoo Finance Due to the stockspecific situation as well as the macroeconomic environment of rising interest rates and increased volatility Microsofts price might experience setbacks over the coming months even as its longterm growth prospects might remain intact The following rule provides a systematic method for any investor to manage an existing position in a more volatile environment The idea is to add to an existing position on cheaper prices and reduce in higher territories Rulebased trading encourages trading discipline and once specified takes a certain subjective element out of the trading decision Maintain a target dollar amount invested in the asset in this case Microsoft When the value of the assets rises above a threshold sell When the value of the asset falls below a threshold buy An example I hold worth of Microsoft shares When the value of the investment rises to I sell worth of shares to bring back my exposure to If the value sinks to I buy worth of shares to return my exposure to A cash account collects the proceeds from sales and provides liquidity for investments Initially two parameters need to be determined The threshold at which the investment should be brought back to its target exposure and the initial cash reserves In my opinion the trading threshold should ideally be chosen such that on average only every one or two months a trade occurs not to burden the trader with too frequent trading and transaction costs Of course the trade frequency will depend on market volatility The initial cash allocation requires an assessment as to how much downside might be expected from current market levels This analysis is very individual and could involve fundamental valuation technical analysis or historic drawdowns For example Lets assume my target exposure in Microsoft is I set the rebalancing threshold at ie up or down and set aside in my cash account My total assets investment plus cash are thus I can rebuy three consecutive times after a decline each before I run out of cash and of my assets are invested With a reference price of three such declines would bring Microsofts price to x At that level the shares would sport a dividend yield of enough to attract the attention of conservative investors Heres the backtest of the strategy described above as benchmark serves a buyandhold investment in Microsoft No transaction cost Given the moderate amount of trades the low execution cost of most online brokers and the tight spreads in MSFT this seems a reasonable simplification The backtest period is from December to January This period presented itself as an example of a sideways market with a breakout upwards in the last two months The years prior can be characterized as a trending bull market for MSFT not suited for the strategy see Risk section below For the purpose of the backtest the closing value of every day is taken to determine whether the rebalancing threshold has been reached If so the rebalancing will take place at the close of the following trading day to allow for a lag between observation and trade The initial parameters are in shares and in cash with a rebalancing after each move in the stock price The price level of Microsoft at December was These parameters would have ensured the ability to invest down to a decline to about x The red line in the chart below shows the value of a buyandhold position including reinvested dividends The green line shows the total value of the constant exposure strategy shares plus cash Also indicated are trading days blue and cash ratio of the constant exposure strategy purple There are only five trading days over the month period two buy signals and three sell signals The constant exposure strategy outperforms for most of the period until the massive pricegap upwards after the most recent quarterly results after which the buyandhold strategy takes the lead On a riskadjusted basis the strategy looks superior While it underperforms the buyandhold strategy in pure performance it does so with much less risk Its volatility and maximum drawdown are and lower respectively The constant exposure strategy scores especially high on the return in relation to maximum drawdown ReMaD an asymmetric risk measure that puts upside potential in context with downside risk Of course a backtest based on historic data does not guarantee any future returns It is simply an illustration of how the strategy might have behaved in a certain market environment The results shown in the backtest stem from the meanreversing nature of a sideways market However the constant exposure rule performs badly in a strong trending market A steady upward trend leads to continuous selling reducing exposure without ever being able to rebuy in the absence of corrections Similarly a continuous bear market leads to buying on the way down in absence of a recovery this is a bad strategy catching a falling knife The constant exposure rule is best suited for sideways markets that is markets with frequent corrections and peaks The constant exposure strategy can be modified and tweaked For example Asymmetric thresholds of rebalancing in up and downmoves can be chosen Constant proportions instead of constant exposure instead of a constant USD amount the investment ratio and cash ratio is held fixed Calendarbased rebalancing instead of rebalancing based on price movements Do you have other suggestions to improve this rule Would you like to see a backtest of this rule on one of your stocks Let me know Tagged ETFs Portfolio Strategy
