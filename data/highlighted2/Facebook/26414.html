find a contemporary comparable to value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>An alternative is to look at historical comparables If youre like me youve probably been scratching your head the past years trying to figure out how to value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB I think most people would agree <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a unique product marked by unprecedented growth and a growing monetization opportunity In short its the type of business any investor would like to buy at the right price But naturally different investors will have different perceptions of the right price to buy I consider myself a value investor By its nature fundamental valuation relies strongly on cash reserves debt levels and low to modest multiples of free cash flow and EBITDA It is rare that a value investor will make the assumption of continued growth However I recognize that businesses with strong or exponential revenueearnings growth and a monopolytype product may trade at multiples well outside the value range for extended periods if not indefinitely This means I will probably never buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or most other rapidly growing technology stocks But apart from evaluating the margin of safety I also like to characterize the upside ie where a stock is likely to trade under realistic market conditions The determination of the appropriate PE ratio for a given business is inherently problematic The difficulty is magnified if earnings are accelerating or decelerating And of course uncertainty has a tremendous role to play Uncertainty may be related to general market sentiment to changes in operations or to almost any other factor Its very difficult to capture all this information in a DCF model making the conclusions highly suspect at best Another approach is comparables which works quite well if you can find a number of comparable businesses in the sectorindustry Perhaps the most important criterion for a good comparable is that its forecast future cash flows should be similar This may allow us to say that similar multiples may be used in valuing the compared businesses Here we come to the fundamental problem with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>How many other companies with similar market cap and growth prospects can we find at the present time Very few large companies are capable of YoY revenue growth Many if not most large companies depend on revenue streams from many small projects but the law of averages works against the business as it grows and diversifies To avoid this size problem over a period of years you need a single homogeneous scalable product Think Coke CocaCola Google Search Google or oil Standard Oil It needs to be a nearmonopoly with great pricing power And it needs to have a huge market Only a handful of businesses in the past century have fulfilled those criteria When people look for a comparable on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the first company that comes to mind is Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Similar market cap similar business model based on ad revenue But as many have pointed out Facebooks growth profile is very different from Google So you cant directly compare them Or can you As others have pointed out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>looks a lot like the teenage Google Both arewere companies with tech founders and a head start on technological revolutions search vs the social network that grew by leaps and bounds as they changed the lives of billions of people In fact as Bill Gates has pointed out the growth of Google had some similarities to the growth of Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT thanks to Windows and the Microsoft Office suite in the s note that Microsofts early business was contract software development and it later transitioned to a product business Its possible that nontech businesses could be referenced but best to keep the comparables as focused as we can So if I were trying to value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on a comparables basis I would want to look back to when Google and Microsoft were growing at comparable rates It would also be nice if the absolute magnitude of revenues at the time of comparable growth rates were similar as you may note the absolute magnitudes are remarkably similar in this regard For years I assumed that FBs YoY rev growth remained at that Net IncRev was about and that Sh Outstanding remained constant No special logic went into these I was just trying to be as nice to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as possible I pulled the rest of the numbers from ADVFN I could spend pages and pages poking holes is this comparison Comparables is by its nature a very imperfect science But looking at this table I make the following observations If Best Sh Price is taken as the absolute best case historical valuation for FBs shares FB has remained below this curve for the most part If Worst Sh Price is taken as the worst case historical valuation considering the market conditions during the periods respectively described for Google and Microsoft FBs shares have remained above this curve If Av Sh Price is the average of the two valuations FB has remained above this curve but seems to be moving closer to it If we assume Av Sh Price is representative of intermediate market conditions and such market conditions should prevail over the next few years a big assumption then a valuation of FB around sh no dilution considered by the end of would not be unreasonable When I did this analysis I thought it would make the case for an obvious overvaluation of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in a historical context If you look at the numbers above it actually looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not at too much of a premium to typical conditions My biggest concern however is the growth rate assumption if you look at GOOG and MSFT they quickly tapered rapidly off anything close to revenue growth over subsequent years So to believe FB will perform as above you have to assume that FBs growth prospects are bigger than MSFTs or GOOGs were at similar points in their lives For all I know this may well be true Zuck is certainly a visionary and has strong motivation to grow the company As a value investor I will obviously be more conservative for my own account I see that in the roaring s leading up to the crash MSFT traded at PE multiples up to the mids and then pulled back to the mids afterward see ADVFN for later years Since GOOG recovered pretty quickly from the drop in but had slowing growth afterward it tended toward the s and s If FB should dive to times earnings with continued excellent growth during a downturn I might jump on it Otherwise Ill probably never buy the stock But if youre a growth investor as shown above it wouldnt be unreasonable to expect solid growth stock returns on investment if revenue growth remains around YoY and market conditions remain similar etc Source Historical Comparables For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Disclosure The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned
