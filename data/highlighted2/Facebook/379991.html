potentially bearish indicators for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The first noted by Karl Eggerss was a potential double top in the stock The second noted by SqueezeMetrics was a x spike in the volume of dark pool shorting of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares We elaborate on both indicators and present two ways for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>longs to add downside protection The first reason for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB longs to be cautious is the candlestick chart above shared via StockTwits by Karl Eggerss of Eggerss Capital Management As Eggerss suggests this chart could be the beginning of a bearish technical formation known as a Double Top Reversal Looks like there was some unusual dark pool activity in some of the tickers you follow Dark pools for readers who may be unfamiliar with the term are private exchanges where institutions trade shares without the transparency of public markets This enables them to place large block trades away from frontrunners and other predatory traders on public exchanges Seeking Alpha contributor SqueezeMetrics elaborated on how dark pools work and why investors should pay attention to them in an article a couple of months ago Seeking Alpha In The Dark After seeing that email from SqueezeMetrics I signed on to their site and pulled up the chart below The red part of the histogram represents the volume of dark pool shorting and you can see how that spiked on April th If youre long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and are still generally bullish on it but you want to limit your downside risk in light of the reasons mentioned above well look at two ways of hedging it over the next several months below If youd like a refresher on hedging terms first please see the section titled Refresher On Hedging Terms in this previous article of ours Locking In Gold Gains Were going to use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge FB below but you dont need the app to do this You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if youre willing to take the time and do the work Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app an additional piece of information youll need to supply along with the number of shares youre looking to hedge when scanning for an optimal put is your threshold which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purpose of the examples below weve used a threshold of If you are more riskaverse you could use a smaller threshold And if you are less riskaverse you could use a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge Here are the optimal puts as of Wednesdays close to hedge shares of FB against a greaterthan drop by midSeptember As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value A couple of points about this cost To be conservative the cost was based on the ask price of the put In practice you can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and ask The threshold includes this cost ie in the worstcase scenario your FB position would be down not including the hedging cost When scanning for an optimal collar youll need one more figure in addition to your threshold your cap which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly One starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge For example if youre hedging over a fivemonth period and you think a security wont appreciate more than over that time frame then it might make sense to use as a cap you dont think the security is going to do better than that anyway so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that We checked Portfolio Armors website to get an estimate of FBs potential return over the next several months Every trading day the site runs two screens to avoid bad investments on every hedgeable security in the US and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return Potential return in its terminology is a bullish estimate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>passed those two screens and the site calculated a potential return for it of over the next six months which equates to about over the time frame of our hedge This is pretty close to the return implied by the median month Wall Street price target shown below via Yahoo Finance As you can see above the median month price target there was which represented a increase over Wednesdays closing price of implying a potential return over the next five months So we started out using as a cap but when we were able to raise it to without raising the cost of the collar we used that As of Wednesdays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of FB against a greaterthan drop by midSeptember while not capping an investors upside at less than As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was a bit more or of position value So the net cost of this optimal collar was negative meaning an investor would have collected more from selling the call leg than he paid for the puts an amount equal to of his position value One note on this collar hedge Similar to the situation with the optimal put to be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls in practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask So in reality an investor would likely have collected more than when opening this collar Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks
