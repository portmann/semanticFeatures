gives it insight into what current IoT customers are doing and whats coming in the near future Coming soon to a universe near you the Internet Weve previously written on the new universes that companies like Alphabet Inc NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc NASDAQ FB are creating that will allow devices connected to the Internet of Things IoT to communicate with each other and their human or machine controllers Weve written about moves that IBM Corp NYSE IBM is making with its Watson super computer in harnessing the power of IoT to improve weather forecasting First Verizon is obviously a leader in mobile data After all its Verizons network plus its rivals networks WiFi and other technologies that form the backbone of the IoT That gives Verizon insight into what current IoT customers are doing and whats coming in the near future Second Verizon wants to be much more than just a data pipeline Just as it wants to own content through its purchase of AOL and rumored interest in some of Yahoos NASDAQ YHOO assets Verizon wants to own major parts of the Internet of Things too Indeed its already got universes of its own for the utility and transportation industries In short massive growth just as weve predicted here Verizon estimates that the IoT market will grow to billion devices in and over billion in If that sounds large its actually on the conservative side of some estimates Cisco Systems NASDAQ CSCO for example estimates there will be billion connected IoT devices by Either way its still enormous growth So much in fact that its hard to count all the devices Verizon says there are billion IoT devices in use today while other estimates say there are only half that many But as my colleague Louis Basenese has said the exact number doesnt matter much The company commented on how regulation is driving much of IoTs growth Specifically it pins a lot of the growth of smart meters to the Energy Policy Act of for example And other increasing regulation from drugs to food to construction equipment will drive IoT infrastructures to automate sourcing histories shipping times and more For instance if a restaurant has an outbreak of sickness among its customers Chipotle anyone it can take days or weeks to find the source But data collected by the IoT will allow the restaurant to know instantly where every possible source of contamination comes from it will know if the problem was a farm a warehouse the restaurant itself or even a single truck that wasnt properly cleaned And crucially restaurants will be able to prevent many outbreaks theyll know if a truck spent too much time in the sun with its cooler off and know not to use the products from that truck The government is heavily involved in the IoT primarily with smart cities Smart cities involve much more than tracking streetlights to save energy and illuminate potentially dangerous dark spots Cities are employing IoT devices to let landlords compare their buildings to others to see where they can conserve energy theyre building WiFi networks so mobile users dont have to hope that their cellular network doesnt cut out in any given area theyre even finding potholes as they form And in the future motorists will receive a text message telling them where the nearest empty parking space is to their destination Regulation is often a dirty word but in this case its the ultimate form of forced adoption The company notes that at the moment much of the data being collected by all these devices is actually being wasted It estimates that only of businesses are using even of the data theyre collecting Well forced adoption doesnt always mean fast adoption The IoT is a work in progress and the trend is pointing higher For example half of businesses plan to be using over of that data in two to three years This represents a big opportunity for Big Data However only a few companies have the capabilities to process and analyze all of the data that will soon be available to them Most companies will need help organizing and using the data for their own aims whether to increase safety lower costs or design new products and services that tap into customers needs Todays Menu Oysters and Wine With an Assist From the Internet Verizon uses the examples of an oyster farmer in Massachusetts and a vineyard in Maine Neither company has the scale to develop their own IoT analytics But with help from Verizon of course they can monitor their oysters and grapes in ways they previously couldnt For example customizing delivery of water and food Once harvested the companies can track their products all the way to end users particularly important for oysters of course since they go bad so quickly But even for the winemaker knowing where its wine is piling up in a distributors warehouse and where its selling well allows the winemaker to focus its sales and marketing efforts and even plan what grape production to increase and which to decrease Verizons point here is one weve made before The Internet of Things isnt just one giant market its tens of thousands of smaller markets The service component of these markets represents an even bigger opportunity than the device component And ultimately the rewards will go to the companies that can help other firms collect analyze and use the massive amounts of data to achieve their business objectives Tagged Investing Ideas IPO Analysis Technology Telecom Services Domestic </div></body></html>
