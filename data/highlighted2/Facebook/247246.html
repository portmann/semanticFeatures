just the purview of teenagers Bulk texting is a huge business Sometimes theyre scam spam in about the same category of usefulness as emails from a wealthy Nigerian prince who doesnt exist granted but sometimes theyre useful blasts from businesses or public entities that let a whole bunch of people get useful information quickly in a lowbandwidth way But what they arent quite yet is clearly regulated A case moving through the FCC right now however may change that Phone lines including mobile are common carriers subject to Title II regulation Thats been true for decades and it means wireless carriers have to treat all phone calls the same way without providing priority to one caller over another Calls from grandma come through to you in the exact same way as calls from Rachel in cardholder services for better or worse Mobile broadband your G or G LTE network is also subject to Title II common carrier regulation at least for now That was part of the net neutrality rule that went into effect earlier this year and it means that wireless carriers have to treat all data the same way without providing priority to one app or website over another Downloads from Candy Crush will get to you under the same conditions as downloads from The New York Times unless next months court date upends everything once again But text messages still exist in a strange netherworld SMS messaging is neither voice nor data or maybe somehow its both voice and data Right now all of that is still up for grabs And thats where this fight comes in Back in August a company called Twilio which provides the backend systems for businesses to text customers petitioned the FCC formally to classify SMS as a Title II service along with your phones voice and data Twilios goal is of course to make sure that all the texts it sends on behalf of its customers can get through to subscribers without being blocked or throttled or more importantly from their perspective without having to pay a pile of extra fees to the carriers Twilio argues that under the existing law texts are treated in the same way as phone calls which have a very clear regulatory status Additionally Twilio points out it basically makes no sense to apply the same kind of regulation to everything a phone does except text The wireless companies however are not a fan of this idea ATT Verizon and the CTIA a trade group that represents most of the wireless carriers all filed responses with the FCC strongly urging against making texts as subject to Title II as everything else you do on your phone is According to ATT since texting doesnt exist on landlines it is exempt from the statute Verizon meanwhile likens it to email and calls it an information service All three argue that to oblige wireless businesses to treat all texts as equally as they treat voice calls and data would harm consumers because it would hamper their antispam efforts and open up texting to the same sort of incessant spam harassment consumers are already subject to with robocalls Yours truly who has so far received three phishing scam texts this week would suggest that perhaps that ship has already sailed Consumer advocate groups including Common Cause Public Knowledge and Free Press all supported Twilios side Smaller businesses and startups they said had been facing challenges getting their bulk texts to consumers because of
