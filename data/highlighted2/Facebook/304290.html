Disclosure I amwe are short FB MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has received many of its video views from stolen videos FB said it was working on solving this problem in August The biggest risk to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is that its numbers are a lie This is a strong statement to start an article off but it is the truth As of January we are at the oneyear anniversary of my article on YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>where I mentioned freebooting was a serious problem If you arent aware of what freebooting is freebooting is when a video is downloaded from YouTube and reuploaded to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>using its native video player The videos are preferred in Facebooks algorithm because FB wants to keep users on its site Therefore stolen content is preferred over original content and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is profiting off of it Consider the following chart via Duke University As you can see the natively uploaded content received about five times the reach as the YouTube video The first star indicates YouTube views from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and the second indicates play clicks on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The policy to keep users on FB is smart but using stolen content is what makes it wrong This latest quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced that million hours of video per day is watched on its site million people watch video on FB every day Much of this content is stolen In the first quarter of out of the top videos on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>were stolen as you can see from the slide below This amounted to billion total views Video has been so important to Facebooks results that the term was mentioned times on the conference call so clearly this is an issue worth reviewing I was nave to think last year that because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was new to video it just needed time to create the infrastructure to start supporting individual content creators As a video creator myself I am passionate about this issue but was willing to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a pass because of the programming it takes to create a proper Content ID system like YouTube has Unfortunately for me and every other creator FB has made no effort to stop this freebooting from occurring This makes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a company that is unsustainable because theft always catches up to the thief Alphabet already is aware that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is its biggest competitor There will be a time in the future where Alphabet decides to sue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for its stolen views I think we are getting closer to that time When I first heard about this issue I was very angry that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would build its new ecosystem off of stolen videos This is much more difficult to do than encouraging independent creators to come onto its platform YouTube has already existed for over years so it is ingrained into potential creators minds to head to it first to upload a public video <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>decided to go the easyunethical way when it continued to allow stolen content to grow on its platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>said in August that it was working on a Content ID system that would prevent this from occurring in the future I believed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was sincere in its efforts I was misguided FB dragging its feet on this change is emblematic of what happens when a content creator flags stolen content on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>drags its feet and takes the video down after all of the views already occur The company rakes in the money and doesnt pay the original creator any money There arent any consequences for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or the person who uploads the stolen video Moving on to what has been happening lately on November Hank Green wrote a piece on Medium where he expressed his frustration while making the point that he doesnt have the time to sue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>He said that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a system in place to take down copywritten content from major corporations such as Disney NYSE DIS but doesnt care about individual creators This lack of care is consistent with its monetization efforts which only focus on partnering with major content creators This is because individually each creator is powerless Hank Green says <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt deal with this issue because independent creators wont sue and because it would be difficult to create and monitor a Content ID system On November the channel called In a Nutshell uploaded a video detailing freebooting It received million views Its video had been freebooted on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>causing it to miss out on thousands of dollars in ad revenues The Ethan and Hila channel uploaded a video that received views where he showed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>actually refusing to take down his video which was stolen The stolen video received three million views This is how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been making its money from the expanded video initiative it has unveiled in the past few quarters I have laid out the argument quite clearly If you dont care about copyright issues or the fact that a billion firm is stealing from small entrepreneurs to enrich itself you still may be wondering how this will affect the stock I can debate with you in the comment section about this issue but what matters the most is what will end up happening I believe this method of profitability is unsustainable for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>It cannot survive in the long term by basing its traffic off of stolen content If you noticed both the video by In a Nutshell and the article by Hank Green were published in the middle of November This is because that was when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced it had eight billion video views Every single announcement of how great FBs video platform is doing encourages new complaints by creators This latest announcement should be no different The best solution for this would be either a class action lawsuit or for Alphabet to sue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>This situation has game theory written all over it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is making the bet that it can keep stealing money from content creators without any consequences It can take its time slowly creating a Content ID system and when it gets big enough to be a threat to YouTube it will change its policy Im not sure if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is this nefarious It may just not have any reason to care so it continues with this unethical policy The problem with the nefarious situation is if a class action lawsuit does take place it will have to change its policy and pay the money owed to individual creators Judging by the litigious nature of our society and the virality of the videos that discuss freebooting I am expecting the shoe to drop this year There was literally a crowdfunded kickstarter that raised for a guy to make a potato salad I think the Internet will eventually rise up and fight <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>FB has stolen from the most powerful people on the Internet I think the creators dont understand their own power in this situation If Internet stars such as Hank Green and Jenna Marbles who have tens of millions of subscribers wanted to get together they could end this problem There are many problems <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>faces besides the amount of money it will pay out to the affected creators The first will be it will have to spend money to actually build a Content ID system It will have to work properly or else there will be a renewed scrutiny on the platform The one announced in August was supposed to be in beta version As you saw from the video in December by Ethan and Hila the system is not working Another problem with this potential lawsuit is the amount of video content on the platform will decline substantially The companys stock is supported by the potential growth of video and Instagram A shift to reality would hurt the potential growth investors see for the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is being valued at over times sales so this growth has to come to fruition or the valuation must compress Vanity metrics such as monthly active users anger critical investors I believe the video views are worse than vanity metrics because they arent Facebooks views The entire value of a video platform is the intent of creators to publish on the site otherwise known as the network effect Facebooks network effect is not as strong as it has let on If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had so much confidence in its network effect why wouldnt it stop the theft of content Another problem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will have to face is it will have to start paying out the money it makes to content creators once the system changes YouTube would effectively double its profits if it got to keep all of the money earned on the ads shown in front of videos instead of only taking a cut <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will lose half of its earnings on the freebooted content when this policy is changed FB has garnered the hatred of content creators so they may not want to work with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to create a sustainable platform The counterargument to this would be that these creators may hold a grudge against the company but will still post their content to the site because it would be in their best interest My response to this counterargument is that monetization via ads isnt the permanent solution to monetization of content online It is only one solution The other solution is monthly subscriptions as is the case with YouTube Red No content creator will want to work with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to create a monthly subscription network that would compete with YouTube Red after FB has screwed creators out of their hardearned dollars Because of this the company has less monetization potential than analysts and investors think I am very biased in this situation because I have a YouTube channel that I plan on growing substantially this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>investors are biased to believe the firm is doing nothing wrong Putting these biases aside there is a chance Facebooks stolen chickens will come home to roost in Stealing content is not a sustainable business practice On the other side of the coin <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been successful at managing the change in consumer tastes by shifting its focus to mobile This was the driver of the excellent user growth numbers reported in the recent quarter Analysts discussed the possibility of FB having its own separate video player application on the call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cannot do this with stolen content However if it does decide to improve its business practices and support independent creators the opportunity to truly rival YouTube is there for the taking Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
