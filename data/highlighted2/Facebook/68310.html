territories you want to be ready Apple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Alibaba are of my top buy on dip picks While there are undoubtedly a plethora of experienced investors out there reading Seeking Alpha I imagine a significant percentage of us do not consider ourselves experienced Then again how do you define experience Number of trades Hours reading Seeking Alpha articles Perhaps a simpler metric such as the number of years invested in the market Experience is a rather subjective term isnt it Consider the poker industry Many of the older professionals believe themselves experienced based on number of years played from the late th century until the present day Then came the advent of online poker when mathematically inclined teenagers needed less than a year of online poker to amass more playing experience in terms of number of total hands played than these older professionals had gathered in decades We live in an era where experience can be obtained quicker and more efficiently But sometimes perhaps only through the passage of time can certain lessons become engrained That lesson that I am just coming to learn myself is this keep some percentage of your portfolio in cash ready to be used as your knight in shining armor With the market taking a substantial dip on Tuesday May I felt like this topic would serve as a brief reminder of why you need to keep cash in your portfolio I reject the maxim that cash is King and propose a new take cash is a Knight Not quite the King but not a jester Too much cash and you reduce your portfolios ability to take advantage of market gains Too little cash and you reduce your ability to take advantage of dips in the market that create buying opportunities Knights serve the King they are warriors and they go to battle If the King is being attacked they defend him Similarly if your portfolio the King is being attacked by the rigors of Mr Market you need a Knight your cash ready to do your portfolios bidding and save the day What I do not intend to do here is answer the age old question of how much cash you should keep Despite being involved in the stock market for years the thought of keeping cash in my portfolio has been anathema to me until recently On bad days I cringe at my King being viciously attacked No cash no Knights to pick him back up I think most would agree that percent cash is too much Conversely percent is likely too little to make any meaningful impact Then again timing the market with your use of any cash in your portfolio is always risky in and of itself This is why the decision of how much cash to keep is going to be fairly individualistic and based on your risk aversiontolerance Perhaps think back to the times when the market has taken a slight dip and think about what you wanted to buy and how much you would have needed Perhaps your portfolio is and generally when the market takes small dips you recall several scenarios where you wish you had enough cash in your portfolio to buy x of shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or y of shares of Apple Average all these times together and perhaps you can come up with a percent that you can live with So what stocks am I immediately eyeing after yesterdays minirout While I have not yet quite settled on pulling the trigger the following are catching my eye Apple NYSE AAPL Im no chartist but Apple sure seems to be forming a base in the past couple months trading in a range between the mids and lowsclick to enlarge Of course Ive always taken issue with this technical mechanism to some degree as a stock might take time to escape its trading range I am eyeing Apple closely but will likely take a deep breath and wait until a statistically notorious post WWDC few percentage point breakdown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>seems to bounce every time it dips to the high s and once again the market has been unkind and pushed FB back to With Oculus set to hit the market next year increasingly monstrous user numbers for Instagram over million and Whatsapp over million and the potential for monetization of these user bases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>looks undervalued even at a forward PE of In an upcoming article I plan to do an extensive analysis of the Oculus Rift and the potential for its future monetization Despite the popular opinion that Whatsapp and Instagram are the greatest potential sources of earnings for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I actually posit that the ability to advertise in an entirely new world is Facebooks most exciting albeit further out prospect Alibaba NYSE BABA While in hindsight like everyone else in the investing world who did not pull the trigger I wish I would have gotten in a month ago in the high s If you can stomach the ups and downs I think this goes significantly higher over the next twelve months and coming years as the Chinese populace slowly keyword here gets wealthier Having visited China several times and even worked for a law firm in Beijing back in I do have some hesitation about Alibabas ability to deal with rampant intellectual copyright infringement that plagues the country Before its IPO Reuters reported that its businesses were listed on the US Trade Representatives list of notorious markets for intellectual property NYSE IP infringement That mainstream Chinese media is reporting on the issue may be a harbinger of things to come But then again Alibaba appears to be directing millions of dollars to solve this problem Only time will tell Source Cash Is A Knight Use It To Protect You Disclosure The author is long
