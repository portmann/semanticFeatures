The Saturday Weekly Review Will hour <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction Pages Make You Rich The Saturday Weekend Review What started as a place to connect with family and friends has turned into a moneymaking venture with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction pages popping up all over the free social networking service The hour <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction pages have quickly become some of the best auction sites around because of the sheer volume of people who use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>My wife and I are not shy to say that we love secondhand shops We hardly buy anything new unless we need to because most often we can find it used for quite a bit less than retail or sale prices If we arent scouring through the secondhand shops we are checking out Kijiji which is an online buying and selling website where you can post your Wanted or For Sale ads for free Kijiji is much more than buying and selling though since its branched out to include vacations and employment as well Over the years we have purchased so much from Kijiji were safe to say that most of the contents of our home has been previously loved Another way we would score great deals was from the more traditional route in the form of a garage sale Heading out at the crack of dawn on a Saturday with a travel map in our hands would soon find us visiting house after house looking through the bargains set out for sale on long tables or simply laying on the ground Garage sales are a great way to sell stuff you no longer want or use in the house BUT you wont get near as much money as you would if you used a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction page Its true at a garage sale you sell your stuff at rock bottom prices and at the end of the day Id have to say most people dont even earn back what their time is worth trying to sell it all The goal for many is not always the money its to get rid of the stuff so they dont have to look at it anymore For that reason alone they dont care if it takes them half the afternoon to give it away or they leave it with a Free Sign if it hasnt sold The other option for homeowners is to just donate it all but why do that when you can try and score some money out of the deal Again unless you have some quality items it may not even be worth your time What are hour <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auctions How do online auctions work I know you want to understand how to get rich and believe me there are people who are making cash from these <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction pages They not become secondhand millionaires BUT some are earning a cozy living with their new found hobby A hour <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction page is simply what you think an auction page You list an item that you want to auction off and from the time that it is posted the hour clock starts ticking In your post you will list what the product is the starting bid and increment bids You may even list the pickup location and when it needs to be picked up by You can bump your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>auction post typically once a day so it jumps to the top of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction page where more fans of the page will see it and potentially increase the bids Once more items are posted your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction item will get buried down the list so its important to bump it Sometimes you dont have to if its a HOT item and tonnes of people are bidding on it The get free stuff and resell it for a profit As long as you are organized you can run many auctions at the same time and watch the cash roll in as long as you have the product I know it sounds daft but some people literally are addicted to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction pages and watch them day and night so they dont miss an item or lose out on bidding for something Ive seen some items posted and people start bidding like crazy within the first minutes so an item that had a hour starting bid of with increments is now at within minutes yet there is still over hours to go Fans go nuts and drive the price so fast that the seller is making a fortune especially from the people who have it in their heads that they wont lose to anyone Typically in the lastminute of a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction you will see the price go higher and higher sometimes in a mad dash to outbid the highest bid no matter what the price We won a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction for our iPhone but we only paid for it We were lucky that the other people who put bids on it either forgot or lost interest At the end it was just us and we won the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction and now have a new to us Smartphone for a fraction of the cost to buy it new I often wonder if people who are placing bids on items are actually sourcing the original retail price and potential sale price to buy it new Ive seen so many used items get so high in bids you could have bought new products for that winning bid No word of a lie Check it out for yourself to see how many people fight over bids and go nutty to win a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>auction The sellers see this and know its a goldmine for them Some may say its not ethical selling stuff they got free from someone else such as clothes BUT they dont give a rats bottom what anyone says If there is money to be made they will make it and no one will tell them to stop There are times when a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction can tank on the seller because no one bids on the item or it gets lost on the page because they didnt bump it That means that if the seller was trying to catch attention by listing the product for a starting bid they may end up giving away a bargain to someone Weve seen lots of clothing and boxes of DVDs go for because there were no other bids Its all risk but for the most part the bids are steady for most items weve seen especially if it is a hot item There are many <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>groups or pages that are free pages where you can join and nothing is to be sold only given for free <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Pages such as Freecycle or even Frugal Mommy has thousands of fans all over Canada You can bet that there are people getting items for free then reselling them for profit Its not everyone obviously but more than likely it is happening Dont be fooled that everyone is in need as they will stop at nothing to get free stuff to resell Some will even travel from city to city to pickup free stuff they get from the freebie <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>pages to resell in their own community so its not so obvious There are also people who roam the streets every night looking for free stuff to sell online for profit They are everywhere You can sell pretty much everything that is legalof course or that follows Health Canada regulations but there are some items that must be approved by the admin of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction page first such as knives It depends on the rules of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction page so its important to always read that which is clearly posted on just about every page What items will make you the richest on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>auctions By far it will be clothes I dont know about you but I dont happen to have a mannequin hanging around our bedroom closet Many of the clothes sellers will use mannequins or they will have endless amounts of clothes that they sell every single day Where they get all these clothes is a question they can answer but thats not my business how they go about earning extra income If anything I think they are smart finding that loophole that they can cash in on Its insane the amount of money they make Some of these smart sellers will go to secondhand shops on off days and look through the entire store for all the name brand items they can find They will pay the bottom of the barrel prices and resell them on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for profit You may think its not worth it but trust me we know someone who does this and lets just say they are doing alright financially There are no hard and fast rules about what you can and cant do when it comes to selling stuff you got for free so people will take advantage of that The garage sale is still popular but you can bet that more of those items will end up on hour <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction pages because the money is lucrative compared to the chump change they would get at a yard sale So the next time you see tonnes of traffic at your neighbours house dont assume they are doing something illegal because they may just be getting rich selling stuff on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Auction pages My parents arrived safe from the UK the other day so its been a busy couple of days in the CBB house So far they love Boston Cream and Canadian Maple Donuts from Tim Hortons with a cuppa coffee or tea Its the donuts that have won their heart though Ill likely get them some bus tickets so while Im at work they can tour around the city and go to the mall shopping I do have to work a few days but we will be going on day trips and likely one major destination in Ontario in the next couple of weeks Thats the plan at least So far we managed to eat in and had family over who brought some groceries such as steak to BBQ up and we made some salads which worked out great We hope to eat in as much as we can and BBQ as my parents dont get that opportunity much in the UK with no BBQ This weekend the wife and my parents are going to garage sales in the neighbourhood while I rush off to work I hope they bring something back for me to report on I managed to get the hanging baskets almost done this week in the front of the house Everything is out now for summer apart from our clothes drying line which I will put up next week After my parents go I will focus on finishing the back garden and installing the spot lights out front I will also be sealing the driveway again this year since I made a mess of it cutting tiles last year for the bathroom renovation Other than that its been a super busy week on the blog as we have seen a steady increase of visitors which is great A big thanks to Rob Carrick for sharing a CBB post in his best reads of

around the world and would like your blog to be MAD featured simply drop me an email and Ill explain the process to you This is my way of giving back to the personal finance community through networking and sharing knowledge with my fans Greetings Mr CBB readers My name is Matt affectionately known as MattTheFool from Running Of The Fools Along with KeithTheConfused and DavidTheDoofus we write about early retirement financial independence and personal finance with a twist Do you ever feel like youre caught in a roiling sea of people and you dont quite know how you got there Your eyes constantly focus down the road trying to pick out someone to follow so you dont get trampled But your reflexes arent quite as quick as they used to be People fall around you but the crowd forces you onward You see this is Pamplona and everyone is afraid that the bull will gore them The worst part You cant even remember how or why youre here Thats often how we feel about our lives at least Were stuck in a mass of people chasing the everelusive American dream But instead of getting out we mindlessly keep running with the crowd too afraid that well be gored by the mythical beast Why Is there a way to get out of the race Is there more than simply pursuing possessions and accumulating crap Thats what we want to explore at Running of the Fools You see we believe that our entire lives matter We are created in a way that makes it damn near impossible to separate the different parts of our being So wouldnt we be best served to talk about finances in the context of these other interlocking pieces The stark reality is that financial independence and early retirement are great But theyre not the end goal Accumulating wealth is great but its not the end goal either Being generous and charitable is important but were not even sure that is the end goal We want to explore now just how to retire early but why you want to retire early We also explore what you might do once youve retired early to best serve yourself and your community Thats not to say were all about philosophy We constantly have great articles about becoming a budgeting ninja hacking your savings rate and generally becoming a financial whiz Ultimately though we want you to join us as we journey and explore how to quit running how our finances affect our whole lives how to get out of the rat race and how to avoid being gored by the American dream Food and grocery shopping is a BIG part of CBB because food is a large part of the budget which people struggle the most with If you are someone who would rather buy convenience meals or products consider cooking homemade meals or baking from scratch Not only will you save money but you will be proud of what you accomplished and youll see that from the smiles on those you feed If you dont already know I have a second <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page called The Free Recipe Depot where I share recipes from other Food Bloggers from around the world I created this second <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page because I love food so much and I wanted to showcase only food and this is where
