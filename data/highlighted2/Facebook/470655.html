Verizon NYSE VZ are two of the best known dividend stocks around And for good reason the yields are a heady and respectively both well above the relatively meager or so yield offered up by SPDR SP ETF Trust NYSEARCA SPY But these two telecom giants appear to be taking different paths toward the future which is something to which youll want to pay increasingly close attention At one point ATT and Verizon were both largely land line telecommunications companies Essentially they owned the copper wires over which phone calls were made That was a great business up until the point when the wires were no longer needed because of cellular phones To their credit both companies made the decision to shift gears So for a long time Verizon and ATT were traveling the same path Two industry giants shifting from land line to cellular Because of their size and financial strength backed by their legacy businesses theyve been able to dominate the cell business Cell service in this country is basically a duopoly with ATT and Verizon leading the way The cell business in the United States however is largely mature at this point And that means ATT and Verizon need to do something else if they want to grow Where to go from here though is a question that can be answered in many different ways ATT has been doubling down on owning pipes For example it bought its way into the Mexican cellular market and acquired DirecTV Both are interesting investments Mexico is basically an international expansion play that happens to be right next door While ATT is a small fry in the Mexican market it has the experience name brand and clout to be a real competitor over time It isnt likely to be an easy path but its one down which ATT has gone before DirecTVs satellite TV service meanwhile is a slightly different business but one that fits well with what ATT does overall And it puts the company in a better position to deal with the content creators that use its pipes to reach consumers that are increasingly watching video anywhere and everywhere So the path that ATT has gone down is pretty similar to the one its been oncontrol the pipes to the end customer Verizon meanwhile has recently been doubling down on a different idea Advertising and content To do this it acquired AOL and is in the process of buying much of Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO It appears that the goal is to build up an advertising business that can compete with companies like Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Google and increasingly dominant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB The logic for this approach is solid in that controlling advertising has been the key driver of Googles success And more important it seems like a business that has a lot of potential as more people shift toward mobile an area in which Google isnt as dominant However the way in which Verizon is choosing to compete is by acquiring laggard and perhaps tired old Internet brands Thats not to suggest that AOL and Yahoo dont have loyal customers but that their business models have been passed by newer competitors Theres little doubt that Verizon has the financial strength to cobble these assets together The question is more about what it will really be able to make out of the businesses its buying Theres a lot of upside potential in many ways as it could provide Verizon with a new and very different business to grow But theres also more risk because in the end this could all be wasted money time and effort if putting together struggling internet companies leads to nothing more than a bigger struggling internet company If you own ATT or Verizon what you need to pay attention to is changing At one point it was the same for both companies the cell business Now however their paths are diverging and the question marks are increasingly different For ATT you need to keep watching cellular but increasingly need to think about growth south of the boarder In addition you need to think about the delivery of content in new ways DirecTV and how size helps create value for ATT as it negotiates with content creators These issues really arent that new for the company they are just a different variation on the theme But they will be key bigpicture drivers of growth Verizon meanwhile appears to be going down a very different path In the future youll need to start thinking more about advertising and original content Thats a big change from Verizons history It could prove to be prescient but it could also prove to be a huge waste of shareholder money too Either way though if you own Verizon you have to think about its future in a different way than you likely have been In the end ATT and Verizon are on increasingly divergent paths If you own either or both the companies arent the same as they were just a few years ago And youll want to increasingly pay attention to the changes being made If you dont you might wake up one day to find that you dont recognize the company you own anymore And that could have major implications for the dividend payments youve grown accustomed to receiving Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
