campaign to replace Yahoo Incs YHOOO board of directors is being welcomed by some investors who have grown impatient with the faded Internet pioneers drawnout process of selling its Web business Starboard which owns about percent of Yahoo said last week it was seeking to remove the entire board of the company after pushing for changes since Four years after Marissa Mayer took over as chief executive and promised a turnaround Yahoo continues its struggle to keep up with Alphabet Incs GOOGLO Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc FBO in the battle for online advertisers Yahoo shares have risen about percent since March the day before Starboard called for the changes The stock has fallen percent over the past months but is up percent so far in More than a halfdozen investors of various sizes and investment strategies contacted by Reuters this week including an executive at one of Yahoos largest shareholders all praised Starboards move as one that would help provoke necessary changes Many investors declined to comment making it hard to determine if Starboards move would succeed The shareholders who spoke represent a small percentage of what Starboard would need to take control of the board Yahoo declined to comment for this article In February Yahoo said it would auction off its core business while attempting to split its stakes in Chinese ecommerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABAN and Yahoo Japan from the rest of the business Yahoo holds a percent stake in Alibaba and a percent stake in Yahoo Japan Some investors said they have become disenchanted with Mayer Others said they were never fans of her but bought the stock expecting strategic moves that would boost its value Theres going to be overwhelming support for the Starboard slate if there is not material value creation ahead of the annual meeting through an asset sale said Jeff Lignelli chief executive of Incline Global Management in New York which owns about a million of Yahoos roughly million shares outstanding Lignelli said he began buying Yahoo shares two years ago We werent necessarily Mayer fans but we were fans of the future of Alibaba and other parts of Yahoo he said adding he would now support the dissidents Ted Chen a portfolio manager at Water Island Capital in New York which has about shares of Yahoo said his firm also would likely support Starboards slate of directors if no deal is reached before the annual meeting in the summer We have lost some faith in this board doing the right thing Chen said I want to make sure we have a chaperone in the boardroom Last week after Starboards announcement Yahoo set an April deadline for preliminary bids which could yield a deal by June or July before the annual meeting the Wall Street Journal has reported Yahoo whose core Internet business includes search mail and news sites said it has improved the Web properties by focusing on mobile social networking native advertising and video Starboards goal of selling the core business is in line with Mayers plan and in a public letter on Thursday Starboard wrote that it wanted to ensure a full and fair sale process The same management team and Board that has failed shareholders for years wants shareholders to entrust them with one of the most crucial decisions yet to be made Starboard founder Jeffrey Smith wrote referring to the auction Analysts said that after years of failing to restore growth Yahoos management has a credibility problem with investors who see a deal raising asset value Whats taking place now puts the current boards feet to the fire said Victor Anthony analyst at Axiom Capital Brian Wieser an analyst at Pivotal Research Group predicted that Starboard would easily win a proxy fight Mario Gabelli whose investment firm owns million Yahoo shares and several others said they would likely support only some of Starboards slate Gabelli said he would not want to give Starboard control of Yahoo without a significant premium but that it would be important to send a message to Yahoo leadership Something has to be done he said Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news
