contributed of the SPs growth rate excluding the EPS benefit of the companys massive buyback program Furthermore roughly of the nearly jump in Tech margins since is attributable to Apple alone However that was all in the past this quarter Apple is actually forecast to subtract from the SPs bottom line The reason the iconic company is expected to report its first ever yearoveryear decline in iPhone unit sales at million iPhone sold this will represent a steep drop from a year ago The slowdown in Apples iPhone sales has been documented here previously both through channel checks and most recently from media reports suggesting the company itself is dramatically slowing down production This has been a bitter pill to swallow for the throngs of raving sellside analysts most recently Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt lowered his fullyear outlook on iPhone sales to million units earlier this week on meaningfully lower average selling prices The consensus estimate is calling for iPhone unit sales of million for fiscal compared to a record million last year Worse compounding these issues are signs people are upgrading their phones less frequently than they used to a slowdown in demand in China and expectations that the new iPhone SE and Apple Watch are selling below expectations Some other key observations The current mean EPS estimate for the company for Q is compared to yearago actual EPS of If Apple reports a yearoveryear decline in EPS for Q it will mark the first time the company has reported a yearoveryear decline in EPS since the calendar third quarter of fiscal fourth quarter of for Apple However while AAPL has posted declining EPS before this will be the first time in which the company will also reported an annual drop in iPhone sales As Factset adds as a result of the decline Apple is expected to be the largest contributor to the blended earnings decline for the Information Technology sector for Q The blended combines actual results for companies that have reported and estimated results for companies yet to report earnings decline for the Information Technology sector is Excluding Apple the blended earnings decline for the sector would be If Apple reports actual EPS equal to or below the mean EPS estimate for the quarter it will mark the first time Apple has been the largest detractor to earnings growth for the Information Technology sector since the calendar third quarter of And just like iPhones were a key driving force behind the profit growth of the SP now comes the payback over the past three years on average the iPhone product segment has accounted for nearly of the total revenues generated by Apple In four of the past five quarters the iPhone product segment has reported yearoveryear revenue growth in excess of However last quarter Q the segment reported yearoveryear revenue growth of only For Q the segment is projected to report a yearoveryear revenue decline of If the iPhone product segment does report a yearoveryear decline in sales for the calendar first quarter it will mark the first yearoveryear decline in iPhone sales since FactSet began tracking sales for this product segment in the calendar fourth quarter of Revenue sellside analysts expect Apple to report revenue of billion according to FactSet down from billion in the same period last year Contributors on Estimize according to Marketwatch are forecasting revenue of billion In January Apple forecast revenue between billion and billion for the quarter The company fell slightly short of the FactSet consensus estimate last quarter but beat expectations in the five straight quarters before that Stock reaction Shares of Apple have increased from three months ago underperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average which is up nearly The stock is down from months ago while the index has stayed relatively flat It recently entered and exited a bear market Earlier this week Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner forecast that Apple shares would trade at a discount as her analysts found that SP companies with more than a index weight tend to trade at a roughly discount to the markets forward PE multiple What to watch for According to MarketWatch China has been a bright spot for Apple for several quarters recall the infamous Tim Cook email to Jim Cramer on August but the worlds largest consumer market is starting to become saturated with smartphones which is slowing the pace of growth there Adding fuel to the fire are reports that Chinese regulators this week shut down Apples online book and movie services in the country as it tightens guidelines on media Macroeconomic issues continue to weigh on sales growth not only in China but in other regions across the world Since Apples firstquarter earnings report in January analysts have grown more skeptical on whether the company can maintain the pace of growth it experienced during the heyday of the iPhone Deutsche Banks Scriber who has a neutral rating and month price target on the stock said that longterm fundamentals suggest topline growth will be more challenging going forward Last month BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said there appears to be a structural change underway in the pace of upgrades which could weigh on sales growth long term Despite all the criticism other analysts are more optimistic that Apple will be able to get through the nearterm trauma by building out its software and services platforms Earlier this month Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said analysts were underestimating and underappreciating the potential growth of services such as Apple Pay Apple Care Apple Music and iCloud Tue ___________ Tue nuubee How many more different ways can they bring a inch touchscreen computer to you At some point you have

ZeroIntelligence monopolyToo bad you didnt switch to the Android wagon with meyou couldve bought a Galaxy Note at roughly the same time as your Apple and you could still be running that Note to this day just like I do In all seriousness when I read the pg Steve Jobs bio a few years ago I came to the conclusion like many other people that Apple will never be the same company without him He was the embodiment of a complete lunatic perfectionist CEO and basically singlehandedly drove his employees to innovate No hardware software or firmware would have ever been released that was not without the tiniest flaw unlike wave after wave of botched OS and iOS updates that the Apple fanclub has been forced to live through for the past few years Very sad story Tue NTaREALmerican Will they beat
