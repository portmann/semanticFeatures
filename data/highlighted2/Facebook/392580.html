leave very little room for criticism said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter who called the operating margin a good surprise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>did not offer details on sales of its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset but emphasized that it was early days and said that sales would not significantly impact revenue The results come after
