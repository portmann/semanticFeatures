style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>made it known last week that it wants to be best friends with small businesses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>joins a long line of players who want to friend small businesses SMBs have to believe that when customers go searching for the product or service that they are seeking that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a place that theyll turn to initiate that search and then buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>joins a long line of players who want to friend small businesses from alternative lenders to mobile payments players to card issuers to acquirers to eCommerce marketplaces You name it everyone and his mother wants the SMB on their team Just to put some metrics to it in the US percent of all businesses have fewer than employees thats a little more than million nonfarm businesses All in businesses with fewer than workers about million of them employ about percent of the active workforce and drive nearly percent of GDP We track the health of a particular category of small business we call them store front businesses each quarter and produce the Store Front Business Index that benchmarks how well they are doing Think of storefront businesses as the local establishments that are the bedrock of communities local grocers coffee shops restaurants convenience stores nail salons and hair dressers the dry cleaner the yoga studio etc We also think theyre the bellwethers of how vibrant local economies are But all small businesses storefronts or otherwise face big business challenges finding new customers and growing their businesses Thats why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is so appealing to so many SMBs billion monthly active users globally is a pretty big pond in which to fish for new business So it shouldnt come as much of a surprise that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>reports million active business pages on its platform and a lot of small business advertisers Some reports even suggest that as many as million of those businesses buy advertising on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Judging from last weeks earning call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would like even more of that action to come from more of those small businesses As announced during their earnings call <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is doing a bunch of things to tie SMBs even closer to them Local Pages will become more robust with separate tabs for Video and for Shopping Call to Action buttons will initiate outbound messaging A Photos tab will link Instagram content to Pages Monitoring and managing Pages even via mobile devices is now made easier thanks to an improved UX For the SMB <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has made their use of different aspects of their platform Messenger and Instagram and Timeline quite seamless Concurrently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is also making a push for more video content from those SMBs Their latest stats suggest that billion videos a day are uploaded from some million users and that some million SMBs share video content daily with their user base Video content is pushed further up on a users newsfeed to encourage even more producers of video content Of note is the fact that percent of those videos are now being loaded directly from users to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform If youre Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL thats a pretty scary and somewhat recent shift Until recently most of the video on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform came via YouTube By all accounts <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is positioning Local Pages as the online presence that these SMBs could never afford themselves to build free loaded with valuable features and functions and that big added value of course of being discovered by the massive number of users it attracts on a daily weekly and monthly basis And for those users to become customers All of course within the comfort of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>walled garden Those users still have to find that local business and its Local Page on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>That can only happen if a user already knows that a business has a Local Page and checks it out regularly as part of the minutes they spend now on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>each time they visit Or if the business pops up in the newsfeed of customers or potential customers Thats much tougher to achieve organically Just liking a Local Page or a business is no guarantee that all updates will appear in that users newsfeed especially when that business is small with a correspondingly small fan base Thats the crux of the conversion problem and Facebooks SMB recruiting challenge One that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has to solve in order to really become best friends for life with SMBs If a SMB has to spend time and energy marketing to a customer so that they can find them on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>there needs to be a demonstrable ROI to throw ad spend in that direction especially when so many other options are available that can help them find customers in their local markets I know a little bit about this from some work that I did a few years ago helping to entrepreneur a social commerce platform that would live on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>fan pages of local businesses The target audience was SMBs for the very same reasons that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has wrapped arms around them most of them had crappy websites that at that time didnt even enable commerce They also didnt do much to market their services well were desperate for new business and knew that all of their customers and prospective customers were on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>In the restaurant space where the website crappinessmeter hits an alltime high and where theres actually a dearth of websites the problem was even more acute Local restaurants had invested money into building a fan base on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but had no way to convert those fans into paying customers When presented with an opportunity to do that via an easy technology solution that would become part of their existing page that would also allow that experience to go viral and that would allow them to control every aspect of the message and the offer it almost sounded too good to be true One things for sure it all sounded great in PowerPoint And worked pretty well in a few pilots and test trials Separate tabs on what we now call Local Pages allowed customers to make purchases in this case egift cards with an incentive to make the purchase and it worked like a champ Technology was slick payment was flawless redemption at the restaurant was easy SMBs had a wizard that they could use to customize their pages and their experiences and their offers and pricing Messaging with photos which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>algorithms love were posted on Local Pages timelines and displayed beautifully There was only one problem those posts never made it to the users newsfeed Say hello to The Great <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>SMB Conversion Challenge Its now wellknown that only percent of the entire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>audience sees a post That wasnt common knowledge a few years back it wasnt even published Disgruntled brands forced the disclosure You probably remember all of the mania that brands were engaging in around getting likes so that brands could communicate with those fans one on one Turns out that made a lot of agencies who designed like campaigns rich but didnt do much to drive conversion and new business I also suspect that an awful lot of likes came from marketing companies that paid people in places like Bangladesh to like their clients Forrester reports that top brands only reach about percent of their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>audience reach as in they ever see a post And that percent of those who are reached do interact with a post That means that if youre a small business with fans and thats at the high end for most SMBs only a tiny fraction of those fans might ever see a post and click through to the page where offers are positioned When the conversion math dust settles getting percent of percent of a fan base of doesnt yield a number that gets many SMBs terribly excited But buying ads on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is really expensive Lots of SMBs do often because its the only marketing they do What SMBs must now contemplate is where they have the potential to gain the most bang for their marketing buck Thats also why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues to invest in functionality to make the SMB presence on their platform even more appealing You can see from their quarterly results that theyre dumping a ton of money into their platform and marketing to get among other things SMBs on board including as a commerce partner Who could blame them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants and needs SMBs to get on board Theyre an adbased platform now competing with Google Search and YouTube for ad dollars Its no accident that it wants to get more deeply into Search and why video is such a huge focus More channels for ad dollars to be derived And who can blame the SMB for playing along Its a pretty compelling sales pitch when the value proposition is the ability to leverage the assets and sophistication of a global social network that a SMB could never replicate in a million years But it remains to be seen if Local Pages will work as advertised for Local Businesses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a global behemoth but most SMBs dont need that they just want to do business with local customers and lots more of them If they have to do the work and spend the money to find customers in their own backyards and push them to a page on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>where they then transact with them the big question is whether thats a better return on their investment than pushing them to a website thats under their control instead When asked percent of SMBs who do advertise on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>dont know if they are getting the ROI on that investment Its that uncertainty that now gives SMBs pause especially since there are also a number of other options to get visibility access to customers that other aggregators or platforms have assembled and distribution The old standbys eBay NASDAQ EBAY Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Yelp NYSE YELP and Craigslist are strong contenders As are lots of creative new channels including Google Now and mashups of issuers with consumers and mobile payments platforms with local merchant relationships a la Chase NYSE JPM Pay and LevelUp that have the potential to deliver millions of relevant customers to local businesses Depending on the business good oldfashioned SEOoptimized content and Google Search could also work just fine Websites are also pretty cheap to build these days and there are lots and lots of options now for paymentenabling those sites and SaaS services that make it easy and cheap for those sites to be as robust as any SMB needs them to be SMBs have to believe that when customers go searching for the product or service that they are seeking that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a place that theyll turn to initiate that search and then buy not Amazon not Pinterest not Google and not Yelp That might be a big leap So far social commerce on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been a bust Users go to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to be entertained and informed not to shop or buy stuff Its true that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a huge driver of traffic to news and eCommerce sites but whether a consumer that would otherwise click off her newsfeed to the local retailer would instead click through and buy from that retailers fan page remains unproven Of course thats not to say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is irrelevant for SMBs But instead of being the only commerce and payments friend they have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could end up being one of many competing for
