Seeking Alpha article claims now is the time to short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The article ignores the true customers of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Ive written several articles on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB all of which have been seasonal or risk management strategies see them here here and here I have not yet written a long case or short case article until today Luckily at least one of my articles has made a difference I hope that this article also can make a difference I dont want to see anyone go short on FB without an adequate reason Recently a trending article on Seeking Alpha has in my opinion presented a weak case to short FB I wish to give you a dissenting view In Seattle Contributors NYSE SC recent article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the case was made that FB is overvalued and that investors should sell or even short the stock Although I read the article in full I was not convinced that FB is overvalued Assuming overvalued means overpriced SCs article posits that the fundamentals of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a company do not back the valuation of the stock SCs article primarily focuses on the slowing growth in the user base User base growth necessarily must slow because it is a logarithmic function capped by a practical maximum number of users The fact is that a couple years ago you can essentially state without error that everyone with an internet connection who wants to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is already using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>this is well known To focus on the slowing and ultimate capped growth in users tells us nothing about the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>except that theyve dominated the social media market Other measurements of growth are conveniently ignored If I were to look at the growth of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I would check the most important fundamentals for the company which we will do in our next section Mistake Confusing Users for Clients <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does not make much money from its users The vast majority of its revenue comes from advertisers The user base is moreorless set at the current levels but the number of companies moving into digital marketing is a growing demographic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is always the best place to begin advertising I said it when I was a marketer and Ill say it again If your ad doesnt work on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it wont work anywhere In my experience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>beats any other advertising medium on ROI for the advertiser to me this alone is a perfect explanation as to why FB continues to rise while Twitter NYSE TWTR continues to fall The measurement for growth should not be the user base but rather statistics related to cash flows which come from advertisers If I were to perform a growth analysis on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I would look at the following statistics and their trends Free cash flow is on the rise and does not appear to be slowing We should take this as evidence that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is improving its ability to draw money from advertisers That big B valuation includes B of invested capital Thats for a company that is basically nothing more than information stored on servers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not a small company by any means and the capital invested is on the rise its still in its growth phase according to this statistic Sales revenue is still growing The line looks almost exponential Sales are certainly not slowing Common equity is on the rise making the company increasingly safer for its investors in the event of significant losses Common shares outstanding have not decreased significantly over the past year implying that the rise in FBs price is unrelated to any buybacks That is the rise in stock price is likely tied to true fundamentals rather than artificial inflation at the hands of the company The fact that shares are increasing at the same time the stock price increases implies that FBs share price growth should be faster than what weve seen over the past year CROIC is again on the rise approaching its alltime high Overall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is growing from all important fundamental aspects We dont see any slowing growth either at least where it matters FB is still a growth stock A company that slows in growth doesnt necessarily fall Most of the big players in each industry start as a growth stock and matures as a value stock I believe this is what is happening with Apple NASDAQ AAPL Slowing growth is not a short opportunity It is rarely a sell opportunity Buying a growth stock with slowing growth is an opportunity to buy a future value stock at a discount A company with a monopoly can see slowing growth without feeling any pain It can even see negative growth without much impact A monopoly can keep a company afloat through a recession <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a monopoly They monopolize two things social media and digital advertising Because they monopolize the former they can monopolize the latter Shorting a company with a monopoly is a bad idea Selling a monopoly growth stock is a bad idea because growth slows is a bad idea You only short a monopoly growth stock when it begins to lose its monopoly My Exploiting
