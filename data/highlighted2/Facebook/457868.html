style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has had an incredibly strong performance in the market for years Thats what has led the stock to a value of well over per share from its opening price below just a few years ago However some analysts have been quoting as saying that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could grow to break the per share mark These analysts point to virtual reality as the reason However is per share a realistic expectation for FB The Most Interesting Part Of These Types Of Predictions Surrounding FB Theres no doubt that Mark Zuckerberg is a genius Theres also no doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the leader in the social media space However the predictions that say that the stock will reach per share say very little about the gains coming from social media Lets face it When we talk about FB were talking about a social media giant that has turned its website into a way of life for many Sometimes I think that my fiance her mom heck even my mom might die if the website were to ever go offline for good However the analysts that see the stock more than doubling in value see the future of Facebooks profits coming largely from virtual reality Find out how you can trade stocks like the pros without major time commitments If this is the case it will definitely be a tidal shift for the company In order to make it big in virtual reality <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be selling products not advertising At the end of the day thats a completely different business model Is Per Share Profitable With The Help Of VR First and foremost I can say that Zuckerberg didnt shell out more than billion to get involved in an industry that he didnt think would be profitable Who would However will VR really have the ability to more than double the total value of FB In my opinion the answer is yes You see with Oculus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt simply going to offer a gaming experience Sure gaming is going to be a big part of it but thats not all Oculus will do The truth is that Zuckerberg sees augmented reality and virtual reality as a wave of the future This is how he believes people will be searching the web purchasing products and you guessed it socializing This gives FB a pivotal edge above the competition You see FB can use its social network to turn oculus not only into an augmented reality experience but to give users a way to share their experience with other users The depth of knowledge that the company has in the social networking space will give it all the tools it needs to drive Oculus to be a leader in Virtual Reality With all of that said a share is long off However its not completely out of the question If the company is able to realize the level of success that it has in social media but to do it through virtual reality as well the sky really is the limit If youre buying the stock in hopes that it will climb to per share over the next quarter or even over the next year youre making a bad move However I wouldnt say not to buy it Historically FB has had incredibly strong performance and continues to make moves that will push the stock to grow further Regardless of whether or not is hit there are profits to be made here Learn how to trade smarter risk free Find winning trades in
