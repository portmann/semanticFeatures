asset class performance yield and more check out the ETF Hub ETF Hub Facebooks live video release wasnt up to par <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock is still a buy but it is leaving room for Periscope to control the live video space Twitter is a buy because live video will have massive earnings potential because it is more engaging than regular video content Jim Cramer often refers to the market as the Wall Street Fashion Show This description is apt in describing the stock performance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Twitter NYSE TWTR <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is clearly in vogue while Twitter is hated by most investors I bought some more Twitter at because I believe the negative stock momentum doesnt reflect what is happening at the company This article reevaluates the live streaming landscape now that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>entered the fray this week with its celebrityonly live capability which works through the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Mentions app I continue to think Periscope is in a great situation to disrupt online video <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>recently came out with the ability to stream live video on its website <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been verifying many users in the past few weeks likely in anticipation of this release Having the correct accounts verified was important since the live streaming capability was only available to these accounts Having a verified account now has a more important meaning This launch should not be a surprise to any investors <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has seen Periscope reach million active users and doesnt want to get left out of the action As a shareholder in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I am highly disappointed in what was released I am not saying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cant become successful in the future but so far this has been a step in the wrong direction for the firm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a billion company which has over a billion users yet its livestreaming capability is much worse than Periscope which was acquired for less than million by Twitter earlier this year It is difficult to give a full assessment of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live because I cant find any to watch live I have been messaging the Twitter account for Sympl TV which is a discovery platform for live streamers and they told me they couldnt find any live streams to watch either I tried to like celebrity accounts on my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but I have yet to see one live I have watched many replays of live streams There have been many glitches where the stream unexpectedly crashed It made the Rock jokingly threaten to call Mark Zuckerberg to get him to come fix the service The replay streams did not show the comments on the screen like the screenshots <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>promoted which are shown in live streams This made it difficult to understand what was going on Streamers do not repeat the questions they are answering so it was akin to watching a press conference where you cant hear the question that was asked The livestream by Lindsey Vonn wasnt great because she didnt answer any of the questions This made it great for replay viewers but pointless for live viewers The idea of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>launching live exclusively to verified users may have been the exact wrong thing to do I have read complaints that Periscope and Meerkat streams are lowquality because the streamers are nobodies I disagree with this completely I would rather watch a video where someone who isnt famous answers my question than watch a celebrity film without responding to questions In essence <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>management pulled a Jack Dorsey For those who arent aware Jack Dorsey ignored the Periscope stream when his team recorded the conference call Livestreams of celebrities will generate traffic but a high percentage of those views have come from replays Replays were likely highly promoted by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to make it look like it had a big success with the new announcement For example Matthew Santoro filmed a video where he received livestream viewers and total views This is much different from Periscope where livestreams generally get more views than replays I talked to the Periscoper Ashley Daniels who has followers She told me in general a replay getting of the views of a livestream would be the highwater mark Clearly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a massive audience of users so it isnt surprising that Matthew Santoros livestream did well He said typically he receives viewers on Periscope which was less than his views on his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stream <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was smart in its release as it only gave users a notification of the stream if they recently interacted with the celebrity who was streaming It would clearly be annoying if you got a notification from someones page that you liked years ago This annoyance is a part of the problem with having streams on Facebooks newsfeed Twitter does it better because the streams are highlighted on the Periscope app and are just regular tweets on Twitter On Twitter native video Vines and pictures take up space in the feed but Periscopes just show links With the release of Project Lightning Periscopes will be more prominent but it will be curated so the experience is easily digestible There has been discussion about whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will ever give this live streaming feature to everyone Brian Fanzo filmed a Periscope where he guessed since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>rolled out the feature through its Mentions app instead of Messenger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>didnt have plans to roll it out to everyone The other side of the argument is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was just using celebrities to test it out The feature had glitches for celebrities imagine how poor the experience would have been for millions of people trying it at once Going back to the former argument the addition of streaming may not be great for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users because it would clog the newsfeed As I mentioned Periscope doesnt overwhelm the Twitter experience It could be problematic for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Periscopes launch has gone smoothly because it has grown over time I wouldnt describe the growth as slow but if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>just launched the feature at once it would have this same growth in hours instead of months If everyone on the feature was new to it it would lead to subpar content which would be even worse than the content which was initially on Periscope This is why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>should utilize the feature in a separate app The situation may not even work out for celebrities since replays make up such a large percentage of views Why bother making a lowquality stream If you make an edited video it will get almost the same amount of traffic anyway My fear is we are seeing a trend toward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>creating two classes of people The celebrity class gets certain treatment while the rest of us dont get these features This is what has already occurred with video Only video creators with millions of followers are allowed to participate in the ad partnership program There has also been a problem with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>failing to stop stolen video from being reuploaded under a different account without paying the original creator the amount of money the video earned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I mentioned the possibility of Periscope only allowing video to last longer than hours for verified users to Ashley Daniels She strongly disagreed with this idea because it would be creating two classes of people This is the point of Periscope it allows users to see another persons world without feeling that they are any better than you Celebrities and other scopers are on the same level of the viewers This is the exact opposite of what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is doing which makes me decry its actions Periscope will be the first opportunity for Twitter to create a partnership program like YouTube I would be strongly in favor of Twitter going down the YouTube path instead of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>path Content creators need to be respected and compensated well or else the quality of content will decrease Parachute is already creating a scheduled network for content creation on Periscope Once Periscope has ads in the next few years I hope it plans on compensating the creators properly This creates a relationship with the creators This creates a moat which prevents scopers from jumping ship to the next popular app So what does this launch mean for Periscope It will have no effect on downloads and engagement in the next few quarters Periscope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Meerkat can all do well without bumping into each other Meerkat certainly has the lowest probability of success since it doesnt have its own social network to share content on The way I look at the landscape is Meerkat has the best features Periscope has the second best features and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the worst features The order is reversed for the amount of distribution with Meerkat having the least Periscope having the second most and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>having the most This puts Periscope in the sweetspot What will determine who wins in the battle with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is whether Periscope can maintain its lead in terms of features Looking back at what I anticipated happening in this space I knew <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would come out with some sort of response to Periscope The fact that it had a response so quickly shows how important <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>thinks the category can be I would have been worried for Periscope if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had bought Meerkat because it has a lot of great features This clearly did not happen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has decided to create it inhouse Without any ranking system which hearts provide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will have a difficult time at finding traction What will determine which stream gets a higher ranking in your newsfeed Watch time Watch time isnt as good as hearts which provide proper feedback As you can see below Periscope has been trending higher as it is now the th most downloaded app in the App Store Facebooks streaming capabilities only work for iPhone as of today while Periscope works with both of the major app stores Periscope has to gain enough popularity before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>gets its act together if it wants to be successful Meerkat wasnt able to run up the scoreboard before Periscope was launched but Periscope will have a better chance since it is in the sweetspot Periscope has greater distribution than Meerkat and a firstmover advantage over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>In conclusion as a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shareholder I am very disappointed with Facebooks answer to Periscope It could have added the feature to Instagram if it wanted to limit the exposure to beta test it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>needs a separate streaming app for it to work out in the long term <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>already has WhatsApp Messenger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram so creating another platform may be awkward What would be even more awkward would be seeing my friends all hold up an iPhone to their faces and answer comments <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>mainly connects the user with hisher friends Periscope and Twitter connects the user with anyone in the world I dont want to watch my friends livestream I want to walk the streets of Paris or Rome with a person I would never otherwise meet Periscope brings you closer to everyone in the world Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has done a poor job at responding to Periscope I remain bullish on Twitter stock I still will continue to own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock because it will continue to get an increased amount of ad dollars to equal the amount of time people spend on its platforms I am also a believer in Instagram growing into a mainstream app I already consider it to be a mainstream app but lately investors have been describing Twitters million users as a niche product Therefore I will go along with their lingo and say Instagram is going to go from niche to mainstream in the next few years Source <span
