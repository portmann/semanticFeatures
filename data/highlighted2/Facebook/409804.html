Reasons Why Im Not Buying Apple Right Now Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha Apple shares will likely be range bound and moderately lower in the near to midterm Innovation cycle may be entering a malaise Im going to get right to the heart of the subject matter as to why investors should avoid buying Apple NASDAQ AAPL shares There will be no prioritization of reasons to avoid buying shares of AAPL While I believe Apple to be one of the strongest companies with regards to innovation execution and products that have become ubiquitous in the world I also believe the company has run up against a brick wall on all fronts The magnificent amount of selling pressure on AAPL has offset most any impact from buyers of shares This selling pressure began prior to the release of Q results Upon the delivery of missing Q expectations and lowered fullyear guidance that selling pressure exacerbated Ultimately sellers outweighed buyers over the last couple of weeks and found shares of AAPL briefly dipping below a share Some very wellknown and widely respected investors and fund managers had been selling relatively large positions in shares of AAPL including Carl Icahn and David Tepper With such heavy selling pressure on shares of AAPL due to much lowered FY guidance that anticipates declines in earnings and revenues I believe shares will moderate lower over the next days at least As it pertains to Apples hardware and product lineup most every segment has found itself with declining sales as of Q results and on a YOY basis Furthermore the companys flagship iPhone product has now exhibited its first ever sales decline And its not just that the iPhone units shipped and unit sales are declining it is that the category as a whole is on the decline Maybe this decline will be shortlived but maybe not With the iPhone drawing the most significant sales and profits for Apple and sales for iPhones expected to decline YOY I dont believe iPhone can offer Apple and investors anything meaningful when it launches later this year Sales for the iPhone may continue to decline beyond the iPhone based on what might be Apple and its peers closing in on market saturation for smart phones As such I believe it is optimal to avoid buying AAPL shares Here are some recent notes from Carolina Milanesi of Kanter Worldpanel ComTech to consider The user base isnt going to grow all that much for the foreseeable future Smartphone ownership has reached peak levels in key markets worldwide Carolina Milanesi chief of research at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech said in a report back in late February In North America percent of consumers own a smartphone In Europe that number jumps to percent In China the figure rests at percent This translates to markets with fewer and fewer firsttime buyers In order for Apple to grow iPhone sales again they need to not only advance the product into new regions and offer a less expensive handset but they also need to grab market share from the competitionat least That last line from Carolina Milanesi is a critical or crucial claim regarding future growth for iPhone sales Essentially it doesnt matter how much improvement is put into the new iPhone or the future iPhone What she is outlining is that iterations will not prove to grow units shipped but rather lower prices which likely mean lower gross profit and grabbing market share For all the discussion centered on the iPhone that is expected to only have slight improvements anyway the discussion may prove to be a moot point as Apple needs a new pricing strategy new regional distribution and added market share Apple has received a great deal of praise for its ability to introduce innovative products over the last years The reality is that the company has been a great follow on producer of already introduced products andor concepts Apple didnt introduce the MP player smartphone or tablet But Apple certainly built better devices with more aesthetically appealing design and application features What ultimately set Apple apart from its peers was the ability to converge technologies into singular platforms to produce a ubiquitous product like the iPhone The advancement of technology goes through boom cycles that then bring about a malaise in such advancement The s brought about the computer but it wasnt until the late s that the internet came into play From that point came the cellular phone and in the turn of the century the smartphone Beyond the smartphone though seems to lay a period of malaise that is developing and for which may take several years to bring about that next great technology The Apple Watch is not likely the form factor for the next ubiquitous technology if not for the form factor alone In developing smartwatches from Apple or its peers it seems as if hardware manufactures ignored what has dispatched with the watch industry the cell phone By and large people prefer to carry a cell phone than to wear a watch and the numbers speak for themselves What these hardware manufacturers attempted to do was to say No you dont want to get your data that way going forward and we dont need to implement new technologies or applications into the smartphone Based on sellthrough results from these products as tracked by NPD Group and other firms the greatest sales of smartwatches has come from the manufacturers selling them into retail locations but the retailers are finding it difficult to sell through to the consumer The results for most smartwatch manufacturers have been poor and worsening Apples poor results with the Apple Watch have been offered by various analysts and publications The Apple Watch being the biggest contributor to Apples sales in the Other category exhibited a sequential decline in the latest quarterly results even as the product had tens of thousands of expansionary retail doors to participate with But these results should have been expected given Apples decision to lower the price of the Apple Watch amongst other reasons Beyond the Apple Watch which will exhibit future iterations even an iteration that will be untethered to the iPhone it remains to be seen if Apple can innovate the next great iThing For now the world might find itself in a period of innovation malaise As a leadin to the next reason I would not be buying shares of AAPL I would like to offer an analyst note Oppenheimers Uerkwitz cutting his rating to Perform from Outperform writing that we believe that weaker performance seen in this quarter is likely to recur until s iPhone launch Investors are going to question the longterm investment prospects he believes As smartphones become a utility we believe consumers need more than incremental improvements to upgrade We expect Apple to make bold changes to support mobile VR Fast growing VR content and its promise as a brand new user interface are too enticing for Apple to ignore Recent acquisitions could position Apple to leapfrog its competition Questioning Our Faith in Apple We recognize the low valuation the strong cash flow the ironclad balance sheet and the recurring revenue opportunity from its active installed base We like Apple as a company but less so as an investment We believe investors will question if the best times have passed or if Apple can innovate no more As it was mentioned in the quoted analyst notes above Apple may add some applications centered on mobile VR Its been at least years since Ive been hearing that VR is coming VR is coming VR glasses were actually dreamed up of course by a science fiction writer Stanley G Weinbaum who wrote a tale in about a headset that made the wearer feel that he was in a different world Well VR is here and isnt amounting to much based on early sales and limitations on manufacturing and supply capabilities Pricing for VR has also been an impediment for consumer adoption What VR likely offers is much akin to what D televisions offered to consumers in the past As with Oculus Rift techies became enthused about the immersion of D televisions as if we were all bound for a threedimensional future But then within a year or two the popularity for D televisions peaked and demand dropped precipitously D television was not a new idea when it finally appeared in stores for consumers to purchase it just finally had a big marketing push with more effective technology With that more effective technology came a big price tag for what was better understood by consumers to be a novel experience and nothing more D television didnt solve a consumer problem or evoke a gamechanging need with regards to our television viewing experience VR likely will never exhibit such needs either but it is a cool experience once in a while that we choose to enjoy at theme parks and with a greater audience The audience is something VR fails to achieve in terms of sensation But dont let my bearish sentiment dominate this narrative as to why VR has been slow to come and wanting for greater sales lets read some bullish commentary from a recent article authored by Alpha Max titled Apple Is Making iPhone The Next Killer Device The author touts Apples new iPhone as bringing Apple into the era of VR I expect that the upcoming iPhone will be VRready driven by thirdparty hardware which can drive significant demand for the product from outside The basis of my expectation is investment firm Piper Jaffrays recent VR conference in which VR hardware companies participated as reported by Apple Insider One of the participants named IonVR said that the company could launch a VR HMD particularly for the iPhone IonVR believes that iPhone will offer proper VR experience to users with the help of thirdparty hardware IonVR has already developed such a device which is available for preorder for It has a proprietary optics technology called MotionSync which can significantly reduce VRassociated motion sickness VR has already gone mainstream Therefore its quite natural that iPhone users will want to use their iPhone for watching VR content With a host of iPhonecompatible VR HMDs coming to the market I believe iPhone s demand will rise remarkably and iPhone shipments will exceed all expectations According to Juniper Research over million VR devices will ship this year and the number could reach million by Since iPhone will be VRready its adoption will rise meaningfully driven by fresh demand from industrial customers from several fields including manufacturing medicine and real estate To learn more about the growth potential of VR in various industries Id recommend reading this article published in TechCrunch Pretty bullish stuff on Apple and its coming VR applicability no Unfortunately this is the furthest from the real depiction of the issues that continually surround VR and consumer adoption Additionally in no way shape or form has VR become mainstream Theres a big wow factor in trying out VR headsets or reading reviews by people who have done so But they have done so in trial situations where people are demonstrating the equipment This doesnt mean that the average person wants that experience several hours of VR a day every day of the week We need to find a way to go beyond the wow in order to make VR a part of our daily lives In short VR does nothing that the average consumer desires to use it for on a reoccurring basis Additionally VR for all its immersion capabilities forces us to put devices on our head I would think Apple understands this is not what most people want to do as evidenced in the massively declining sales for Beats By Dr Dre headsets that forced the company to move into aroundtheear and intheear headphones as opposed to onthehead headphones But then there are the actual sales forecasts that have been lowered and lowered yet again twice this year for VR products Superdata has lowered its expectations for virtual reality revenues in for the second time in as many months The market intelligence firm today revised its global VR hardware and software forecast down percent from billion to billion Its projection at the beginning of the year had been billion The revision came with the release of the firms Virtual Reality and the Next Killer App report which identified a number of reasons for the downgrade among them recent production and fulfillment issues that have affected the Oculus Rift the HTC Vive and even the Samsung Gear VR The report says about million Americans intend to purchase a VR headset this year but Superdata is only expecting shipments of million This year the firstever Vision Summit was organized by Unity which unveiled a tool that allows VR designers to create and manipulate virtual worlds while wearing headsets Unity CEO John Riccitiello cautioned the attendees at the Hollywood Highland Center that will not be the year that VR sees mainstream adoption and that the technology has been overhyped by the media It seems like every single decade since the movie Back To The Future VR has made an attempt at coming to the market in a big mainstream way At best VR has developed a small gamer usage community but splitting that community amongst large players doesnt help large corporations results like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL or Apple Im afraid that once again even with large corporations developing this hardware and software enabled device the end result will be the same another disappointment for VR This is just another reason I dont believe buying AAPL shares at present levels is optimal for investors Dont get me wrong VR makes for great headlines and it always has but the application of VR has never amounted to anything of significance In total it is difficult to surmise the next great hardware or software device coming from this current innovation cycle from Apple and I dont see anything in the VR world as developing such a compelling product Ive said it previously Apple is a hardwarecentric company Apple has clearly hit a peak in its business cycle which is centered on selling hardware devices to consumers and new consumers are hard to come by For this reason that is supported by Apples lowered guidance I think it better to look toward other investment vehicles that may not be so heavily levered to the consumer market The consumer is very fickle and found wanting for greater spending always With consumer spending being what it has been over the last couple of years discretionary spending has been hardpressed for growth Take a look at the following consumer spending trends related to retail sales Apple like any other hardware company needs consumer spending to grow or at the very least show proliferating purchase intent toward its products If consumption doesnt grow Apple needs to find new regional growth as noted earlier With retail sales all over the map YTD and trending toward the lowend of the growth scale over the last couple of years Apple and its peers have shown a similar trend in sales growth that may ultimately lead to further sales declines Im not sure if many have looked closely at the retail sales trends that led up to the crash and compared them with where we are in the retail sales cycle Looking at the chart above retail sales look ominously bearish midterm without a significant change to consumption habits Retail sales could impact Apples sales and profitability even further Lets face it the issue is not just Applecentric but also exhibited by Apples distribution partners like the retailers that have posted dismal Q results and lowered guidance Target NYSE TGT is the latest to disappoint with its quarterly results and lowered Q guidance In short the retailers may look to lighten their orders to Apple under the assumption that inventory levels need to be more closely monitored in order to lower cost of goods logistics and other operating expenses for the balance of the year All of this could impact Apple and shareholders through without a significant increase in overall consumption that has been tepid yeartodate In short shares of AAPL may not move all that much and find themselves range bound or as some call it dead money The recent rally in AAPL might find itself some legs and shares of AAPL may soon touch or a share As such this might be the best opportunity to lighten ownership if so inclined
