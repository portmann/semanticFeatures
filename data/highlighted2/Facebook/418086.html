class='textDiv'>Does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Have A Snapchat Problem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha When I invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I promised myself I would monitor the platform very closely to avoid a MySpace repeat When I first noticed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>showing signs of fatigue among younger users I was not worried because Instagram was extremely popular with this demographic Snapchat has recently overtaken Instagram as the most popular app amongst teens and this should be very alarming to investors However I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has diversified itself adequately and Mark Zuckerberg will continue to demonstrate his exceptional leadership and foresight <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB competitor Snapchat Private CHAT is firing on all cylinders The younger social media platform recently raised billion dollars for its quest to overthrow the current social media king This latest funding raises its valuation from billion to billion Its user base is growing at a healthy clip adding approximately users each day Lastly revenues are exploding In Snapchat produced million in The following year revenues were million Analysts are predicting anywhere between million to billion in revenues for The revenue projection is eerily similar to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in its early days as pointed out by Business Insider For a while Snapchat was primarily for teenagers and refrained from stepping on Facebooks turf all that much Even so Instagram kept the former at bay by claiming the spot for social network used by teens Just this spring Snapchat has officially wrestled that spot from Instagram Additionally Snapchats user base is no longer contained to teens and has seen people from all demographics join the network Back in November it was announced that Snapchat was garnering billion video views a day the same as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>That number has now been increased by Snapchat to over billion Even though the videos are considerably shorter this is still incredibly impressive seeing that Snapchat has around the DAUs as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Alright enough with the negatives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a couple of things going for it that Snapchat specifically does not First there are substantially more companies on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>than Snapchat and the site is better suited for companies to host a page which is usually the first step to converting that company into a paying advertiser Secondly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>contains a treasure trove of data on its users This data can be used to hyperfocus ad campaigns to make sure theyre viewed by the intended audience This second factor will be a large advantage to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>when vying for digital ad dollars The most successful digital ad campaigns highlight their ability to target and retarget segments of the population Lastly if live video takes off as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>imagines Snapchat will have to play catchup in developing an equally impressive feature to engage its users Mark Zuckerberg has not been sitting on the sidelines while Snapchats rise was occurring In fact he had the foresight to try to buy Snapchat in when it barely had any revenues and a modest user base <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has invested heavily in its video offerings brought live video online and increased the length of its Instagram video time restrictions Outside of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has nicely diversified itself It owns WhatsApp one of the largest messaging platforms in the world Moreover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could have a huge hardware and software business if the Oculus Rift works its way into hundreds of possible applications <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has more than just its core platform and Instagram However these are the only two segments generating a profit at the moment To an extent digital ad dollars are limited which means Snapchat could begin to eat away at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagrams revenues This makes Facebooks newer investments such as the Oculus Rift and WhatsApp all that more important I believe in Mark Zuckerbergs ability to navigate his company through hardships but I urge investors to closely monitor
