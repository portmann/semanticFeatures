out the conviction of a Pennsylvania man over threatening statements he made on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>toward his estranged wife law enforcement officers and children in a case touching upon the boundaries of free speech online The court ruled on an vote in favor of Anthony Elonis in a decision that could make it harder for people to be prosecuted for outbursts on social media Elonis served prison time for posting a series of statements on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in after his wife left him They are now divorced Seven justices voted to throw out his conviction while Justice Samuel Alito said he would have sent the case back to an appeals court to decide Were pleased that the Supreme Court saw the case for what it was an unprecedented criminal conviction for a crime of pure speech based on only a showing of negligence said Elonis lawyer John Elwood Elonis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>posts written in the form of rap lyrics talked about killing his wife knifing a female FBI agent and shooting schoolchildren After a court granted his wife a protective order against him Elonis posted Is it thick enough to stop a bullet The justices ruled that in order to prosecute Elonis it was not sufficient that a reasonable person would have interpreted his remarks as threatening but rather that Elonis had to have intended the words as threats Federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the results of an act without considering the defendants mental state Chief Justice John Roberts wrote of behalf of the court The case touched upon the rise of social media and how people use it to express strongly held feelings But the courts legal reasoning did not rest on free speech Instead the court held that Elonis needed to be aware of the threatening nature of his communication in order to be convicted Lower courts had said he could be held responsible regardless of whether he believed his messages could be viewed as threatening Todays decision properly recognizes that the law has for centuries required the government to prove criminal intent before putting someone in jail said Steven Shapiro national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union which filed court papers in support of Elonis That principle is especially important when a prosecution is based on a defendants words The Internet does not change this longstanding rule Shapiro added Kent Scheidegger legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation which filed court papers siding against Elonis expressed disappointment with the ruling saying that because of areas left unresolved by the justices it is possible that people who should be convicted might be acquitted Justice Clarence Thomas was the only member of the court who would have upheld the conviction outright He criticized the courts reasoning saying it throws everyone from appellate judges to everyday <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users into a state of uncertainty Elonis lawyers argued his statements were little different from lyrics by performers like rapper Eminem Elonis contended his remarks were meant as art or a form of therapy Another of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>posts by Elonis recounted a visit by an FBI agent in which he imagined murdering her Pull my knife flick my wrist and slit her throat Leave her bleedin from her jugular in the arms of her partner The Justice Department had argued that to bring a case prosecutors need only prove that statements could be interpreted as a threat by a reasonable person Alito partially disagreed with the outcome saying the appeals court should be given another opportunity to decide whether the conviction could be upheld Elonis was convicted of violating a federal law that outlaws sending a threatening communication and was sentenced to months in prison Last year the Philadelphiabased rd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the conviction Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency providing investing news world news business news
