ANGI has knocked down its paywall and we believe this is a signal that the company views FB as a serious threat Our bull thesis on FBs consolidation plans remains strongly intact due to FBs size ANGI has million unique visitors per month versus FBs billion monthly active user base On the capital front FB is much more financially equipped to launch a platform more comprehensive than what ANGI currently offers or plans to offer in the future We believe FB will add a feature to its platform that will ultimately consolidate this space and create significant churn for platforms like ANGIYELP We recently wrote on how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has the potential to take over both Yelp NYSE YELP and Angies List NASDAQ ANGI We pointed to an overlap of Services and Place as the tool FB would use to be a business and services discovery hub Since then ANGI has knocked down its paywall and we believe this is a signal that the company views FB as a serious threat in the local business and services discovery space While we believe knocking down the paywall is the right move for ANGI we view it more as an affirmation of FBs consolidation plans than anything else Our bull thesis on FBs consolidation plans remains strongly intact due to FBs size both from a financial standing more capital than other players in the space and a user base standing more users than other players in the space ANGI has million unique visitors per month vs FBs billion monthly active user base In other words for every person that visits ANGI each month use FB ANGI also has only million paid members and while this is up YY it shows drastically slowed growth from the member growth rate in The average membership renewal rate last year for ANGI was This is up from in but still indicates a rather high membership churn Granted knocking down the paywall will unequivocally increase traffic and bolster ANGIs monthly visitor numbers in the near term but this spike will almost surely keep that figure significantly below FBs billion MAUs As we have said before consolidation onto FBs platform here makes sense from a consumer standpoint To avoid repeating ourselves we will simply quote from our last article to briefly capture our sentiment here Individuals on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>post about everything from what they eat to where they shop to how they feel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>posts cover the gamut of options and service review is no exception <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>recently announced that it has more than million active business pages that collectively receive billion comments each monthOn <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>though you can see how many likes the place has how many people have checkedin there and which of your friends have been there Perhaps most importantly you can browse through all of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>posts related to the location This is all in addition to the reviews of the service There is plenty of data on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>that platforms like Yelp cannot offer In essence a local business search and directory ads service fits perfectly into Facebooks platform which is simply a collection of more a than billion peoples thoughts about everything On the capital front FB is much more financially equipped to launch a platform more comprehensive than what ANGI currently offers or plans to offer in the future ANGI is aiming for revenues of to million next year while analysts are looking for FB to net billion in revenue ANGI expects free cash flow to be breakeven in while FB netted billion in free cash flow in Q alone While FBs cash is certainly invested into multiple aspects of the business aside from business discovery we believe that FBs access to significantly more capital puts it at an immediate advantage over ANGI to create a more comprehensive platform We think it is also important to note here that ANGI has million participating service providers which is roughly unchanged YY and more or less equal to FBs million active business pages ANGI believes that knocking down its paywall will give it greater access to service providers and while this may be true in the near term we think that service providers will be more attracted to use FB in the long term This is again an issue of size FB will put the service in front of billion monthly users while ANGI will put the service in front of million monthly visitors While knocking down the paywall will likely provide a nearterm boost to ANGIs business we think the longterm story here remains unchanged We believe FB will add a feature to its platform some overlap of Services and Places that will ultimately consolidate this space and create significant churn for platforms like ANGIYELP I wrote this article myself and it
