class='textDiv'>Instagram Sees Posts Slowing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Instagram is seeing posts by users decline This is because only certain pictures are socially acceptable to be shared on the app There has been a new story circulating the web as now it appears the amount of sharing on Instagram is declining much in the same vain as original sharing has been declining on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB This means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is in double trouble as its app which was supposed to be capturing young people who share every waking moment of their lives on the internet has begun to peak If you take a feet approach while looking at social media Instagram is much more limited than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in its scope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been the go to place to connect with friends and family members Twitter NYSE TWTR is where you interact with people with similar interests who you may not know in real life Instagram was founded on the ability to share your best photos in a fashion that makes them look more professional or artsy because of filters which was a unique feature at the time it was launched Most readers can attest to the fact that they see the same picture on Instagram as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>anyway so the uniqueness of the app has eroded Twitter often provides examples of how a public official like the President or the Pope has used the app to make a pivotal statement While investors may scoff at this as storytelling I think there is an argument to be made that this makes the app more sustainable That has been proven by the way Twitter maintains its relevancy even as its user growth slows and stock declines I think if Twitter management recognized what goals the company should have it could be a sustainable business Instagram is a less serious platform than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter As has been spoken about endlessly Twitter isnt the most userfriendly social media app in the world Instagram has predicated its success on being user friendly as it made it easier to make your photos and now videos look better Although we have seen Instagrams monthly active users increase at a much faster clip than Twitters if the app has less necessary and serious content than its popularity is more in danger of being lost News isnt broken on Instagram The news of your family member having a baby is broken on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and the news of an international crisis is broken on Twitter Being cool is not sustainable If Instagram disappeared tomorrow would anyone notice My theory on serious content being more sustainable than selfies is supported by Snapchats Private CHAT movement towards bringing in traditional firms to have articles as well as its coalescence of users videos to create makeshift coverage of a news event Snapchat knows that it cannot rely on users taking pictures with silly filters forever so it is trying to use its popularity to pivot into being the center of the online conversation surrounding news events The reason these stories of declines in sharing n Instagram are shocking to some investors is because they see all the charts of users going up in a straight line The reality is total usage is the only thing that matters Monthly active users is a blurry picture daily users would be better of half the story with the other half being time spent per user Do you really think that usage on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram always goes up in a straight line When <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>went public the company was looked at with a microscope because it was in a new category Now when Instagram passes million monthly active users investors exclaim that now is the time to buy as if this number has any relevance You wont hear why Instagram posts are declining because a lot of journalists and investors covering the story dont use the app They get a random token teenager and ask himher what the best social media apps are and then make it into a news story The teenager doesnt have an analytical mind so the task of using your mind to get into what the teenager is thinking can be a difficult one The reason why Instagrams posts are declining is because the app is about perfection Pictures have to be flawless in order to be posted on the app Pictures have to be deemed Instagram worthy or else they are discarded On Snapchat users dont worry about what they are posting because there are no likes or comments and the content deletes after hours You just film your monotonous life to share it with your friends The competitive advantage Snapchat has over Instagram is that most people spent their lives doing boring things They dont go out to eat or go on vacation often which means there isnt a need to share on Instagram My assertion has been backed up by survey data As you can see in the Piper Jaffray survey Snapchat has now leapt above Instagram in usage among teens The trend towards Snapchat shows no signs of stopping As the app becomes used more prevalently it will start to eat into the time spent on Instagram Instagrams problem is that it is too important Because photos fill the whole screen unlike tweets each post is important If you post too much you are called a spammer If you use Twitter you can see actual spam bot accounts which post clickbait links But in Instagrams case users are calling their friends spammers Users discouraging their friends to post can work in the reverse for Instagram and cause it to lose its popularity Its like a popular girl in high school who dismissed every promposal she received and ended up with no date to the prom There has been possible changes to improve Instagram floated around One possibility is to add the ability to share a post like the equivalent of a retweet This would be terrible because users are already obsessive about what they see on their feed They do not want to see what the accounts they follow think is interesting If they did want to see that they can just go to the part of the app which has which shows what their friends are liking Its not as if Instagram will ever have a breaking news story that people must see anyway Adding a regram feature would be like adding to the character count on Twitter which users have balked at There is also proposals to add features such as video to Instagram This wont help either This concept that new features dont make a difference has gone against my previous analysis of Twitter when I was bullish on the stock Its the opposite of what you would think which is why its understandable for me to have been wrong The best example of this is Vine Vine is much easier to use and has much more features than it had when it was more popular Vine wasnt able to keep its creators on the platform as they moved to YouTube because Vine is too limiting of a form factor Inherent flaws in the makeup of a social media app are masked by popularity but then emerge when the fad fades Instagram is built on perfect pictures which limits sharing This is the inherent flaw in the app which cannot be changed no matter how many new features are added There is another thesis to the ark of social media firms which can never be distinctly proven That thesis is ads cause users to leave the social apps This means social users are not as valuable as expected because they can never be monetized fully since they will always leave if too many ads are shown This changes how investors value these firms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a story stock so the narrative matters more than other firms like an Exxon Mobil NYSE XOM The original narrative went <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>went public was that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was slowing This changed when investors saw the emergence of Instagram The only thing this did was buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>time Teens are now moving away from Instagram and towards Snapchat The less posting there is on the app the less Instagram becomes necessary It becomes a selffulling downward spiral to irrelevance No one knows if Instagram will be able to keep its importance among fickle teens so why buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock thinking Instagram has a lock on young users I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Short Ideas Technology Internet Information Providers
