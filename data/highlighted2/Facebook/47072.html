issued light guidance On the surface it appears as if Twitter is running out of growth runways Social media company Twitter NYSE TWTR is all over the news right now but this time for all the wrong reasons Twitter released pretty awful first quarter fiscal results Even though the company managed to deliver results that beat bottom line expectations after posting nonGAAP EPS of against expectations of the company reported revenue of million way below the million that analysts were looking for For the second quarter Twitter guided for revenue in the million million range well below the million consensus by analysts For the full year Twitter guided for revenue of billion billion again below the billion that analysts were expecting The report seemed to prove what some investors had feared all along that Twitter was quickly running out of growth runways Twitters shares tanked around after the disappointing earnings call Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB are some of the leading social media companies Both companies rely very heavily on ad revenue for their top line around for FB and for Twitter LinkedIn NASDAQ LNKD another leading social media company is not so reliant on ad revenue since only of the companys revenue comes from ads while close to comes from recruiters and hiring companies who pay LinkedIn to access potential job candidates on its platform These form the acronym MACE The infographic below helps explain how ad revenue growth for a social media company such as Twitter is calculated The Monthly Average User or MAU growth can be somewhat an extrinsic factor since a social media company does not have direct control over the number of users that joins its platform The company can only try to build an attractive platform that provides a great user experience then hope that people like it Twitters MAU grew yearoveryear to million which is a healthy growth rate When it comes to ad revenue social media companies have much more control over ad load and user engagement In fact these are two of the most important factors that can be used to determine the health of a social media company Twitters total engagements grew during the quarter which is a healthy growth rate especially when you consider that Twitter managed to achieve that against a backdrop of difficult comps because engagements had grown a hefty in the yearago comparable quarter But ad loads are an altogether different matter Trying to achieve an optimum ad load is usually quite complex because it involves a number of independent variables that have to be taken into account concurrently Increasing the ad load is usually effective in growing a companys revenue in the short term For one marketers will almost always prefer it when your ad load is high But overdoing it also can turn out to be counterproductive Increasing your ad load too much can easily upset your viewers and even turn them away from your platform As Nate Forrester observed increasing the volume of instream ads is great for interactive marketers but makes for a poor user experience a very critical component for a social media company This is the biggest dilemma that social media companies that rely very heavily on ad revenue like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter face In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was lambasted by marketers in for what they termed the practice by the company to display only a tiny fraction of marketers brand posts to viewers These marketers claimed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>showed each brand posts to just of its users To make matters worse they added that only of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ads leveraged the companys huge cache of social data to target relevant audiences which decreased user engagement As a result the marketers ranked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as their least favorite marketing platform As you can see from the infographic both Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>were rated poorly by marketers in the survey These marketers gripe was that both companies display ads to just a tiny fraction of their available audiences Mind you when marketers were saying this about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>its ad load was around Later that year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doubled its ad load to around And that brings me to the main point of my thesis Twitters ad load currently is just Thats way lower than Facebooks ad load when marketers were kvetching about its ineffectiveness as an ad platform Twitter told Barrons early this year that it is shooting for ad load or a increase Thats a huge increase that can provide a big lift to the companys top line In fact if all the other three determinants of ad revenue remain constant but ad loads increase around Twitters revenue growth rate would more than double And theres really nothing to prevent Twitter from increasing its ad load to something close to Facebooks level which translates to about times their current level After all the two platforms are quite similar and I never noticed any drop in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>user engagement after its large increase in ad loads Twitter has been mulling over the question of whether to increase or not to increase its ad load for some time The company had suggested that it planned to start increasing ad loads this year but its latest earnings report shows that ad loads have remained constant Twitter recently struck a deal with online ad giant Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL to make its inventory available through Googles DoubleClick In my view thats a potentially great move Twitter has only marketers on its platform compared to over million for Google Twitters ad units will now be available to Googles marketers which can increase both the volume of ads sold as well as their unit price If Twitter substantially increases its ad load you can bet that many of these marketers will view it in a much more positive light and will be willing to do business with the company Source Twitter Still Has Some Hidden Ammunition To Help Grow Ad Revenue
