innovation He gives new home automation products from Amazon and Google as examples of innovation and the next big thing in technology This shows a misunderstanding of the different business models and product strategies of Apple and its servicesoriented competitors Longtime Apple NASDAQ AAPL bear and Seeking Alpha contributor Michael Blair is out with another polarizing article titled Apples Greed Stifles Growth While Amazon Forges Ahead criticizing Apples alleged focus on shortterm profit and lack of innovation I think it is an interesting piece worth discussing and explaining in more detail as it showcases a misunderstanding of the different business models product strategies and underlying valuation of Apple and some of its key competitors in todays technology space Lets jump right in Mr Blairs view on the matter is clear Apple lags its competitors in innovation and has done virtually nothing but tweak its devices for the past two years He then gives new home automation products from Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL as examples of innovation and the next big thing in technology Needless to say I look at things differently Amazons Echo and Googles Home are a good reflection of the companies business models focused on selling services Both represent a logical way to offer an affordable basic product to provide access to Amazon and Google services for the widest audience possible The internet giants play to their strengths here service infrastructure and data collection while limiting their weaknesses hardware and design see Google Glass and Amazon Fire Phone On the other hand Apple is a product company competing in the premium segment where rich experiences are positioned as the reason to attract customers In this respect I look at the existing Apple product portfolio as a better fit for the companys business model and goals The iPhone iPad Apple Watch Apple TV and soon Mac if rumors are true already offer access to a virtual assistant and speakers while also providing more interface options utility and overall value In fact I think a product like the Apple Watch is best positioned for handling voice queries and home automation as its microphone and user interface is right on your wrist wherever you are Does Apple need to improve Siri and other services Yes Are Amazon Echo and Google Home the next big innovation with a vast potential market and a showcase for technology leadership Given the products limitations and their voice interface I have my doubts Either way Apple Amazon and Google follow the same goals here trying to engage their customers within their ecosystems but given their different business models and different strengths they position different products to achieve them Mr Blair then states that Apple has ignored the compelling need in technology to look ahead and innovate I disagree While the company makes a few bets these are significant longterm strategic initiatives Apple Watch and Apple Pay are the clearest examples of this focused product strategy While both products are currently not material to Apples revenues and therefore are easy targets for criticism and dismissal they target important industries and their impact can already be felt Google spent many years unsuccessfully trying to get its mobile payments off the ground while other companies active in the field today like Samsung didnt even offer any payment solution before Apple Pay Similarly the smartwatch category in terms of material units shipments was largely insignificant before the Apple Watch while the Swiss and US watchmakers now suffer the biggest sales declines in almost a decade There is a marked difference in terms of strategy and innovation between Apple and companies like Amazon Google or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Apples functional organization makes the company focus and pursue depth while the divisional organizational structure of the likes of Alphabet and Amazon enables a broader and more experimental development approach While the latter strategy results in many product and service initiatives few of them ever see the light of day and even fewer become successful and profitable What is the better strategy That depends on your definition of innovation and whether you prefer breadth or depth In terms of profit and cultural impact Apples strategy has certainly worked over the last two decades However the notion that Apple does not look ahead and innovate is not correct even more so now that the company is working with Didi Chuxing to redefine transportation Finally Mr Blair suggests that Apples alleged focus on shortterm profit and the lack of innovation is reflected in the companys valuation while innovative products from Amazon and Google power their respective stocks ahead Both AMZN and GOOG certainly benefit from the positive sentiment surrounding their many initiatives while investors are glad to pay a premium for their recurring service cash flows and growth On the other hand no matter how it innovates AAPLs valuation will always be limited by its hardware business model and its consequence secretive development to prevent the Osborne effect changing technology cycles and low predictability of future product cash flows There is no denying the fact that AAPL is currently going through difficult times The enormous growth in fact unprecedented for a company of Apples size seen in recent years is coming to an end as the smartphone market is showing signs of maturity and so is the most successful and profitable technology product of all time the iPhone However this is not to say that the company has stopped innovating The company is currently establishing itself in the important wearables and health markets brings security and convenience to the payments industry and its rumored electric vehicle is widely considered the worstkept secret in Silicon Valley While these are only a few initiatives they represent big longterm bets on some of the most important industries and Apples relevance and survival Authors Note If you have enjoyed reading my article and found its
