Reasons Verizon Should Buy Yahoo Verizon Communications NYSEVZ Seeking Alpha An acquisition has the opportunity to make Verizon distinctive Verizon NYSE VZ tipped its hand that it would be interested in buying Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO back in December In the last few days this possibility drew more attention as VZs CFO confirmed interest on CNBC and Bloomberg reported that AOLs NYSE AOL CEO Tim Armstrong is investigating a potential acquisition There are some very good reasons this deal makes sense First this acquisition has the opportunity to make Verizon distinctive Think about all those ads you see for mobile phone service Pretty much alike All of them trying to say that their service is better than competitors in a world where customers dont see any real difference G G pretty soon it feels like theyll be talking about G but users mostly dont care The service is usually good enough and all competitors seem the same So that leads to the second element they advertise price How many different price programs can anyone invent And how many phone or tablet giveaways What is clear is that the competition is about price And that means the product has become generic And when products are generic and price is the No discussion it leads to low margins and lousy investor returns But a Yahoo acquisition would make Verizon differentiated Verizon could offer its own unique programming at a meaningful level and make it available only on its network And this could offer price advantages Like with go streaming VZs customers could have free downloads of Verizon content while having to pay data fees for downloads from other sites like YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Vine Instagram Amazon Prime NASDAQ AMZN etc The Verizon customer could have a unique experience and this could allow the company to move away from generic selling and potentially capture higher margins as a differentiated competitor Second Yahoo will never be a lead competitor and has more value as a supporting player YHOO has lost its lead in every major competitive market and it will never catch up Google is No in search and always will be Google is No in video with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>No and Yahoo will never catch up either Ad sales are now dominated by AdWords and social media ads and Yahoo is increasingly an afterthought Yahoos relevance in digital advertising is at risk and as a weak competitor it could easily disappear But Verizon doesnt need the No player to put together a bundled solution where the No is a big improvement from nothing By integrating Yahoo services and capabilities into its unique platform VZ could take something that will never be No and make it important as part of a new bundle to users and advertisers As supporting technology and products Yahoo is worth quite a bit more to Verizon than it will ever be as an independent competitor to investors which likely cannot keep up the investment rates necessary to keep YHOO alive Third Yahoo is incredibly cheap For about a year its investors have put no value on the independent Yahoo The companys value has been only its stake in Alibaba NYSE BABA So investors inherently have said they would take nothing for the traditional core Yahoo assets Additionally YHOOs investors are stuck trying to capture the Alibaba value currently lockedup in the company If they try to spin out or sell the stake then a billion tax bill likely kicks in By getting rid of Yahoos outdated business whats left is YaBaba as a tracking stock on the NASDAQ for the Chinese Alibaba shares Or possibly Alibaba buys the remaining YaBaba shares putting cash into the shareholder pockets or giving them Alibaba shares which they may prefer Either way the tax bill is avoided and the Alibaba value is unlocked And that is worth considerably more than Yahoos core business So it is highly unlikely a deal is made for free But lacking another likely buyer Verizon is in a good position to buy these assets for a pretty low value And that gives it the opportunity to turn those assets into something worth quite a lot more without the overhang of huge goodwill charges left over from buying an overpriced asset as usually happens in tech Fourth Yahoo finally gets rid of an ineffectual board and leadership team The companys board has been trying to find a successful leader since the day it hired Carol Bartz A string of CEOs have been unable to define a competitive positioning that works for Yahoo leading to the current lack of investor enthusiasm The current CEO Marissa Mayer and her team after months of accomplishing nothing to improve Yahoos competitiveness and growth prospects are now out of ideas Management consulting firm McKinsey Company has been brought in to engineer yet another turnaround effort Last week we learned there will be more layoffs and business closings as Yahoo again cannot find any growth prospects This was the turnaround that didnt materialize and now additional value destruction is brought on by the weak leadership Most of the time when leaders fail the company fails Yahoo is interesting because there is a way to capture value from what is currently a failing situation Due to dramatic value declines over the last few years most longterm investors have thrown in the towel Now the remaining owners are very shortterm oriented on capturing the most they can from the Alibaba holdings They are happy to be rid of what the company once was Additionally there is a possible buyer that is uniquely positioned to actually take those secondtier assets and create value out of them and has the resources to acquire the assets and make something of them A real winwin is now possible Tagged
