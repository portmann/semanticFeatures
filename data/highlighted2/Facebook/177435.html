#A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be able to successfully expand into emerging markets but faces the threat of decreased revenue per user Facebooks earnings growth has consistently declined since and most recently the company had negative earnings growth While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will have a favorable future and successful expansion it seems clear that the company its overvalued and will not experience the same growth it experienced in the past Beyond being incredibly overvalued I believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a flurry of challenges in achieving growth ahead of it and it is best for investors to avoid this stock The following factors lead me to be bearish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The social media industry can certainly be classified as being in a bubble and a look at Facebooks most recent earnings reveals that its growth has begun to slow substantially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>already has a strong domestic presence with not much room for growth A high PE is certainly justifiable if there is high projected growth ahead but this is not the case for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>My call may be premature as the stock price could still rise but I assert that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not good value and the growth ahead is not strong enough to justify its current valuation Facebooks stock price has experienced a consistent upward ascent which is becoming less and less logical considering the consistent decrease in earnings growth Growth in EPS has been decreasing substantially since The companys EPS grew by the following amounts when compared to the period months before The continuous trend of decreased earnings growth coupled with the most recent decline in earnings necessitates caution and a shift from a bullish to bearish view of the companys upside potential FB PE Ratio Annual data by YCharts A recent rise in valuation can be seen as a result of the newly experienced decrease in earnings which has resulted in increased valuation this year Realistically valuation can go much higher and its stocks price can continue to go higher even if earnings continue to decline However it certainly needs to be noted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not delivering on earnings growth as it most recently had a decline in earnings of This new phenomenon is merely a warning sign and indication that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not good value A further look at Facebooks challenges that it will face entering emerging markets further warrants a bearish sentiment of this company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is currently being used by over half of the worlds population that has access to internet currently having approximately billion users Its financial success is based on the United States and Canada which already account for approximately of its revenue Naturally there is not much room for growth in this area which leads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to have to turn to other markets Facebooks success in emerging markets can be considered a next crucial step yet there are significant restraints to this being a positive driver for further revenue and earnings growth During the average revenue per user in the United States and Canada was compared to the collective average of Furthermore another significant concern is that revenue per user from Asia Pacific users averages at only Therefore the implications of diminishing marginal returns on earnings solely based on revenue per user is very clear Facebooks ability to tap into Asia much of which is emerging has been very impressive I lived in a village in India and practically everyone used <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on their mobile phones yet every house did not have running water and homes only had electricity for hours a day This is a success story but the low revenue per user is Asia Pacific is an obvious thorn What of Facebooks expansion into Africa Senegal one country I am extremely optimistic about will not be emerging until according to projections made by the World Bank A quick glance at the small percentage of the population that uses facebook in Africa is extremely disappointing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>must therefore await for this growth while leveraging off of its success in domestic markets However there is obviously not much room for domestic user growth and Facebooks only hope is increasing its revenue per user The lack of opportunity for growth in its domestic market provides a clear explanation of the companys consistent decline in earnings growth since Over time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will surely be able to successfully expand into current frontier markets but the timeframe and implications for earnings growth are severely disappointing While I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be extremely successfully in its endeavors to expand internationally it seems clear that there are very high challenges for the company to continue delivering the same earnings growth Therefore early seems to be the clear success story while the future of Facebooks stock price looks less favorable It is clear that Facebooks earnings have consistently been declining and that there is not much hope for the company to experience similar growth that it had between and early The stock price will most likely continue to go up based on optimistic sentiment but it is clearly not good value A historical look at valuation does prove that the stock is not at its highest point of valuation yet now is an excellent time to really begin to be skeptical of the companys continued upside potential Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the
