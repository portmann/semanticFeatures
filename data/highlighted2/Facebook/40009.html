average users are up in line with current trends User business pages and videos are driving advertisement revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB reported a successful first quarter this week The social media giant answered strongly in the affirmative two of the biggest questions analysts want to know are the number of users increasing and is the company making more money from the user activity Its the basic unit price and volume equation that retailers and service providers use And the numbers are big <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>maintained its upward trend in daily average users DAU From Q to Q DAU numbers rose and from Q DAU growth was Those increases are in line with longerperiod growth rates and should satisfy both analysts and investors Growth in users in the rest of the world category rose the most followed by AsiaPacific US and Canada had the least percentage growth Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Q Results presentation Monthly average users MAU showed even greater growth Since Q MAU numbers rose and quartertoquarter was up since Q Again these growth rates were about the same as earlier periods so user numbers are still rising strongly and consistently Mobile users also are gaining steadily as more people shift from PC to mobile platforms In Q mobile MAUs totaled billion people higher than two years ago However MAUs who accessed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>only by mobile are now up to million Two years before they were only onethird of that That shows the incredible growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can tap into with the potential monetization of its mobile apps like WhatsApp and Instagram Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Q Results presentation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>again delighted investors with quarterly revenue growth Reported quarterly EPS were down from in Q NonGAAP earnings were per share versus in the yearago period for a increase Foreign currency exchange weighed on revenue In the Q earnings call the company said constant currency revenue would have been million higher than the reported billion quarterly revenue This played a part in a small revenue miss compared to the billion market estimate Advertising revenue which accounts for the overwhelming majority of total revenue was up to billion The weakness came from the companys payments side which was down Had <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>decided to begin monetizing WhatsApp and Instagram which have million and million users respectively advertising revenue could have easily grown to meet and beat the market estimate However the company is holding back on starting that Market detractors may be showing some anxiety just as investors did after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>listed when they didnt know how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was going to make money from mobile I would expect to see a similar surge in revenue when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>thinks its time to make that move Until then user numbers for the platforms are still rising a key factor for company growth so this small miss shouldnt be a big issue for investors if they focus on ad revenue expansion GAAP costs and expenses for Q were up from Q The company explained in the earnings call that expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition made up a significant part of the yearoveryear expenses increase In addition head countrelated costs rose from a big increase in staff hiring which saw total numbers up on last year to around <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is gearing up for big growth in the short and mid term with video WhatsApp further mobile advertising and Instagram so the company needs to be ready for the heightened demand of computing power and application development For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is expanding its virtual reality development with Oculus resulting in a big intake of new employees for that growing field In the companys fullyear guidance CFO David Wehner said GAAP expenses are expected to settle down to a growth rate of slightly tighter than the prior guidance of Along with the revenue miss the increase in expenses may be the reason why the stock has slipped since earnings came out but I think thats shortsighted in light of the sheer amount of development that must be done over the next years If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is to continue growing revenue in the highdouble digits it must invest sufficiently now User business pages and videos driving ad revenue These impressive gains are being driven by the development of user business pages ecommerce data analysis services and the huge increase in videos Chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said in the earnings call We believe video will play a significant role in bringing more marketers to mobile More than of global video views on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>occur on mobile and we believe mobile video will become more important to marketers over time CEO Mark Zuckerberg also noted that in Q over billion videos were viewed daily for the first time Video can drive more business because of the richer social interaction a buyer can have with a product as well as with the vendor Now that there are million advertisers on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the volume of sales and advertisements can continue to expand well Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Q Results presentation Thats very reassuring for investors because the stock is trading at times consensus fiscal earnings of The share price is not a stretch if you look at annual EPS growth of an average since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can monetize its Messenger Instagram and WhatsApp apps to spur on further earnings growth yet CEO Zuckerberg said in the earnings call What were focused on doing is providing more higher quality services for free than what you could otherwise get in paying for them The companys emphasis is growing user numbers so if these services stay free for longer it attracts new users and keeps them sticky to Facebooks services and ecosystem All in all Q was a good start to the year and I would expect to see the social media leader setting new ad and user records this year as well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares are down about since the earnings release The stock story continues to improve with no major snags so investors should look past the temporary expense rise and the small revenue miss For longerterm buyers who can envision how much more the company can grow I would say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>deserves an addition to your portfolio position Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Sets
