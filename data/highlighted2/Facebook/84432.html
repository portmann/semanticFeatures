class='textDiv'>Intel And Micron The Purple Swan Intel Corporation NASDAQINTC Seeking Alpha After a decade in the making Paul Otellinis Intel is about to be realized This realization involves Micron in a big way The investment opportunity is substantial but may bear risk With much sobriety Intel NASDAQ INTC disclosed their persistent memory processor instructions to the world last November Subsequently the stocks of Intel INTC and Micron NASDAQ MU went on to reach modernday highs For years those intheknow NDAsaddled employees at Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Oracle NYSE ORCL NetApp NASDAQ NTAP EMC NYSE EMC VMware NYSE VMW Google NASDAQ GOOG <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN have been anticipating Intels persistent memory technology with baited breath or so I can imagine Ive been watching everything slowly unfold through the lens of the US Patent Office online search and the occasional slipup in news articles and forwardlooking statements This persistent memory announcement is the tip of the iceberg that culminates the many billions in RD that have been spent over the last five years And while there are many brilliant minds that created this iceberg they have made the mistake of using too much enthusiasm and specificity in their patent applications This is a great opportunity for wouldbe investors who havent signed an NDA Take the following patent application for example direct quotes in italics Dynamic partial power down of memoryside cache in a level memory hierarchy The focus of this approach is on providing performance with a relatively small amount of a relatively higherspeed memory such as DRAM while implementing the bulk of the system memory using significantly cheaper and denser nonvolatile random access memory NVRAM I can tell you that any other company would simply leave the specific implementation of NVRAM undefined because this is the smart thing to do in a patent But it really seems to me that Intel is trying to spoonfeed their insiders The application continues For convenience of explanation most of the remainder of the application will refer to NVRAM or more specifically PCM or PCMS as the technology selection for the far memory As such the terms NVRAM PCM PCMS and far memory may be used interchangeably in the following discussion Now PCM is phase change memory for those who havent been following nextgen memories Ive explored PCM and its hypothetical benefits in a past article that might be worth reading if you need to bring yourself uptospeed with something less technical PCMS is IntelMicron shorthand for phase change memory with switch The differentiation is that the switch is an Ovonic Threshold Switch OTS that is leveraged in lieu of a silicon transistor that would normally be used to isolate each of the memory cells for reading and writing The benefit of the OTS is that it delivers the highpower that is required to quickly manipulate the PCM but does so in a form factor that is much more compact than an equivalentlypowered transistor The big news here is that we now know that phase change memory is significantly cheaper and denser than DRAM and that by using a clever arrangement of the two there is an opportunity to disrupt many different industries The rest of the world was waiting for PCM to become cheaper than flash This puts IntelMicron years ahead of their competitors as many consumers will necessarily pay a premium for the betterthanflash storage performance lowerpowerthanDRAM memory performance and unique instant executeinplace qualities of PCM And competitors who scramble to copy IntelMicron will now need to license the unavoidable portions of the technology from the two The other big news is that the memory hierarchy described in the patent is readytogo Intel is already shipping Iris Pro processors with the requisite onpackage highbandwidth eDRAM From the patent application above Aside from the fact that this looks like Intels forthcoming Knights Landing noteworthy here is that the small chunk Mbyte of eDRAM on the Iris Pro products is a cheap component in and of itself less than by spot price but its presence onpackage commands as much as an premium in the total package price a percent margin Clearly when performance is at stake it now makes sense for Intel to put as much of the memory and storage subsystems onpackage Increased demand and margin will just be an unavoidable side effect The patent goes on to characterize the disruption For example in one embodiment a high powered server is configured with a near memory eg DRAM a PCMS device and a magnetic mass storage device for large amounts of persistent storage In one embodiment a notebook computer is configured with a near memory and a PCMS device which performs the role of both a far memory and a mass storage device ie which is logically partitioned to perform these roles as shown in FIG One embodiment of a tablet computer or cellular telephony device is configured with PCMS memory but potentially no near memory and no additional mass storage for costpower savings However the tablettelephone may be configured with a removable mass storage device such as a flash or PCMS memory stick The embodiments of the invention described below provide a softwaretransparent way to integrate PCM while also enabling newer usages through software enhancements These embodiments promote a successful transition in memory subsystem architecture and provide a way to consolidate both memory and storage using a single PCM pool thus mitigating the need for a separate nonvolatile storage tier in the platform A backup power unit for maintaining power while the flushing is taking place Since the flushing does not take a long time this backup power unit need not use a very expensive UPS system Instead some rack or serverlevel batterybackup module is sufficient The techniques described above may be used to significantly reduce TCO in data centers because expensive UPS systems will no longer be required For those who were wondering what Supermicro NASDAQ SMCI was doing with those tiny batteries in those giant servers now you know Instead of keeping servers running they are simply moving everything out of volatile memory prior to battery failure Once the power comes back on the system resumes instantly where it left off with no loss of data or state and a very expensive component UPS of the data center is eliminated where this failure mode can be tolerated It is important to note that Supermicro is a close Intel partner having fabricated the Adams Pass Knights Landing prototype They are often a leading indicator of Intels direction Noteworthy of late is their substantial investment in NVMe technology This is an Intelcontrolled puppet string But Intel isnt holding all of the sexy intellectual property for themselves as they seem to have a good understanding that Micron deals with the fabrication side of the equation even though some Micron patents hold Intel inventors Some important comments come from a Micron patent Phase change memory devices can provide several performance advantages over other memory devices such as flash memory devices and dynamic random access memory devices In addition some phase change memory devices can provide fast read and write access time eg faster than nanoseconds andor high read and write access bandwidth eg greater than megabits per second In addition some phase change memory device can be arranged in a very high density memory array eg a crosspoint array having greater than million cells in the smallest memory array unit connected with local metallization This is important because everyone has become very quiet with respect to PCM research in the past couple of years Intel and Samsung OTCSSNLF both dropped out of Sematech for example as the secrets become more valuable As PCM gets faster and more durable less DRAM cache is required In lowerperformance applications eg IoT PCM will immediately begin to find itself onchip replacing both SRAM and DRAM for true nonvolatile computing on a single chip It is entirely possible that PCM is already faster than DRAM at this point We simply dont know because this is closely guarded But we do know that as of it was fast enough In another Micron application a clever lowcost structure similar to D NAND is disclosed Electrically this structure only requires a single bit line for each row of an entire D stack of PCMS cells The advantage here is that each memory cell is wrapped in an Ovonic Threshold Switch which obviates the need for perplane bit lines This is aggressively costeffective versus DRAM In the first Intel patent application theres discussion about each of the stacked planes representing percent of the total memory This coincides with four planes and I am not anticipating more than this as other patent applications cite repeatability issues as the vertical aspect ratio increases Assuming a square centimeter about the size of a dime and a nanometer fab size quadstacked SLC PCMS will store about Gbit if we dedicate percent of the cells to yield flaws and standby spares You can do the math for MLC TLC and QLC quad level cells of which PCM is capable but realize that performance suffers as more bits are packed into each cell This wasnt a big deal for flash SSDs because they were several orders of magnitude better performers than the hard drives that they were replacing PCM is replacing DRAM not hard drives in half of this use case But it is possible to subdivide SLC for main memory purposes MLC for a graphics purposes and QLC for storage or otherwise as desired There simply isnt enough room here to adequately characterize the amount of work that has gone into the IntelMicron PCMS technology While I will do my best to summarize some of the patents it is worth reading them in their entirety to get a better handle on the dramatic transformation that is about to take place Multilevel memory with direct access PhaseChange Memory and Switch PCMS is a nonvolatile storage technology under development as a successor to the NAND nonvolatile storage ubiquitous in todays solid state storage devices PCMS offers much higher performance than NAND flash and in fact begins to approach the performance points of the Dynamic Random Access Memory currently used as primary dynamic storage in most client computing devices While PCMS storage may initially be more expensive perbit than NAND storage that relationship is forecasted to change over time until eventually PCMS is less expensive than NAND We are at this point of inflection now D NAND was able to buy some time for flash because it leverages trailingedge fabs that would otherwise be scrapped sooner For example Samsung uses their old nm fab to produce D NAND and it is speculated that the much larger D cells are still not as costeffective as Microns nm planar NAND Samsung will need to add even more layers for this to happen I believe that nm PCMS will be cheaper than D NAND but nm or nm may already there Since performance will be hundredsfold better it will command a much higher price per bit leading to phenomenal margins But the staggering performance will only be usable if it is installed on a CPUintegrated memory bus which is the only thing fast enough to take advantage Thusly for the foreseeable future this means Intel Could this spur Apple NASDAQ AAPL to switch their mobile platforms and homogenize their software environment Other CPU manufacturers are free to support PCMPCMS on their memory buses but theyll need to license Intels persistent memory patents if they want to take advantage of the powersaving and checkpointing qualities And theyre at least two years behind in terms of developing a processor to support it Moving on This looks like Intels Knights Landing andor Knights Hill products Take note that Intels new D EMIB product reduces the need to stack chips for bandwidth so this may be realized in an onpackage format instead of stacked The PCMS is used to checkpoint the supercomputer nodes while avoiding the substantial time overhead that exists with the current state of the art This increases the efficiency of the supercomputer substantially The US government has prohibited the export of this product to China and others An embodiment of the invention may also be used in handheld computing devices to deliver high bandwidth memory at significantly reduced power For example a heterogeneous stack of DRAM Dynamic Random Access Memory and nonvolatile memory such as PCMS Phase Change Memory with Switch die may be used to implement an integrated TwoLevel Memory LM system Accordingly techniques discussed herein may be applied to a range of computing devices from handhelds to Exascale HPC High Performance Computing to provide a highbandwidth andor lowpower heterogeneous memory hierarchy consisting of DRAM and PCMS devices This should provide the scale of what they are doing with the nearfar memory model as it is applied to data centers The link is optical so the server rack would just be CPU with onpackage near memory while the memory rack would just be PCM Apparatus and method for implementing a multilevel memory hierarchy having different operating modes A MByte highbandwidth onpackage DRAM is managed as a MByte way cache with MByte dedicated to the graphics processor GByte of PCMS is dedicated for graphics on top of the MByte DRAM cache The implications of caching and subdividing a terabyte of PCMS between main memory graphics memory and storage are discussed The performance penalties of changing planes in a plane D structure are discussed A novel mechanism to maximize performance under this penalty is outlined A mechanism to clean pages of PCM is patented This avoids either the slower SET operation whereby the phase change glass is recrystallized over a long period of time using low energy or the fast energyintensive RESET operation whereby the phase change glass is quickly broken by smashing it with a swift highenergy pulse ie the amorphous phase This optimizes PCM for either highspeed or lowpower depending on desired attributes A method and device to augment volatile memory in a graphics subsystem with nonvolatile memory A GPU with GByte of DRAM augmented with GBytes unheard of in todays age of GB GPUs of PCMS and discusses the implications of highfidelity D textures with no loading delays between different sections of the ingame world This is a good patent to read in its entirety because there is much discussion related to managing the tremendous complexity of making this all work to create something thats years ahead of the competition Even stereoscopic frame buffers are mentioned Gamers will open their wallets for this technology A stack of chips communicate using a highbandwidth semiwireless technique called AC coupling Separating each technology allows Intel to build custom CPUmemory products Nonvolatile random access memory nvram as a replacement for traditional mass storage As Intel moves memory and storage onpackage they create a monopoly because the performance of conventional solutions will be worse necessarily This speaks to the rumors that Intel was going to package additional RAM and allow endusers to purchase a soft upgrade to unlock it at anytime during the lifetime of the product They will likely do this with storage too Instructions and logic to provide memory fence and store functionality This is a very big patent that remains unassigned after nearly two years which is a technique that Intel uses to prevent people from finding their big secrets The inventors are Intel employees so the assumption is that this will become an Intel patent This speaks to the complexity thats needed to be solved in facilitating a single memory store that is shared by multiple CPU cores with a variety of volatile and nonvolatile caches ie cache coherency Atomic transactions to nonvolatile memory unassigned but Intel employees are inventors Compressionenabled blending of data in nonvolatile memory If the above disclosures and realizations dont have the hair on your neck standing up then you either arent a technical person which is understandable given the presented complexity or need a good onceover by your physician Autonomous memory has a profound advantage in the case where a linear search is performed on a large database By way of example using pipelining for one autonomous memory device having GB memory density containing banks of M pages of B each a page can be compared to a target pattern at a beat rate of about nsec per page resulting in a possible search time for the GB die of about mS While this is an impressive result by itself the value is that this solution is scalable and thus the search time for two autonomous memory devices each having GB memory density would also be about mS as would the search time for a petabyte of memory or for any sized pool of memory Using autonomous memory devices in a distributed subsystem to perform linear searches would be limited by the cost of the array of memory devices along with thermal management and power constraints System administration functions also may take advantage of autonomous memory devices in a distributed subsystem For example a data center may perform a virus scan on distributed subsystem and when a virus is detected the data center would be downed for mS during which time a search and destroy algorithm would be executed on every byte to isolate and disable any occurrence of the target virus This isnt the best example of autonomous memory but it is the most easily understood Theres much more power that I will discuss with further detail in a standalone article This technology is available today but at very lowdensity due to the cost and power requirements of the required volatile memory SRAM in todays implementations Micron does not explain how they achieve highdensity providing an impossible combination of DRAM NAND and logic but leaving the door open for alternate tech but my assumption is that they are using PCM The patent outlines a method for wireless communication between stacked chips This would only be necessary for deployment on a tremendous scale eg Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Microsoft etc This technology is ideal for network security it runs Ciscos Snort at just a fraction of the power that is required by conventional processors Palo Alto NYSE PANW Cisco NASDAQ CSCO FireEye NASDAQ FEYE Fortinet NASDAQ FTNT and more will be interested in implementing this into their products Automata looks a lot like a soupedup version of tech from the late CSwitch an FPGA startup that mysteriously closed their doors in after producing a highlyanticpated disruptive product Their product was readytoship when the plug was pulled without explanation Of note is that many of CSwitchs patents involve very innovative phase change FPGA devices Without knowing exactly how Micron has implemented autonomous memory know that it is extremely powerful for search security neuromorphic computing and also that they plan to implement this technology in their SSDs Microsoft also is ahead of the curve with PCM They arent keeping any secrets to this end It is just that academia and Wall Street dont communicate very well I think that it is very possible that Microsoft Intel and Micron are staging a coup Perhaps Windows is free not because Microsoft is benevolent but rather that were about to see new hardware thats so compelling that they simply arent worried about it The IntelMicron PCMS tech facilitates such power efficiency that they will be able to offer a nocompromise PC in a smartphone form factor With Intels wireless display and wireless charging youll still be able to use it like a desktop given a compatible wireless monitor keyboard and mouse Liken this to BlackBerrys NASDAQ BBRY opportunity of years ago they were the first to put alwayson corporate email into a pocketable form factor in order to create a market that didnt previously exist Microsoft has the same unique opportunity here because Apple has largely ignored business software because it isnt fashionable A new market will be created when employees can put that complex expensive customdeveloped Windows application in their pocket The apps in question arent sexy new innovative apps theyre the year old million dollar accounting apps HR software and TPS reports boring stuff a technology at which Microsoft excels Apple does not I have more confidence in the new leadership at Microsoft to capitalize on this situation The Windows Mobile Enterprise product appears to be aimed squarely at this opportunity I think that it is safe to say that because all of these apps require x AMD NASDAQ AMD will be a sitting duck when this happens Perhaps a bidding war between IBM NYSE IBM and Samsung OTC SSNLF will ensue This will be the only ticket to the Office in a Pocket vision that I have prognosticated Ive been following PCM technology for years and I need to disclose the risk of which I am acutely aware Id actually like to think that I am a part of it The concept of PCM was pioneered decades ago by Stanford Ovshinsky of Energy Conversion Devices ECD ECD established a subsidiary in Ovonyx for the purpose of commericalizing the technology Although Ovonyx management was populated by Micron employees Intel became the first and only real investor Along the way to commercializing phase change memory Stan and company discovered that phase change materials could also perform the following Reconfigurable circuits and Die customization The advent of nanoscale phase change devices will facilitate FPGAs with much higherdensity and flexibility The line between CPU and FPGA will be blurred Standard ASICs will be obsolesced This is another forthcoming standalone article in and of itself Digital and multistate nonvon Neumann inmemory computing Again no room to go into detail but recent research summarizes this quite well By a subtle investigation of the wellcharacterized phasetransition behavior this simple method provides an elegant solution to boost significantly the speed of phasechangebased inmemory logic devices thus paving the way for achieving computers that can perform computations approaching terahertz processing rates Also note that this research outlines a method to switch PCM in the hundreds of picoseconds range where picoseconds is nanosecond perhaps a window into the secrets that have been kept in recent years Is this Microns Automata Logic by implication and nonsilicon computing This is everything that HP was trying to do with The Machine but better Is it a coincidence that HP just changed their plans for The Machine from memristor to PCM While these are certainly out there in terms of technical complexity it should be understood that the advent of nanoscale phase change devices enables all of this Intel for example holds a patent on using an Ovonic Threshold Switch to replace SRAM with a fold increase in density and no loss of speed potentially much faster Thus comparing volatile memories the speed of some embodiments of the present invention may be comparable to that of a six transistor static random access memory but the size of some embodiments of the present invention using only a single transistor and an ovonic threshold switch may be considerably smaller than that of standard six transistor static random access memory Thus some embodiments of the present invention may provide a volatile memory with comparable speed at much smaller size It is to be appreciated that a highdensity replacement for SRAM is priceless at the moment While this is an Intel patent there were many other groundbreaking patents held by ECD many of them in a subsidiary called Ovonic Cognitive Computer Inc I recently learned that all of these patents were quietly transferred to Ovonyx in Shareholders were not asked nor informed of this substantial transfer Since ECD only had a minority interest in Ovonyx I feel strongly as an ECD shareholder that this was theft I have no idea who was behind this theft While ECDs share of Ovonyx was sold to Micron in as part of ECDs bankruptcy some shareholders including myself have involved the US Trustee to take a closer look at what transpired The bankruptcy is scheduled to close next Wednesday June th If this happens then I expect that well see Micron announce PCM as expected In terms of my own expectations I am substantially long Intel and Micron But I am hedged with a boatload of otherwise worthless ECD stock in the event that something does happen Also of interest is ECDs work in OLED and phase change optical routers The OLED project was a successful jointventure with GE NYSE GE producing flexible OLED screens using printing presslike technology The phase change optical router project produced a promising opticaltooptical router using phase change materials Even though these were both pure assets ECD management formally petitioned the court to abandon this work very early on in the process The related patents were also transferred to Ovonyx and subsequently sold to Micron In Stefan Lai a year Intel flash memory VP left Intel to join Ovonyx where he stayed for a year and a half He went on to assist a Chinese company with developing PCM You may draw your own conclusions as to whether Mr Lai was independent in these actions But there would a possibility for Intel to pull some shenanigans with Micron depending on the contract between the two Micron currently sells hot dogs from a cart on a street corner in an OK neighborhood But theyre about to open a star restaurant with Intel as their partner To me it seems like Intel and Micron have been working as a single entity for some time now For example as Intel was supposed to be closing the initial deal with Altera before it fell apart Micron quietly closed their acquisition of Convey Computer What does Convey do Convey packages Intel Xeons with Xilinx FPGAs and creates software to integrate the two Convey is a very innovative company but Im going to go out on a limb here and predict that theyre not going to be using Xilinx for much longer If a Micron acquisition is coming shareholders need to realize what Micron is worth Theyre not selling hot dogs anymore Source Intel And Micron The Purple Swan Disclosure The author is
