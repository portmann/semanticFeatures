</span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was delivering serious revenues consistently and growing very fast Zuckerberg was not getting carried away by the VC bidding frenzy In general my observation is that entrepreneurs retain a much higher percentage of equity if they can bootstrap their way to showing real traction and then keep delivering solid performance metrics Obviously <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB was in high gear when Peter Thiel invested the first outside money into the company so seed financing was not some k for equity from an incubator Rather it was k for This started things off well the cap table had lots of room for raising new rounds without ridiculous amounts of dilution Prior to the Peter Thiel investment there was a small amount of friends and family money in the company and by the time the first outside round took place the company had started generating ad revenues The valuation for this round was M in September In May the company raised its Series A round of M at a M valuation from Accel Partners Note the revenue metrics were solid at a M annual run rate The company was fully validated and the user metrics were growing like a rocket The performance metrics coupled with Peter Thiels extensive connections and influence drove followon rounds of financing into a bidding war I remember during these years everyone in the industry was talking about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Zuckerberg as the next Bill Gates However Zuckerberg didnt get carried away He only raised a modest amount of money compared to what he could have raised under those circumstances of an oversubscribed bidding frenzy In May the company raised M at a M valuation with a revenue run rate of over M from Greylock Meritech and Founders Fund Again rock solid performance metrics and a validated company growing like a rocket This is the dream of all VCs and the type of company that comes along only once or twice a decade So all the VCs were scrambling to get into the company The entire negotiating power in each round was with Zuckerberg As a result he managed to not only get high valuations in each round minimizing dilution he also managed to negotiate all sorts of favorable terms visavis voting rights etc ensuring a firm hold on the companys vision The company raised more money after that In October at a valuation of B they raised a M Series C Revenue run rate was M Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT was the new investor and was trying to figure out social media so it was a strategic investment and valuation was way above was performance metrics warranted Microsoft only got of the company Competition to invest in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>remained crazy as they raised Series D M revenue Series E B revenue and Series F B revenue The Series D valuation also was opportunistic as Yuri Milners Digital Sky was coming into the Silicon Valley market as an investment player and invested M in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for only equity As you can see there were two things going on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was delivering serious revenues consistently and growing very fast Zuckerberg was not getting carried away by the VC bidding frenzy and unless the terms were entirely irrationally to his satisfaction Series C and D and later he was not raising too much money early on Seed Series A Series B If youre going to raise a lot of money its essential that the fundamentals of the business are spectacularly good to retain significant ownership and to give you negotiating leverage This keeps down rounds to a minimum and hence dilutions to a minimum Otherwise you would end up with very little Calls for my favorite cartoon Who Makes More Money A lot of companies that are basking in the glory of being unicorns currently without adequate performance metrics to support those valuations will soon experience severe corrections down rounds etc My concluding comment Focus on the fundamentals Deliver on the performance
