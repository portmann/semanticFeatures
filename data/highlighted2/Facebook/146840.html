individual stocks So far this year weve seen the price performance of individual stocks vary much more than it had been previously If you havent been invested in the right sector or had a decent amount of your portfolio in just a few high growth stocks it is unlikely that your portfolio has kept up with the SP Nothing illustrates this more than the acronym FANG which stands for the darlings of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL As a whole these stocks have accounted for more than of the SP s returns yeartodate Amazon is up so far this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google are both up by Netflix is up a staggering These four stocks comprise just of the SP yet have contributed of its performance Together they have driven the SP s total return up by The SP is up by just so far this year If you own individual stocks and you dont own these four companies your portfolio is going to have a very hard time getting close to the markets performanceThe question that must be asked is this If just four stocks in the SP have been doing so well why not own these four stocks Why not buy shares in Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Google and Netflix An investor who puts money into a stock that doesnt pay a dividend can only profit in one way If someone else is willing to pay them more for their shares in the future We invest in companies for which their market price growth closely follows dividend growth A company that pays a dividend has shown that it can create cash from its business operations and is willing to share that cash with shareholders A company that doesnt pay a dividend either doesnt make money consistently enough to afford to pay a dividend is growing rapidly or is not shareholderfriendlyWithout a dividend a companys stock price is based far more on speculation about future earnings Weve seen over time that earnings can be volatile In earnings for the companies in the SP plunged by more than with price going right along with it They all trade for extremely high multiples The pricetoearnings PE ratio is a quick way to see how optimistic other investors are about a stocks future It tells us how much investors are willing to pay for of that companys earnings The current PE for the SP is right around That means the average stock delivers in earnings for every the investor pays to own it That represents an annual return on investment of divided by All four of these stocks are trading at extreme premiums to the rest of the market Facebooks PE is currently just under Netflix trades for a staggering times earnings And Amazon doesnt even have a PE because it doesnt have positive earnings over the past months Google appears to be the value of the group trading at a pricetoearnings PE ratio of The higher a PE investors pay the more hope they are putting in the future If the next few years dont pan out like investors currently expect a company trading at a sky high PE can see its stock price fall dramatically Buying these stocks means signing up for a return on investment of divided by negative profits AMZN If these companies dont have dramatically higher earnings in the future than they have today their returns will be unattractive to say the least The only way you can profit from these shares is if you can find someone to pay even more at some point in the future Who knows what these stocks are worth Are these PE ratios too high Maybe They might also be too low No one has any idea what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Netflix Google or Amazon will be worth years from now Its quite possible that one or more of these companies will be trading far higher than they are today Its also quite possible that at least half of these companies will have been replaced by the latest and greatest technology of the day Whats clear is that earnings are not the major factor underlying the current market price per share Instead its what each investor is willing to imagine about the companys future Trying to predict the future of these companies is nearly impossible Predicting what people will pay for them is even more impossible We believe most investors would be better off not to try especially not with money they need to live on in retirement Conclusion Wall Street is obsessed with trying to find the next home run Who is the next Netflix or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Who is going to triple in price over the next few years Betting on these types of stocks is not much different than going out to the casino and plopping down money on the roulette wheel Your payout is big when you win but the odds are against you over the long term We find it much easier to hit singles and doubles investing in highquality dividend growth stocks Our multiple regression tool helps us identify stocks that
