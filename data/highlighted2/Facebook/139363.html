thing happened to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB on the way to The company reported a beat on earnings last week that should have guaranteed it Experts raised their price targets in anticipation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>opened for trading on Monday at below where it ended just before the earnings were announced The numbers themselves were good earnings of million cents per share on revenues of billion Operating income of billion represented over of revenue those are Apple NASDAQ AAPL numbers The experts of course had their excuses Valuation is always a good one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still trading at over times its revenue almost times its earnings And even if the top line is up over from a year ago theres a limit Where that limit lies is always the question Investors are still pushing Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN up past those limits and theyre still pushing Netflix NASDAQ NFLX up past those limits Notice a pattern here Thats right video But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>says theyre all over video that its their video ad numbers especially on mobile devices that are really taking off Sure say the bears But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is showing numbers on adbased video Since earnings Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has also been hugging the flat line down almost share from the pop it got right after announcing its own results It is ads that are the problem add the bears <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google are advertising companies Amazon and Netflix get people to pay for what they offer Maybe But theres something else I think that is keeping Mr Mrs Investor from going allin on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>That is its future growth catalyst Oculus Rift Oculus has been at the heart of bearish <span style='background-color:

NASDAQ MSFT Sony NYSE SNE and Google are all showing various versions of the technology But weve been hearing about D in various forms since a quarter century ago I am old enough to remember when a

special glasses meant that business models were hard to come by The problem of the business model is helping keep the Oculus Rift down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has released a virtual reality cartoon that is seen with the glasses and it is cool but how much money do you get from a cartoon Most people who have considered the headset think it to be bestsuited for use by video gamers but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not a video game company Thus investors wonder about the there there Yes Instagram and WhatsApp are interesting and yes they feed the existing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>business model but that model is fullyvalued at the preearnings price of the stock With companies like this the lesson is its not just what have you done for me lately its what are you going to do for me next Maybe the pros will turn out to be right but when faced with a choice between the wisdom of experts and
