class='textDiv'>Twitter In Everything You Need To Know About Periscope Twitter Inc NYSETWTR Seeking Alpha Alex Pitti My Janet Yellen Impersonation clicks In midJanuary Periscope will update its numbers and will show over four million daily active users Periscope will also release a major update in January which should bolster growth My estimate for Periscopes value is somewhere between million and million Twitter NYSE TWTR stock continues to languish in the low s On the bright side the January effect which sometimes lifts stocks that had a bad year lifted Twitter stock Thursday and should power it higher for the next week Besides the January effect there is more reason to be optimistic going into I think Periscope can help turn the company around It was named App of the Year in the App Store This should boost the number of users who try it The biggest problem for Twitter has been that a lot the people who have tried Twitter have given up on it I think if Twitter gets a similar number of people to try Periscope we will see monthly active users potentially grow larger than Twitter itself Integration with Periscope can help Twitter but unfortunately nothing major has happened yet My original motivation for writing this article was the interview Periscope CEO and cofounder Kayvon Beykpour did on CNBC He said all of the platforms metrics have more than doubled since the August update when two million daily active users combined to watch years worth of video per day This was a preview of the results Kayvon will report sometime in the next few weeks I have been expecting Kayvon to do an update sometime in December or January so that expectation seems to be on the mark Not only will Periscope announce its latest metrics in January but Im also expecting a major update to the app If you look at each major update the average time between them is days As of December it has been days since the version of the app was released so an update in the next two to three weeks would be inline with the average The biggest function the firm is working on improving is search Periscope is a live version of YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Obviously search is incredibly important to YouTubes user experience Periscope has a unique challenge because the content is all updating dynamically The search function will become even more important as the quantity of content increases Because Kayvon has told us the firm is working on search I am fairly certain an improvement will come in the next update There are three more improvements on my wish list that could vault the app to new heights Hearts has room for expansion Hearts is the killer feature that differentiates Periscope from other live streaming apps The equivalent killer feature for Instagram NASDAQ FB is filters The killer feature on Snapchat Private CHAT are lenses and the ability to drawon and manipulate photos and videos Lenses has been so successful for Snapchat that it actually charges for some of them You can see an example of a lens below with me looking like Santa Clause These key features help these apps withstand copycats Periscope has already improved hearts by making them seasonal I want Periscope to allow streamers and viewers to change the colors of their hearts instead of having them randomly assigned This may seem trivial but by making them assigned Periscope can allow polls to take place This would further improve communication between the viewer and content creator This can great for businesses using Periscope to gauge the audiences opinion of a new product It is a live form of Twitter polls Hearts are a far superior engagement mechanism than likes and dislikes on YouTube videos because of these factors My other two requests are for integration with Twitter Moments and adding filters While those who arent familiar with Periscope are calling for monetization I am calling for integration with Twitter which can help both platforms crosspollinate When watching Periscopes I have asked scopers about Twitter They seem to all say they love Snapchat and Instagram but dont have a Twitter Just as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has to get young Instagram users onto <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Twitter has to get its young Periscope users back onto Twitter Adding filters would be an example of Periscope copying the best feature of Instagram which is what Snapchat did to improve its functionality The last time Periscope gave an update in August I gave an estimate of what Periscope was worth based on the watch time compared to YouTube The numbers are still the same for YouTube since the last update was about five months ago I assumed YouTube is worth billion YouTube last gave out the number of hours watched per month in Assuming YouTube grew by about to the six billion hours watched per month in turns into about billion hours per month in This left me with a valuation of million for Periscope Based on Kayvon saying Periscope more than doubled Periscope would now in my estimation be worth million This isnt a perfect valuation because it assumes Periscope can monetize as well as YouTube It also doesnt take into account that Periscope is growing much faster than YouTube Since Periscope is growing at about four times the speed of YouTube you could argue its worth million However as I said assuming Periscope can monetize at the same rate as YouTube may be aggressive so Ill stick to the million valuation estimate The amount Periscope is valued at as a percentage of Twitters total market cap has grown exponentially since August as Twitter stock has declined as of the close on December st and Periscopes valuation has doubled In August Periscope was of Twitter now it is of Twitter Just as Instagram has grown to be a larger part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and YouTube has grown to be a larger part of Alphabet Periscope should grow to be a larger part of Twitter Im betting that we wont see another decline by the next Periscope update later in Another data point that we have is the estimate of total downloads on the Android Play Store According to the Play Store Periscope has between million and million installs and Twitter has between million and million installs Instagram has between million and billion installs This puts Periscope at one tenth the size of Twitter and one twentieth the size of Instagram which is impressive for an app less than one year old This momentum helps the app grow further because more streamers will want to capture this growing audience An important point worth mentioning is the level of support Periscope is getting from Apple NASDAQ AAPL As I have already stated it was named the App of the Year I was shocked to find the way Apple ranked Periscope under the New to the App Store tab As you can see from the screen shot below Apple has a category for social media for new users As you can see from the Social Networking list <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is first Periscope is second Pinterest Private PINIT is third and Twitter is fourth Instagram and Snapchat were under photo and video Apple thinks users need to know about Periscope more than Twitter Pinterest and Tumblr which was fifth This shows how much support Apple is giving Periscope This order is not random The apps are not listed in alphabetical order One way I know Apple meticulously selects these apps is it didnt put Spotify Private MUSIC under the music tab probably because it considers it a competitive threat to its Music product Support from the App Store will be critical for Periscopes success One catalyst Periscope has is that it is the perfect app for the presidential candidates in Rand Paul did a livestream but he chose to use UStream to show a day of his campaign I think his choice in streaming services follows the direction of his campaign which has had a number of poor choices As I mentioned in my last article on Twitter Donald Trump will have the biggest effect on the trail as he has been making news with every tweet he has sent to his million followers Since August th Donald Trump has done four Periscopes and has garnered followers on the app If he starts to use the app more regularly it can be a catalyst for growth similar to how the Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight drove usage growth Donald Trump has about more followers on Twitter than he has on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>so he will maintain his usage on the social network He has repeatedly praised the social network Im expecting him to connect with his followers with Periscope more often in He is currently the most likely candidate to be nominated by the GOP according to Pivitio chance In my article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live I mentioned that it was not a threat to Periscope because it wasnt in the same category Everything I have said about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live came before I was able to try it out myself so it was subject to change <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live has been released to some iPhone users as it slowly rolls out Since I am one of those lucky users who have an iPhone I have been able to test it out My opinion on the live feature is that it is terrible When outsiders notice that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live streams get millions of viewers when celebrities do them they need to understand what this means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live isnt competing with Periscope when it comes to total reach <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live is competing with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>video While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live videos get more views over time than Periscopes if they dont garner more views than a regular <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>video there is no point to it From my own experience all of my views came after it was posted thus defeating the purpose of a livestream Im willing to bet the livestreams that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>claimed received millions of views would have occurred even if they werent live As I mentioned in my last article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has to calibrate who it decides to give a notification when a person goes live For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Mentions the livestream notified those who recently engaged or liked the page of the celebrity to get the word out about the stream without bombarding people who werent interested In my experience my mom was the only one of my friends to be notified Two of my friends joined the stream after seeing it in their newsfeed As I said almost all of the views came after I posted the video Obviously the number of views is anecdotal information but my experience with the features within the app should be the same for all users trying it out for the first time Going from Periscope to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live is akin to going from an iPhone s to an iPhone Gs because the technology isnt up to par <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live had an incredibly long delay making it impossible to communicate with my viewers I measured the delay on both apps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live had an average delay of seconds and Periscope had an average delay of seconds using the same Wifi signal and the same iPhone s Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live isnt even live which defeats the purpose Keep in mind Periscope is the best experience as it does a few seconds better than Meerkat Another negative is regular noncelebrity users cant get followers or subscribers to grow their viewership With the Mentions app celebrities can have viewers subscribe to get notified about future streams Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live also doesnt have hearts which makes it like a photo sharing app that is trying to compete with Instagram while not having filters for photos Finally <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live isnt really a broadcast because when you tap public you cant see who is joining if you arent friends with them I doubt many people on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will use it publicly I only tapped it to test out the feature Either way this limited my ability to welcome these viewers which gets them to stay longer In conclusion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live broadcasts arent live broadcasts Im assuming the usability is better for the Mentions app but I thought <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was testing it with celebrities to bring it to regular users Apparently it needs more testing If it takes a few more months to get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live to have less of a lag Periscope will continue to widen its lead in features and strength of community There has been a major decline in downloads on the App Store for Periscope over the Christmas holiday As you can see from the chart it dropped to th place during Christmas and rebounded somewhat to st place This decline is not because of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live It is because Periscope isnt exactly a social media app While most social media apps such as Instagram were probably used heavily during Christmas to share family photos users who care about their privacy dont want to broadcast their time with their family to strangers I expect Periscope to rebound further into and get back into the top apps in the App Store While monetization of Periscope will not come in for Twitter it has already come for scopers Alex Pettitt has done a livestream sponsored by SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK Alex Pettitt and other scopers are excepting donations on PayPalme NASDAQ PYPL Bree Olson is actually charging for a follow on Periscope These are small steps but they show the potential of streamers to make real money just like on YouNow If streamers can make money they will make more Periscopes and of higher quality This is just like how YouTubers use the money they make from videos to improve their channel As you can see from the Alexa chart below Periscopes desktop website continues to grow exponentially It shows how diversified its user base is by having a better rank globally than in the United States Blab and Meerkat have fallen off the map completely as their usage has declined YouNows Alexa ranking hasnt grown since October and is less popular than Periscope on desktop On mobile its ranking in the App Store has improved since October but is still slightly behind Periscope I dont think competition is the biggest obstacle for Periscopes success Executing on improving the product is the biggest obstacle That being said less competition cant hurt the app I dont see YouNow as a longterm threat to Periscope because it is so heavily geared toward younger users YouNow has done great job at getting YouTubers onto its platform by engaging them directly While this is a great strategy the reason why social networks are successful is they have the best platform that makes the argument for joining without having to individually engage users I doubt Periscope personally asked Jenna Marbles one of the biggest YouTubers to do a scope This is why Periscope can scale better than YouNow
