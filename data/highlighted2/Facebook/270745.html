My Janet Yellen Impersonation clicks Facebooks Live Video feature will be a success as it finally roles out to everyone Instagram still has a lot of untapped potential I wasnt a fan of Facebooks NASDAQ FB initial launch of its live product to only celebrities via the Mentions app <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was already behind the curve with its live function Periscope NYSE TWTR launched over eight months ago and Meerkat has been out a couple of months longer Adding in its inability to be used by most people made me disappointed twice as much Finally the firm is now testing out the ability to livestream for everyone If you have been reading my articles on this topic you would have anticipated this move Looking at this timeline it isnt as disappointing now that it is actually launching as having celebrities use it can be considered an elongated test The test isnt just about how the features will technically function its also how the notification system will work and how it will fit into newsfeed It would be a disaster if users were bombarded with notifications As someone who uses Periscope daily has written about it from before it was launched and went to the Periscope Summit in Manhattan I think I have a different perspective on Facebooks live feature From the reports I have read tech journalists are comparing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>live to Periscope and Meerkat Generally they say those apps should brace for impact because a disruption is about to occur In my opinion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live is not a direct competitor to Periscope and Meerkat Instead I think its a direct competitor to Snapchat Pending CHAT From a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>investors perspective this is a positive because Snapchat is a much larger app If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stole all of the Periscope and Meerkat users it wouldnt make a dent in its numbers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has tried and failed miserably to compete with Snapchat by creating copycat apps It shuttered Slingshot Rooms and Riff Its not surprising those attempts failed because Snapchat is excellent at innovating new features ie the ability to scan a profile to connect on the app A side project isnt going to destroy the powerhouse that is Snapchat Why go on any of those lesser apps if all of your friends are already on Snapchat They didnt have any breakthrough features to differentiate themselves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live is different from those failures because it is more integrated with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself and it has a feature Snapchat doesnt have I am still predicting Snapchat will become a livestreaming app but currently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has this advantage over Snapchat To get back to my original point <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live is competing with Snapchat because live video will be shared to your friends and family Only the celebrities and those who chose to make the live video public will have anyone other than their friends watch the livestream This type of content is exactly what is on Snapchat There are other famous public accounts on Snapchat but usually you know most of your connections For nonfamous users Snapchats are about sharing an interesting portion of your life to your friends not about gaining attention Periscope isnt in this category because its main function is to share a portion of your life with someone who is in a different part of the world For example I scoped walking in Manhattan and had people from around the world joining and commenting This wouldnt work for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live because a majority of my friends have seen this hundreds of times Periscope is an entrepreneurial venture at becoming your own TV broadcaster On Periscope your goal is to use the platform to create an entertaining experience For example there is a cab driver in England who tells his customers whatever the comments say Periscope is taking time to develop because it takes time for creators to understand what type of content is watchable I consider Periscope a competitor to YouTube because it has similar content Its a live vlog which is meant to inform and engage with the viewer I hope this article doesnt come across as me being a shareholder of Twitter trying to defend Periscope because I love the app In reality I am attempting to show how live video will transform every aspect of social media Status updates will consist more of livestreams than of text This is the next iteration of content First we had text then pictures then video then live video Facebooks new feature will drive this trend forward I dont think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be able to finally destroy Snapchat or steal its viewers as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live will be a semipublic window into someones life while Snapchat has the veil of privacy because everything is deleted within hours The big advantage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has over Snapchat and Periscope is its more developed relationship with advertisers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has greater scale for corporations to experiment with using it to get the word out about new products Live is a scary proposition for brands because a commenter can say something offensive or the person in the video can have a slipup that is seen by thousands of people with no possibility of being edited out If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can hold companies hands through the process it has the potential to be the most profitable of the three <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is like Apple NASDAQ AAPL in this way because it has the potential to have a huge market share it terms of profitability It can afford to lose the Periscope superstars and independent channels This is the same relationship it has competitively with YouTube It lets YouTube have the countless vloggers with subscribers but it skims off the top of the internet heap the best most popular content and content creators and forms a monetization relationship with them YouTube and Periscope will always offer a better deal to the smaller creator trying to gain a following but this comes at a cost This is why YouTube has had trouble becoming as profitable as you would assume the biggest collection of video content in the world would be While I continue to believe YouTube Red will be successful and a Periscope Red or Periscope Blue could work out in the future it makes much more sense for an investor to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt have to start charging for a formerly free product in order to make billions While Periscope was named the App of the Year by the App Store the true App of the Year was Instagram Instagram is Facebooks crown jewel and will be the main diver of growth in the next five years The reason it will drive growth is teenage usage continues to increase As you can see from the chart of teens consider Instagram their most important social media app Companies need to disrupt their own business in order to stay ahead or else another firm will If it wasnt for Instagram taking share from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>among teens investors original worry about teenage usage would cause the stock to plummet just as it did postIPO The next chart is a thing of beauty for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shareholders As you can see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has of the top apps with Instagram being downloaded on of smartphones in America Instagram is in its beginning phases of integration with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Instagram is still in the early innings of its ads By using usage data from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the ads are even more targeted than they would otherwise be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has just revamped its eve nts app which you can see below There are synergies with Instagram where posted pictures can sink with events to give users a vivid idea of what happened at a local event The next phase where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will really flex its muscles is with an Instagram algorithm which will show users the content they are most likely to engage with While the dedicated teenage users view every post for the hundred accounts they follow an algorithm can get new users hooked In essence what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trying to do is get teens who use Instagram onto <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and adults who use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>onto Instagram I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be successful at both ventures <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>still looks like a great investment as its business model is more solid than ever before I would even venture to say <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can be considered as a viable retirement stock The company is able to flex its strength which is its social graph to kill off any competitors The only firm that has effectively challenged <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in the past few years is Snapchat and Snapchat still hasnt impacted the growth among teenagers on Instagram
