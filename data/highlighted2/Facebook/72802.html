customer loyalty but only one evolves in an Oligopoly Last week I wrote a stock analysis for Seeking Alpha on Verizon NYSE VZ you can read the analysis here While I was writing this article I kept comparing this telecom giant vs one of my holdings Telus Corporation TTo or TU on the NYSE While both companies get the bulk of their income from mobile services and both companies pay healthy dividends VZ is worth times the market capitalization of TU Still I prefer the small cap even if the dividend is lower Since Telus could be very attractive for US investors as it trades on the NYSE I thought it was worth making a real comparison between both companies Verizon shows an impressive profile with million retail customers and covers more than of the US population What is even better than having lots of customers Keeping them Verizon has earned very high customer loyalty throughout the years and is known for great customer service Unfortunately its strength is also in the middle of one of its main weakness the cost of maintaining such a high quality network Last year VZ spent B alone to maintain this network This represents of their sales While the company generates lots of cash flow a good chunk is used up in operating this great business model As technology evolves quickly VZ also invests in other avenues It has recently bought AOL NYSE AOL for billion The main idea behind this transaction is to integrate AOLs advertising platform into the new VZ video mobile service Many say its a risky move as VZ bought a declining giant to enter the arena with many others Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB the masters of online advertising Telus has been providing communication services for over years The business has evolved greatly over the past years We can now divide Teluss business model into two segments This is now the bread and butter of the company Telus is known for keeping its clients and shows a high profit margin per customer with a growing client base up to million Teluss wireless services assure an interesting growth for the future They also cover all the important parts of Canada Telus not only provides wireline phone services but also internet connection and TV cable services While the wireline phone business is slowing down Telus compensates by adding other wireline services to its wireless customers This explains why the internet and TV services are growing this fast Telus is protected by a strong oligopoly in Canada While the Government has many times expressed the desire to open the door to other competitors many of them have decided to ignore the Canadian market knowing it would cost lots of money to break the oligopoly VZ finally decided to ignore the Canadian opportunity in and bought back its shares of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone NASDAQ VOD instead In other words Telus is still playing against players of its own size while Verizon has to compete with much bigger players on its playground Throughout my investing years Ive read much financial research and learned from my own experience In order to build a solid dividend growth portfolio I came up with dividend investing rules being part of my investing principles I will use my dividend investing rules to compare both companies In order to compare apples to apples Ive used TU stats instead of TTO All data is coming from YCharts It is well known that high dividend yield stocks often provide smaller growth perspectives After all if a company pays a high yield its not a free lunch there is something behind it Financial research has proven the st quartile dividend yield stocks show smaller returns than the nd dividend yield quartile stocks Lets take a look at how both companies yield over the past years As you can see VZ is a better dividend payer than Telus However this also leads me to think that VZ is less likely to perform on the stock market over time You can see how both stock prices have evolved over the same period Since there is a net advantage for Telus Lets dig deeper to see why Teluss stock grew twice as fast as VZ Principle If There is One Metric Its Called Dividend Growth My favorite metric to analyze any company is and will always be dividend growth The reason is simple a company constantly increasing its dividend must first generate growing sales and expects growing earnings If both conditions are not met the companys dividend payment will be jeopardized and payment growth will quickly stop Then again lets compare both companies Telus has shown one of the strongest dividend growth performances over the past ten years on the Canadian stock market While Verizons growth is respectable Telus is definitely in another league in terms of dividend growth stocks The stability of the Canadian market doubled with TUs ability to generate high profits from its customers and opens the door for higher dividend payments Principle A Dividend Payment Today is Good A Dividend Guaranteed For the Next Years is Better Strong dividend growth is appreciated by all dividend investors but one must remain cautious about the sustainability of the payment By looking at how a company manages its dividend payout ratio over several years it will be easy to see if the dividend will remain over time Once again Telus shows greater stability in its dividend payout ratio It is even more impressive considering how fast TUs dividend payment grew Principle The Foundation of Dividend Growth Stocks Lies in its Business Model VZ shows a greater ability to increase its revenue but has a hard time generating bigger profits TUs revenues seems to stagnate over the past three years and it will be interesting to see how the company intends to keep growing in the future as earnings wont continue to rise if revenues are not growing Still TU seems to be more profitable So far it seems to be that Telus is more appealing than Verizon However it doesnt necessarily mean its the right time to buy either stock This is why we will take a look at how both companies are valued I will use two techniques to determine the correct valuation The first one will take a look at the year history PE ratio to see how the market sees both companies and the second technique is the dividend discount model DDM to look at the company as a dividend machine DDM calculations are done with a twostage dividend growth spreadsheet provided in the Dividend Monk Toolkit After looking at both valuations Telus doesnt only show the strongest dividend growth profile but also the best valuation TU shares seem to trade on a relatively low PE ratio considering the current market and shows a discount using the Dividend Discount Model On the opposite hand VZ shows a hectic PE ratio history doubled with a premium when compared with the DDM valuation I guess that if the VZ move to buy AOL leads them into another league earnings will follow and the stock might fly higher At the moment I still prefer Telus for more stability even if the cloud of more competition is hanging over its head Penetrating the Canadian market is a quest by itself and not many foreign companies are willing to do so Its also a plus if you buy TU with USD since the Canadian dollar is quite weak recently Source I Prefer The Small Telus Over The Giant Verizon We only use your contact
