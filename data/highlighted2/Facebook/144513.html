style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is testing a Buy Sell button to help people buy new or used products from sellers located nearby A dedicated searchable localized page for trading products is something that eBay has not yet implemented Aside from aggressively promoting hyperlocal advertising to its advertisers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB also wants to enable localization awareness for ordinary people to trade goods inside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is currently testing a Buy Sell button in New Zealand and Australia This is a very important development because it could lead to a better version of eBay NASDAQ EBAY inside Facebooks web and mobile platforms As far as I know localization awareness is still not available to eBay sellers The desktop version of the Buy Sell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page being tested shows only products for sale by vendors located within a certain city or municipality There is also a search engine box and like eBay items for sale are organized into different categories People who cant seem to sell their used or new items on eBay might eventually find <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a worthy alternative The experimental Buy Sell ButtonPage is a big improvement over the Sell Something feature that is available to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Groups Trading new and used items on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>groups has no search ability and sellers are often located in faraway locations Consider this buy sell group that was created for trading cars and car accessories among residents of the City of Manila The lack of location awareness feature allowed vendors outside Manila Batangas and Laguna provinces to still post their items The technology and talent acquired by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>from purchasing product search engine specialist TheFind last March is obviously helping toward making <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a viable store for online shopping Marrying the product search technology of TheFind with Facebooks location awareness technology is a decisive move that could help Zuckerbergs company compete with eBay and other ecommerce portals Location awarenessenabled advertising is a cheaper and better alternative for small businesses to promote their people located near their area of business The same principle applies to Facebooks hyperlocalized version of trading goods online It has several advantages compared to eBays current business model Selling items on Facebooks Buy Sell platform is likely to be cheaper and faster than using eBay Since the buyer and seller are located near each other delivery costs of sold items is minimized A short minute drive to pickupdeliver an item sold through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is superior to any day express courier delivery It is also possible for prospective buyers to personally inspect items through a facetoface meeting with a vendor Product return or refund is also easier done when the people are located within the same area Like eBay <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can monetize trades on its experimental Buy Sell Page service by charging business or professional sellers a small fee per item posted or sold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can also allow users to use their local bank accounts and not just credit cards to buy Credits to buy physical goods <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Credits is losing steam because it is only being used to buy ingame items on social games Webbased gaming is on a big decline It is time for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to enable its payments service to include processing online trading of actual products Testing a localized ecommerce platform is one more reason to go long on FB <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>certainly has a far higher number of active and loyal users than eBay or Amazon NASDAQ AMZN has now Enabling billion people to quickly search buy and receive products from their friends neighbors and town mates is a believable future scenario Fasttracking the implementation of a localized Buy Sell platform in all countries could generate new revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Credits or a new digital wallet service Peertopeer buy and sell transactions should go hand in hand with digital payments The peertopeer Money transfer feature implemented on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger app is still free because it was deemed to be just another feature to improve user stickiness and as a means to show more ads to people FB investors will likely agree with me that digital wallets should be monetized through transaction fees and not through advertising Alpha Omega Mathematica also agrees with the Buy rating made by TipRanks analysts for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Alpha Omega Mathematica still believes that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can sustain its impressive growth in sales and net income <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has outpaced its peers Getting involved in ecommerce is
