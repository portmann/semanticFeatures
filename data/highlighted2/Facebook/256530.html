Any technological lead in a given area is soon matched or leapfrogged by competition In an interview at the Credit Suisse Technology Conference on December Microns NASDAQ MU CFO Ernie Maddock took questions from analysts Unlike most analyst days these questions were excellent and Maddocks answers were sometimes illuminating Since he is the CFO he is mostly interested in costs and margins without being too detailed about the technical issues surrounding the products themselves As the top beancounter at Micron Maddock was suitably cautious and conservative with his answers This is opposed to most CEOs who are naturally more optimistic and sanguine about their products future potential sales and profits In the past I have questioned the validity of the memory oligopoly pricing argument because in my opinion the expanding CAPEX being deployed will require production regardless of prices Like other commodity businesses mining for example once your costs are sunk via CAPEX you must run those lines to generate cash and therefore what seems like oligopoly pricing is really just the high point of the pricing cycle And it looks like the cycles are getting shorter and shorter In this article I will make five points regarding DRAMs oligopoly pricing OP and D NANDs socalled disruptive cost DC Remember Robin always look both ways Batman We talk about pricing but we need to account for the increasing influence on pricing by fewer and fewer large buyers Amazon NASDAQ AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Apple NASDAQ AAPL Samsung OTCSSNLF IBM NYSE IBM HP NYSE HPQ Dell Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY et al are buying tens of trillions of bits at a time and can demand lower prices from the oligopoly sellers This is not just relative to DRAM but to NAND as well As DRAMeXchange noted recently thirdquarter NAND revenues actually dropped Why do you think that is Considering the joint venture status of Toshiba OTCPKTOSYY SanDisk NASDAQ SNDK and Intel NASDAQ INTC Micron why doesnt NAND have oligopoly pricing power The concentration of buyers Apple consumes of all DRAM for example will force lower gross margins GM on all DRAM and NAND vendors Do you really think Apple whose price negotiations are akin to water boarding will let a vendor have GM Not a chance And I doubt Google Amazon etc will either As Maddock said Micron is ramping up NM DRAM Unfortunately Samsung has been shipping NM for some time and in fact states that of its DRAM will be NM in Talk to us a little bit about the nanometer transition how is that going how should we think that unfolds over the next several quarters Right so weve talked about the fact that sort of by the middle of next year its going to represent more than a majority of our DRAM capability This is the leapfrogging I talked about before Samsung will enjoy an advantage perhaps for a year then Microns NM will show up and make the landscape more competitive for sales to the large buyers But for now industry analyst Romit Shah is of the opinion that the lagging technology roadmap and an oversupply of DRAM chips are some real issues hovering around Microns prospects And furthermore Shah also warned that the technology gap between Micron and its peer Samsung creates a cost disparity that is a risk to Microns margins Do you think you will be the low cost producer should we think about it more in terms of the gap today is going to close significantly as you move to D I think the latter is probably better We are not in a position to say we believe we are going to be the cost leader But certainly we are going to be in the same lap of the racetrack with the cost leader if not the cost leader And so we are very comfortable with how we will be positioned as we move forward into the D realm It would take a semantic magician to turn the words in the same lap of the racetrack with the cost leader into the words cost disruptive For more information on NAND in general see In The Land Of NAND Where Do They Stand Points To Ponder Intel has announced it will be starting production of nonvolatile memory D NAND and D XPoint next year in China we now will utilize Intels facility in Dalian China to help expand our manufacturing capacity in nonvolatile memory The expansion is part of our global multisource supply strategy and will allow us to best serve our customers We expect initial production of the D NAND technology in Dalian in the second half of We have a longterm plan for this facility and may invest up to bn over the coming years to transition this site to support leadingedge nonvolatile memory production One has to wonder what this means for the IntelMicron JV and what Micron is going to do with the excess capacity it had for Intels share of D production Hopefully for Micron increased sales will absorb the production Intel will not be taking Also on the Chinese front Tsinghua Group which unsuccessfully bid billion for Micron in July has announced a new billion investment in a new Chinabased memory chip plant The oligopoly seems to be getting larger Along with Samsungs new B fab Intels likely B investment in Dalian and Tsinghuas B thats about billion in new fabs producing products competitive with Microns While the supposed disruptive cost of D NAND was a matter of production efficiencies getting more bits from a wafer at lower cost D XPoint DX is from all appearances a new disruptive technology that fits between D NAND and DRAM in certain applications Disruptive technology typically results in highmargin products so it should eventually be very profitable for both Micron and Intel But there are four main issues with Micron and D XPoint over the next two years at least A How big is the market for DX Because of the cost I do not see DX replacing NAND except in servers How many desktop and notebook users will be willing to pay a premium for DX B The server market for DX is going to mainly be Intels because it will be tying it all together with Xeons and Alteras NASDAQ ALTR FPGA Field Programmable Gate Arrays There will be very few buyers who say lets get the server from Intel and the DX from Micron C For many DX sales Micron will lose DRAM bits andor NAND bits so the net difference will be less than just adding DX to the revenue column The eventual higher margins on DX will partially but not completely offset this difference D When will full volume full margin sales begin Certainly not maybe late but my guess is Apparently there are still bugs being worked out as mentioned in this article An Altera engineer said his company is helping prototype the controller in its FPGAs but hasnt had a hands on with the memory chips Micron is said to have little access to the details of the Intel DIMM extensions for the memory chips I am not accusing Intel of keeping state secrets my guess is its not working yet So the question for Microns investors is when will the big profits hit the bottom line I dont think it will be in the next two years There is also the adoption lag between when a new product is available and when the market accepts it full bore Remember Toshiba invented NAND in How many sales did it get in and I am not saying DX will take a decade but I think it will take longer than most people think Micron suffers from being the little brother in the IntelMicron relationship So it is only natural most people listen to Intel and apply what it says to Micron even when it is not necessarily so In the case of the joint venture I think Intel has dominated the JV and the Dalian expansion is just one example This has affected the investment theme for Micron negatively and I dont see anything in the near term to change that fact That is why IMO MU has languished around the mark for some time now See Intel And Micron Stock Prices Are In The Doldrums For Good Reason Some people think there is still a buyout possibility for Micron but I question that possibility here Reasons Why Micron Hasnt Received Another Buyout Bid However there is plenty of consolidation going on in the chip business so who knows Maybe Tsinghua will raise its bid When I wrote my first of five articles on Micron back in February warning that Samsung was a threat to Micron the stock was at Now it is half of that So I repeat my five previous caveats about buying MUs stock wait until it actually generates some significant profits from the products it talks about before you commit Until then MU is at best a hold We only use your contact details to reply
