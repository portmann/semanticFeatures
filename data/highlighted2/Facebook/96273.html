style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is working the slowplay on monetizing WhatsApp it was effective with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>after all Inward monetization is already occurring as user agreements display <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger will not exactly cannibalize WhatsApp Rather it will buttress Facebooks nowmammoth chunk of the messenger arena <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the resources to emphasize or amplify the messenger services better than competitors many of which are utilizing oldschool monetization tactics Zuckerberg himself said they are not rushing to monetize WhatsApp The right strategy is to focus on connecting the people before aggressively turning them into businesses Once we get to that scale then we think the users will start to become meaningful businesses in their own right Pitching out another curveball FB created <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger which is very similar to WhatsApp Clearly the singular goal is to net as many users as possible FB will then slowly adapt a monetization platform to let businesses slip into this stream WhatsApp founders promised users no gimmicks or cheesy stuff to monetize at the cost of user experience so if FB adds such bells and whistles directly to WhatsApp it could erode the user base While FB probably isnt afraid to change some things they can always squeeze cheesy ad gimmicks into FB messenger for those who dont mind such things Either way FB is already legendary for the slowplay technique of introducing features with low outward invasiveness to user experience and remaining that way for great lengths of time Our explicit strategy is for the next several years to focus on growing and connecting everyone in the world Zuckerberg said Facebooks game involves gaining user dependence first Introducing monetization slowly means people dont feel hardpressed to pony up cash to participate WhatsApp originally gave users a free year of use followed by a per year fee thereafter Some say that its easy to avoid paying that dollar anyways and FB is clearly not looking to become a mere subscription service which always comes with natural limits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants a user pool that spans countries and continents With WhatsApp <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>got exactly that in a rather expensive gift basket With WhatsApp dialing in at million users growing toward billion its clear why FB paid up The billion WhatsApp acquisition has puzzled some investors and it should until recently If monetization is introduced effectively and the userbase remains the high fee could be surmounted A few of WhatsApps competitors monetize with features that many consider cheesy or simply nominal Some rely on ads paid stickers and freemium games to generate revenue Some messengers have taken furthers steps for example WeChat also is integrated with ecommerce sites including JDcom which encourages customers to order products directly from the messaging app Barclays estimates that WeChat revenue will rise annually to billion RMB billion this year From my view Facebooks monetization strategy has evolved beyond gimmicks they are looking for deeprooted institutionaltype moves They will likely capitalize on WhatsApp differently than current messenger apps That monteization will likely include the addition of services that will lasso WhatsApp <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>together as much as possible in terms of monetization and data collection In fact this lassoing appears to have already happened as you can see from this specific section of the user agreement that details <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is datasharing with WhatsApp This translates to what Zuckerberg said regarding WhatsApps future of letting businesses in they have already been let in WhatsApp data can simply fall within Facebooks data mining sales platform as it already exists Apparently this is already happening as well since both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and WhatsApp squeeze users to submit their phone numbers as well so monetization of WhatsApp in Facebooks traditional way is already occurring As Zuckerberg said regarding WhatsApp he thinks users will surface as businesses on their own over time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>sells advertising to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users bought by other users who happen to be businesses This advertising platform relies on stalwart data collection and data linkage occurring during every second of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>showed the market that extremely targeted advertising carries a big relative premium Selling the best of the best in targeted advertising attracts businesses and thats something that WhatsApps competitors might not have Coupling that concept with the notion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the time talent and finances to enhance its own services in any direction needed means that theyll keep the edge in outdeveloping their competitors With massive user bases developing small features that just barely monetize translates to billions of dollars <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is Already Looking Beyond Messengers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to create enveloping user experiences which means increasing the amount of times per day that people are willing to use Facebooks products then expanding the amount of data people will share For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>creating or buying such a big foothold in the messenger market means taking hold of the next biggest platform in social media After all messenger services are used constantly throughout the day seconded in number of visits to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The combo of messenger service and social media platform makes users of both services interact with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>possibly more than any other company in the world So long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is monetizing user experiences growth is imminent until stopped by outside forces While there is some talk about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger cannibalizing WhatsApp users theres a hefty chunk of moot points buried in there To quote one of the greatest movie lines of all time Why build one when you can build two at twice the price from the movie Contact via the s For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>by purchasing the biggest whale in messenger services and then developing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger regardless this remains a sign that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>intends to dominate the messenger market to the best of their abilities FB could have simply developed their own messenger and let WhatsApp remain as competition Thats a big difference of outlook However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>didnt fork over billion to buy a messenger app they spent that money in the attempt to buy a whole market By taking a chunk out of the messenger market it allows FB to slowplay monetization to yield effectiveness If FB tried to develop Messenger on its own without stopping WhatsApp as a competitor then FB Messenger could have fallen into the unused app arena like many of Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL extraneous developments Another few years would have passed and perhaps WhatsApp users would tally billion with a price tag insurmountable In the messenger market what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>did was the equivalent of s Google buying Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO or vice versa its a move that leads to expediting domination of budding markets even further If FB can get a few dollars in advertisement value service upgrade or sidegrade out of WhatsApp the purchase fee will be swallowed rather quickly Yes loyal fans of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or fans of integration as a whole will just use FB Messenger Yet many people will use both apps as needed because why not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>relies on creating a giant pool of users to sell to businesses While this concept might undoubtedly face some legal fragility someday as it should FB has surpassed the billion company status FBs monetization pace was effective and will likely translate to WhatsApps future to some proportion Small or large businesses that purchase advertising throw money in the direction of most effectiveness If you are in that position then the question is who do you rely on the FB Goliath who offers a slew of information about users or FBs competitor with million users and no depth of historic data on those users Such businesses will go to FB so long as they provide the best If we look at the paidperclick advertising market for small websites trying to monetize through advertising Google is still considered the absolute best They pay out more and offer more Some competitors offer more convoluted programs and rack up a lot of controversy and criticism often due to lack of payouts and other serious problems In the Internet adsales world actual corruption and gouging is a common fear among advertisers not that Google is free from controversy but the problem is that its too easy for companies to fake advertising results lie cheat and steal Most ad potency data comes from internal documentation offered by the ad sales company themselves Such complaints can be easily researched and they deliver the idea that massive household names can become a more reliable goto for advertisers Reliability itself is a primary feature and something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>probably offers adpurchasing customers The point is where will advertisers go Every penny they spend on advertising is another slew of profitless products they must sell to pay for that advertising While I personally think the heavy monetization of users in terms of spyandsell is more than just a problem as it stands today I dont think FB will have a problem monetizing WhatsApp or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger collectively Its pretty clear that Zuckerberg is after the entire social media puzzle The interesting yet controversial purchase of Oculus has deep social media connotations He knows that some company will push social media into a virtual reality experience Virtual reality could put distant people directly into the illusion of direct physical presence and then extend into the far reaches of fantasy For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to roll in simple messenger services remains a simple step toward that encompassing experience Zuckerberg is actually looking toward Oculus is far from being a mainstream concept but thats the endgame FB must be looking to Today it seems that buying or developing messenger apps is a huge business maneuver but with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>valued at hundreds of billions WhatsApp is more of an intermediate moneymaking venture to provide monetary support for that virtual future of social media Whether or not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is capable of reaching that distant reality is a different matter altogether but I believe this envelops the status of the WhatsApp purchase and I think FB is more than capable of closing over the astronomical purchase price if current trends continue Authors personal comments I dont have a position in <span
