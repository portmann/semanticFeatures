Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock is divorced from financial reality The company continues to try new things as Google did in the last decade Remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Phone Of course you do It was a disaster a custom skin on Android phones that went about as far as Amazons Fire Phone in the marketplace Yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>hasnt suffered the way Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN has for this failure The reason is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>unlike nearly every other big company in Silicon Valley just keeps trying new stuff <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is Silicon Valleys Peter Pan refusing to grow up Just in the last week <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced moves to host major news sources inside <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to support embedding of videos directly in the platform and make an entry into the Internet of Things at its F developer conference These may work or they may not Most companies hosting videos wouldnt risk angering Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube in the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has but the company seems to relish it Its for things like this that the stock has become disconnected from financial reality As I noted recently in comparing the stock to that of Amazon a piece that was widely panned by commenters Facebooks valuation is completely disconnected from financial reality The company had revenues of billion in its most recent year yet its market cap is billion Yes advocates will point out that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>brought a Googlelike in every last year to the bottom line and the PriceEarnings multiple of is actually lower than a staid company like Red Hat NYSE RHT But its still for a company this size absurdly high For many investors today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is what Google used to be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares are up over the last year while Googles have gone exactly nowhere down This is true despite the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now running TV advertisements has opened a new headquarters complex and gotten into the crosshairs of European regulators just like Google While Google has more than five times the revenue of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>billion vs billion and almost five times the profit billion vs Facebooks billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now has of Googles market cap trailing it just billion to billion All this for a company that is for all intents and purposes becoming just like Google only with search tied to people instead of things Which brings me back to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>phone Might <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>try again Right now it is busy integrating its WhatsApp App into Google Android But its also bringing its latest features to Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Windows Phone as quickly as it does Android including voice calling Microsoft which has a market cap of billion could really use the new momentum if its phone is going to be competitive and not get buried like BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY was due to lack of support Could a more formal tieup between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Microsoft be in the works I dont know Its entirely speculative But the fact is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the kind of company that might try something like that Its making Google look old and Microsoft look ancient And that as much as anything is why investors continue to love the stock Source <span style='background-color:
