earnings model while the latter shows why being is often not good enough Were not saying Twitter will inevitably go the way of MySpace but it will need to improve its product considerably if it wishes to grow to the level of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The difference between a social media network success story and failure is simple product iteration and innovation coupled with disciplined execution This has been the difference between social media giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Twitter NYSE TWTR While Twitter has spent time fighting through management shifts and attempting to discover its true calling as a social media platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been busy growing its global scale LinkedIn NYSE LNKD continues to navigate its wide range of fair value outcomes and we maintain our view that the companys business model has yet to be tested Twitter is still in the midst of its search for a new CEO and its interim CEO Jack Dorsey is also the CEO of IPOtobe Square giving him an overflowing cup of responsibility He may be the right man for the CEO job at Twitter however and his candid approach to secondquarter results on July was more refreshing than the results themselves Were monitoring executive changes closely Monetization of the Twitter platform was strong in the quarter as the firm grew revenue from the yearago period to million and adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to million Though the firm is still losing money on a GAAP basis it reported nonGAAP diluted earnings per share of up from in the second quarter of Despite the solid progress in monetization Dorsey blatantly stated his dissatisfaction with Twitters active user growth rates Excluding SMS Fast Followers Monthly Active Users MAUs advanced to million in the quarter a gain on a yearoveryear basis but a disappointing increase of millionless than growthon a sequential basis The relatively stagnant sequential growth is a reflection of product iterations and innovative initiatives that have failed to produce the results they once promised Nevertheless the firm is just scratching the surface of its true potential In order to realize that potential however Twitter must refocus and execute with much better discipline The potential of the network as a newslike update platform is largely unrealized as most current users scroll aimlessly through their timelines having to digest often useless information they may have selected to follow but ultimately care little about The firms Project Lightning scheduled to launch this fall targets the showing of more meaningful tweets and conversations faster an initiative management believes will help the network capture its potential as an uptothe minute informative platform Whats more is that Twitters untapped potential spans the globe The company has over brand awareness in the most important global markets but despite this the network has achieved less than penetration in those same markets Management believes it can increase this penetration rate through the simplification of its product and clearer communication of the unique value Twitter offers In essence large scale changes will be needed in order for the company to succeed in the mass market but the company still has substantial expansion potential nonetheless We cant make the investment case for Twitter The firms equity has substantial cashflow duration risk and we think shares will trade with the technical trends for the foreseeable future which simply doesnt bode well The companys shares are a lotto ticket not likely to pay off and if they do not anytime soon As Twitter struggles to find itself <span style='background-color:

message and load speeds in others The firm has also enriched its product by making it easier for users to find more relevant and engaging content such as increased video content The focus on video

fantastic performance from the underlying equity The company remains highup on the watch list LinkedIn the worlds largest professional network on the Internet reported solid secondquarter results on July The company reported revenue growing from the yearago period to million and adjusted EBITDA grew to million Recentlyacquired lyndacom an online education company offering various software and other business skill video courses taught by industry experts had a negative impact of percentage points on adjusted EBITDA margin which was as reported and is expected to have a similar impact on

continue to capitalize on LinkedIns platform and the growth in engagement is even more encouraging than the member growth users are uncovering more and more ways to add value across their professional

will inevitably go the way of MySpace but it will need to improve its product considerably if it wishes to grow to the level of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>From our perspective Twitters shares are nothing more than lotto tickets dont hold your breath hoping they will pay off The social media frenzy has been likened to the dotcom bubble but we think theres at least one exception <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The Zuckerberg production continues to grow like a weed and post significant net income growth even on a GAAP basis If we were forced to own one social media entity it would definitely be <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but only at the right price the low end of the fair value range We keep waiting LinkedIn has similar financial qualities as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but were less enthused about the professional networking site if only because were uncertain
