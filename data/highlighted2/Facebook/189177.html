NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog One thing Ive learned from my three and a half years of writing publicly on the internet is you never know which posts are going to go viral Nothing proves this point more than last weeks post The UN Releases Plan to Push for Worldwide Internet Censorship Although I certainly thought it was an important story I never expected it to become the beast it did Under US law the law that not coincidentally governs most of the worlds largest online platforms intermediaries such as Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>generally cant be held responsible for what people do on themBut the United Nations proposes both that social networks proactively police every profile and postand that government agencies only license those who agree to do so Interestingly it appears Apple wants to get ahead of the curve and begin censoring news the US government might find embarrassing right away Freelance journalist and data artist Josh Begley has been methodically recording US military drone activity for years Every week or so whenever the strikes occur Begley will post a news story from the dronestream Twitter account identifying when and where drone strikes have occurred before feeding the results into an app calledMetadata Longtime Liberty Blitzkrieg readers will be familiar with Dronestream as I highlighted it all the way back in in the post The Kid Who Tweets Every Drone Strike But on Sunday Dronestream tweeted that Metadata which sends out push notifications every time there is a US drone strike had been removed from the App Store after seven months of being openly available Apple still aspires to be a hub for serious newsItsbuilding tools like Apple News to help journalists and publishers reach new audiencesBut Apples opaque filtering process shows that it may not be ready to decide for the public what kind of content weshould or shouldnt be exposed to Earlier this month Apple censored a journalistic app that took you to the scene of the Ferguson Missouri shooting of Michael Brown The tech giant has also taken down educational apps that depicted the Confederate Flag in its historical context All while allowing for apps that include violence and graphic depictions of war like Hitman Sniper and Zyngas Empires and Allies Then again those apps all include inapp purchases from which Apple collects revenue And none of them is offensive to the United States government Everyone should call out Apple on this pathetic disgusting authoritypandering behavior It also reminds me of some of the warningsI issuedin the post The Pentagon Creates Partnership with Apple to Develop Wearable Tech Moving along the Guardian is reporting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has banned an ad fromthe Royal National Institute of Blind People due to get this negativity Facebookhas banned a hardhitting ad campaign by the Royal National Institute of Blind People arguing that users of the social networking site should only see neutral or positive messages The RNIB launched the ad on its YouTube channel and has been seeking to run a campaign featuring the video across <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>once again demonstrating its key role in ensuring the next generation of Americans grows up to be apathetic ignorant submissive little debt serfs Facebooks advertising team has refused to clear the video ad for use in a campaign across its network saying it breaks its guidelines on language that is profane vulgar threatening or generates high negative feedback Asking for clarification the RNIBs social media team received a further email response saying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not very keen on hardhitting ads Weve found that people dislike ads that directly address them or their personal characteristics said a member of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Ads Team Ads should not single out individuals or degrade people We dont accept language like fear of losing your sight losing your job and the like Instead text must present realistic and accurate information in a neutral or positive way and should not have any direct attribution to people We were really shocked to find out that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had banned our advert but even more surprised when they couldnt tell us exactly why were still not sure what weve really done wrong here said Natasha Dickinson group head of marketing and communications at the RNIB The Pentagon Creates Partnership with Apple to Develop Wearable Tech <span

a political agenda here private nonpublic entities do have free speech and can legally censor and control content on their systems Contrary to the Supreme Courts decisions of the past neither <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>nor your local bakery are public accommodations Thu Ataxic Press An interesting future might be one where private entities have functional monopoly control over access to speech thereby rendering the public accommodation angle moot Thu swass Businesses respond to money If enough people are fed up with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or any other business for censoring they will simply abandon them and move to another service thereby prompting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to change their policy or accept their fate I think so long as we continue to apply pressure to businesses as the public we can keep this from becoming a huge problem When businesses make dumb decisions it is the capitalist that sees an opportunity to take their market share Thu Ataxic Press Actually diseducation goes a long way in mediating what you propose I think a lot of money is currently martialed in this regard Thu madcows what ever happened to MySpace <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will go the way of every other digital entertainment Eventually the digitards find another distraction May facebook google and apple all disappear they are far too political and abusive its disgusting Thu rt Thu American Psycho Thu Groundhog Day Dont know many people who still login to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>other then to login to ifferent websites using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which Im sure they count as active daily users But when the dislike button goes live these corporation s are not gonna be to happy Thu Skateboarder Apple wants you to be in a selfcongratulatoryfeelgood state at all times Drone strikes and death do not get people into that state and therefore the app that exposes such information is banned From the same people who will help the popo in turning off your camera when youre in a crowd and something important needs to be filmed Thu Normalcy Bias I dont know why theres any surprise here Both companies will continue to use their influence to drive as many of their workers wages as possible down to a bare subsistence level Thu semperfi Thu SlaveFashion Oldwood You and Yahoo I might have been the only one who saw the Yahoo story this morning about some Russians attempted hack
