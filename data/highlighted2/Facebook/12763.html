Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class performance yield and more check out the ETF Hub ETF Hub FB unveiled Messenger Platform at its f conference on Wednesday While most are talking about ESPN and the Weather Channel as application partners I am more focused on the retail aspect of this new service Through retail and other recently announced payment services FB has a legitimate chance to compete against EBAY and WU longterm Lastly FB is even set up nicely to compete against MA and V as a payment processor The end result could be billions of dollars annually a payments segment thats just as large as advertising for FB <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has officially ended its first day of the f developer conference in California and among the highlights were new details for its popular Messenger app <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>unveiled the Messenger Platform a way for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users to now communicate and utilize other apps within Messenger That said we know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is all about making communication sharing and conversations better making the world a more connected place But for investors it all comes down to dollars and cents So after listening to the conference here is a way that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>might use the Messenger Platform to create billions of dollars annually Messenger Platform allows developers to hook their apps into the Messenger service Initially there will be apps when the Platform launches including prominent apps like ESPN and the Weather Channel Messenger users will be able to install apps into the Platform and then share content from those apps with other users or communicate directly with the appbusiness As you might imagine sharing scores from an NBA game the weather or even inserting photos into a GIF with the use of Jib Jab app will be popular at first But none of these things create dollars and cents for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>especially since the service is free for users That said one function on the Messenger Platform with retail does hold promise and perhaps a glimpse into the future Keep in mind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>recently implemented usertouser payment services into Messenger The picture below shows how the Messenger Platform can work with partnered retailers As seen the Messenger Platform allows users to communicate directly with a company and then make purchases <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is yet to gain big retailers like Walmart NYSE WMT Best Buy NYSE BBY or Kohls NYSE KSS as developerspartners but if so purchasing volume could intensify quickly with such a service In many ways the Messenger Platform becomes one way for big box retailers to combat the faster growing and often cheaper ecommerce giants like Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN Therefore I imagine that many big box retailers and retailers in general will embrace this new service gaining access to Messengers million users Further once a user makes a purchase the following occurs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>provides very detailed shipping information and purchasing history via the supported app and UPS NYSE UPS While all of this is great it still doesnt answer the question of how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is going to monetize the service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not charging any fees for Messenger Platform users and by using the credit card that users have on file <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it is not collecting any processing or transaction fees That said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a history of giving away services now to earn revenue later <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>went several years without any ads on its core site because it didnt want to risk harming the user experience After spending over billion to acquire WhatsApp it still hasnt unveiled any meaningful monetization plans the same applies to Instagram While we can assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will monetize these services via ads video subscriptions etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is yet to do so in part because it wants to maintain a high user experience As it relates to Messenger we already have pretty good indications that it will be monetized via payments Given the fact that WhatsApp functions much like Messenger but has higher utilization in international markets we can also assume it will be monetized similarly Perhaps the biggest indication that payments will be the fundamental tool for these apps is hire of former PayPal Chief David Marcus to Head the development of Messenger Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has already implemented usertouser payments on Messenger and with its latest Platform move the company is adding retailers to the mix Facebooks history does suggest that the monetization of Messenger Platform will remain non existent for some time However due to the sheer size of its user base combined with my expectations for widespread retail adoption of the service it could be an approach thats just as meaningful as advertisements longterm First off Messenger Platform gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a unique approach While Apple NASDAQ AAPL Pay can be used for mobile orders it is mostly intended for use in brickandmortar retail and for everyday purchases Hence PayPal remains the prominent online payments solution for consumers having million users at the end of its most recent quarter So what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has done thus far is bypass the market that Apple has already penetrated with Pay and also bypassing its measly royalty from transaction processors Visa NYSE V and Mastercard NYSE MA and instead focus on Western Unions NYSE WU consumertoconsumer and PayPays online payments business Unfortunately there is no way to know how or when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will begin to monetize the service But as a reference Western Union collected over billion in revenue from consumertoconsumer transactions during its last quarter and eBays NASDAQ EBAY PayPal created billion Assuming that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>monetizes via fees it will surely charge users much less than the noted Western Union and PayPal services especially after providing the service freeofcharge at first However even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>charges just of the fee that Western Union and PayPal charges I think it could very well collect just as much revenue The reason is because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has nearly twice as many users on its Messenger and WhatsApp services combined Granted this is assuming that WhatsApp will adopt a Messenger Platformlike service I think it will but on a global scale adding currency exchange to the mix and possibly even functioning like a bank of sorts Albeit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is one of the most innovating and disruptive dotcom companies in history implying that its plan for the Messenger Platform likely far exceeds my wildest dreams This fact is important for investors to keep in mind as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has many moving parts as it relates to payments not only on mobile messaging services but also on desktop As seen above <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is also testing a Buy button This is yet to be implemented on a large scale but is possible due to a partnership with PayPal competitor Stripe This further proves that Facebooks payment initiatives run deep in the companys core and that it is a big plan for the future beyond mobile messaging It is because of this that I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>eventually goes the route of becoming a payment processor like Mastercard and Visa Last year there was news that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>applied for a license in Ireland as an emoney service provider allowing users to store pay or transfer currency This led some to think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was exploring the idea of becoming a bank but given the number of transactions that might occur on its platform I think challenging the likes of Visa and capitalizing on the sub of transaction costs that processors earn would be a much more viable business that and the operating margin that payment processors typically carry due to low costs beyond initial infrastructure investments The bottom line is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>just launched Phase in what I expect to be a long journey in becoming a meaningful player in the payments industry Yes it has started with Messenger and free services but it could very well end with s of global retailers and service providers partnered with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>through the Messenger Platform and WhatsApp with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>either collecting fees from its users or from retailers as a payment processor Regardless the future looks quite promising for Facebooks payment initiatives and it all started at the f
