lot of noise has been made about the rising popularity of WhatsApp very few have noticed the rising popularity of Facebooks own Messenger App At the rate Messenger is growing chances are that Messenger will become even more popular than WhatsApp in a very short time Meaning the billion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>paid for WhatsApp has gone down the tubes and shareholders were diluted for nothing Ever since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB acquired WhatsApp for about billion last year everyone has been asking the question of when and how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>plans on making any money with WhatsApp While it is not clear in my mind what Facebooks initial intentions where as things stand today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is essentially giving up on the prospect of ever making any money with WhatsApp The main reason for this is cannibalization While a lot of noise has been made about the rising popularity of WhatsApp very few have noticed the rising popularity of Facebooks own Messenger App And the reason for is simple In my mind there is no practical reason to use WhatsApp if you are a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>user With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger both mobile and desktop users can text send voice messages and talk to other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users While the same can be said about other popular messaging Apps there is one very big difference with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger Almost all your friends and even people you do not know have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account by default What this means is that you do not need to tell your friends to download another messenger App because chances are a sure bet I would say they already have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account And since you do not need to beg your friends to download another App you use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger right out of the box knowing they will answer you because they have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account by default In addition even if your friends do not have the App installed you can still text them send voice messages and even talk to them anyway if you have the right browser Not only that but as far as texting is concerned <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>messenger has a real slick and light desktop version that does not even need to be downloaded Personally I mostly text my Friends on Messenger from the desktop And while Messenger might not be as good as WhatsApp in many respects the difference is that you know by default you will able to reach your friends on the other side if you look for them Why bother downloading so many messenger Apps when all you need is one Yes this is really cool and convenient and its the reason for the rising popularity of Facebooks Messenger As you can see from the charts above as of April of WhatsApp had about million users and as of April of it currently has million users Thats an increase of on a yearly basis However when looking at Messenger for same time period user count went from million to million or an increase of In fact my guess is that in a very short while more people will be using Messenger than WhatsApp So if people will be using Messenger as opposed to WhatsApp what is the reason for having let alone paying billion for WhatsApp I have no idea I am not sure the reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>bought WhatsApp in the first place However what is evident from the data is that Messenger will probably become even more popular than WhatsApp in a very short time As such it is clear <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will never be able to charge any money for WhatsApp given Facebooks own Messenger App is free simpler to use and above all you take for granted that the people you know will be online to answer your text or voice message I continue to be negative of Facebooks stock because I think the valuation is more than stretched for my tastes please consider Short Twitter And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>They Are Grossly Overvalued However given the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>diluted the living daylights out of shareholders for nothing I have become even more negative for this is a clear sign of management incompetence Source Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook
