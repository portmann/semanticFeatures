Alpha WhatsApp touts million monthly active users At the current growth rate WhatsApp could hit billion monthly active users by end of At the rate that WhatsApp is growing I predict that this billion messaging app will hit billion monthly active users by the end of Jan Koum Founder and CEO of WhatsApp announced on his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB page that WhatsApp now enjoys million active users As per Statistas chart below WhatsApp only took months to add another million monthly active users from Januarys million figure The chart above also says that WhatsApp is adding million active users per day Since Zuckerberg is not going to use advertisements to monetize the huge population of WhatsApp addicts the other alternative is to do what Skype does to generate most of its revenue WhatsApps huge million user base last year was not monetized properly Contrary to the strong revenue stream of Skype WhatsApp only generated million in revenue for the first six months of WhatsApp also incurred a net loss of million during the same period The substantial net loss is due to the million loss incurred via sharebased compensation expenses and common stocks issued at below fair value Nevertheless if we assume that WhatsApp made million in FY revenue from its paying subscribers it would still be peanuts compared to what Skype makes from selling Skype Credits WhatsApp has implemented voice calling for Android last month and will also implement the said feature soon on iOS and Windows devices Business logic says Zuckerberg will charge fees for international voicevideo calls on WhatsApp much like Skype does right now The twist is that Zuckerberg wont allow ads to annoy WhatsApp users Free users of Skype are now bombarded by Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT ads This noads policy could further accelerate the rapid growth of WhatsApps number of global active users Zuckerberg insisted last year that WhatsApp is worth more than billion He is the boy genius but his valuation of WhatsApp might take some time before it becomes a reality In theory my billion monthly active users estimate for means WhatsApp could deliver around million in revenue by My revenue projection is from my estimate that Skype boasted of its user base were paying subscribers of WhatsApps billion active users would sign up for the year annual subscription by early The other million could come from selling international call credits My million estimate is influenced by Skypes own revenue of million This is the year before Microsoft bought Skype so we could assume that the million was not polluted by ad sales Skype touted million monthly active users by end of If we calculate the revenue per monthly active user of Skype in it will come to Voice calling is a new feature in WhatsApp and it will take years before people adopt it for international calls I do not dare use the full revenue per active user of Skype to calculate the potential revenue from WhatsApps future premium voice call service I therefore guesstimate that revenue per active user is more realistic I am also assuming that only of my estimated billion WhatsApp active users will use the app to make international calls The Skype unit of Microsoft which includes Lync was already estimated to generate billion in annual sales in Zuckerbergs claim that WhatsApp is worth more than billion is more realistic once WhatsApp also starts delivering ninefigure revenue numbers Even at million annual sales WhatsApps billion price tag still comes with PriceSales ratio of x FB trades at a PS ratio of only A billionyear revenue stream from WhatsApp could still be possible even without mobile advertisements by maximizing the voicevideo calling potential of this app Microsoft has renamed its businesscentric Lync messaging app to Skype for Business The Skype brand is a juggernaut cash generator that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>must fully imitate with WhatsApp My million revenue estimate for could be higher if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also implements a WhatsApp for Business WhatsApps voice calling feature should not only cater to consumers It should also be positioned as an alternative to Microsofts Skype for Business Even though theres a noads policy on WhatsApp some marketing professionals still see WhatsApp as a great tool to interact with consumers and sell products Even if WhatsApp does not deliver my estimate of million annual sales there are still expert analysts at TipRanks who rate FB as a Strong Buy Those experts have an average month price target of for FB The experts still have a deep faith that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will continue its strong growth momentum Source <span
