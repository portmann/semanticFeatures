Apples ecosystem Unless the company has something much bigger up its sleeve Apple Music represents a miscalculated and concerning loss of focus Its no exaggeration to say that the iPhone has changed the future of Pandora I could take this little guy out of my pocket and choose music to suit my needs It took us one day to make Pandora fully background aware on iPhone Pandora NYSE P cofounder Tim Westergren said those things on the same stage Steve Jobs owned during an April event where Apple NASDAQ AAPL introduced multitasking on the iPhone There arent many very good pictures of Westergrens appearance floating around online which is why I had to use this relatively weak one courtesy of Engadget But lots has changed in fiveplus years If Westergren or even somebody less random appeared at an Apple event with Tim Cook today you could have designs on dozens if not hundreds or thousands of highquality snapshots via Google owned by Alphabet GOOG GOOGL I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Instagram or any other repository that chronicles our most messed up cultural practice of experiencing life through a smartphone screen While Apple might not be wholly responsible for Pandoras success it deserves all the credit Westergren gave and as far as I know still gives it And the feeling should be mutual After all Pandora consistently ranks as one of the topgrossing apps in Apples App Store As I pound out the prose on my MacBook Pro with Retina Display circa mid Pandora occupies fifth place in that ranking two notches behind more subscriptionfocused Spotify For the record Pandora is the th most popular free app in the App Store four spots ahead of thplaced Spotify I found these details by tapping Top Charts on my iPhones App Store app Clearly Pandora and Spotify both owe Apple the world in what has long been a mutually beneficial relationship But now for some reason Apple seems to want to change and really has changed all of that Its probably even fair to say that to some extent Apple via Apple Music wants to crush Pandora and Spotify just as it did the artist formerly known as RIM thats BlackBerry NASDAQ BBRY Im willing to suffer murder or a heart attack in the comments section of this article but this is something I just dont get When Apple went after BlackBerry it made all the sense in the world to attack BlackBerry completely misunderstood the smartphone market going forward Theres no need for a lengthy explanation If you require a refresher read the excellent book released earlier this year Losing the Signal The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry It chronicles the divergent views of the future of mobile computing Jim Balsillie was wrong about the role of apps Steve Jobs was right Simple as that Apple exploited BlackBerrys ineptitude not to mention the internal strife and chaos It turned out to be one of the most obvious and gamechanging decisions in tech history Looking back at that crazy story tells us as much about Apple as it does about the old RIM Apple particularly in the Jobs era always chose its targets wisely and at the right time To that end there was probably a reason why the company was so late to the streaming music game and really never actually went there under Jobs It wasnt that Jobs as I incorrectly argued in missed the boat on streaming It was that it was and is a boat Apple never should have jumped into From a user experience standpoint Pandora and Spotify are both at the top of their game in a tough business Theyre not failing miserably in some key practical andor theoretical area exposing a weakness Apple would be insane not to exploit Quite the opposite Pandora and Spotify actually provide Apple with a key cog of its ecosystem Tim Cook should be investing in Pandora and Spotify not going after them The miscalculation Cook is making is one I dont think Jobs ever would have made Cook seems to be of the mind that Apple needs to be internally responsible for every aspect of its ecosystem But unless Apple has much bigger aspirations for its foray into music its better off keeping its eye on hardware and leaving things like streaming music platforms up to the experts While Jimmy Iovine and Trent Reznor can chirp at the way Pandora and Spotify curate music what Pandora and Spotify are doing and Apple purports to do arent to a listeners ears all that different Everyday users dont care how the app spits out music they just want a clean and easytouse experience Pandora and Spotify provide this in superior fashion They do it so well the user doesnt even consciously realize whats happening Thats the beauty of a product or service that becomes second nature a daily habit youd be lost without Apple Music doesnt come close in this or any other similar regard But that aside Apple Music should not make investors want to buy Apple stock In fact if youre lining up the pros and cons of an investment in AAPL Apple Music should be a primary concern It makes me wonder if the company has taken its eye off of the ball Tim Cook should ask himself what would happen if Apple removed Spotify and Pandora from the App Store tomorrow There would be an allout mutiny against the company that would take off on social media with a backlash more severe than the blowback faced as a result of all previous bonehead corporate moves combined Then Cook should realize that hes better off skimming off the top of Pandora and Spotifys greatness That Pandora and Spotify probably help his company sell more iPhones than Apple Music has and likely ever will Control the parts of the ecosystem where Apple has exhibited great strength Thats the hardware and the allencompassing operating systems not ancillary areas such as streaming music Apple has never been particularly good at putting these platforms together iTunes never really evolved aesthetically or functionally And even though nobody seems to want to point this out Apple bought a failure in Beats Music reincarnated it into another failure in iTunes Radio and is now at the plate about to look at strike three with Apple Music If the conclusion here is that Apple has lostshifted focus from what it does best and I dont know if this is the case as I am just relaying my most intimate thoughts for your consideration then I would think twice about buying and holding AAPL to the death It might not be that type of investment All of that said if the company has much more massive plans than we know about for Apple Music Im happy to back off Theres a better than percent chance that Apple knowing what a bad business straight streaming is simply wants to use Apple Music as a gateway into something that Ill loosely define as being a record label Though its probably not going to become a record label Pandora is following a similar strategy As I suggested last year Apple should start the modern version of a record label Im surprised it hasnt already Thats where the money is In starting off by buying a label such as Big Machine Records and whatever else you need to acquire to own every aspect of the Taylor Swift franchise for example Now were talking about the company entering disrupting and potentially transformingfixing an industry that is in desperate need of intervention An intervention Apple provided
