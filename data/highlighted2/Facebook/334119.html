silly with the market Many articles seem to only stress buying options Buying protection is one of the worst strategies you can do Plenty of Seeking Alpha and other financial media articles suggest to buy put protection in case the market topples I really do not agree with this line of thinking at all It seems to promote fear of the unknown and flight to security Basically it is the way equity investors think Invest for the longterm and scrutinize every fundamental detail to come up with a plethora of scenarios The What would derail this rally quote comes to mind If you use options it needs to be more strategic than buying a put based on a guesswork scenario analysis Buying puts in general is a low probability trade It is advocated by people who do not understand how to use options in the market The thinking is that this is a form of controlling risk This is completely false The only risk you control is upon entry As Tom Sosnoff would say before you leave the driveway you fasten your seat belt check the rear view mirror and make sure every one is safe and secure As soon as you leave the driveway you have no control over an wheeler that decides to slam into you This is the kind of risk we are trying to control We cannot control this and it is no wonder there are so many justifications for being wrong Again there is more to the market than the prognostications of <span

linear regression channel helps to show order It is nothing more than another form of the onetotwo standard deviation indicator that finance always relies on I am making the seemingly random data clear and understandable This is nothing new I know some of you will think I am drawing lines on a chart and think this is nothing more than tomfoolery Let me just point out that this is visual representation of quantifying the current data and making future projections Again this is no different than grabbing a financial statement and concocting a thorough forecast Yes the SP is correlated with oil This is not voodoo or black magic Again I am showing that the moves are not random and the downward tendency of the SP is still intact Oil has been pretty good about staying within one standard deviation No these bands are not magical and factors can change What this is letting you know is oil is continuing its downtrend within a one standard deviation move Thus unless oil surpasses the one standard deviation moves we cannot assume anything about a bottom being made A two standard deviation move would be worth noting However to know if the market is truly healthy we need to check the Russell and the Nasdaq These two indexes usually lead the overall market Continuing along the same line of thinking we see the Russell is in a downtrend and the Nasdaq is flat respectively <span

correlation Just as a piece of Swiss cheese <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stands alone Should this be a cause for concern Nope It should confirm that the stock is still

of you who own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>You dont need to concern yourself with what if the market does x y or z There is simply no correlation What protection do you need Nothing First and foremost when you look at an options chain on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>you should not be thinking about losing money on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>protecting your investment and buying on a whim to feel secure Options are another form of tackling the market and you need to strategize Since I am bullish on the stock I would select a bull put spread Unfortunately there is not enough premium or enough option activity to enter a spread The IV rank is low which confirms the low premium one would receive selling a spread Low IV rank is good for buying options However directional plays are difficult and have the lowest probability of success You pretty much become a degenerate gambler by purchasing options Dont be gambler Analyzing the equity market is completely different than analyzing the options market As I have said before dont seek options for security What I have shown you is just the beginning of what you need to know when using options Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this
