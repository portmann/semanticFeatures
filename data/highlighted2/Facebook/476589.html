administrator very complicated things iphone apple samsung corning largan precision supply chains m murata vishay intertechnology foxconn Where does your mobile phone actually come from What company makes it How many people how many businesses how many factories how many hands were involved in its making Most of us probably have no idea whatsoever how to answer those questions A smartphone comes from Apple or Samsung sure from the Verizon store or Best Buy or a website It comes from China maybe Or some other nation that does a lot of manufacturing It comes in a box and it works right Thats all most of us really think about on any given day But the iPhone in your hand is not only a marvel of modern coding its a miracle of modern logistics Its supply chain is sprawling and hard to track Minerals come from some suppliers Manufacturing from others Each screw lens solder chip and piece of glass has to be designed manufactured shipped and assembled before we get anywhere close to the million people in the US alone that Apple claims make their living from the app economy The process is pretty opaque We all know that the phones arent simply wished into being by magical elves but the reality of how they are made is hard to understand even after years of efforts to increase transparency Were not here to pick on Apple just to be clear In fact Apple is more transparent about their suppliers and process than most of the competition which is how we can even write this story The company publishes a list of its largest suppliers every year PDF as part of a corporate responsibility initiative and says that list of suppliers accounts for of its spending Without even counting where the minerals are mined where the phones are used and the shipping logistics of making it all happen Apples supply chain really is global The companys top list of supply partners includes listed office and manufacturing facility locations worldwide As youd likely guess the majority of those addresses are in China Japan and the United States But other nations large and small appear The full list of of countries involves every continent except Australia and Antarctica including Components are manufactured worldwide but most of the final assembly is done at factories owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co in Zhengzhou China Americans usually recognize that company by its other name Foxconn Technology Group The company which also assembles gaming consoles other smartphones and a huge number of other electronics has an estimated million employees in dozens of facilities worldwide While many of the companies Apple does big business with are completely unknown in the US plenty are major global players in their own right A sample One of Apples biggest most important suppliers A company best thought of as competition in the global smartphone market Samsung a South Korean company with roughly employees makes the actual processor chip that makes your phone a pocket computer work And they make it in Austin Texas The company makes about of the A chips included in the Apple iPhone S and S plus Samsung also reportedly manufactured a minority of the A chips in the iPhone as well as the A iPhone S several iPads the A iPhone and C and in fact the processor chips for all iPhones models prior So yes the virtual brain that makes your iPhone function is brought to you by the company best known for dominating the highend Android market Home consumers know M best for their sticky products Scotch Tape and PostIt Notes But they also design and make a whole lot of electronics components And sure there are a whole lot of fancy adhesives on that list because of course there are but the most important part for an iPhone is something called a touch sensor film Without that film theres no pinch zoom or tap M has been supplying touch films to Apple for years and regularly announces some new upgraded better version every year or two Your first exposure to Corning if youre like many Americans was a casserole dish on Grandmas Thanksgiving table The company sells ridiculous amounts of bakeware and homeuser kitchenware under the Corning Corelle and Pyrex brands among others But it also famously makes Gorilla Glass a strengthened toughened durable glass that does not easily scratch or break and can survive living in your pocket or handbag for a year The product is used in basically every smartphone you can think of including all Apple iPhones In recent years Apple had been researching alternatives but those plans didnt work out and so your iPhones still using Gorilla Glass Corning just recently announced its newest Gorilla Glass version and will likely to continue to appear in your iPhone for some time to come Texas Instruments has of course always been far more than the company that made your highschool graphing calculator even if the TI or its younger siblings is what most of us immediately envision on reading the name The company which employs people in countries does indeed still have its headquarters in yes Texas It is one of the many in the world that make the processors that drive basically all modern electronic goods Selling those embedded processors and analog chips to the companies that put them into other products account for about of TIs revenue In the iPhone specifically TI provides chips that help make sure that when you touch the screen the insides of the phones can process that into the input signal it is In other words something pretty dang important to the basic function of the phone TI isnt the only company that has touch screen controllers in the iPhone another company Broadcom has one in there too It takes a lot of parts to make the iPhone go Dozens of the companies on Apples supplier list are almost completely unknown to anyone who doesnt actually make electronics for a living even when theyre hugely important Once again just a small sample This Taiwanese company has in a sense made this entire decade the entire way we use the internet and communicate with each other possible Why Because they make the camera lenses that you find in almost every iPhone and most Samsung Android phones too Thats it Thats what they contribute to the iPhone camera lenses The lenses are assembled into the camera module elsewhere and those modules are then later assembled into the phone itself But without those lenses there would be no video chat no recordings of protests no <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>livestreaming from your pocket no pics or it didnt happen The company is expected to continue making lenses for the upcoming iPhone at least if not also later generations This company which is based in Austin TX employs workers in its locations worldwide And while it makes some industrial parts the big thing Cirrus is known for is audio Your phone is after all a phone You need to be able to hear what comes through it Likewise it is also your modern iPod Spotify streaming device and TVwatching tool all of which require functional audio And thats where Cirrus and its array of converters amplifiers and codecs come in Those are all the parts that take audio signals from voice to music and let them be read into sound for your ears to hear Cirrus does not by any stretch only make these chips for mobile devices youll find them inside a wide ray of other audio devices including on some PC sound cards too Apple is however Cirruss largest customer which is why investors and crystalball readers look at what Cirrus is up to to prognosticate about future Apple products and stock Like those increasinglyplausible rumors that the iPhone will kill the common headphone jack Murata is a yearold Japanese company that makes almost nothing youve ever heard of Their corporate website touts products from monolithic ceramic capacitors to multilayer ceramic devices and the happily vague sensors Those tiny parts pack a big punch though Although it does make bluetooth connectors and parts that let your phone have a vibrate setting Muratas most important product is a line of ceramic capacitors minuscule parts that regulate where and how electricity moves inside your phone No electricity no phone As of Murata commanded half the international smartphone market for the parts it supplies and in turn those parts comprised a solid of its overall sales It seems to be working right now Muratas valued at about billion and has been on a generally upward trajectory for years Vishay is actually an American company with its headquarters in Pennsylvania although it has manufacturing facilities and offices worldwide Apple has Vishay locations on its supplier list You can be forgiven for never having heard of it anyway though unless you work in electrical engineering Vishay makes the sort of parts that make a lot of sense to the folks who design and make electronics like smartphones but that make almost anyone elses eyes glaze over in confusion The company makes different kinds of semiconductors which at their most basic are the silicon bits that make computer chips work It also makes passive components including resistors and capacitors that help manage and direct the flow of current inside your phone In other words the bits that let the signal go from point A to point B without letting too much signal go from point A to point B Once you get past the convenientlyalphebatized list that Apple says accounts for of its expenditures things start to get really murky As we know Apple has roughly suppliers Lets then imagine for the sake of argument that each of them has just five Thats already a total of businesses involved Now lets say each of those suppliers in turn has only three Only two tiers in wereup to imaginary companies to keep track of Thats just a thought exercise of course The actual number could easily be at least an order of magnitude larger if not far more Or perhaps theoretically smaller if many companies in that second tier out are actually sourcing their parts and materials from the same suppliers But investigating that and coming to actual numbers is extraordinarily challenging Not all companies publish a public supplier list Most dont in fact And even when they do there may be strategically missing information Because itsworth noting that although it does publish that comprehensive supplier list Apple remains incredibly tightlippedabout who makes its parts to the point where those suppliers are often not allowed publicly to say who they supply Apple for example is nowhere on Cornings list of products that use Gorilla Glass Likewise Cirrus also on Apples supplier list is widely understood but not explicitly stated to have Apple as its largest client Everything exists in a layer of open secrets and hushhush needtoknow information which might be good for those who play the stock market but doesnt do much for anyone else First because its important to realize how complicated the modern global economy is A butterfly flapping its wings in China might not create a literal hurricane but it can create a disruption that creates another disruption that slows a train that shifts a contract that alters a supply chain that moves a shipment that puts manufacturing in another country that changes a local economy that well you get the idea And second because increasingly consumers are holding giant corporations responsible for their impact on human rights and the environment And with a corporation the size of Apple those effectsare profound The same problems exist in basically every industry Clothing retailer Patagonia for example has been trying hard for years to excise all exploited labor from their supply chain and make it fully sustainable Its a core element of their brand and their consumer appeal and yet they still cant make auniversal guarantee Their suppliers are good but their suppliers suppliers suppliers and subcontractors around the world are all but impossible to reach track or audit Electronics sourcing is particularly fraught The delicate components that smartphones need in order to work require elements and minerals cobalt tin tungsten tantalum and gold among others that are primarily found and extracted in developing conflictheavy nations like the Democratic Republic of the Congo US law requires publicly owned companies to disclose any use of conflict minerals Not to avoid them just to disclose them But to be able to know and accurately disclose that you have to be able to audit your suppliers And theres only so far down the chain most companies can go In addition to auditing their own direct suppliers all of them Apple has also explicitly tried to audit for and eliminate suppliers of conflict minerals from the next rung of its supply chain by going to the smelters But even then as experts told Newsweek in When you think about the context of these mines being primarily artisanal very informal there is no paperwork so what evidence do any of the audits have to rely on At the end of the day we dont really know what the reality is As for tracking whether or not exploitative child labor is being used in those artisanal mines thats even harder Earlier this year Amnesty International released a report showing how hard it is to trace just one component cobalt from just one supplier to the companies that end up using it in the end Tap Or Scan Here To Pay Know Your Mobile Payment Apps Android Users Give Apples Move To iOS App Bad Reviews For Some Reason Fitbit Looks To
