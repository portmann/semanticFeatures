Prime Minister Hun Sen looks at his smartphone at a ceremony in Phnom Penh February Picture taken February PHNOM PENH Unable to pay his way out of jail Kong Chamroeun was remanded in a Cambodian prison pending trial for stealing of company property a crime his family said he did not commit We had nothing just empty hands said his girlfriend Lorn Chenda who alleged police tried to extort Chamroeun for in compensation in exchange for not pressing charges With Chamroeun behind bars for days and no one else to turn to Chenda used her smartphone to appeal directly to Cambodias highest authority Prime Minister Hun Sen She recorded a fiveminute video detailing the alleged extortion attempt and urging the selfstyled strongman to intervene then posted it on his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page The next morning Chamroeun was freed and his case dismissed We never expected the prime minister would help us Chenda told Reuters This is the smallest problem for the prime minister to have to solve himself and it was solved very quickly Chamroeuns release was fortuitously timed coinciding with Hun Sens new infatuation with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which he adopted with gusto in September last year and now has two million followers Experts say he is using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to quickly recoup some lost popularity ahead of a election tipped to be the biggest test to his threedecade rule Hun Sens strategy appears to be out of the playbook of bitter rival the Cambodia National Rescue Party CNRP The oppositions social media campaigns were a hit with young urban voters in a disputed election that stunned Hun Sens ruling Cambodian Peoples Party CPP and sharply reduced its house majority Chendas video appeal to Hun Sen went viral and the premier has since urged the public to send complaints about government corruption to his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>inbox He referred to Chamroeuns case at a recent speech adding that without <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>he could not serve the public so effectively I need to have work done quickly he said The problems the people face are not small do not underestimate them It was not an isolated case The former Khmer Rouge soldier has been credited with solving numerous problems raised on his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>like high university test fees informal road tolls and issues with motorcycle licenses and inheritance tax Seven ministries have set up working groups with members who trawl postings on Hun Sens <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page looking for solvable public grievances including land disputes arguably Cambodias most entrenched problem We track the comments all the time every day said Seng Loth who monitors the page for the Land Management and Urban Planning Ministry This is at the direct instruction of the prime minister so this work cant be ignored The government last year held mandatory classes for heads of Phnom Penh schools where they were encouraged to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and write messages supportive of the CPP Sebastian Strangio author of the book Hun Sens Cambodia said successes from using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to troubleshoot voter problems were being spun as Hun Sens personal gifts to the public and ignored the need for structural reforms to tackle graft injustice and bureaucratic inefficiency This populist strategy merely reproduces an old pattern in Cambodian politics which is that improvements in peoples lives are treated as a blessing from the powerful rather than as part of a democratic social contract Strangio said Thomson Reuters is the worlds largest international multimedia news agency providing investing news world news business
