conglomerates facebook facebook atlas same thing we do every night pinky project aries terragraph While the average consumer might just think of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as just a place to post photos ignore high school friends and distant uncles politically charged rants and catch up on the news the reality is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been quietly building a behindthescenes empire that covers everything from advertising to virtual reality to artificial intelligence And the companys latest venture makes it clear that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is intent on being a lot more than a social media platform Its been a big week of announcements from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>unveiling new features like simplified signin inapp ticketbuying and filesharing through Messenger These are all big updates to the social side of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but it was another lessheralded announcement one involving satellites giant antennas and functionally citysized signalrepeaters that highlights the vast scope of the companys operations These projects are called Terragraph and Project ARIES and each is designed to solve an internet access problem Terragraph is designed for dense urban areas and uses a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is still unlicensed in many countries including the US but supports very high datatransmission speeds at a very short range So Terragraph is basically designed as a series of streetlevel nodes fairly close together that function moreorless like signalrepeaters that can strengthen and carry wireless communications without being hampered by pesky features of the urban landscape like buildings or people Where Terragraph is designed for the worlds billions of urban wouldbe internet users Project ARIES is for their country cousins The idea behind the ARIES antenna array is to significantly boost the capacity of wireless networks serving rural underserved areas without needing to build out more extensive expensive network infrastructure or crowd more spectrum In short it basically is able to blast out a lot more signal at once than existing traditional antennas can do Terragraph and ARIES are just the latest in a growing number of internet and tech ventures that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has started or acquired in recent years Some of these projects have a more direct connection to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>social media platform than others Advertising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>generates more than billion per quarter in revenue and this is where more than of it comes from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>not only sells advertising space on their own services to more than million businesses but also through their Atlas service help businesses use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>data to place more effective ads and track their performance on other platforms Artificial intelligence Facebooks banking big on AI For now theyre trying to harness AI for tasks as comparatively simple as basic chatbots or automated audio captions of photos for blind and visually impaired <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users However AI and machine learning are a major cornerstone of the companys tenyear plan see top image at this point Commerce and payments Not only can businesses put a buy button on their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>posts but you can send money through Messenger and now you can buy goods and services directly through the platform too Theres money to be made in being the middleman and in rendering everyone elses independent apps and website obsolete in the name of simplicity Content aggregation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>just announced a save to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>plugin that works basically just like any other social bookmark or

these days <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also revamped its Notes feature last year to basically make it a modern blogging platform think more like Medium so any individual who wants to create host and share web content in that way can also do it without having their readers step foot off of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Direct communication WhatsApp and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger Facebooks two direct communication tools have roughly one billion users each One app at a time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is stepping into basically every kind of personal communication function text voice and video your phone can do and integrating them under its own umbrella Internet access Through the nonprofit Internetorg and its Free Basics service <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>provides zerocost zerorated lowbandwidth data plans to about million users in developing nations The service of course provides all of those users with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>access as well as some other sites and programs that vary locally Internet infrastructure Free Basics works through partnerships with local telecom companies but Terragraph and Project Aries are all Facebooks Photo and video hosting The last time <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>published stats on it users were uploading more than million new photos daily but that was two years ago Meanwhile Instagram users post more than million new photos daily and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users stream over million hours of video Again thats per day With live streaming video now available to all users not just celebrities and media accounts those numbers are only going to keep skyrocketing Social networking Obviously this one is the elephant in the room There are billion people give or take about of the entire worlds population on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>sharing photos and status updates and articles and videos and whatever else they want Virtual reality
