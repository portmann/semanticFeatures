keep the company ahead in the long term I object to this hardware centric perspective as it cannot offset fundamental consumer trends What does Apple NASDAQ AAPL need As the debate on the supposed lack of innovation in the iPhone continues the debate has shifted towards the larger picture of Apples innovative capabilities Another recent piece has contended that Apple is increasingly relying on internal hardware innovation as opposed to depending on suppliers The article contends that potential imminent breakthroughs in display technology are signal of sustainable longterm innovation and will form the base for future growth In this article I comment on product innovation and further on recently announced software initiatives Siri SDK On being a late mover in software services Apple has traditionally been a late mover Apple did not have the first smartphone tablet smart watch or music player However seemingly it had the last What Apples product design has achieved is to make people feel like they were using the first real smartphone tablet music player Hence Apple never has had a problem with being late to market Its brand image and superior product design the look feel and social prestige associated with owning the latest Apple products ensured swift market penetration Lately Apple has been trying to expand its software service business What I think Apple is having a problem with is that software works differently Software services are sticky once a software infrastructure is built around a bundle of InfrastructurePlatformSoftwareasaservice solutions changing to a new solution requires a huge effort and political will within an organisation As a rule of thumb the higher the service is on the application layer the easier it is to attract new customers For instance it is quite hard to get a company switching from one infrastructure provider to a competitor eg from Amazon Web Services to Microsoft Azure Such a change usually does not add immediate business value and demands huge operational efforts This is not really a problem for the cloud market right now simply because it is growing so fast that there is room for everyone to grow On the SaaS end its much easier to get developers to try new products because applications are easier to rewrite and there are new application features and new applications for all types of platforms all the time The application layer is in constant flux Apples software services iCloud HealthKit ResearchKit future Siri SDK are on the SaaSPaaS layer Again Apple is a late mover The Siri SDK is a reaction to Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Amazons NASDAQ AMZN IBMs NYSE IBM and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT s natural language processing initiatives However unlike with hardware there is no compelling latemover advantage A Siri SDK is likely to be equal to competitors at best Apple is lacking the breadth of cloud data infrastructure and machine learning research of Google or Microsoft over the past decade In other words Google and Microsoft can integrate their language products into a whole cloud ecosystem while Apple is still setting up their own infrastructure moving from Amazon after neglecting this domain for far too long In summary Apple has no advantage here The company is simply late to market On the other hand the market is still in an early stage overall so late might not be too late The key argument still stands Apple should not apply the hardware approach to software services Watching the competition move forward and then releasing a similar SDK a year later with likely no product differentiation will not cut it On the positive side it should also be noted that Apple is beginning to think more like a data company Apple has always tried distinguish itself by claiming not to care about its customers data unlike Google or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB This approach does not work in the era of machine learning Apple can simply not afford to not analyze user data To avoid going back on its privacy promise Apple has been working on differential privacy which is explained here Starting with iOS Apple is using Differential Privacy technology to help discover the usage patterns of a large number of users without compromising individual privacy To obscure an individuals identity Differential Privacy adds mathematical noise to a small sample of the individuals usage pattern As more people share the same pattern general patterns begin to emerge which can inform and enhance the user experience In iOS this technology will help improve QuickType and emoji suggestions Spotlight deep link suggestions and Lookup Hints in Notes Emoji suggestions and improved spotlight search not exactly at the bleeding edge of AI I think it will take another years to see where Apple is going with its machine learning efforts based on its surge in hiring for the Siri team The true question to me is whether Apple can create an atmosphere of creativity and be more appealing to experts in this field This brings me to my next and final point innovation What is meaningful product innovation As the debate around whether the next iPhone or the one after will turnaround smartphone sales I think there are a number of points to make here First iPhones and other Apple products have always been used for social signaling eg demonstrating an appreciation for careful design and the ability to pay for it While there is a small group of tech aficionados want to differentiate themselves by having insight into the latest technical details most users dont They go by brand look and feel They dont care or know about display technology The corollary to that is that customers will primarily care about new design cycles on the iPhone that allow social signalling again An orthogonal argument to the prior one is that even if design cycles spark new interest there is no compelling reason why that should reverse an overall downtrend in smartphone sales Device sales over all classes grew steadily for a while because emerging markets have provided ample room for growth This era of growth is likely over both for smartphones and the TV market Overall I see Apple making some steps into software services and machine learning Essentially Apple is figuring out how to become more of a data company These sectors are very different from devices Apple cannot charge a premium because it does not offer a premium product Siri SDK will not be a premium product The iCloud is not a premium product The consequence of these arguments is that software services will not offset device losses in the coming years Shifting to a more softwareoriented company will likely take until next decade Offsetting sales from one device class iPhone thus will take new device classes While a car is a likely contender at some point nothing points to a new device class in the medium term This makes me rate Apple as a hold at this point its still somewhat cheap and a solid dividend play but I expect no meaningful appreciation as the company is going through the largest shift in its history Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
