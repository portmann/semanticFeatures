With that said, Microsoft has been a market favorite pretty much since Nadella took over the reigns.He's done a tremendous job at emphasizing Microsoft's growth businesses, while taking the focus off those in turmoil.For example, Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue did grow 110% during the company's last quarter, a reflection of strong adoption with Office 365 and Azure.However, if Synergy Research is correct in its analysis, that Microsoft controls about 10% of the cloud infrastructure services market, then this hyper growth segment accounts for less than 5% of total revenue.Albeit, Microsoft's server business is strong, and there's no way to criticize Microsoft for that.Nevertheless, Microsoft's income statement exhibits strong growth, including a reflection that revenue over the last four quarters has grown 10% versus its last fiscal year.However, one thing to keep in mind is that this revenue growth is very much tied to the acquisition of Nokia's handset business.In fact, if you remove the near $1.4 billion that Microsoft created from phone hardware during its last quarter, which was not present last year, then Microsoft's total revenue actually declined by $100 million year-over-year, rather than increasing 6%.The reason is because of the numerous businesses where Microsoft remains in steep decline.Specifically, I am talking about its licensing business.This includes Office programs and Windows software both for consumers and the enterprise.In the consumer side of licensing, revenue declined more than $1.1 billion year-over-year, and it lost another $300 million on the commercial side.<span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>These are high margin businesses, and for those wondering why Microsoft cut so many jobs last year, and might very well cut more jobs after making "tough choices", the decline in this licensing business explains it -- licensing accounted for 62% of Microsoft's total revenue during its last quarter. (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #AED6F1'>All things considered, Microsoft's ongoing losses in licensing are problematic, and despite the company's move to the cloud, it still relies heavily on the business for profits. (Surprise) </span>Therefore, Microsoft needs something to counter the losses that licensing is likely to keep producing.After all, PC sales aren't coming back anytime soon.The problem is that the cloud, Microsoft's way to combat such loss; in general is very crowded.While it is expected to become a $191 billion market according to Forrester Research, up from less than $60 billion in 2013, the question is whether Microsoft's small market share in the cloud can one day carry its $365 billion market capitalization.Personally, I don't think it can, and also, I think the job cuts are a good way of tempering Wall Street's expectations, and preparing investors for a leaner, more profitable Microsoft long-term.While some investors are satisfied with this new look for Microsoft, I prefer growth, companies like Google and Apple among others.In other words, so long as Microsoft is cutting jobs, and not hiring, and seeing losses in licensing, I wouldn't want anything to do with it.Source: Why I Wouldn't Own Microsoft Disclosure: I am/we are long FB, AAPL.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
