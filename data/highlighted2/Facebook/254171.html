NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog Yesterday all the media hoopla over Mark Zuckerbergs announcement to give away of his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares to philanthropic causes came and went in theexpected torrent of internet commentary However what youmight have missed are the specifics around how he decidedto safeguard those shares and how unusual the forprofit LLC structureis for a charity The decision by Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan to graduallygive away percent of their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>fortune is big news not just for the huge sum involvedabout billionbut for how the couple chose to achieve their philanthropic goalRather than set up a private foundation orcharitable trust asBill and Melinda Gates did the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will be structured as a limited liability corporation Its a highly unusual step for a massive philanthropy Ive never seensomeone set up an LLC exclusively for a philanthropic purpose before says Jane Wales vice president of philanthropy and society at the Aspen Institute Normally they set up a foundation for the tax advantages of doing soHere are some significantways that LLC status will shape whatZuckerberg and Chan do with their wealth It seems clear the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will put money to work in politics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in its official description of its foundersnew LLC noted thatmaking private investments and participating in policy debates will be part of the mission In a public letter Zuckerberg wroteto his newborn daughter Max he likewise emphasized an appetite for pushing a policy agenda We must participate in policy and advocacy to shape debatesIf the charitable venture had been set upas a traditional

less about charity and more about ensuring that Zuckerberg the oligarch is able to frame US government policy in any way that he and his billions so desire Wed ebworthen Wed Oh regional Indian Wed Divided States Wed NoDebt Wed Save_Americast so basically the NSA and CIA figured out another way to launder billions of fiat to use for black ops against American citizens and to wage proxy wars around the globe by using bullshit websites Easier than importing cocaine from South America I guess Thu philipat What all that tax on Dividends Next step reincorporation of FB in Ireland or some

and hes appointed a disproportionate number of jews but not muslims to high office Your hate of Muslims as a Jew offended by muslims daring to resist Ashkenazi conquest of their homeland apparently blinds you to basic rational thinking Your outright Jewish Supremacism is well attested As is your peculiar brand of inane quips Obama is not a muslim and if he were hes a puppet Its a funny kind of muslim that is propelled into office by a zionist network in chicago appointing jewish advisors to head the fed treasury national evonomic counsel and spending an absurd amount of time dealing with
