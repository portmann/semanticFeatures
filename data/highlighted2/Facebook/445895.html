resurgence in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>bear thesis has me yet again shaking my head With a prominent short seller issuing his decree the bears have a new found courage The problem like most <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>bear theses is the tunnel vision of Facebookcom and not the entire <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform at large There is growth still to come in many of Facebooks assets namely Instagram Messenger and WhatsApp In the last two weeks there has been a flurry of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB articles and comments as well as a particular notorious short seller talking about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>being at the end of its growth phase or as Ive heard so many times over has peaked What Ive found to be a common theme in these negative assertions is the focus on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the website Many of these analyses have focused too much on or only on Facebookcom and its associated metrics and not on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the company This will undoubtedly cause many investors to miss the growth allegedly said not to be present when in fact there is growth left not only at Facebookcom but Instagram Messenger WhatsApp and to a lesser extent Oculus It must be a new found courage after one of the most popular short sellers issued their decree to cause this bearish uprising There hasnt been much to tell me the financials at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are set to collapse or the company is in trouble otherwise Therefore you can consider this article at least partially a continuation of my ignore the noise thesis Before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>IPOd in May of it has not been just Facebookcom The company bought Instagram earlier in the year for nearly B But much of the focus had remained on Facebookcoms users its time spent on the app and its transition to mobile and for good reason it was the only source of revenue More recently that single platform no longer holds the revenue reigns at least not alone Its no longer just Facebookcom bringing in the cash as Instagram has come online monetarily and begun contributing to the top line Whats great about Instagram is it features better ads due to the inherent nature of the platform showcasing pictures and only pictures A users stream is picture after picture after picture Throwing in an ad which shares the quality and creativity similar to a friends doesnt cause a skip in the heartbeat of the stream Because the app lends itself to this high quality ad content it fetches two and a half times the click through rate of any other social media ad and thus higher ad prices Switching to user growth Instagram just recently passed M monthly active users MAUs and M daily active users DAUs While its still less than half of Facebookcoms daily active user base it is more than twice Snapchats Private CHAT and two and a half times Twitters NYSE TWTR Said another way Snapchat and Twitter combined only garner M daily active users to Instagrams M Going back to the B purchase price of Instagram in there was much worry and speculation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had grossly overpaid for the then M user picture sharing app Fast forward a few years and according to estimates from eMarketer Instagram is set to bring in B in revenue this coming year after bringing in an estimated M this past year Something tells me the purchase price was a pretty good deal especially if Instagram is only at the beginning stages of ramping up ads and advertisers If Instagram is to continue upping its video product which it is by increasing video length to seconds then its increase in time spent watching will bode well for advertisers Theres still plenty of runway left for this jetliner to ramp up further revenues and bring a more robust and accessible product to advertisers With two and a half times the likelihood of clicking on your ad you would be willing to pay up as well It would be a great mistake to discount Instagram in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>story as not being a growth driver with the potential to bolster Facebooks overall business and rely less on one platform After only listing off one of Facebooks products other than Facebookcom of course we are already onto the first nonmonetized asset Now most people at this point would say Well thats exactly the problem There needs to be revenue generation from all their products I would tend to agree but at what rate and at what cost As my points about Instagram alluded to it has taken four years before the money spent on the acquisition actually came back to the company During that time however the user base grew while the product developed and matured Not only did the product grow up but so did the tools <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>uses to give advertisers a full detailed overview of their campaigns There are a few implications of those stats and what has gotten those stats there If ads were on Instagram the day after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>acquired it there likely wouldnt be much of a demand for ads because it was unproven and likely would have cost <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>more in resources to run the ad then the ad would have been worth Second it likely would have drove users away rather than to it at such a young stage <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has become very very good at weaning users into ads and giving them a treatment of change blindness or perhaps in this case ad blindness Third <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>hadnt developed their mobile strategy and didnt have the tools and resources yet to give advertisers and users an effective ad product Therefore its not surprising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>hasnt introduced some kind of revenue producing stream with Messenger yet During this unmonetized time Messenger has grown from M monthly active users to M Further the company has added several features to Messenger before and since it unbundled it in which can likely attract revenue from businesses or even the users themselves Some of those features include voice calling video calling and monetary transactions Its likely the last one gets most investors attention because there are other companies like Paypal NASDAQ PYPL whose entire business is collecting transaction fees So far however <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has chosen to make this feature free see slow to monetize theory above In a recent Seeking Alpha article Andrew Mok contends WeChat is a better platform and has better features than Messenger While I think he did a better job of conveying how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has more potential going forward than WeChat he did do a great job of pointing out all of the features that can make a messaging app useful productive and create revenue In essence WeChat users can do everything from pay and split among friends a restaurant check hail a taxi pay utility bills and take care of their brokerage accounts Right now Messenger is in a very early stage if you put it next to those potential possibilities In fact new customerbusiness friendly capabilities have just been added in the last several months The next natural question is how and when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>monetizes those features I picture it ranging from referral fees with businesses to partnership deals to in app purchase more like in app within app purchases Many people contend this is farfetched will drive users away and may pose conflicts of interest among partners on other <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platforms However we know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the vision and execution ability as displayed in Instagram and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>mobile I might add and combined with the ideas seen in other platforms like WeChat I believe this is hardly out of Facebooks reach and capabilities Finally I believe monetization is not terribly far off It will start slow and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will use the process to learn along the way on how best to position them making users and businesses happy If we use the Instagram timeline it took two years before the company introduced ads and about three before it was ramped up to a material amount If we take the Messenger timeline from the unbundling time period then we are nearly there for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to introduce some kind of monetization Therefore it may begin the end of this year with meaningful monetization coming in late Well here we are the inevitable analysis on Facebooks largest purchase and one of the biggest in tech in general Many criticized and still criticize this purchase as a waste of money mostly stock wondering how anyone could have it pay for itself over the course of its life let alone in the near future A lot of investors wrongly distill the acquisition as a redundant function of Facebooks Messenger platform The company already has a messaging app they say This much may be true but the real core of the acquisition wasnt functionality as much as it was its user base and the business defense it provided Look at WhatsApp from a more down to earth nontechnology related perspective Say you own a dry cleaners on one side of town while at the same time there is another dry cleaners on the other side of town Initially you think you are in direct competition but you realize everyone in town goes to your dry cleaners The other place on the other side of town attracts all the out of towners Only sometimes do you both exchange customers but through asking you find out your customers do it based on where they were in town at the time and not so much on preference You get to thinking with your bigger investment backing you could expand your market to all the out of towners just by owning the other cleaners You figure if someone else were to buy them youd have to worry if they would try to encroach on your intown market You decide to buy the business and even though you provide very comparable service and have great reviews you just eliminated any threat of a chain brand buying them and squeezing your market Its no different with WhatsApps mostly nonUS demographic of users Only of North American mobile users use WhatsApp on at least a monthly basis Its mostly Latin American and African regions using WhatsApp Whats more WhatsApp has surpassed billion MAUs Thats more than Messenger and is the most monthly users of any encrypted messaging app Actually let me dazzle you for a moment Did you know messaging apps have surpassed social networking apps Yup its true messaging is more important than social So Facebookcom and Instagram are the biggest and one of the biggest social networks in the world respectively and Messenger and WhatsApp are the biggest messaging apps in the world <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the dominant player in all things mobile Now that it has sunk in Ive spoken enough about why the acquisition makes sense So how does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>go from here Well its not too much different than Messenger except WhatsApp may have a better platform for all of the features which will make it extremely useful to users These are already the things the rest of the world is used to using as Andrew pointed out in his article If WhatsApp simply adds these features it will not just not harm user growth but bring in more and potentially steal users from other platforms Not only that but I believe WhatsApp has a great opportunity in chatbots Thats right I went there If you already blew off my thought then investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not for you and there is no amount of writing I could do to convince you this is an important point in the future of communication If you have a problem with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and its interest in chatbots then youll have to take it up with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT IBM NYSE IBM Twitter and Alphabet GOOG GOOGL who has been silent but yet is very likely in the trenches of this because all of these tech giants have taken to the coding board to get the best AI bot users can make use of The technology is very much in an early stage so there will need to be a lot of progress to come but I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the team to mount a charge to the technology summit Once this technology is perfected as well as any technology can be then the possibilities are endless to get businesses on the platform just like they are for Pages on Facebookcom From there it wont be difficult to understand what businesses or users will be willing to pay or trade for WhatsApp may have appeared to be a pricey acquisition but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>did it well by using stock which at the time was undervalued Its important to understand that creating the biggest mobile company in the world will cost a bit upfront The payoff will be on the back end when the best minds in technology add the features that will not only be good for user retention but also revenue generation The great thing is there are other platforms taking care of the revenue growth in the meantime while platforms like WhatsApp carefully navigate their way to the front of the revenue line So About Those Trees Or Is It The Forest There is quite a bit happening at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>needing the attention of an investor Everything from Instagram to messaging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the potential to turn them into revenue generating machines Those wary about potential need to check the companys track record as it relates to ads and mobile monetization Many including the market doubted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could monetize mobile and is the single reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock has ever seen a handle How we doin now While Im not surprised there are doubters at this stage it means were at another inflection point a point where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could launch into its next phase of revenue growth They have proven themselves capable of beating others to the money in mobile and I dont see it stopping here With all that said stop focusing on Facebookcom its users and metrics on a standalone basis Doing so will cause harm to your portfolio or at least not give it the respect it deserves Investors need to take a holistic look at the company and see each of its trees creating a robust forest And to think I havent even touched on the virtual reality side of the company If youd like to be made aware of my opinion and analysis in the future on <span
