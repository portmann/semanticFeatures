At the annual F developer conference today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out his vision for how the big blue social network plans to take over the world in the coming decade There was a lot to his keynote speech and there will be a lot more to the conference but two big announcements the Messenger Platform and the Account Kit stood out as likely to have an immediate impact on consumers nation and worldwide <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger is already a way to chat with people make calls send money and even share files but its utility as a customer service tool and commerce platform is still more in the future tense than the present tense That however will change shortly if Zuckerberg has anything to say about it The platform will allow businesses to build their own automated processes on top of Messenger to do well anything Within reason And if that should just happen to make nearly every app on your phone including the actual phone part of your phone other than Facebookowned ones obsolete well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would probably count that as a win The example Zuckerberg gave involved ordering flowers In the video the hand holding a phone used Messenger to interact with a Flowers chatbot to have an ordinarylanguage conversation with it I want to order flowers becoming in a just a few steps an order placed for delivery without any pause manually to enter payment recipient or orderer information Now to order from Flowers you never have to dial Flowers again Zuck quipped <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has clearly been moving slowly in this direction for quite some time Since it already has a chat function and a payment processing function built in and access to all of your and your contacts personal contact information if you choose to let it Messenger could soon be a onestop shop for a whole lot of commerce It was just over a year ago that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>opened up Messenger for business use instead of just persontoperson chats for the purpose of customer service and only a few weeks ago that Messenger started becoming a onestop shop for air travel info You know how you can log into a bunch of sites services or apps by tying them to your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account and password Well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to go one step farther The Account Kit is kind of like a universal twofactor authorization without the first factor built in Developers who use Account Kit for their apps will be able to have users log in with only an email address or a phone number no second field required After the user puts in that contact info they receive a login key in much the same way as you can now get a code over SMS to authenticate your login efforts on hundreds of sites and services People hate passwords <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>says and really thats kind of true Remembering them entering them correctly on tiny phone keyboards or using password management services are all the little hated bugaboos of modern digital life Account Kit is meant to streamline the login registration process for basically any app by simply tying it to that one unique piece of information The login flows for Account Kit combine account registration and account login There is no need to check if an account exists already or to use a separate flow to register new users After a successful login or registration an authentication credential associated with the user will be made available the developer documentation says Heres the other thing designed to make it attractive it does not actually require the consumer have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account in order to use it unlike the standard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Login which works by connecting apps to your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>profile That said if the phone number andor email address you provide should happen to match one that does have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account well theres a point of data matching for big blue to use FacebookOwned
