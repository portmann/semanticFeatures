Faced with slower growth in all segments Microsoft is making the right strategic decision in my view Nearterm dilution but also synergy and earnings accretion could kick in starting FY Crossselling Office products penetration in mobile and scale up subscriptionbased revenue are key positives Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT is acquiring LinkedIn NYSE LNKD for share in an allcash transaction valued at b inclusive of LNKDs net cash Faced with slower revenue growth the lack of a distinct mobile strategy and the need to push its office subscription services to the broader working professional group MSFTs decision to acquire LNKD is a sound one in my view Over time MSFT could leverage LNKDs database and potentially crosssell Office products to LNKDs existing users integrate Office products into LNKDs interface and provide a more comprehensive officeprofessional product suite than LNKDs current socialnetworking platform As for LNKD the offer is attractive and certainly worth tendering Although I am bullish on LNKDs growth prospect in the niche professional social networking vertical the biggest concern I have on the stock is the potential for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB to go aggressive on building its own professional platform Under such scenario I am skeptical on whether LNKD could have sufficient resources to counter FB so being acquired by MSFT is by far the best outcome LNKD investors can hopeful That said I remain cautious on MSFT stock given that the acquisition will not have material impact in address the weak outlook on Azure Office and Commercial Cloud As for LNKD I recommend investors to tender the shares MSFTs decision to acquire LNKD is the right move to scale up its subscriptionbased business model expand its product suite for working professionals and gain exposure to mobile where MSFT has often failed to expand Recall that MSFT is facing decelerated growth on all three key segments More concerning is that the company guided much weaker than expected outlook that came in below consensus Although management cited the cloud transition is the reason behind the unfavorable impact I expected Commercial Cloud and other segments to offset the weakness but it appears that slower growth is becoming a norm for the company In light of these risks LNKDs acquisition is designed to booster growth in both cloud and office MSFT and LNKD can create an unrivalled professional services platform in my view First MSFT can crosssell office products to LNKD users so that a single LNKD account can be integrated across MSFT office outlook Skype and Windows This could potentially strengthen Windows ecosystem among working professionals Second MSFT can integrate Cortana MSFTs digital assistant to LNKD members so that each user is updated with relevant meetings project updates and newpotential contacts This could drive both LNKD and Office MAU with incremental ad revenue being the icing on the cake Third the Intelligent Newsfeed on professional updates industryrelated news and events keep the MAUs engaged Not only could this drive higher ad revenue on both PC and mobile but also drive Office MAUs if users are looking to accomplish certain tasks ie Outlook file transfers over LNKD With LNKDs targeted ad gradually increase in sophistication MSFT will benefit from higher ad pricing driven by an engaged user base With m MAUs and traffic coming from mobile and rising number of page views and traffic LNKD is the ideal platform of MSFT to leverage to expand its mobile footprint Not only will MSFTLNKD enhance productivity for the working professionals they could also enhance marketing and talent management On marketing MSFT and LNKD will be focusing on socialbased selling rather than the traditional sales approach Socialbased selling not only is more impactful but also allows sellers to deeper relationships with their prospects and customers thereby driving higher results On talent management LNKDs rich database allows employers to have a better understanding of their talents and this insight is necessary to understand how to most effectively utilize the workforce to drive higher productivity Finally Lynda will be relevant from an HR perspective in that it drives learning and improvements within the workforce The appropriate courses via Lynda and materials via Office could be pushed to employees via LNKD to foster learning at work place Longterm speaking interaction via MSFTs HoloLens among working professionals from multiple locations over LNKD is a distinct possibility in my view In short acquiring LNKD is a right strategic move for MSFT Although this deal will be dilutive by roughly for MSFTs FY and FY earnings m cost synergy could be realized in FY
