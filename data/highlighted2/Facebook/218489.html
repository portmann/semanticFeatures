of billion an increase of and billion over This was our largest absolute revenue growth ever To put that into some context our growth in one year was greater than the full year revenue of almost of the companies in the Fortune We made huge inroads into emerging markets generating over billion in revenue and growing despite very strong headwinds from foreign exchange rates These results were made possible by Apples commitment to innovation and creating the best products on earth In the past months around the world weve sold over million devices including million iPhone million iPads and million Macs setting new unit records in increasing our global market share for both iPhone and Mac We crossed billion cumulative downloads from the app store and we added powerful new services to our ecosystem including Apple Pay in the United States in the United Kingdom Apple Music in over a countries and Apple News in the US We also entered an entirely new category without the watch and we are in the very early innings of this promising new part of our business We generated over billion dollars in net income and grew earnings per share by We returned almost billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while continuing to invest confidently in research and development marketing and distribution our retail and online stores our supply chain and our infrastructure We also completed acquisitions to enhance and accelerate our roadmap for products and services We accomplished all of these things while intensifying our efforts to protect the environment to promote equality and human rights and to ensure the security and privacy we know our customers deserve We are ending the year on a high note with a record breaking September quarter including sales of million iPhones beating our expectations and up yearoveryear Momentum price on and iPhone Plus remained very strong across the quarter and we established a new launch record iPhone s and iPhone s Plus near the end of the quarter We are seeing strong interest around the world and weve been getting great feedback from customers who love the iPhones new features including D touch live photos the new iSight camera and the powerful new A processor in the iPhone s and s Plus We exited the quarter with demand for a new iPhones exceeding supply but weve made good progress with our manufacturing ramp in the initial weeks of October We sold an all time record million Macs continuing to defy the negative trend and the global personal computer market which IDC estimates contracted by The app store set new all time quarterly records for both the number of transacting customers and overall revenue The strong performance of the app store helped fuel billion in services revenue also an all time record Sales of Apple launch were also up sequentially and we are ahead of our expectations This quarter we introduced beautiful new Apple launch cases and bands including new Gold and Rose Gold aluminum Apple Watch Sport models We released Watch OS in September paving the way for a whole new class of native apps that are faster and can take advantage of the hardware capabilities about the Watch such as the microphone speaker and the heart rate center Today there are over apps in the watch app store including over native apps such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>messenger MLB At Bat and Runkeeper and the number is growing rapidly Apple Watch has already had a tremendous effect on customers health and fitness and the stories were showing about its impact are truly inspirational I personally heard from people who credit Apple Watch with saving their lives and customers are finding new applications all the time in their day to day activities Revenue in Greater China nearly doubled yearoveryear and we continue to focus and invest heavily there I just returned from a four day to Hangzhou and Beijing where we announced major new initiatives to provide renewable energy for our supply chain I also visited our retail stores in China which were among the busiest in the world On Saturday we opened a new store our th in Greater China to a very enthusiastic crowd and we are on track to achieve our goal of stores by the middle of next year Yesterday we started taking orders for the all new Apple TV and it was a huge first day for this exciting new product We want to provide the same innovation in the living room that we delivered in our iOS devices People are already watching more TV through apps today and we think apps represent the future of TV Weve built a new foundation around this vision with a new operating system called tvOS innovative ways to connect with your screen and a smart use of Indiscernible to search for what to watch Next month well begin shipping iPad Pro the most powerful iPen ph youve ever made iPad Pro will enable a new generation of apps for entertainment and productivity design and illustration engineering and medical and much more and with the Apple Pencil and Smart keyboards users can customize their experience making iPad Pro and even more powerful tools ph for everyone from students to artists to business professionals iOS has hit the ground running on track to be downloaded by more users than any software release in Apples history with of active iOS devices already running at less

before Apple Music has set a completely new standard redefining and combining the best ways to enjoy music in a single and immersive app Over million individual and family accounts are experiencing Apple music including over million paying customers We are thrilled to bring Apple Music to China beginning this quarter along with iTunes movies and iBooks and we are especially happy to offer such great new and diverse content to our large highly engaged and rapidly growing customer base in China We are also looking forward to bringing Apple Music to the new Apple TV beginning this week Apple

are over brands working on home chip ph enabled accessories they can be privately and securely controlled from your iPad and iPhone and in the car more than automobile models had been announced with CarPlay support which provides a smarter safer and more fun way to use iPhone in the car And we will continue to work to make the iOS experience even more meaningful across more touch point of our daily lives The impact of research kit also continues to build We recently announced new studies on autism epilepsy and melanoma adding to the important studies already underway on conditions from asthma to diabetes to Parkinsons disease Our iOS news app is off to a great start Nearly million people are reading Apple news and weve been getting very positive feedback from the publishers We have now signed more than publishers representing hundreds of titles and were happy to announce that news just launched in the United Kingdom and Australia with partners such as the BBC NewsCorp ph the Telegraph the Guardian Financial Times Daily Mail and the Australian Broadcasting Service And finally we are making great strides in the enterprise market announcing a new strategic partnership with Cisco in September while furthering our progress with IBM in building our mobility partners program We estimate that enterprise markets accounted for about billion in annual Apple revenue in the last months up over the prior year and they represent a major growth factor for the future Id like to thank our talented and incredibly hardworking employees our developers and our business partners around the world and of course our very loyal customers for making Apples most successful year yet With that Ill turn the call over to Luca to go over the September quarter results in more detail Thank you Tim Good afternoon everyone Its great to conclude our record fiscal with our strongest September quarter ever Revenue for the quarter was billion an increase of billion or year over year Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone the expanded availability of Apple Watch and all time high services revenue and Mac Store sales We achieved these outstanding results despite severe and persisting weakness in foreign exchange rates around the world that affected all our geographic segments and this makes our yearoveryear growth rates even more remarkable In constant currency our growth during the fourth quarter would have been basis points higher We once again reported very strong numbers in Greater China with revenue growing yearoveryear to billion Emerging markets performance was strong overall at yearoveryear and representing of total company revenue for the quarter Company gross margin was up sequentially better than our expectations mainly due to lower than expected costs Operating margin was of revenue and net income was billion a new September quarter record Diluted earnings per share were a yearoveryear increase and cash flow from operations was billion also a new fourth quarter record For details by product Ill start with iPhone We sold million iPhones in the quarter up year over year with strong performance around the world throughout the quarter Total iPhone sales were up in Mainland China and grew over in South Asia and increased by over in several markets around the world including Germany and Italy iPhone ASP was an increase of yearoveryear thanks to more favorable mix and in spite of the very significant negative impact from foreign exchange that I referred to earlier We increased iPhone channel inventory by less than million units in order to support our new product launch at the very end of September quarter We exited the quarter with demand exceeding supply and channel inventory below our target range of to weeks Next Id like to talk about the Mac We sold million Macs which is an all time quarterly record and represents yearoveryear growth We extended our very long running trend of PC market share gains based on IDCs latest estimate of a global market contraction Mac growth was driven by the great customer response to our new MacBook and say its a MacBook Pro also remained strong We ended the quarter below our to week target range for Mac channel inventory Turning to iPad We sold million compared to million in the yearago quarter iPad sellthrough was million as we reduced channel inventory by about units We exited the quarter below our to week target range of iPad channel inventory iPad customer metrics continue to be extremely positive In August ChangeWave measured a consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within days tried to purchase an iPad Corporate buyers reported a satisfaction rate for iPad and a day purchase intent of In the segments of the tablet market where we compete we continue to be very successful Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has share of the US market for tablets priced above And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad has share of the US Commercial Tablet market As Tim mentioned our enterprise initiatives continue to expand In September we announced a new strategic partnership with Cisco to optimize their net source for iOS devices with a goal of providing iOS mobile users with great performance advantage over other mobile platforms Also during the September quarter IBM released new mobile first for iOS apps in healthcare financial services travel and transportation and industrial sectors including new apps leveraging iOS and Watch OS There are now apps in the IBM mobile first for iOS catalogue and the list of projects signings is growing rapidly Inside IBM Macs are gaining tremendous traction There are currently over Macs deployed within the company with more being added each week IBM tells us that each Mac is saving compared to a traditional PC thanks to the much reduced support cost and better residual value This is a terrific example of the kind of opportunity our devices offer to improve user experience and create value in the enterprise world Our mobility partner program also continues to grow with more than new partners added in the September quarter bringing the total to over and we are already seeing some great success stories with this program We are also very excited about the potential of iPad Pro and the enterprise For example with the Bloomberg professional app more than financial professionals will be able to use iPad Pro to gain instant global access to finance and business news market data and portfolio tracking and trading tools Turning to services We generated over billion in revenue a new alltime record and an increase of over last year mainly due to strong growth from apps The revenue from the App Store increased and the number of transacting customers grew also setting an alltime record Services growth was particularly impressive in China where the App Store revenue grew by yearoveryear The momentum behind the app store in China has been tremendous with huge interest from developers and customers alike Our developer program in China has grown dramatically in the last year with over million members in our program today Revenue from other products grew strongly up over last year thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the quarter and it was available at almost locations in countries at quarter end Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter We opened stores including our first store in Belgium That brought us to a global store count of of which are in countries outside the United States In fiscal we expect to open or replace between and stores and we continue to place particular emphasis on Greater China where we plan to have stores opened by the middle of next year Customers have been very interested in the iPhone upgrade program offered in our US retail stores The iPhone upgrade program gives customer purchasing a connected device an easy convenient way to get a new phone every year with low monthly payments to a third party lender along with a secured and protection of upper tier ph class After making or more installment payments customers can upgrade to a new iPhone Let me also quickly discuss three accounting matters First relative to the iPhone upgrade program that I just mentioned we will be reducing revenue at the time of sale for the cost associated with the program and deferring the portion of revenue related to Apple care software upgrade rights and non software services for each iPhone sold Second in September based on an analysis for market offerings we reduced the estimated selling price of future software upgrade rights and non software services that we defer for each iOS device and Mac sold the reduction is between and per unit Third also in September we lengthened the time period over which the deferred revenue associated to iPads will be recognized from two years to three years Let me now turn to our cash position We ended the quarter with billion in cash plus marketable securities a sequential increase of billion billion of this cash or of the total was outside of the United States In the September quarter we issued a total of billion of term debt consisting of billion Indiscernible denominated notes AUD billion denominated notes and billion denominated notes This left us with billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter We already acted in the market during the quarter and returned over billion to our investors We paid billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent billion to repurchase almost million Apple shares throughout the market transactions We also completed our fifth accelerated share repurchase program in July and retired an addition of million shares at settlement We have now completed over billion of our billion program including billion in share repurchases of which billion was repurchased in fiscal alone Now as we move ahead into December quarter I like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call We expect revenue to be between and billion compared to billion in the year ago quarter We expect gross margin to be between and We expect OpEx to be between million and billion We expect OIE to be about million and we expect the tax rate to be about Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of per share of common stock payable on November to shareholders of record as of November Thank you Luca And we ask that you limit yourself to one onepart question and one followup May we have the first question please Yes thanks good afternoon In light of December quarter revenue guidance friendly low single digit revenue growth and what looks like increasingly tough comps heading into the March quarter How do you get comfortable that Apple is on the verge of x ph growth for the first time in a decade And then I have a follow up Katy its Tim You have to consider the constant currency growth rates And so if you do that our guidance is actually to because we have about a basis point FX headwind in Q And so the growth is actually quite good underneath and thats obviously a problem with everyone struggling with it So resuming after the more macro question about growth heres what I see currently We believe that iPhone will grow in Q and we base that on what we are seeing from a switch or point of view we recorded the highest rate on record for Android switches last quarter at We also look at the number of people that have upgraded that were in the installed base prior to iPhone and Plus And that number is in the low percentages So we feel like we have a very open field in front of us Our performance in emerging markets although its quite good and our revenue was good Our market share is low and the LTE penetration in these markets is quite low Also if I assume I had to look at China As I have said before and just to make the point once again is we see an enormous change in China over the next several years The latest study I have seen from Mackenzie indicates if you look back five years Chinas middle class had about million people in it If you look ahead five years it will have ten times that number in it And so and I feel like we are reasonably well positioned in China Im sure we can do better but I think we are doing fairly well there Its not the only market that we are working on obviously I was really impressed last quarter with our progress in Vietnam and Indonesia and India among others Also from the currencys point of view and the weak global economies we dont overly focus on this Its Indiscernible its sort of a transitional kind of thing and we invest for the long term so we are continuing to invest for Apples future In addition to those Apple TV is off to a great start Apple Watch is just getting going The app store hit a new record again last quarter and the growth seems to be really great there Im really happy with the early days of Apple Music and the people moving from the free trial to the music business And finally the enterprise business is not to be under estimated Id doubt there many people knew that we had billion enterprise business that we quietly build in not too many years but our penetration is low but we have significant actions going on to really deepen that So sort of everywhere I look I see significant opportunity Long answer but I thought you might be interested No I appreciate that Just as a followup on growth if you look at large services companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Amazon Google theyre all growing over and its largely driven by activity of Apple users on IOS devices Do you feel like there is more than Apple can do to participate in that services growth or you relegated to fundamentals that are tied to device upgrade cycles Well the app store is growing over it grew last quarter and so we feel very good about that Thats become a sizeable business I would also point out that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market they sort of began to look more like subscription business in terms of where they operate And so we think that in the aggregate that they reduce upgrade cycles and also the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits the price point that were not hitting today largely which could help further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter Good afternoon and congratulations Tim you just briefly touchdown as reducing the time between upgrade but how do you think about the iPhone upgrade cycle compressing over the next few years obviously the impact from previous ph changes in the iPhone upgrade program Can you talk a little bit about when thats going to rollout internationally And then lastly Luca you mentioned some of the accounting changes related to iPhone upgrade program Any sense in terms of what percentage of the Plus the s upgrades were associated with upgrade program Thanks Eugene in terms of the upgrade program its early but heres what we believe our current view We do think that their broader upgrade program so Im just talking about our program that in retail I mean that is relatively small compared to our total iPhones sales in a company but the broader thing obviously is that many of the carriers are offering these plans And that if you look at them in the aggregate we think that it would have a positive impact in replacement cycles We do like the fact that it creates a market for an iPhone at a different price as well that is a better product and that customer maybe trying to buying which would further help from an ecosystem point of view and thats not to be under estimated It also seems like that from a rollout point of view theres a you will see these plans offered in a significant way in the United States already but in fact these plans are being offered in some derivation in over dozen countries in the world Theyre not as pervasive as they are in the US but it seems like they were on the front end of fairly major trends in the industry From financial perspective Gene the transaction on our iPhone upgrade program is a purchase its not a lease and so we recognize our revenue upfront of course we deduct also upfront the cost associated with the program essentially to provide interest rate financing and we need to estimate the fair value of the upgrade option for the customer but as Tim said its a popular program in our US store in the scheme of things its a small percentage of our worldwide iPhone sales and so well have really a negligible impact for example on ASPs for the phone And Tim if we put it all together is it something that has more measurable impact on the business two three quarters down the road is that the right way to generally think about it Yes we think about it Its being there were some clearly that were offered in the market prior to this cycle But they became much more pervasive and much communicated I think much wider with the September announcements And so I would sort of expect to begin seeing this somewhere around the year from now Yes Thank you Tim I appreciated the color that you provided on the drives of iPhone growth in Q I think the investor concern is that Q will benefit at least on a year over year basis from three extra weeks of availability in China And it will also benefit from more of those initial launch days that only two of them were in the September quarter and the remainder will be in the December quarter And so I guess the investor concern is December is a structurally advantage quarter in the sense of benefiting from both of those tailwinds on yearoveryear basis But if we look out beyond December wouldnt that point to notably lower seasonal growth than the March quarter And how do we think about the factors affecting unit growth beyond the December quarter And then I have a followup please We dont guide beyond December as you Toni I do think that the sort of the macro things I had spoke about earlier the upgrade programs the Android Switcher rate the iPhone momentum in the emerging markets and the LTE penetration in these markets These trends are not one quarter of things These are longer thing in size The same my same response applies and I think well do quite good in iPhone I do believe well grow this quarter as we put in our guidance that when we start with the number in the low s in terms of the percentage of the installed based is upgraded that had some three of the iPhone and plus that number still likely to leave a lot of headroom beyond December So thats how I look at that In terms of your first comment you didnt have to comment on that but just to be clear Our forecasting doesnt work like you articulate it I recognize that people can have their own models and so forth but just to make it clear that Im not agreeing with your point Okay And then just on the followup the reported gains from currency hedging in fiscal year were significant several billion dollar contribution to the company And again this is not an Apples specific issue Luca as you pointed out several times but how do we think about this notion of currency hedges effectively rolling off and being replaced with hedges that are likely have less of an impact How do we think about that impact the PL on a go forward basis perhaps starting with Q but then qualitatively or directionally over the course of the year And what is some of kinds of things that youve undertaken or planning to undertake that could mitigate some of those concerns Yes I think Toni its a very good point I mean whats going to happen in practice is that we got this portfolio of hedge comp such that over time provides protection to our margins and to our results but that protection diminishes as we go through the year and so we should expect that in over time during the course of fiscal that protection will come off assuming that the dollar stays at current levels Keep in mind there are some currencies around the world that where we cannot economically hedge and so those currencies are bit excluded from what were talking about right now I think my conclusion is that the guidance that were providing for the first quarter that to it actually an incredible level of guidance given the foreign exchange headwinds that were dealing with How do we deal with that We continue to hedge so our program continues on an ongoing basis and we will continue to provide some level of protection to foreign exchange movement In some cases we have realign prices particularly when we launch new products We tend to do that in a number of countries where the foreign exchange moves have been particularly extreme and so we tend to recover that through pricing And then finally of course we are putting in place a number of cost initiatives that would allow us to deal with the foreign exchange situation So overall we feel very strong guidance for the first quarter And beyond the first quarter as you know were not guiding and so well see over the course of the year Thank you very much Tim I wanted to go back to your commentary on the enterprise business billion I think you said it was up yearoveryear I know you have a relatively small sales force internally and obviously you utilizing the joint ventures but as you noted you see thats an important driver of growth So how do you attack that market going forward Will there be changes Is there something that you need to shift or focus product in a little bit of different directions to make sure you can adequately attack it Just in general how youre thinking about it From a product point of view wed actually been continuing to change and improve IOS for some time With every release they are more enterprise features and so I would describe it as sort of continuation of that cadence perhaps with little more intensity From a go to market point of view we will be working with or are working with IBM with Cisco Were already working with mobility partners that are principally in the US but thats expanding quickly to international as well And so many of these companies have in some cases very large sales forces in many cases the reasonable seize sales force And in addition to a direct sales force there is a huge worldwide indirect channel that many customers buy from and count on buying some services from And so I do not envision Apples having a large enterprise sales force will certainly make we continue adding some people more on the engineering side but I dont envision having a large direct sales force Okay great Thank you And can you give us some more color on China yearoveryear growth in iPhones but can you talk in general about what youre seeing in the marketplace and perhaps where you think you in terms of penetration from a smartphone standpoint especially with a China Mobile which has a substantial opportunity to grow given the LTE penetration Yes If you look at China we grew from an iPhone point of view Greater China we grew the market grew for If you take iPhone out of the market number the certain market x iPhone actually contracted slightly And so weve been able to grow without the market growing iPhone was the number one selling smartphone in Mainland China last quarter and iPhone Plus was number three And so we did fairly well The sort of the economic question which I know theres a bit lot of attention on frankly if I were to shut off my web and shut off the TV and just look how many customers are coming in our stores regardless to whether theyre buying how many people are coming online and in addition looking at our sales trend I wouldnt know if there was any economic issue at all in China And so I dont know how unusual we are with that I think that theres a misunderstanding probably particularly in the Western world about Chinas economy which contributes to the confusion That said I dont think its growing as fast as it was but I also dont think that Apples results are largely dependent on minor changes than growth I think its much more of contributing I think other things contribute to that much more That does say youll never had problem there because the economy Im not saying Im dumb enough to think that But I just think that the area that its currently operating within its hard to tell the difference of the consumer level for us I mean you really cant tell the difference if you look at sort of our daily and weekly numbers So were very bullish on it and I would point out that were investing in China not for next or the quarter after or the quarter after were investing for the decades ahead and as we look at it our own views is that China will be Apples top market in the world And thats not just for sales thats also developer community is growing faster than any other country in the world And so the ecosystem there is very very strong I was very impressed with the number the developers I met last week and of course the customers in stores are enthusiastically contagious Thank you Tim I wanted to talk about the two sources of your iPhone demand selling to current customers and selling to new customers In terms of selling to current customers you indicated about a third of the base is moved to the sixth line As much as people talk about that been a huge upgrade cycle and what is the six has have incrementally not that a bigger number I would have thought it would be bigger than that Does this suggest that there is maybe more of a consistency to upgrading than the street perceives And then on the other side in terms of new customers just wanted clarity on the switcher number are you saying that of iPhone shipments in the quarter went to android switchers to IOS And do you believe that you could actually have more new customers to Apple in fiscal than you had fiscal Theres a lot there Let me start with the Android Switcher What this means is that for customers to purchase an iPhone last quarter and replace the smartphone that of those switched from an android device And so there would have been some switchers on top of that from other operating systems but obviously android is the largest one by far And so thats what that means and that number is the largest that weve ever recorded since we began measuring it three or so years ago And so its a huge number were very very proud of that number In terms of versus new customers its hard to predict Im very happy with how were doing Were doing better than weve ever been doing People I know theres a fixation on the upgrade rate When I look at the upgrade rate Steve what I see is I feel good that its a low number because thats low number means that there is of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone and plus that havent bother to upgrade this year Thats a large number And so Id see that is opportunity Do I think it has anything does to length to consistency I think part of it is and I believe that the iPhone upgrade plans that are out there as Ive mentioned before it seems to me on the future Well tell its true or not but it seems to me its going to act as a catalyst to accelerate some of this upgrades And I think thats not something that were going to see this quarter or next quarter but it seems like its going to happen beginning a year for now or so It have begins to be youve seen the plan They look more and active like a subscription than they do like a purchase And thats great for the customer because many of them want to upgrade on a frequent basis and they can do this very very simply In terms of new I dont know whether well more new or not I can tell you that thats always our objective We want to add a lot more people to the ecosystem and certainly if you look in the emerging markets even like nobody is asking about iPad on the call But if you look at iPad as just an example in China of the people that purchased an iPad it was the first tablet theyve owned and of those have never owned any Apple product Just to go through one product with one set of number I dont want to get through a bunch of numbers because it does contain the data than I dont want to share But these are things that were very focused on And the first time buyer number is surprisingly strong And keep in mind that we have a good history of bunch of people buy one Apple product they have a great experience They begin to look at other Apple products And of course we makes they all work well together Hi Thank you very much Just is a followup to that last question and to put that in context roughly what percent of the iPhone shipments come from shipments for the installed based versus from your user shipment Okay And then just a followup as Luca mentioned you had to make some adjustments to the pricing in various regions given the currency move weve had What had been the response in terms of demand I guess both in terms of units and revenues in some of these regions like Japan or India parts of Europe where the local prices has to go up Simona weve made a number of price changes during the course of fiscal What weve seen in a normal of these markets weve seen that iPhone sales have been very resilient and that shown in our growth rates Most recently weve adjusted some prices around the world for the launch of iPhone s and s Plus We are very positive about the safest trends around the world Its a bit early to tell because the phones have out there just for four weeks so its bit early to tell there Obviously when we increase prices around the world its normal to see some impact on sales rates but so far we were encouraged by the response Let me go back to your question And this is an exactly what youre asking that what your view I think some color is The reason I cant answer this is we dont look at any aggregate we actually look at the detailed because its much more important for to us to look at buy iPhone model by country what percentage going to our first iPhone buyers Somebody thats never owned an iPhone before And so if you look at China as an example its over of people that bought and Plus were buying their first iPhone As you move down the line that numbers goes up And so a s generally speaking is higher in most countries And so that gives a feel for very important market and we cannot where the numbers are Thanks a lot Good afternoon guys Two questions from me as well I guess first could you talk about the gross margin dynamic as you go from September to December the midpoint implies on basis points I think the last five years thats only happen once the gross margin is going down in fiscal Q Can you just talk about what the FX dynamic or what area the other headwinds that you think that implies gross margins being done in December Yes Let me give you puts and takes for margins for the December quarter On the positive side of course as you mentioned that we would have positive leverage from the higher seasonal volumes Also what weve seen over the last several quarters is a commodity environment that has been quite favorable and we expect it to remain favorable during the December quarter On the other hand of course we are launching a lot of new products Weve launched some during September We are launching some now and everything we launch new products we make them better We had features and new technology and these products when we launch and tend to have higher cost structures than the products what they replaced We have a very good track record overtime to reduce those cost structures but every time we introduce a new product that is a headwind at the beginning of the cycle for gross margin While its different from a year ago very significantly with the foreign exchange impact that we have mentioned before it remains a very significant headwind as I mentioned earlier to Tony I believe we are dealing with that to a combination of hedging price realignments ph cost initiatives but on a net basis foreign exchange we will clearly by a sequential headwind Got it And then Tim when you talk about seeing iPhone growth in fiscal Q Im curious is that statement more reflective of iPhone units or iPhone revenues so that the ASPs could hardly get growth even if units are not there And then would you expect to exit within the to week optimal inventory range in fiscal Q I dont know that we will exit We make that call late in the quarter as we see what the demand is because we are actually trying to position the inventory for the following quarter instead of the current quarter And its very difficult to predict What was your other question Is it revenue I was making a revenue statement but units are also yes we expect units to be up as well Yes thanks for taking my question I just wanted to ask Tim maybe if you could comment on the mix between iPhone and iPhone s And whether the mix of demand is any different than what you say for instance that the iPhone s point whether there is more say iPhone I know you highlighted that the iPhone is a number one phone in China for example and then I have a follow up The statement I made in China was about Q and the s was only available in China for two days last quarter The iPhone s is the most popular iPhone that we currently sell In terms of has there been a change If you look at iPhone today and add iPhone Plus and compare that to last years s we are doing better at that price point than we were previously Okay thank you And then theres follow up for what you were doing on the upgrade program I am wondering if can you envision a time ever made in the US or elsewhere where you would not have to come into an Apple store to activate it or to take advantage of the upgrade you might be able to do that somewhere else do you start now what your Thats a really good question We actually solved that problem back in But then quickly had to change it in order to scale in a major way And so that is something that we would always sort of always in our mind that one day from a customer experience point of view we would like to make things as easy as possible for the customer And to some degree you can already do that with buying online But there are many different plans and search what the people buy that they have to come in for several times we would love to have that automated and working with our partners with service providers Thank you Rod A replay of todays call
