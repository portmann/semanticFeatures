key misconception about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>that I believe will lead to hugely positive EPS estimate revisions in the future I also believe that because of this catalyst and several others outlined <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is much cheaper than it appears on fullyear expectations Taking a levered long position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>currently is a bet that at least one of its catalysts works out historically that bet has paid out big I think currently the hardest variable to value within the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB ecosystem is messaging The longterm and potentially farreaching implications of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>having success via its messaging vertical are incredible and that can lead to sensationalism if leaned into Sensationalism that Wall Street as well as anybody writing about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wants to avoid Once branded an irrational pompom waver its a hard title to shake But is it fair that analysts have had to be so measured in pricing in any level of success to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>financials I dont think it is I mean to say that the level of success that messaging at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can experience inclusive of both Whatsapp and Messenger could be model altering is to put it mildly If M develops to the extent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is intending my bet is on this coming to fruition and if societal communication trends dont completely pivot to a new direction messaging could be equally as lucrative as the core <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform Yes that big But before you disregard this opining as the overzealous hopes of an investor long JAN CALL options at break out exactly what messaging is what it does for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and what it could be The key concept to grasp and one that I grasped in leading me to my purchase of longdated CALL options is that Whatsapp and Messenger dont compete Not at all Nor will they ever Thats huge Whys it so huge Two reasons First Wall Street for some reason thinks the two platforms compete and by way of that cannibalize each other pull a report on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>from any of Wall Street houses that cover <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Second Wall Street doesnt realize the funneling capacity that Whatsapp provides to Messenger and that eventually Whatsapp will be killed off or folded into messenger likely within the next years Whatsapp is essentially a farm team customer aggregation engine for future Messenger users Dont think that the eventual realization of all leads to some EPS growth being modeled into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I do Being that Whatsapp is a datalight currently lowfeature currently lowfunctionality app its well suited for developing markets This is something that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has never been shy about Why hasnt Whatsapp been built out further than it has Because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a built out Whatsapp in Messenger Messenger is the developed market white glove competing solution to WeChat which Messenger clearly aspires to be and is its largest and most formidable global competitor etc At least thats what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is working towards before WeChat works towards the West With the recent additions of M Businesses on Messenger and the overlay of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at Work Messenger is appearing to be Facebooks marquee ecosystem product for enterprise capture If you didnt know it this is a hugely important market that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is looking to capture So Messenger serves a sort of universal capture and retention function for all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users but especially those that drive its advertising business the nonconsumer Again as global infrastructure constraints allow for it more and more users will be transitioned to Messenger from Whatsapp Eventually I believe as stated above Whatsapp is folded into Messenger entirely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is about user experience over everything Messenger now and especially in the future will have a much better much distinguished user experience Not only this but with Messengers constantly evolving constantly moving forward enterprise capacity ecommerce funds transfer tech live customer service concierge service via M etc Messenger is the future portal for how businesses operate outside of brick and mortar <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is quite literally making Messenger more important than flagship websites or apps Yes in the nearfuture it will be more important for an enterprise to have a capable Messenger team than to run a dotcom Look no further than what WeChat is doing for examples of how this evolves over time Again a lucrative forward look that no analyst is pricing into forward looking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>EPS But for now at least above anything else understand that the two platforms dont compete They just dont Whatsapp is the startup tech to the techgiants better tech Whatsapp will be acquired by Messenger If Wall Street viewed each as their own company I believe analysts would be pricing in a much different much more lucrative earnings picture for full year and soon to be full year estimates Wasnt it doing this before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>acquired Whatsapp Why did Facebooks acquisition suddenly change how Whatsapp was viewed and how it changed the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>model In addition to this a legitimate related question can be asked in is Wall Street valuing M at all Can it at this point I dont think it is because I dont think it can Again this nearterm change Wall Street being able to value M too should add to EPS estimates when forward looking I guess the broader point to be made within this article is that when I view the spatial race to have the most capable and widely used communication platform both on the private side and the public side I have to look at Messenger as a standalone that isnt competing for the same function For instance Slack Skype for Work Hangouts etc are all wanting to help you perform a function or be more productive consumer and nonconsumer use cases Messenger wants to be a platform It wants to be an internet within an internet a platform that you never exit A platform where you can send a family member a happy birthday message followed by a money transfer while checking with Ralph Lauren NYSE RL to make sure the birthday shirt you ordered your family member is still on the way Thats fundamentally different in competition and in monetization capacity With M Messenger might not want you to have to do this at all It might want its concierge to do all of this for you So I caution against viewing Facebooks PE at X and its FCF yield at Because I just dont think those figures will stand the test of time I think when we reach full year conclusion that those estimates have been stepped up or so History would agree with me as this has been the case at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>dating back to As realizations come in substantially better quarter after quarter analysts will be forced to positively revise estimates higher and higher as they have consistently as illustrated within the charts above But what if they were revised higher today What if Facebooks EPS expectation was say higher than it is today and its PE expectation substantially lower Would that change the naysayer investment thesis I think it most definitely would History has shown us this will happen and never before would I have said that there are so many visible catalysts to drive forward looking outperformance Whatsapp M Messenger buildout <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at Work So on and so on Doesnt it make sense to just buy the estimates and realizations revisions to come now It would have in the past Taking a levered long portfolio position in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>currently is a bet that at least one catalyst on the board is successful Maybe more than one but certainly not all I believe that as bullish as analysts have been forced to be that there is still a very measured take on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>currently leaving room to the upside from an analyst driven standpoint Being levered long allows for a smaller capital outlay to participate in a bigger upside than taking a position in the common It does this with more risk potentially catastrophic risk if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>suffers a longterm setback but again at a lower net risk per dollar than buying common on an equal basis Ive done well so far being levered long <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and based on my expectation that EPS is consistently positively revised I would think others who initiate soon prior to this happening would stand to be positioned attractively as well I continue to recommend a longposition in <span
