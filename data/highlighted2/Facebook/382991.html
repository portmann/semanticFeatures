competitors make further inroads The thesis that a real threat to Intels data center market is years away comes into question after Googles data center server announcement The new competition will give Google more leverage with Intel After the earnings report is released the stock could bounce to the upside since expectations for Intel may already be low Shares of Intel NASDAQ INTC have been trading along the day moving average after bouncing off the low in February as analysts raised concerns about PC and notebook sales during the firstquarter Intel will report its firstquarter earnings after the market close on April Investors will be closely watching the results from the Client Computing Group or CCG Intels mobile and PC business and the Data Center Group or DCG as about of their revenues last year came from these two groups Less than a week ahead of the earnings report Pacific Crest warned it expects Intel to report firstquarter earnings below the midpoint of guidance and to lower its guidance for the fullyear as well Wall Street opinions about Intels data center outlook are mixed according to Barrons Investors may want to pay attention to the average selling prices or ASPs of the DCG platform which are on the decline during the past several quarters Since midJuly Intel shares have been trading in a range between and per share within a symmetrical triangle chart pattern meaning investors cant decide in which direction the stock will move next In our view INTC could bounce off from the day moving average to the upside even if their earnings report misses estimates as expectations for Intel may already be low Nonetheless a negative earnings report and guidance surprise could send the stock back to retest the lower trendline support of the symmetrical triangle at about per share and eventually per share Last week Gartner and IDC said that based on their preliminary data global PC shipments took a and nosedive in the firstquarter respectively from a year ago IDC however anticipates an upturn later this year when the enterprise upgrades to Windows may start to kick in Notebook sales arent doing so great either according to Chris Danely at Citigroup who reiterated his view in March that Intel will have to cut its forecast given worsening trends in the PC market Danely said Taiwan notebook ODM shipments in the firstquarter are expected to decline quarteroverquarter below the normal seasonality of down quarteroverquarter More bad news might be Gartners latest forecast saying that global IT spending will decline in instead of the growth previously reported in January Although Gartner kept the estimates for spending on data center systems at billion for it revised spending growth downward to from the January forecast of a increase on a yearonyear basis Intel investors are hoping for a revenue rebound in its lucrative Data Center Group which makes microprocessors chipsets and SoC that are used in servers storage and switches to power data centers In the fourthquarter the company said DCG revenue grew yearonyear compared to a clip during the same quarter in Most analysts had expected previous doubledigit percentage gains to continue Revenues and operating income growth from the Data Center Group which accounted for and of total revenue and operating income in are decelerating From Intels earnings statements DCG revenue grew in compared to in while the operating income grew only in compared to the explosive growth of in Notably the average selling prices of the DCG platform increased just in compared to a increase in while the unit volume growth was in as it was in In fact the ASP during the fourthquarter was down compared to the thirdquarter and the fourthquarter Intel may want to cut the ASP deeper if enterprise buying remains cool and new competitors begin to emerge as they try to maintain high singledigit growth In early April Jerome Ramel at Exane BNP Paribas cut his rating of Intel to Neutral from Outperform citing that ARM Holdings NASDAQ ARMH is making more inroads to Intels server chip franchise than he had expected Ramel revised his revenue growth forecast downward for Intels Data Center Group to from for and to from for The thesis that a real threat to Intels data center market may still be years away since large scale data centers still mainly run on x chips comes into question after the recent announcement by Google a division of Alphabet Inc Class A NASDAQ GOOGL and Class C NASDAQ GOOG at the OpenPower Summit in San Jose California Google said its developing a data center server with cloudcomputing company Rackspace Hosting Inc NYSE RAX code name Zaius which will run on a new Power IBM NYSE IBM OpenPower chip To make matters worse for Intel Google plans to submit its final design through the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Open Compute Project so other companies can use it to build their own data center servers Rackspace Hosting said they will deploy their solutions into production Thus far Google is not yet sure about switching to the Zaius Power server running on OpenPower chips or to processors based on designs by ARM Holdings as the decision is going be based on performanceperdollar said Gordon MacKean a Google senior director of Infrastructure in an interview with Bloomberg Regardless Google will have more leverage with Intel even after Intel launches a brand new server platform in the secondquarter known as Purley which according to them is the biggest platform enhancement since Nehalem Early in January Annapurna Labs Ltd an Israeli chip designer that Amazon NASDAQ AMZN bought for between and million last year sent out a press release saying that it will start rolling out a new line of ARMbased chips called Alpine which can run WiFi routers power connected devices and handle networking and storage functions for data centers The chips will be sold to makers of products for homes and data centers Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM announced in midJanuary that it had entered into an agreement with the Chinese province of Guizhou to create a joint venture called Guizhou Huaxintong SemiConductor Technology Co Qualcomm plans to enter the server CPU market that Intel dominates with a customer processor chip built using the ARM architecture which is less expensive and may also consume less power Intel immediately fired back several days later with an announcement of a new joint venture to design chips through a research partnership with Tsinghua University and Montage Technology Global Holdings Intel will put million into the venture A Barclays analyst turned bearish on QCOM in late March after Intel became a second source for the Apple NASDAQ AAPL iPhone baseband cellular modem More bad news also came from Googles announcement that it singled out an IBM OpenPower design rather than one from Qualcomm Shares of Qualcomm have performed poorly during the past years QCOM bounced off a fouryear low at a share in midFebruary and the stock is now trading under the day SMA near the a share trendline resistance level Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD announced in January that they had started volume shipments of its Seattle Opteron A ARM processors designed for high density server systems The Opteron A chips will power web servers networking appliances and storage arrays So far analyst views of the new AMD bit ARM chip have been mixed Chip companies including Broadcom Ltd NASDAQ AVGO Applied Micro NASDAQ AMCC and Cavium NASDAQ CAVM could soon try to take a bite from Intels nearmonopoly market share with their Vulcan bit ARM server processor XGene family of ARM server chips and ThunderX ARM processor respectively Shares of Broadcom one of the largest ARM server chip companies is trading at the top of the range of the bearish ascending wedge chart pattern The stock could bump along the upper trendline resistance as long as momentum continues and earnings power support a premium valuation There are several supports if AVGO pulls back Intels High Performance Chips Arent a Game Changer The acquisition of Altera by Intel was completed in early fiscal year and Altera emerged as a stand alone unit called the Programmable Solutions Group Intel just announced that the company had begun shipping a development module that features Xeon E server processors and fieldprogrammable gate arrays or FPGAs from Altera which will improve the performanceperwatt of systems by as much as Late last year Qualcomm and IBM already signed deals with Xilinx NASDAQ XLNX Alteras competitor to allow Qualcomm and IBM to incorporate Xilinx FPGA chips in Qualcomms ARMbased server chips and IBMs Powerbased systems to accelerate their performance As competition in the data center business is heating up it is highly critical for Intel to convince Google <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and others to switch from the graphics processor unit or GPU chips to the Intel hybrid XeonFPGA chip to power their artificial intelligence tools including speech recognition image recognition and natural language processing Investors will be closely watching Intels earning report to be released after the close of April with an eye on results from their Data Center Group as revenues operating income growth and average selling prices had previously been decelerating as global IT spending is on the decline and competitors make further inroads Intels Data Center chip business is coming under direct siege so the thesis that a real threat to Intels data center market may still be years away comes into question after the recent announcement by Google at the recent OpenPower Summit Google said its developing a data center server code name Zaius which will run on a new Power IBM OpenPower chip Google will thus have more leverage with Intel despite Intels new server platform known as Purley to be launched next year After the earnings report is released the stock could bounce to the upside as expectations for Intel may already be low I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other
