recent decision to withdraw from the NFL bidding because it was required to show ads was a sound one However the NFLs decision to insist on ads was also sound <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and the NFL would still make great partners but they should focus on a different category of football content than exclusive nationwide games The conventional view that sports is a natural place for ad breaks is not wrong but it is incomplete There is substantial potential for an adfree sports service Facebooks willingness to invest heavily in providing such a service is I believe an extremely bullish indicator for the stock even if it missed out on this round It certainly wasnt an outcome anyone saw coming For years media analysts have wondered when the major tech players would break down the old PayTV walls and yank away a major sports contract into the digital realm Not long ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Verizon NYSE VZ Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO and Apple NASDAQ AAPL were all fighting for the privilege with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>supposedly in the lead However it then decided to back away from the bidding Somewhat surprisingly for an advertising powerhouse <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>refused to agree to allow any commercials during the broadcast When the NFL wouldnt go along with an adfree experience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>backed out The deal ultimately went to Twitter NYSE TWTR a name that had hardly been mentioned before then and for maybe a tenth of what others were offering <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear he sees ads as a nonstarter in Facebooks new Live platform On the one hand whether he is right or wrong that users will not put up with ad interruptions in a modern service is not the point The CEO thinks ads will kill the experience so ads are not coming to the service for the foreseeable future On the other hand Zuckerberg may well be correct in his belief that ad breaks even rich ones like the NFLs are not worth the blemish on the customer experience Netflix NASDAQ NFLX the king of video streaming has never had them and its customers frequently list adfree viewing as one of the biggest benefits of their Netflix subscription Amazon Prime Video another adfree service has vaulted to second place in streaming video just behind Netflix and ahead of Hulu Plus despite the fact that Hulu is two years older Is that because of its lack of ads Hulu itself seems to think so it recently announced its first completely adfree offering But at the same time the NFLs reticence to disrupt the advertising paradigm of its content is understandable A deal with Facebooks adfree format would have been highly problematic for three reasons First finance second ad spots are going for north of each on Sunday Night Football right now Which extrapolated over regular season games with twenty ingame commercial breaks four second ads per break plus halftime commercials and playoff games yields an annual advertising income of well north of billion per year Just for the advertising That is roughly million per game Facebooks reported offer of less than that amount was not worth taking the first step on a slippery slope that might disrupt that business Second politics <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was bidding for the digital rights to a set of games that had already had their linear rights sold to CBS NYSE CBS and NBC NASDAQ CMCSA broadcasting powerhouses who would never agree to drop their ad breaks NBC is even owned by Comcast the company at the heart of the PayTV ecosystem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Netflix and company are busy trying to disrupt So far Comcast has considered the NFL one of its best partners in keeping sports content locked behind the paywall and holding off the coming tsunami of internet TV A deal with an almost Netflixlike format would have set off alarm bells that might hamper future agreements and kings ransoms from its PayTV partners If NBCCBS are broadcasting with ads and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is broadcasting adfree would people really keep putting up with the ads on PayTV or would they turn their TVs off their tablets on and move over to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Twitters willingness to leave most of the broadcasters ad inventory intact on their streams made doing a deal far easier Third the nature of sports programming makes it a natural home for ads Unlike TV shows which are filmed in advance and already finished by the time customers start watching them sports are livebroadcast There are times in the game when nothing is going on and viewers lose nothing by cutting away to an ad If they werent watching an ad theyd be just as bored watching players standing around like when a coachs challenge is underway and referees are reviewing tape for example And that is not limited to football Think of a pitcher warming up after a pitching change in baseball Facebooks suggestion of eliminating ads is a little more complicated in the world of sports than in TV dramas or comedies Does this mean that an adfree <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has no path to sports content for the foreseeable future Hardly It doesnt even mean that it has no path to NFL content But it does mean it needs to recalibrate its approach Thursday Night Football is what is called an exclusive national window That is not only do CBSNBC buy the games themselves the rights to the games they are broadcasting they also buy the entire window of time They get a promise from the NFL that they will be the only ones broadcasting a game that night For hardcore football fans who desperately want a game any game to watch they will only have one place to go That works out well for TV stations desperate for ratings It also works for an adsupported Twitter It wouldnt work so well for adfree <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>even if it had won the rights For any streaming service especially one that runs adfree customer engagement is the name of the game Netflix spends billion a year on content and given the wide range of customer tastes each subscriber is probably only interested in a small fraction of it When viewers bingewatch four episodes of a mystery series adfree on Netflix on Saturday night Netflix doesnt make them take the hourplus they saved and watch a romcom When a subscriber finds something on the service they like Netflix likes to have more of the same ready to keep them engaged and more likely to renew Theres a reason Netflix buys whole TV shows Imagine if Netflix bought the first ten episodes of West Wing but then told them it didnt have the other some when they were done Obviously it will run out of West Wing episodes eventually and then it will have to guess at something similar to recommend it hopes they will like When it does Netflixs recommendation engine will try to find something will similarities to what it already knows the customer likes Maybe another political show maybe something else with Martin Sheen maybe something else with multiple strong female leads But none of these will be quite like West Wing and if it guesses wrong too many times the subscriber might leave Netflix certainly isnt going to chance that until it has squeezed every bit of customer satisfaction it can out of the show it already knows they enjoy Netflixs recommendation engine is very good and it has a lot to do with what makes Netflix so successful All the same it is still guessing At the end of the day it only knows one thing for sure the customer would like more of what they are already watching When people purchase a particular form of entertainment they are essentially signaling the market that they prefer that content to other content Anything else no matter how similar will presumably be not quite as enjoyable Ideally if given extra time by eliminating ads they would like to reinvest it in that same content But if there is only one NFL game on Thursday night adtime savings cannot be used to watch more NFL football Since sports are almost always enjoyed live exactly what makes them so attractive to advertisers old recordings of games wont help either And yet the passion of so many fans suggests that if there was a way to enjoy more games they would probably be eager to do so A few obvious candidates leap immediately to mind The NFL itself of course has only one multigame timeslot Sunday day games The NFL recently concluded an eightyear extension of its exclusive multigame package with DIRECTV NYSE T now owned by ATT so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would have to come to an agreement with them to drop their exclusivity Or college football also plays multiple simultaneous day games on Saturday And the NCAA brings more than just football to the table Another major multigame package is the NCAA March Madness tournament in March In fact aside from the NFL playoffs March Madness is one of the biggest events on TV every year Last year million people tuned into the final game on cable The year before CBSs broadcast brought in million Recordsetting highs in March Madness Live online indicate that viewers are not averse to following the sport onto the Internet and many of them would probably welcome the option to watch more games and less ads Adsupported broadcasts could still be maintained for those who only want to see one game and dont want to pay extra subscription fees to cancel out ads There is major potential for an adfree revolution to come to sports just as it came to television via Netflix over the last few years There is no reason however to insist that that revolution start in the worst possible place singlegame broadcasts in exclusive windows And considering how nervous any sports league would be about leaving the safety of a multibillion dollar revenue stream for the unknown of adfree digital there are more than a few good reasons not to But adfree sports are coming And if the response by primetime viewers to Netflix is any indication Facebooks willingness to invest heavily in them has the potential to pay off in spades Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>missed out on this round I believe Zuckerberg has exactly the right idea Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in FB over the next hours I wrote this article myself and it
