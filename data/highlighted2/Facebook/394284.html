month we noted two potentially bearish indicators for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and presented two ways for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>longs to hedge Both indicators a double top noted by chartist Karl Eggerss and a spike in dark pool short interest turned out to be wrong in this case We review the current status of both hedges and show that although hedged investors participated in Facebooks advance theyre up a bit less due to the drag on returns In an article earlier this month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Proceed With Caution we noted two reasons for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB longs to be cautious the potential double top formation cited by Karl Eggerrs below On the bullish side then were Portfolio Armors website which estimated a potential return of for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>over the next five months and Wall Street sellside analysts whose median price target for the stock implied a similar potential return of about over that time frame Those sellside analysts rushed to raise their price targets after Facebooks impressive Q numbers In our previous article Hedging Apple we looked at how hedges on Apple NASDAQ AAPL reacted as that stock sank after earnings In this one well look at how our <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>hedges reacted as FB shares rose As we noted in our initial article on hedging Apple a sharp move up in a stock can make it costly to exit a collared position early As with the optimal puts above this optimal collar hedge may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security plummets in the near future due to the put legs combination of intrinsic value and time value for an example of this see the section titled More Protection Than Promised in this article However if the underlying security spikes in the near future the combined time value and intrinsic value of the call leg can have the opposite effect making it costly to exit the position early Well see an example of that below with a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>collar First though well look at the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>put hedge These were the optimal puts to hedge against a greaterthan drop in FB shares over the next five months as of April ths close the screen capture below is from the Portfolio Armor iOS app How That Hedge Reacted To Facebooks Rise FB closed at on Wednesday April th A shareholder who owned shares of it and hedged with the puts above then had in FB stock plus in puts So his combined hedged position value on April th was FB closed at on Thursday April th up from its closing price on April th The investors shares were worth as of and his put options were worth So represents a gain over So although FB had climbed at the time of the calculations above and the investor was up only on his combined hedge underlying stock position by this point The best case scenario here is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>keeps going up and the investors return by midSeptember will be the return of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>over that time frame minus what he paid for the put options The worst case scenario is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>plummets from here and the investor is down no more than from the April th closing price by midSeptember That decline would include the cost of the hedge Status Of The April th Optimal Collar Hedge As of April ths close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of FB against a greaterthan drop by midSeptember while not capping an investors upside at less than by the end of that time period As you can see above the cost of this hedge was negative meaning the investor would have collected about more from selling the call leg than he paid for the put leg Heres an updated quote on the put leg as of Thursdays close And here is an updated quote on the call leg How That Hedge Reacted To Facebooks Rise FB closed at on Wednesday April th A shareholder who owned shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had in FB stock plus in puts and if he wanted to buytoclose his short call position he would have needed to pay to do that So his net hedged position value on April th was FB closed at on Thursday April th up from its closing price on April th The investors shares were worth as of his put options were worth and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar it would have cost him So represents a gain from So although FB was up by at the time of the calculations above if the investor hedged with this collar wanted to exit his position on Thursday his gain would have been limited to The best case scenario here is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>keeps going up and is up or more from the April th closing price by midSeptember In that case the investor would be up from the April th closing price plus the negative hedging cost The worst case scenario is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>plummets from here and the investor is down no more than from the April th closing price by midSeptember minus the negative hedging cost Disclosure
