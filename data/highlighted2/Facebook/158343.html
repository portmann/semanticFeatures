class='textDiv'>Hedge funds that crowded into same names likely to nurse losses Reuters BOSTON Hedge fund managers often promise to find stock ideas off the beaten path but this month many prominent players have been bloodied by doing exactly the opposite betting on a small handful of popular names that sold off sharply in August The carnage of the last week even with Wednesdays and Thursdays rebound has been particularly acute for investors who have seen their overweight positions in companies such as social media site <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>pharmaceutical company Valeant internet retailer Netflix carmaker Tesla Motors and renewable energy company SunEdison get pummeled in the last days As a result people who have money with David Einhorns Greenlight Capital Leon Coopermans Omega Advisors Chase Colemans Tiger Global Philippe Laffonts Coatue and others are bracing for red ink when August data comes out next week Only a few managers have actually told investors about their losses People will be shocked by how bad the numbers will be said Peter Rup chief executive and chief investment officer at Artemis Wealth Advisors which invests in hedge funds adding they will be down percent for the month and for some people it may be a lot worse The average hedge fund is off almost percent for the year according to Hedge Fund Research data while the Standard Poors index is down almost percent One reason the declines may be so big is that managers have tended to crowd into similar stocks some lulled by years of rising markets several investors said For example Omega Advisors which investors say is off percent this month was hurt most by SunEdisons SUNEK percent plunge this month investors said The stock fell drop in the last five days alone even though it came back on Thursday and also hurt Greenlight Capital and Daniel Loebs Third Point investors said Earlier in the week Omegas Steven Einhorn said his firm believed stocks would rebound The SP lost more than percent in a sixday run of losses before recovering gaining percent on Wednesday and Thursday combined Greenlight investors tracking the funds returns said Einhorn is likely down by double digits this month further worsening a year in which he was down percent through July A spokesman declined to comment Similarly an percent drop in Valeant VRXTO in the last five days plus Facebooks percent decline and a percent tumble in Netflix also hurt big funds At William Ackmans Pershing Square Capital Management Valeant makes up roughly one third of the portfolio and the billionaire investor said on Wednesday that his percent gain through the end of July was gone hes down percent in August through the th The declines in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Netflix were big detractors for Philippe Laffonts Coatue Management while Netflix was the number one drag on Tiger Global in the last five days according to Symmetric which tracks and

time Whether managers swap stock picks at private dinners or find tips at conferences they worry funds no longer deliver the uncorrelated investments they promise Hedge funds do love the crowded names and the bigger a fund gets the more likely it is we see them in common names said Brad Balter managing partner at Balter Capital which invests with hedge funds But some investors also say there is good reason to crowd into some stocks largely because they are the ones expected to perform well The drop in Apple one of the hedge fund industrys most widely held names has been largely reversed easing the initial sting on portfolios Sometimes the fundamentals are extremely compelling said Troy Gayeski who invests in hedge funds at SkyBridge Capital This is the case primarily for healthcare names where fundamentals are improving valuations are very reasonable and continued accretive transactions are highly probable Some healthcare oriented funds including Perceptive Life Sciences Offshore Fund and CCI Micro Healthcare Partners Ltd have been among the industrys most successful this year Among SP sectors health care is one of just two in positive territory in having gained percent on the year Even as hedge funds were seen as trying to trim their positions in the wake of this weeks sharp losses many are expected to stick with the names they like Ackman for example said he had not made significant adjustments to his portfolio Longterm investors expect hedge funds to perform better especially if markets trend lower If we look at how hedge funds have performed over these times of drawdowns theyve done a whole lot better than the average fund said David Saunders founding managing director K Advisors which invests with dozens of hedge funds Thomson Reuters is the
