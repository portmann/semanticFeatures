Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>remains a compelling investment for growthoriented investors While top line results missed consensus estimates I anticipate that various factors will drive top line results in future quarters offsetting the recent disappointment in Q results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was unwilling to break out the monetization of video ads and investment in certain areas of the organization is somewhat questionable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>needs to offset increases in RD and CapEx with reductions in COGS and SGA Investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB at such a rich earningssales multiple contradicts conventional wisdom In fact investing into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt for everyone So to be fair Im going to present the various factors driving growth while also mentioning some of the risks of owning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in this article Despite offering a balanced viewpoint on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Im still adamantly bullish on the stock So if youre looking for analysis that supports a bearish viewpoint you wont find much to your liking in this article MAU and DAU trends have improved modestly whereas ARPU grew by yearoveryear The increase in ad pricing paired with the growth in MAUs in adjacent properties like Instagram Messenger and WhatsApp supports the stocks high valuation Revenue is growing at a torrid rate Video ads and a scarcity of adinventory will increase CPMs which will support ARPU growth in the interim Ad inventory will continue to grow due to an increase in the amount of content found in the average users newsfeed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has developed new features to engage users which is why the average session length will continue to trend higher An increase in session length will increase the number of native ad units that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can display to users Facebooks ad network across mobile and nonmobile devices offers publishers a healthy alternative to Googles Ad network Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has developed extensive partnership agreements with various ad agencies and operates a network of websites FBs publisher network has enough scale to rival Google AdSense Therefore monetization of offsite ad inventory should add legs to FBs growth rate Theres also the hidden x factor of Oculus Rift which is a VR headset targeted at PC users The PC gaming ecosystem is both healthy and large as Steam has over million members according to Alienware Direct X is expected to improve the overall graphical capabilities of addinboards by a significant magnitude After consulting with technology experts who frequently attend technology conferences photo realistic gameplay is perhaps five to ten years away Assuming graphical capabilities of PCs reach that of photorealistic environments the marginal value of a VR headset will improve considerably <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will likely capitalize on both the software and hardware of VR as it has both the technical capability and financial resources to expand the market potential of the device beyond that of a narrow niche <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>missed on the top line which is a first since going public Perhaps analysts are getting a little too aggressive on their revenue models Also monetization of the FB messenger app is up in the air as displaying ads on the messenger product or charging for the service is clearly off the table Some FB products are going to carry earnings and revenue while other products are unlikely to contribute to either earnings or sales in a very meaningful way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wasnt willing to break out the monetization of video ads on the conference call When taking into consideration the monetization potential of preroll ads or video ads in general its a tough pill to swallow Im not just curious about the amount of revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can make on video ads I demand to know this information because it makes it easier for analysts to anticipate the shift in revenue mix and how it will impact top line growth in future fiscal yearsquarters Facebooks expenses as a percentage of revenue have trended higher Now normally Im a little more open minded when a company wants to invest back into their business However Facebooks core app has reached saturation in the United States and Europe Facebooks other mobile products will continue to grow regardless of Facebooks spend rate on marketing While it makes sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to increase the size of its salesforce why is it increasing as a percentage of revenue In other words I dont understand why the direct sales organization needs more investment when much of the adsales can be taken care of by a computer that matches bidders with the available ad inventory Facebooks SGA and COGS as a percentage of revenue should be trending lower even if just slightly RD and CapEx as a percentage of revenue should continue to trend higher this way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can maximize the value of every dollar that it generates from operations From what I saw <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>delivered reasonable EPS and revenue figures for the most recent quarter Various noncore services like Instagram and WhatsApp will add significantly to Facebooks valuation going forward Theres also room to improve the business operationally as spending on RD and CapEx should be highly prioritized over noncore spending activities like SGA and COGs When weighing the good and bad <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>remains a solid growth investment Therefore I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation as the stock trades at a reasonable valuation relative to its growth potential Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Reports A Decent Quarter Offering A Mix Of Good And Bad
