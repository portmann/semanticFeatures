class='textDiv'>Why You Should Buy Apple Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Seeking Alpha The current drop in stock price reflects lowered iPhone sales anticipation No one has ever predicted in advance the success of the iPhone iPad or any other Apple product Let me get right to the point Apple NASDAQ AAPL is a buy at the current price of Investors are fickle Earlier this year investors were tripping over themselves to buy Apple So much so that the price of Apples stock rose to an alltime high of No one seemed to have any reason to sell Now with Apple selling at investors are tripping over themselves to sell the stock Just this past week David Tepper confirmed that his Appaloosa Fund closed out their Apple stock position in the first quarter That comes on the heels of Carl Icahn selling his Apple holdings citing concerns about Chinas government possibly making it difficult for Apple to sell its products there Undoubtedly the pressure of those two investors selling millions of shares did not help the price So why is there a plethora of selling The most cited reason is the slowdown in iPhone sales But come on How could anyone have NOT thought that this day would come All products have a life cycle And the iPhone life cycle had an amazing run and while slowing down is still far from dead Apple does not disappoint Period At least that is how it used to be As mentioned earlier Apples stock is down on the heels of the news of slowing iPhone sales But with disappointment comes opportunity Earnings as a percentage of both market capitalization and revenues are at fiveyear lows The fiveyear average for earnings as a percentage of revenues is With an annualized rate in based on the past quarters data this metric is currently offering an discount The fiveyear average for earnings as a percentage of market capitalization is With an annualized rate in based on the past quarters data this metric is currently offering a discount In other words using both of the above metrics the anticipation of weaker sales and earnings has already been priced into the stock and now offers an attractive entry point Also not to be dismissed is the fact that Apple does not need the iPhone to keep being a trend setting device The iPhone will always be a cash cow for Apple but as the company has demonstrated time after time it is the new products that make Apple the power house that it is No one has ever predicted one of Apples products being a blockbuster prior to its release And that is why we think that now is the perfect time to invest in Apple Before the next great product is introduced But alas people get scared because of the dependence that Apple has on iPhone sales Fear not Great companies with exceptional managements such as Apple anticipate these issues Case in point is Google aka Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Back in its infancy Google was thought of as simply being a search engine that amassed user information Google Maps Google Earth and Google Analytics are just a few of the products that diversified the Google name by enriching the user experience and enhancing the base for Googles amazing growth Apple is similar to Google in terms of the management team it has Apple has proven time after time that it knows how to run their business with foresight and meticulous planning Even before Tim Cooks team took over Steve Jobs had the foresight to plan and innovate for the future It has been the Apple way to produce record sales and profits since this century started Yet just one quarter of slowing profits has investors running for the exits So what possible catalyst do I see as the future of Apple to enhance Apples revenues and profits Apple has always had a significant RD budget With that being said its RD spending for last year was at or near a fiveyear high Not just on an absolute dollar basis but also as a percentage of revenues and as a percentage of earnings If that was not impressive enough the rate of this past quarter has actually accelerated significantly Granted some of the percentage growth is due to slowing revenues and earnings but in absolute dollar terms the growth is extremely impressive In Apples most recent quarter Q it spent an obscenely large billion on research and development That represents a yearoveryear increase compared to Q s billion We have no way of knowing what products will come out of this spending Sure we have heard of an electric or autonomous car but it would be illogical to think that is the only or the best hope for the next great product The products Apple has introduced in its history are awe inspiring Just look at this timeline of Apples products Apple Watch Apple Music Apple TV and Apple Pay are all viable products and services that have been successful Its success while not at the amazing level of the iPhone or iPad has proven the merits of Apples internal RD potential Organic growth is the most logical avenue for growth since it has historically been the Apple way While it has not been a common practice for Apple to acquire companies for over billion prior to the purchase of Didi Chuxing only the purchase of Beats for billion cost Apple over billion a large acquisition for intellectual properties can and should not excluded Now I am not going to try to downplay the Beats acquisition or ask if Apple paid too much for it personally I think it did but the revenues were clearly not earth shattering and the technology is not so awe inspiring that it will make the average consumer buy an Apple product In fact Apple was not shy about the fact that it bought Beats primarily for the music Music is such an important part of Apples DNA and always will be said Eddy Cue Apples senior vice president of Internet Software and Services The addition of Beats will make our music lineup even better from free streaming with iTunes Radio to a worldclass subscription service in Beats and of course buying music from the iTunes Store as customers have loved to do for years The Beats revenues are so insignificant that Apple does not even break them out separately in any of its quarterly reports nor the annual report That makes us wonder if there is some underlying technology RD that caused Apple to purchase Beats If the answer to that question is no then the acquisition makes very little sense Apple is not a company that historically grows via large acquisitions Nonetheless just this past week Apple announced that it is buying Chinas top ride sharing app Didi Chuxing for billion According to this Wall Street Journal article the purchase was made because the tech giants global fortunes are flagging While I disagree with the WSJ articles thesis this perception may be gaining ground According to this article The company claims it fulfilled one billion rides last year and holds of the countrys private ridehailing market Tech Crunch At the same time Uber announced in February that it was losing over billion a year in China Regarding Didi Chuxing since this acquisition was made just last week it is clearly too early to judge how well the return on Apples investment is or will be One needs to remember however that sometimes the benefits of an acquisition are not solely monetary or technology The Didi Chuxing acquisition was completed not just to offer a Uber Private UBER alternative While discussing the acquisition Tim Cook said We are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market Of course we believe it will deliver a strong return for our invested capital as well the investment strengthens Apples ecosystem pushes Apple Pay yet deeper into the Chinese market provides more insight into China and brings the Apple Car project yet closer to a home in China Source Reuters Also as mentioned by Tim Cook and others it was to improve Apples prospects in and with China The Chinese market is a difficult market to enter Due to competition and the Chinese government both placing barriers for foreign companies not just Apple many American companies cannot or do not want to spend the time and money to try to capture the Chinese market and their billion plus citizens It is extremely doubtful that Apple made this acquisition solely because it wanted to have a pure ride share play More likely is the fact that it positions Apple favorably in the eyes of the Chinese A summary of why Didi was beneficial is To show the Chinese citizens and the government Apples commitment to China Diversification of future revenues and profits As suggested by Tim cook to learn more about the China market the potential of Apple introducing Apple Car and having a ready market for said cars While this acquisition was a service and not a product it demonstrates that Apple is willing to invest in products and ideas not generated from organic growth If Apple was willing to spend billion for Beats there are clearly other companies that can deliver more bang for the buck in terms of technology or revenues The lack of other mega priced acquisitions does not mean that Apple will not or should not make mega acquisitions in the future So what types of companies should Apple consider adding to its corporate umbrella Apple has the luxury of not NEEDING to buy a companies to survive The impetus should clearly be on finding companies that offer a unique product service or angle for Apple that would enrich shareholders What the Didi and Beats acquisitions demonstrate is that Apple is now more willing than ever to consider mega mergers for possible growth This strategy has worked well for other companies most notably <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Priceline NASDAQ PCLN Both have experienced significant bottom line revenue and profit growth by acquiring large companies and incorporating them into their organization while keeping the current management of the acquired companies BlackBerry BBRY would be the first name that comes to mind Potential benefits A significant benefit would be the acquisition of BlackBerrys newest and fastest growing segment its software and services division aka enterprise mobility management EMM EMM enjoys a market share making it the market leader NonGAAP software and services revenue was up year over year These segments had revenues of million BlackBerry has already spent significant money on creating an Android platform phone The knowledge and experience BlackBerry now possesses can be valuable to Apple Android is a threat Even BlackBerry is adopting the Android platform To distinguish Apple from Android they need to do something different Something no one else can recreate Androids market share has become dominant According to a chart supplied by Gartner Androids market share continues to explode With a current stock price of and a market cap of only billion BBRY is definitely affordable Even a a share offer for a controlling interest computes to only billion Why only ownership Simple There is no need to replace the current management at BBRY John Chen stopped the bleeding of cash and has finally stabilized the company While there may not be large symmetries between the two companies RD intellect can cross or merge product lines Both the revenue growth and the significant software growth make sense for Apple BlackBerry itself had cash and cash equivalents of billion at the end of the quarter so this is an acquisition that makes financial sense BlackBerry is currently on track to become cash flow positive There is another opportunity for growth that I personally think would be a good fit for Apple I know that I will get a lot of comments and likely criticism but outside the box thinking gets people talking so here goes Buy Sprint NYSE S and offer DEEP discounts on data compared to the other telecom carriers Why What possible benefits would Apple derive First and foremost is the issue of iPhone users getting their phones data throttled due to excessive usage Every few months we seem to see a news story about ATT NYSE T or Verizon NYSE VZ finding a new excuse to throttle smartphone usage Despite ATT losing a court case back in for throttling a customers iPhone the problem still exists Prior to the iPhone being introduced the topic was once again covered in this article due to it still being an issue that customers faced Verizon is not immune from the throttling controversy either In this article Verizon comments on its throttling the top of all data users not all of which are iPhone users By controlling a telco company such as Sprint Apple could also offer Sprint much needed capital to upgrade its network into a top notch carrier which would not throttle data usage thus enhancing customers iPhone experience while transforming Sprint into a telecom powerhouse Offer a service to all Apple product users that rewards them for using Apple products keeps them inhouse and less likely to abandon their iPhones and iPads The final result would be Sprint becoming a top rate telco that would enrich Apple customers data experience Sprints current market cap is billion with billion shares based on the May closing price of A buyout offer for a controlling interest could be done for billion which would equate to a share Once again a stake is all that is needed That is a pretty good incentive for Sprint shareholders to approve such a deal Also of note is the fact that Sprint has finally made headway in terms of its balance sheet Sprint eliminated of its longterm debt in the past twelve months Sprints management has proven that they too are much more resilient and adept at steering the company than others gave them credit for Given the fact that Apple ended the most recent quarter with billion in cash and marketable securities Apple could even offer cash for a quick deal Financially Apple has its house in order Much has already been written about Apples finances and I do not see a need to rehash it here If you are looking for an indepth financial article on Apple I suggest you read fellow SA author William Koldus synopsis that he penned this past week He made several well supported arguments the most glaring being that Apple is currently selling at its cheapest valuation in over ten years and it has underperformed the overall market dramatically Given his thoughts I am tagging along and endorsing his thesis One final note Warren Buffett announced this week that he took a stake of billion in Apple He likely had three reasons for buying the stake all of which were mentioned in the article The fact that the stock dropped over and is now a good value So there you have it An article on why to buy Apple that is not based solely on financial analysis but rather on the track record of the superior management team that Apple has created and possible opportunities that Apple can capitalize on in the future Investors should give Apples management the respect they deserve It is only logical to expect them to execute as well in the future as they have in the past Given the pullback in Apples stock I expect Apple to outperform the overall market for the remainder of If you enjoyed this article and would like to follow me to read future articles go to the top of the page and click the Follow button under the title and next
