FB Moments the new Paper I think it might be For those unfamiliar Moments is a standalone app that you grant access to your ondevice photos moments then uses face recognition software to silo your photos into convenient categories At its core Moments does two things and its learning to do two things better and better assist in collaboration and machine learning I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is using this to test a future collaboration and communication application and call me crazy but I think an app like that could have serious nonconsumer use If you use Slack or you use Intellinote or another collaborationfile sharing application download Moments and tell me the crossover and similarities arent striking Those who follow my coverage of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>know that Ive equated the failed Paper app initiative to the eventual creation of Instant Articles Facebooks new push to become a content and inbound marketing powerhouse I think this is the future of marketing and advertising and that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>smartly made the Paper investment into preparing for that future It also should be noted that it did this long before it made obvious sense to at a time that the market was seriously asking who was minding the shop You also know now that I think Facebooks See First is a move into further dialingin its News Feed in an effort to optimize the effectiveness of its more overt advertisement efforts In my opinion See First is an effort to give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>some insight into who influences you and who it can leverage into greater add efficacy For those unfamiliar Moments is a standalone app that you grant access to your ondevice photos Moments then uses face recognition software to silo your photos into convenient categories mostly separating particular friends into searchable silos but also helping group together events Still its actually quite useless in my opinion Useless that is as a photo sharing and collaboration app its stated purpose Moments was created to increase user engagement and to help users with photo tracking Again not mission critical issues for the current user base at least not ones that Im aware of But at its core Moments does two things and its learning to do two things better and better assist in collaboration and use machine learning Both are huge for what I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is using this to test I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is using this to test a future collaboration and communication application And call me crazy but I think an app like that could have serious nonconsumer use Meaning for business use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has this desire to be all things to all people its equity owners share a passion for seeing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>satisfy this desire What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt have is a vehicle thats productive to folks in the one environment where presumably its users are not using its app although we all know that isnt true the workplace If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can develop a Box NYSE BOX DropboxSlack because Slack has a wellknown and awesome chat interface type application that can assist in collaboration andor sharing management is there any excuse not to be on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>pretty much all day every day Think about it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>already has face recognition software on its main platform and it already has messengerWhatsapp for sharingcollaboration in fact Whatsapp is used quite often in workplaces Slack notably replaces it on the SMB side often at least I can say that anecdotally In my opinion because Moments allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to create privacy walls within the sharing environment it allows for multiple users when selected to collaborate behind a privacy wall and it allows its algo to make smart suggestions on an automated basis Its algo also makes smart suggestions using device access which greatly expands the capacity and relevancy of the algo and for the first time takes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offplatform and ondevice <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>making that jump is huge Obviously I dont think that Moments is the final iteration of whatever <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is cooking up and I certainly dont see it going viral again as is for photo sharing its pretty useless But if you use Slack or you use Intellinote or another collaborationfile sharing application download Moments and tell me the crossover and similarities arent striking With Facebooks massive network and absurd influence I just dont know that it wouldnt make sense for it to at least testpursue something collaboration based something thats more than simply facilitating the collaboration Something where it doesnt try to be a valueadd and monetize Again you wont be overly impressed with Moments but I wasnt overly impressed with Paper yet I love Instant Articles If Im right and Moments is the next Trojan Horse at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it could be the start of something very special Source <span
