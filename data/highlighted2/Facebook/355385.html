are my reasons why it would be a bad idea to consider shorting or selling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock What are the key drivers of growth that would justify Facebooks high valuation as a company What is the real source of their ad income is it the number of users or something that everyone seems to be missing In a recent article on SA fellow author Seattle Contributor outlined his thoughts on why we should consider selling or even shorting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB I would like to express my opinion on why I think it would be an imprudent idea to consider doing that This is not going to be an article where I poke holes in his analysis nor is it an attempt to get <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>longs to support my argument Im looking at this purely from the point of view that it would be a mistake to short or sell FB I would like readers to have an unbiased view of what Im about to say irrespective of their position on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a stock In other words try looking at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a group of people doing some pretty amazing things rather than as a business entity whose sole end is to toe the investor line We expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and we achieve greater market penetration Thats stating the obvious Their market is only as large as the worlds population and once they reach a particular point of penetration they will naturally be limited by factors such as population growth and internet usage growth In an earlier article called Zuckerbergs Revenue LineUp <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Instagram WhatsApp and Masquerade I spoke extensively about their future monetization plans with WhatsApp and their current integration of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram ad platforms I also referred to MSQRD their recent acquisition on the selfie video front To extend that point to this article none of those revenue streams are fully realized as yet and some of them havent even made a penny yet Facebooks mastery over monetizing web traffic is second only to Googles and with Instagram thrown into the game Zuckerbergs team has a real chance at closing the gap even there More importantly the biggest monetization opportunities have not played out yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is just getting started on Video Advertising Its important to remember that for any type of advertising the more the ad clicks the more revenue the company makes This is called the ClickThroughRate also ClickThroughRatio or CTR Certain types of content have higher CTRs than others As an analogy for a carmaker selling an SUV is more profitable than selling a hatchback And thats where video content plays a huge role in Facebooks strategy because it is like that SUV Heres a look at CTRs for various types of content Instream video ads are the ads you see while youre watching a video on YouTube or elsewhere and has become one of the standard methods of online video advertising You may have also noticed that some of them are actually nonskippable meaning you cant skip the ad and continue to the next part of your video That means the ad gets seen by everyone viewability The hunger for data consumption is being driven as much by the elevated demand for richer content like video as the need for other forms of media In a special report by PWC these are some of the highlights Video exhibits the fastest growth in wired Internet advertising Mobiles growth means it will exceed display in Rising from USbn in to USbn in at a CAGR video Internet advertisings rate of growth will exceed all other subsegments of wired Internet advertising revenue This is a key reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is seriously investing in video advertising and the technologies surrounding it They recently started testing their video feed which offers a variety of options such as pictureinpicture the way Tumblr has implemented just last year and the ability to save videos to watch later Theyre also experimenting with inserting advertiser videos within the video feeds and claim to be pleased with the initial results of these multiple tests These tests are recent additions to a slew of tests that include degree video support for the Oculus Rift a webembeddable video player similar to YouTube as well as tools for live video broadcasting This is essentially one solid business case for why shorting or selling <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could be the worst investment mistake you could make at this point The other is the entire market that is sitting outside Facebooks monetization pool But there is one point that everyone seems to be missing as far as ad revenues go Read on Theres every chance that video advertising will be bringing in the bulk of Facebooks revenues in the next decade But thats merely the door that will let them in The vehicle to take them there is still their user base monetization Seattle Contributors analysis on user growth is sound but whats missing there is the fact that multiple user bases mean multiple streams of revenue even if there are major overlaps between those user bases Lets say there were a billion users each on WhatsApp <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram and lets also assume that WhatsApp as well as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram were fully monetized Now were not necessarily talking about three billion users here because of the overlaps the actual number of users could be anywhere between a billion and three billion But from an advertisers perspective one that is paying for ads on all three social networks thats still three billion user accounts It doesnt matter that its not three billion people What that means is that a single person using all three social accounts is potentially a clicker on ads that appear on all three platforms For example they may click on a Nike NYSE NKE ad on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a Reebok ad on Instagram and an Adidas OTCQXADDYY OTCQXADDDF ad on WhatsApp all on the same day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>still gets paid for three clicks by the advertiser and the advertiser is still getting their potential conversions Heres my point From that perspective Facebooks aggregated user base in terms of individual user accounts can easily exceed billion by The more platforms they own the more user accounts they have and advertising is all about user clicks from individual accounts not necessarily the number of people who click on an ad I believe that this is where Facebooks true potential is going to come from over the next several years This is an edge that even Google GOOG GOOGL doesnt have at this point The more platforms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>owns the more monetization opportunities it is creating for itself At the end of the day its not only about the worlds population or the growth of global internet penetration although those will limit Facebooks user base to a large extent Thats why I think it would be disastrous to sell or short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at this point In my earlier article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Has A Problem I outlined why I thought their valuation was too high for my liking I still say that it is too high for my liking but Im also willing to admit that most of their monetization opportunities still sit outside their current top line The market may correct itself on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>once it reaches a barrier in any monetization channel but selling or shorting would be an extremely risky strategy when there are so many revenue drivers sitting outside and waiting to be counted in As such I maintain that if youre an investor in FB hold on to the stock for as long as you can I may not recommend a BUY at this valuation but I respect the fact that such a valuation is a very possible prediction of future reality I invite you to follow me as I reveal the best and worst of the worlds largest corporations presenting as unbiased an analysis as possible but spiking it with my own opinion At the end I will leave you to be the best judge of what to invest in and what to stay away from Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship
