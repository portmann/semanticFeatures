class='textDiv'>An Objective Look And Valuation Of Twitter Twitter Inc NYSETWTR Seeking Alpha Twitter is a good business with a lot of exciting prospects It is not yet profitable not even close to it Its main assets are its MAUs and I propose a valuation model for it that yields reasonable results Tying MAU valuation with revenue and assets minus total debt gives us a good idea of Twitters fair value Twitter is ranging from fairly valued to overvalued territory and currently is experiencing a negative trend Short sellers can take advantage of this The intention of this post is to provide a sober and unbiased analysis on Twitter NYSE TWTR and its valuation I preface this by disclosing Im short Twitter via options and that I would only write about something in which I have a position Regardless of yours long short sidelines I sincerely hope the following piece is useful to you Twitters business model is to monetize as much of that public selfexpression and conversation as possible And the truth is that Twitter is getting increasingly good at it as you can see in the following figure Source Twitter Q Earnings Slides V Its been able to get more ads on the site charge more for those ads and the cost per ad has been decreasing consistently It is a fantastic achievement and very promising Also it ranks among the most visited social media sites in the US after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB YouTube NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Reddit as of March Source Priit Kallas DreamGrow March So at a glance Twitter might look like the best social media investment you could possibly make at this moment However Id like to bring the readers attention to the fact the social media business comes down to Growing Monthly Average Users MAUs Its as straight forward as it comes Twitters revenue mainly comes from advertising in fact about of it The remainder stems from Data Licensing This proportion has been holding steady since its IPO Ill focus mainly on advertising revenue for the purposes of this article Source Earnings releases from Twitter plus own elaboration Well first we should compare it to the social media giant <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>In its last quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>grew its MAUs at and reached billion Its advertising revenues topped billion which works to about per MAU Its worth noting that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>already is hitting saturation in some of its demographics Twitter on the other hand grew its MAUs at and reached million users Its advertising revenues topped million which works to about per MAU However given Twitters size one would expect growth to be accelerating not slowing down or stalling which seems to be the case Source Earnings releases from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter plus authors forecast Its worth noting that in Twitters case its costs of goods sold COGS arent increasing as fast as its revenue which would bolster a bullish stance on the stock This is probably because it has to buy servers and not necessarily build new infrastructure Nonetheless once you add the selling general and administrative expenses SGA namely salaries and executive compensation including stockbased compensation then it becomes a losing proposition This is a completely operational look for Twitter no interest expense or taxes taken into account However I did add back stockbased compensation because it represents a form of SGA that although its not a cash expense and therefore doesnt appear on the income or free cash flow calculations it is money shareholders pay to its executives in the form of share price dilution The stockbased compensation may not represent cash but it is so only because the company has used a barter system to evade the cash flow effect Put differently if the company had issued the options and restricted stock that it was planning to give employees to the market and then used the cash proceeds to pay employees we would have treated it as a cash expense We have to hold equity compensation to a different standard than we do noncash expenses like depreciation and be less cavalier about adding them back NYU Professor Aswath Damodaran Sadly it seems that Twitter is employing accounting tricks see GAAP to nonGAAP reconciliation page that may mislead investors into believing its profitable Truth be told its far from it because its executives and key talent wont work for free In fact its extremely expensive This cost isnt covered from a loan or the proceeds from advertising revenue but from the shareholders pockets in the form of share dilution And the market will continue to reflect this on Twitters declining stock price Twitter has a monstrous amount of stockbased compensation SBC since this figure has totaled over billion As of today Twitters market cap is just over billion The aggregate SBC represents of its valuation which is a complete insanity There is a silver lining in favor of Twitter because it seems to be cutting its operational costs and squeezing its MAUs for revenue to the very last drop Still remember that it has to pay taxes if it ever becomes profitable and interest expenses which again sets the company into steeper losses Depending on which quarterly release you read growth numbers vary suggesting misleading intentions Source Twitters earnings slides Q and Q If we compare Twitters MAU growth to Facebooks it is clear that TWTR is starting to lag behind on social media At any rate its not growing as fast as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which might be approaching saturation This is a little alarming for Twitter Source Earnings releases from Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>plus own elaboration The company needs to extract as much cash from its MAUs as it can On this front Twitter seems to be stepping up its game Still if you compare what advertisers are willing to pay per MAUs on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>per MAU vs what theyre willing to pay on Twitter per MAU you see clearly that FB is definitely doing better There are lots of reasons for this but all point to the same conclusion sellers get more out of publicity on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>than on Twitter But for the sake of argument lets assume that Twitter could demand the premium per MAUs that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does from its advertisers If so results would have been similar to the ones shown in the following figure Note If Twitter was able to demand this kind of premium I wouldnt mind paying per share for TWTR but then again thats a big if Source Twitters earnings releases and own elaboration On a side note in my opinion there is some room for improvement in Twitters ability to extract additional premium from its MAUs However I doubt it will reach Facebooks level any time soon ie in the next years The reality is that competition is fierce in social media advertising and whatever ground <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>gained it most likely took it away from its competitors Look at it this way if in years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>becomes the CocaCola of social media do you really think Twitter is going to be PepsiCo If the answer is no then Twitter will most likely just get bought out in the end and nobody can predict when and at what price From my point of view this would be the bestcase scenario for shareholders but thats material for another article It seems Twitter has hit the wall on its cost cutting and its not profitable yet Even if it would cut costs by another it would barely come close to profitability And even then remember there would be taxes at some point if it ever does become profitable so from this angle Twitter is performing very poorly There are simply a lot of ifs on this front Source Twitters earnings releases and own elaboration Most of its costs come from stockbased compensation SBC this is what mainly dictates net income The problem is the moment management cuts compensation beyond a certain point it has to increase its SGA expenses which in turn would further damage its EPS And then the stock would take an even bigger hit Source Twitters earnings releases and own elaboration There are three components to valuing Twitter at this point earnings revenues and assets Earnings There are none if you look at GAAP figures It hasnt been profitable since the IPO Revenues Heres Twitters strongest point and driven by advertising Its composed by the following Monthly Active Users MAUs Last quarter it logged million MAUs and in advertising revenues per MAU Growth Its starting to lag behind social media competitors such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>last quarter it grew just over QoQ Assets Heres the easy part we just have to go look at the last quarters balance sheet Earnings If it becomes profitable in the future is another story and thats priced on its revenues In the following figure I construct a normal distribution graph for my valuations I use the mean of and a minimum of Its purpose is to help the reader visualize the possible price ranges of my assessments about Twitter Twitter may be a fantastic company with pretty nice prospects for the future But as investors we need to look at the cold hard numbers and not be deceived by empty promises and high hopes In this order I come to the conclusion that Twitter has about an chance to trend below in the long term see graph above Shorting it for the remainder of the year could prove very profitable just mind borrowing costs and entryexit points with targets ranging between and a share In the short term we can try riding the present negative trend after last quarters disappointing earnings results and expect lower lows For those long this stock Id advise a lot of caution because when you buy Twitter youre paying a huge markup for hope As always Ill be happy to answer any questions regarding the contents of this article Its purpose is to help and contribute my two cents to this community of investorstraders I
