growth in the past few years led by strong franchises and sequels around Marvel Pixar and the Disney universe There were no signs of a lull in their recent sequels and their next sequels are eagerly awaited Disneys NYSE DIS movie business has seen steady growth in the past few years led by strong franchises and sequels around Marvel Pixar and the Disney universe Accordingly the box office revenues have grown steadily and are expected to continue this trajectory We believe that the studios popular franchises and characters such as Captain America Avengers Thor and Frozen should continue to do well in the coming years There were no signs of a lull in their recent sequels and their next sequels are eagerly awaited Moreover Disney will release Star Wars The Force Awakens in December of this year and two more episodes are planned for the coming years We believe that the Star Wars movies will be a gamechanger for Disneys studio operations and boost its global market share Having said that it must be noted that the performance of a studio can be erratic as it largely depends on the audience and box office response which can be fickle and hard to anticipate Star Wars could bring tremendous success for Disney across its portfolio of offerings including television theme parks and consumer products Higherthanexpected growth in boxoffice revenues could add incremental revenues of billion over our current forecast This could trigger a upside to the stock in our estimation The studio business contributes more than to Disneys value according to our estimates Disneys global boxoffice revenues have increased from billion in to billion in the calendar year Looking at the global boxoffice market share it has been in the range of to This growth can largely be attributed to its successful acquisitions in the past Disney has added to its moviemaking assets through a series of acquisitions including the purchases of Pixar for billion Marvel for billion and Lucasfilm for billion Lukasfilm in fact was the maker of the earlier Star Wars films which have a huge fan following with close to million followers on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>It shouldnt be difficult for Disney to repeat the success of Marvel and Pixar with Lucasfilm Disney has also stated that it is planning a significant Star Wars presence in its theme parks While Disney has paid billions of dollars for these acquisitions we think that the price paid is justified as it has been able to generate massive revenues and profits from them For instance Marvels films after Disneys acquisition in have grossed over billion at the boxoffice This is just the movies business Disney also earns revenues through the characters and franchises across its portfolio including television theme parks movies and retail merchandise Disney currently commands close to market share with around billion grossing at the US boxoffice for However the grosses including international markets currently stands around billion The studios three movies Avengers Age of Ultron Inside Out and Cinderella accounted for of the overall grossing in Disney had a fantastic run at the box office so far this year and it has a solid lineup for the coming months as well as in the next few years when the studio will reap the benefits from sequels to Star Wars Avengers Captain America Toy Story Frozen and Thor Given the popularity of these franchises and associated characters we estimate the boxoffice revenues will grow and be around billion and an estimated EBITDA margin of for Disneys studio business will translate into EBITDA of million representing around of the companys overall EBITDA by the end of our forecast period However a better than expected performance of Star Wars at the boxoffice could lead to higher revenue growth in the coming years and translate into a upside to our price estimate for Disney Here we estimate the segment revenues to be north of billion by Profit growth will not only come from higher revenues but also from higher EBITDA margins It must be noted that the Star Wars contribution will be much higher if we account for Disneys other products
