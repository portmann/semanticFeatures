#A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is opening an ad placement API for Instagram Advertisers can use the API to make layouts and add call to action buttons to buy products Instagram has been tapped to go into the big league It may not have the billion users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB CEO Mark Zuckerberg said was necessary to be an interesting business just yet but judging from initial projections some marketing research firms are putting out Instagram will be of great interest to Facebooks ad revenue generation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is already the market leader in attracting online advertising spending and its subsidiary Instagram is going to build upon that lead eMarketer has produced a forecast calling for almost million in mobile ad revenue just within this calendar year By the internet market research firm estimates Instagram will generate as much as of Facebooks total revenue or about billion This is how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can keep up with the lofty earnings growth expectations the market is pricing into the stock Instagram and WhatsApp have been sitting on the bench waiting to get called up as their business models grow to a stage where they can pull their own weight Less than a week ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>reported second quarter earnings and revealed that of its billion monthly active users mobile monthly active users reached billion or of the total My thinking is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>management has decided to look past the fact that Instagram has only about million monthly active users and focus on the rapid growth of mobile users who advertisers will increasingly pursue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is striking while the iron is hot to bring those potential advertisers into the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>fold and put more pressure on Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube for ad dollars Expectations have been building up for Instagram to offer easytooperate ad promotions directly by APIs application programming interface similar to what individuals and businesses have been using to coordinate and manage their ads on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>already Well that time is here The Instagram site has just made available its API that developers can begin registering their applications Similarly advertisers and businesses can put together layouts and add buttons like shop now and sign up for products and services The API can be used to monitor and record ad progress and performance For those who already have ad promotions on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>theyll be able to manage both through the same interface on one device eMarketer also has another eyecatching prediction by Instagram could overtake the mobile display ad revenues of Google and Twitter NYSE TWTR in the US Instagram has less of a following overseas but I am confident there still is a lot of open territory just within the US market for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to add to its dominance in the online ad market In the earnings call COO Sheryl Sandberg said the company would be opening up Instagram to more advertisers but she emphasized <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would be thoughtful and strategic about how Instagram revenue is ramped up Throwing a whole bunch of ads onto mobile phone screens will quickly put users off Matching video ads to user data analytics like in Facebooks NewsFeed would be more effective The expanding use of video is key to bringing in and keeping users within the companys ecosystem I am bullish on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock rallying back up to a share Then when the first indications of the revenues Instagram can deliver start to come in this quarter that would be a catalyst to push through and beyond Source Facebooks Instagram Gets The Green Light To Show Ads And Buy Buttons Disclosure Iwe have
