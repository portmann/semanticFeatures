style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>family of apps is growing and currently controls about one out of every five minutes spent on a mobile device <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>video is growing with million hours of video being watched every day Do you live in the US or Canada and have an active <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB account If you answered yes then congratulations because you contribute over a year to Facebooks revenue As of writing this <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trading for a share Lets go through the fundamentals and see what this company is really worth The Global Online Advertising Industry <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>competes in the hypercompetitive online advertising industry Global online advertising revenue is expected to increase at an annual rate of through and will exceed TV becoming the largest ad revenue category in Mobile ad growth will soon overtake desktop ads as the leading online advertising segment Below Ive listed the six essential fundamentals we need to check before we can get into the model Price <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>currently trades for a share Shares Outstanding There are currently billion shares outstanding Market Capitalization By multiplying the price and number of shares outstanding together we can calculate the market cap to be billion Cash From Facebooks K we find that they have and billion in cash and marketable securities respectively We add marketable securities to cash because they are liquid enough to be considered cash Debt <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>currently has no debt but keep in mind the fact that they have three years left on a billion line of credit that they may begin using at any time Enterprise Value By subtracting net cash cashdebt from Facebooks market cap we get its enterprise value of billion Enterprise value is often a very underused metric which is a shame because it can tell us a lot about a company and how its management operates A company that has an enterprise value higher than its market cap is highly leveraged Facebooks enterprise value is lower than its market cap which means it is a cash rich business Its EVshare is which means that for every share you buy you are spending on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Business and on cash <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has Now that weve quickly run through a few quick fundamentals to get a feel for the business lets go through the financial statements and the model Ive built for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>As you can see from the photo above Facebooks monthly average users have been steadily increasing on a quarterly basis with the AsiaPacific and Rest of World categories leading Our model forecasts MAU growth to continue into at a conservative and slightly decreasing pace Ad revenue per user has been rapidly growing on a quarterly basis with the US and Canada being the most efficiently monetized group If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is able to increase monetization in all other geographies to the US and Canada level revenue would almost quadruple Our model forecasts average revenue per user growth in the US Canada and Europe to gradually begin slowing while AsiaPacific and Rest of World growth rates remain stronger for slightly longer before they begin slowing Payment and other fees have been steadily declining on a per user basis as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>games are being rapidly replaced by independent mobile games Our model forecasts payment and fee revenue to continue to decline Average revenue per user has been growing and is expected to continue doing so into the future As the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>family of apps continues to grow advertising revenue growth will easily offset the shrinking payment and fee revenue Our model forecasts ARPU to grow into the future with US and Canadian growth slowing slightly while all other geographies experience greater monetization growth <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a large gross margin of which is typical of most software companies Operating margins are only around due to the large amount of spending that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>commits to RD Net margins are only around because of Facebooks tax rate Its interesting to note that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>pays its full tax rate instead of using loopholes to lower it like most other major corporations Our model forecasts gross margins to decline slightly as virtual reality products will likely have lower margins than software Gross and net margins are forecasted to remain relatively steady as RD will continue to be a large expense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>going forward and assuming that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will continue to pay a tax rate Above is the complete model forecast for Facebooks income Our model forecasts the total number of users in to be billion which is just shy of Zuckerbergs prediction of billion The terminal growth after has been forecasted to be to be conservative and because I believe its flawed to assume a company will continue to grow forever The discount rate is to reflect the risks associated with Facebooks business model While Im confident in the model there are still several risks to consider when it comes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Loss of users or failure to retain users could put a substantial strain on Facebooks revenue Loss of advertisers or a decrease in spending on online advertising could harm business In conclusion I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trading at a discount to its current price At this price point I would still rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a buy because I believe it has the ability to continue growing users and advertising revenue in the near future I have uploaded the model here so you may edit it if you
