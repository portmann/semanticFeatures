class='textDiv'>PayPal Vicious Headwind Valuation And Venmo PayPal Holdings Inc NASDAQPYPL Seeking Alpha With its recent runup PayPals valuation has become stretched Going forward Apple Pay could be a headwind for PayPal Venmos growth has been incredible and the Pay with Venmo button is a natural fit for Facebooks platform One of the reasons why I enjoy writing for Seeking Alpha is that I can share my young perspective to an interested audience I think and hope my young perspective is of value to older investors and perhaps sheds light on overlooked or misunderstood aspects of companies PayPal NASDAQ PYPL is a company I think I can share a good deal of insight and opinion about If you saw PayPals Super Bowl advertisement you know that the company is targeting millenials such as myself I like PayPal from the perspective of both a user and investor I wrote about PayPal in a previous article but I feel the need to write another because the stock hasnt moved much since my last publication but some of the fundamentals have There is a new headwind that has surfaced since the publication of my piece but I think the narrative remains the same you should be a longterm holder of PayPal A relatively new headwind for PayPal comes from Apple NASDAQ AAPL which said that they plan on launching Apple Pay on mobile sites via their Safari browser This poses a threat to PayPal because the online payments company handled billion worth of mobile transactions in roughly onefourth of the companys total volume Its true that PayPals Braintree processes some inapp Apple Pay purchases but PayPals profit margin is higher when it processes payments from PayPal accounts The other side of the coin is that if PayPal can keep mobile volume strong in the wake of Apple Pay it shows the strength and stickiness of its product In other words if Apple cant create an alternative to PayPal one I might add that already comes with the users phone then who can disrupt the space Though Paypal is expected to grow earnings by and in and respectively the se based company trades at a steep times earnings For perspective MasterCard NYSE MA and Visa NYSE V trade at and times earnings respectively At times PayPal fetches a valuation close to that of its alltime richest signaling that potential upside could be limited A premium valuation also means that investors are paying for promise and execution by management Though PayPals management delivered strong numbers in the previous quarter it may be tough for them to keep investors happy going forward because the expectations are so high PayPals fastest growing services is Venmo In my eyes its potential is enormous For those unfamiliar with Venmo consider it a digital wallet with a social component It replaces traditional payment methods cash check and credit cards with simple paperless digital payments It is designed to make it easy for users to share payments with friends and people in close geographical proximity Venmo makes it easy to pay for things like cabs the rent or dinner A few taps replace searching for spare change or writing a check Not surprisingly the service is very popular among college students Since PayPal acquired Braintree then the owner of Venmo it has been looking for a way to monetize the digital wallet service This solution did not come until recently when Venmo announced they will offer merchants the ability to include a Pay with Venmo button for payments This button gives businesses the ability to offer customers an easy form of payment and Venmo takes a cut of the transaction The Pay with Venmo button is doubly good for Venmo because it gives users another reason to stick with the service Many merchants have already opted for the Pay with PayPal button so their adoption of a Pay with Venmo button is likely Plus the demand is there According to a survey from Techco of Venmo users said that they would use the Pay with Venmo option Companies such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Snapchat Private CHAT have tried to implement payment services similar to Venmo <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>implemented a feature into Messenger that allows users to link a card with their profile and send money to friends via a message Snapchat has a service called Snapcash which operates in a similar manner On paper these services sound like noteworthy competitors to Venmo However in reality these services havent taken off Meanwhile Venmo has been growing at unearthly clips The company processed a record billion in January more than times more volume than January of and better than times more volume than January of This sparks the question Why havent <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Snapchat been able to popularize their payment services As Venmos growth shows there is a large demand for social payment services so what gives In my opinion the reason is that people simply dont associate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Snapchat with transferring money and why should they Also trust has not been developed between the user and these social media companies so they are hesitant about using them to transfer funds to friends I attribute much of PayPals and Venmos success to their ability to build trust with their users I cited PayPals mission statement in my first article about the company and Ill quote it again here because it is so integral to their success The companys mission statement has been the same since its inception and its a leading reason why consumers trust the service so much In the company wrote Breaches of our customers privacy and our security measures could diminish severely consumer confidence in and use of our product Therefore PayPal is committed to ensuring the safety of its product for all customers and for years down the road The trust factor is the leading reason why payment processing from social media companies does not pose a large threat to PayPal But while there is not much potential for payment processing from social media companies I believe there is a place for payment processing on social media platforms In my previous article I told a personal anecdote about my experience selling shoes with the help of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>groups I recommended that readers listen to what CEO Mark Zuckerberg had to say about these groups saying that his remarks could be good for PayPal On Facebooks Q conference call Mr Zuckerberg said that for the first time more than billion people used <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>groups in a single month More than million small business now use pages on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and these pages generate more than billion comments per month <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has integrated a marketplace feature that allows users to see the price of products but in order to purchase them they need to send money via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or use a service like PayPal Now imagine if users could purchase items right from their timeline via a Pay with PayPal or Pay with Venmo button Such a feature would be a huge convenience for customers and would fill the void of trust between the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>user and the payment processing platform With its recent runup in price PayPals valuation has advanced to a level higher than the valuations of both Visa and MasterCard This heightened valuation comes at a time in which many believe that Apple Pay will begin to pose a large threat to PayPal so this headwind will need to be monitored over the coming quarters If Apple Pay cant compete with PayPal though then I dont think any product can Moreover Venmo has shown great growth and has great potential going forward The main reason for Venmos success is its ability to build trust with users This is the component lacking from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Snapchats alternatives to Venmo which is why they dont pose a large threat to the service in the long run Lastly it will be hard for Venmo to keep growing at its current clip unless it can integrate its Pay with Venmo feature into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>It may seem farfetched to speculate such an integration but it could be a key driver of growth for Venmo going forward If it happens I think the skys the limit I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock
