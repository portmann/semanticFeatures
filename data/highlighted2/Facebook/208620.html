<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is making significant moves to integrate video in its platform Video views and content uploaded on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are growing rapidly Compared to YouTube <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offers advertisers and content creators broader reach potential for their videos via network effects Watching videos online has in recent years become almost synonymous with going on YouTube While such a degree of market domination would probably justify a hint of a sense of security for most companies most companies arent witnessing the biggest social media platform in the world planning to devour a large piece of their pie <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB recently announced that it would begin testing A dedicated place on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for people to go when they exclusively want to watch video whether thats videos theyve saved for later or videos from friends Pages they follow and other video publishers on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>This new videos section helps people discover watch and share videos on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>that are relevant to them It can be accessed by tapping a Videos icon at the bottom of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>app on iPhone or in the Favorites section on the lefthand side of News Feed on the web While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still far from challenging Googles NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL YouTube when it comes to watching videos the growth of its daily video views is nonetheless impressive climbing from to billion within a quarter Needless to say that the market in stake is constantly growing According to a recent worldwide study by Millward Brown people aged between and that have both a TV and a smartphonetablet spend equal time watching videos on the two mediums If we narrow the segment down to the socalled Milennials digital video is already the number choice So what other moves is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>making to make their user experience more videofriendly Two new features particularly stand out While they may not seem like the most groundbreaking changes in the world most <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users can easily understand how important they are One of the key characteristics of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>experience is the scrolling down of the newsfeed It is quite often the case however that you dont have time to read the X interestinglooking article or the Y funnylooking video you will stumble upon in that journey While the Save feature which debuted last year was meant to address this issue it didnt catch on as much as was hoped Since last summer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been testing a more prominent Watch Later feature in a more direct attempt to boost video viewing From the look of it it will be integrated within the aforementioned space dedicated to video The second change is also related to the scrolling down nature of the platform While going down your newsfeed you may want to play a video but hesitate if it means you will have to stop your scrolling Well problem solved or at least it will soon be solved since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is testing a feature that will allow you to watch a video in a floating window while continuing your browsing Both these features it should be noted already exist on YouTube Another long overdue move was announced a few months ago as well namely the beginning of adrevenue sharing with content creators This generates a massive incentive for unique content creation although it remains to be seen how exactly it will play out given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does not at the moment offer the traditional type of preroll ads YouTube does Speaking of content YouTube has more reasons to worry Although <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was always the main pipeline for video sharing the actual videos being shared were up until recently mainly YouTube videos This trend is shifting drastically According to Richard Windsor an analyst at Edison Investment Research <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offers advertisers and content creators a type of value that YouTube lacks It serves videos to users instead of relying on users discovering them If you want to search for a specific video there is no doubt that YouTube is and will at least for the nearby future be the place to be But allowing your video to gain a foothold in users newsfeeds holds the potential for much broader reach This connects partly to the fact that user interaction with videos via <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is much more common People are much more accustomed to liking content and commenting on it on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>when compared to YouTube And the network effects that can be generated eg a video a friend liked appears on your newsfeed is exponentially larger In conclusion while it might appear that YouTubes position as leader in the digital video market is unchallengeable <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>possesses the assets required to grab a big part of its pie While it is still too soon to make specific predictions there are good reasons to expect that it will acquire a significant market share in the coming years further leveraging its uniquely strong
