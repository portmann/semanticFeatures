class='textDiv'>WhatsApp Facebooks Next Platinum Mine <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha The WhatsApp acquisition was a significant milestone for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>because of its fastgrowing mobile user base Now however the companys sights are on WhatsApps ability to be monetized the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has spent nearly billion on two acquisitions and brought two major social media applications into its fold I think the time has come for the company to start capitalizing on those pillars The WhatsApp buy was a huge move as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shelled out an enormous billion to buy the messaging app that boasted million users and million in revenues The pricetosale of WhatsApp was but the transaction was never meant to be based on the monetization aspect of the thenfiveyearold WhatsApp business rather it was based on the number of users its growth rate and more importantly the ability to connect to a huge user base via mobile After reaching the milestone of one billion users recently WhatsApp broke the news that it will be doing away with the cent subscription fee it was charging its users after one year of free usage Were happy to announce that WhatsApp will no longer charge subscription fees For many years weve asked some people to pay a fee for using WhatsApp after their first year As weve grown weve found that this approach hasnt worked well Many WhatsApp users dont have a debit or credit card number and they worried theyd lose access to their friends and family after their first year So over the next several weeks well remove fees from the different versions of our app and WhatsApp will no longer charge you for our service Naturally people might wonder how we plan to keep WhatsApp running without subscription fees and if todays announcement means were introducing thirdparty ads The answer is no Starting this year we will test tools that allow you to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that you want to hear from That could mean communicating with your bank about whether a recent transaction was fraudulent or with an airline about a delayed flight If it is not going to let businesses advertise then how is it planning to monetize its platforms The only way possible is to charge businesses for access to thousands or possibly millions of users How effective this will be remains to be seen For example why would a company pay a premium to be able to talk to its customers on WhatsApp Is chat and telephony integration really worth that much to a company when other options are already available like wellintegrated Customer Relationship Management systems Is WhatsApp positioning itself to be another CRM tool in which case the competition is stiff and entry is prohibitive to a great extent My previous article on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was about how the company was nearing a plateau in growth in core markets that are its most profitable ones Thats exactly why I believe its valuation is unjustified at this point And thats also the exact reason why WhatsApp needs to have a solid strategy to make money that will ultimately go into FBs bottom line Essentially what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has is not millions of users on a new application but the application itself WhatsApp is pure mobile which means it is designed to be used for mobile phones and devices Think about that for a minute Companies spend tens of thousands of dollars developing mobile applications because of what Because they want to connect with their customers and prospects in new ways They want more engagement and more sales to put it simply Enter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which can now offer companies a way to get their hands on potentially millions of prospects on an existing mobile application with over a billion users Theres tremendous value in that Granted FB may not go with native advertising for this platform because that model has failed before but this is what I think its going for WhatsApp users are given the option to connect with businesses of their choice and receive custom alerts and notifications about specific offers products and so on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>then charges businesses a peruser fee as long as that user is connected to that business through WhatsApp In essence it would be like a costperclick arrangement except that in this case the click is a user being connected to a business The difference here is that this model is personalized nonintrusive and completely under the control of the user unlike most thirdparty ad platforms In fact if integrated with a payment system it could be a viable entry for FB into the highly competitive but hugely lucrative ecommerce marketplace domain <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>licenses an Enterprise version of WhatsApp for businesses to connect with prospects who are already in the network Similar to the first scenario but here the business has more control over who it connects with Essentially it would be like a SaaS model where the business pays a monthly fee for access to the application It can advertise on other platforms even <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in which case thats more revenue for FB for people to join its WhatsApp group Like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>groups this would be an alternate platform of communication where it operates like a chatphone service for customers and prospects to quickly connect with a company representative Despite what it has said about not getting into thirdparty advertising on WhatsApp the fact remains that people using WhatsApp are highly reliant on it for a lot of their group communication In exchange for a little bit of real estate space on users mobile screens FB can attract premium businesses to advertise using ads that are relevant to the demographic of that group or user Another supporting fact for this premise is that FBs monetizing expertise falls squarely in this domain This is from a report on VentureBeat Jan Koum says the company will experiment with the monetization opportunities to be found connecting companies with their customers While he admitted WhatsApp hasnt really settled on the final plan yet and has yet to write a single line of code for the new project it seems that the company is interested in helping big businesses use WhatsApp to conduct customer service and perhaps even transactions with consumers In short WhatsApp will be launching accounts specifically for businesses The bottom line here is exactly that the bottom line of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>With user growth plateauing in its most profitable core markets ad revenue is going to follow very soon Once its top line starts getting hit the company is going to want to supplement it one way or another and thats where acquisitions like WhatsApp play a major role In the online space companies pay to advertise to new audiences not the same ones over and over again although there is a lucrative remarketing segment that thrives on this For example if you were an advertiser selling a cosmetic product youd have a filter on your <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ads that allowed you to target people who either buy cosmetics or were in a demographic that typically does You may have a potential reach of million users for example but what happens after you run through that million and get all the sales conversions you can from that group If you dont have the option of acquiring a new audience youre going to be looking for a different advertising channel and WhatsApp could become that channel for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>advertisers that are constantly hungry for new audiences to reach out to And this is exactly why the future of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is dependent on the number of new user platforms it can offer to its customers which are other businesses More about this in my recent article called <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Has A Problem Remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is NOT a BC business to consumer company no matter which way you look at it It is essentially a BB business to business operation that offers businesses the opportunity to reach out to potential customers Consumers dont pay <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to stay in business and thats one of the problems with the free platform model user count can get as high as FBs but thats not where the money is coming from consumers are merely the conduit through which revenue is generated Its the same with any social media app that is free for the user The moment WhatsApp pulled out its user fee it became just another free app Admittedly that free app has over a billion users but the money still has to come from other businesses via ad revenues licensing or user fees The scenarios I have laid out above are the likely roads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will take simply because it has little else to choose from Im curious to see what route itll take with WhatsApp but one thing is amply clear The company cannot allow it to be left unmonetized indefinitely <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>needs a growth driver to supplement its ad revenues and WhatsApp with its billion users is the logical choice The management team at FB has already proven that it can monetize a social media application where the majority of the competition has tried and failed It has the expertise for sure and now its time to roll up its sleeves and make sure that Facebooks lofty valuation has the additional support it sorely needs If this article did something for you please follow me for more incisive pieces on companies that provide valuable products and services to consumers around the world Disclosure Iwe have no
