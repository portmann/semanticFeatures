<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>routinely suppressed conservative news on its news feed a training manual was leaked that confirmed there was only one of ten trusted news sources by which trending news topics could come from with any type of conservative angle In the wake of those bad public relations events the company clumsily tried to save face <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>subsequently denied any wrongdoing but still introduced several changes in its policies put another way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>denied anticonservative bias but changed policies that produce anticonservative bias After all of the aforementioned events one would assume that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would lay low and let all of this fade with time but one would be wrong Sheryl Sandberg Facebooks chief operating officer recently announced that the company would be introducing a political bias training program in addition to the managing unconscious bias class the company offers employees We have a managing bias class that all of our leaders and a lot of our employees have taken that I was part of helping to create And we focused on racial bias age bias gender bias national bias and were going to add in a scenario now on political bias So as we think about helping people understand different political points of view and being open to different points of view were dealing with political bias as well going forward Sandberg said As the Daily Signal reports Sandberg acknowledged that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and other tech companies are perceived as being liberal Thats a pretty important accusation and its one we take seriously Its also one which frankly rang true to some people because there is a concern that Silicon Valley companies have a liberal bias And so we took it very seriously and did a thorough investigation and we didnt find a liberal bias So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has investigated itself found absolutely no liberal bias and then changed its policies and added a political bias training program to make sure there is no liberal bias that sounds an awful lot like fixing something that isnt broken unless of course the company knows full well that it has a liberal bias and is trying to hide it but that would be thinking way too outside the box of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>employee contributions in have supported Democrats and those employees have donated more than to Hillary Clinton nearly more than to the closest Republican Marco Rubio Nope no chance of political bias within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>based on those numbers move along Sandberg dismissed the notion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wanted to be a media company to begin with Were clear about the industry were in and the company were in Were a tech company were not a media company Were not trying to hire journalists and were not trying to write news Yes a tech company except when news curators are hired to create the news feed in which of the adults who use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>identify it as a primary news source Other than that probably just a tech company with no political bias santafe Manthong Jun PM <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a JOKE and a FAD Will soon go the way of

and not one of them is self critical enough to recognize that they are the problem To me its a distinction without a difference fascists communists both spring from Marxism A fascist may have more appreciation for property rights than a commie but at the end of the day they both want to use the force of the state to rule the beliefs speech actions of everyone else We are socialists we are enemies of todays capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak with its unfair salaries with its unseemly evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property
