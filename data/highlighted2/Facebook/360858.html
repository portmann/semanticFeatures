<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>FB TWTR Includes CHAT NYT This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech column looks at new features unveiled for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live streaming platform along with a report media firms are being paid to join Remarks from Mark Zuckerberg indicate he has made live streaming a company priority and expects usage to soar Twitters Periscope live streaming platform still has a large early lead However Facebooks aggressive efforts and the size of its base will help it gain ground Back in Bill Gates reportedly spent a night browsing the Internet or what passed for it back then and had a eureka moment realizing this thing that let virtually anyone retrieve messages and content pages on demand from servers thousands of miles away will be huge Whats known for sure is that Gates sent a lengthy memo to Microsoft employees on May declaring the Internet to be a company priority and outlining a series of steps he wants Microsoft to take to embrace it Taking in Facebooks NASDAQ FB latest set of live video product launches management remarks and media reports I cant help but wonder if Mark Zuckerberg had a similar eureka moment while browsing videos on Twitters NYSE TWTR Periscope live streaming platform Zuck was reported in February to be obsessed with live streaming and to have told Facebooks video product and engineering teams the companys Live streaming service is now their top priority After today its hard to question that report Live was originally made available to public figures last summer and was recently expanded to all US iOS and Android users Now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is Adding support for Facebooks recentlylaunched reactions buttonsemojis as well as for Instagramlike video filters and the ability to replay comments made during live streams <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>says people comment more than x as much on live videos than they do on regular videos Providing tools for discovering live video including a global map of where videos are being broadcast and giving users the option to invite friends to watch with them New filters and a pending drawing tool Also a video tab now exists on the main menu bar for Facebooks apps Tapping on the tab takes users to a video hub page that contains both live and recorded video Meanwhile Recode reports <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is paying the likes of the New York Times NYSE NYT BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post to stream live video on its platform The site previously reported <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is willing to pay celebrities to use Live A <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>exec admits the company is providing a financial incentive to some Live partners The report follows one from Bloomberg stating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ended its bid to stream Thursday night NFL games partly because it wants live videos to be adfree presumably to create a better user experience and keep users engaging with a live stream The NFL announced a deal with Twitter yesterday As with many prior services and some current ones <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is taking a goitslow approach to monetization looking to hook users on the service and optimize the experience they get before finding ways to create revenue Also Zuckerberg and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>product chief Chris Cox sat down with BuzzFeed to discuss Facebooks live streaming efforts and future plans The money quote from Zuck The big decision we made was to shift a lot of our video efforts to focus on Live because it is this emerging new format not the kind of videos that have been online for the past five or ten years He also declares it wouldnt be surprising if you fastforward five years and most of the content that people see on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and are sharing on a daytoday basis is video BuzzFeed states Live became Facebooks monomania over the last two months as the company aggressively pitched engineers to join the project and scrambled to add many of the features announced today The site also notes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>worked hard to have live streams load quickly and run with little lag time and that a lot of the recent changes made to Live seem designed to enhance that sensation that youre not seeing something scripted or performative In spite of Facebooks efforts Twitter and Periscope still have a lot going for them not the least of which is Periscopes headstart Periscope recently disclosed it streamed over million broadcasts through its iOS and Android apps in its first year of availability and that years worth of live video are watched on its platform each day And the latter figure doesnt count broadcasts seen on Twitter which recently integrate Periscope live streams or on the web or via replays In addition Twitters status as a goto medium for following and seeing the world react to events in realtime works in Periscopes favor If you were looking to see the immediate reactions of dozens of celebrities and media personalities to the ending of Monday nights NCAA title game you probably went on Twitter to do it not <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has some big advantages as well with the largest arguably being its scale The company had B monthly active users at the end of or nearly x Twitters M Moreover its easier to get a large audience for a live stream if users are constantly logged in or checking in to a service And all signs suggest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a big edge on Twitter in monthly usage per active user Theres also a chance for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to target different use cases than Periscope While Periscopes live streams much like Twitters content have often been publicfacing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can in addition to enabling public streams pitch itself as a way to share live video of events in your life with family and friends That would fit well with what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is used so often for today and could over the long run be a big opportunity in its own right And if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is nervous about Snapchats Private CHAT growth as writerVC Om Malik argues a platform for quickly sharing live videos with friends could be a potent weapon Ultimately live video might not be a winnertakesall game any more than recorded online video or photosharing have been to date But Facebooks big investments in Live its giant user base and its aggressive efforts to recruit celebrities and media partners should help it steal some of Periscopes thunder and create another big service for the worlds most ubiquitous social networking platform
