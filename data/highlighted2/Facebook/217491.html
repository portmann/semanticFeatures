class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Is A Buy Going Into Earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha There are still numerous upside catalysts despite the high likelihood of decelerating MAU growth With the potential launch of dynamic product ads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stands to make an additional amount of money from a better ecommerce experience on its platform Furthermore the company is also releasing a new integrated advertising system that works in conjunction with TV ads and it seems particularly effective with older demographics I anticipate the stock will move higher despite it being an investment year and EPS surprises being limited to single digits Going into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB earnings its important to understand that the company isnt going to generate as much acceleration in terms of MAU growth but thats to be expected and is already priced into the stock Whats really important though is the companys growth in some of its smaller segments and the ongoing monetization of user activity on the core webmobile platform Im anticipating sales and earnings to come roughly in line or slightly above consensus estimates In the past couple quarters <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>reported a to surprise on earnings and the company continues to be in an investment phase for the duration of the current fiscal year That doesnt make it an unattractive stock to own because it still seems slightly undervalued from the context of its growth potential And there is potential upside assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is able to launch in China and grows the user bases of Instagram and WhatsApp over the next couple quarters However the real thing to watch for is the new products that were released to marketers There are new product ads more particularly referred to as Canvas which allow users to experience more of a native shopping experience within the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>mobile app More specifically the user is able to browse an advertisers product storefront within the app after clicking on the advertisement Whats particularly interesting about this is that the new ads could potentially impact the average revenue per user figure more substantially going forward After all its easier to move down the sales funnel if you make the ecommerce experience more readily available Of course its not exactly clear whether the product will be released to programmatic buyers and its limited to testing right now Its been a couple months since the original announcement of the product so there may be more meaningful uptake going forward assuming the product is ready for launch by Q However recent indications show that a Q launch is at least feasible Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank mentions recently in a report released to clients Dynamic Product Ads which has been in beta this year is ready to go for retailers Each company can upload their entire SKU database and dynamically retarget users with ads in the NF database normalization based on what products the user is potentially inmarket for Weve heard that most retailers are wired up with DPA dynamic product ads ahead of Q and that this could be a needle mover for Q The company also released various other products to help entice advertisers especially ones that are focused on integrated advertising campaigns across both the web and television The company recently formed a partnership with Nielsens digital ad ratings division Whats interesting about this is that the reach from an integrated advertising campaign that shares audience metrics between both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Nielsen data results in a increase in targeted reach according to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The company will be using a target rating point system which is comparable to the gross rating point system implemented by TV advertisers The data on TRP and GRP is shared between Nielson and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>so that the two companies can accurately figure out the audience demographic for advertisers and price the ad units appropriately This improvement in efficiency in an integrated advertising campaign is likely to lead to higher engagement at the top of a sales funnel and furthermore improve the overall clickthrough potential of ads especially among GenY users Of course <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has high penetration into the GenY demographic which is why this specific improvement in adfunctionality could result in a meaningful improvement in average clickthroughrates which correspondingly improves the average revenue per user on the websitemobile app The stock has been particularly responsive to these various developments pertaining to ads and I think it will eventually trade at by the end of the year Of course I started by mentioning that the company is likely to surprise analysts expectations marginally however if the company is able to demonstrate that these new ad formats have resulted in higher engagement its likely that the stock will respond positively following the announcement of earnings next Wednesday Therefore I think the stock is worth buying especially considering the broader stability in equity prices and various company specific fundamentals which Ill get into much more detail in
