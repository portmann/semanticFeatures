class='textDiv'>Why Ive Been Wrong On Twitter Twitter Inc NYSETWTR Seeking Alpha Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article My macro analysis tells me to sell highbeta tech I was right about the popularity of Periscope but I was wrong about its effect on Twitters stock I was wrong about Twitter reaccelerating growth Moments hasnt worked because it doesnt incorporate Scopes The best explanation of my investment in Twitter NYSE TWTR is my macro view has bailed out my mistaken companyspecific analysis My article on the imminent recession was one of my most important articles I have ever written because it summarizes the best arguments for why the stock market is about to crash My macro view leads me to be bearish on most stocks which is why I have been focusing on short ideas instead of long ideas in the past few weeks The stocks that have the potential to do especially badly are highbeta tech stocks which is why I am bearish on the FANG stocks I explained my decision to sell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB last week now I will go over my thoughts on Twitter The reason why I have gone over my macro framework is because even if I was right about Twitter or become right over the next few months as it reaccelerates user growth it may not matter Proof of this reasoning was when Fidelity devalued Snapchat Private CHAT by Snapchat has had nothing but success in but it has had its valuation compressed because it had gotten out of hand Even after the haircut the billion market cap implies a valuation of times revenues Profits start to get scrutinized much more closely in a recession than at the end of the bull cycle We hadnt seen the decline in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>until recently because money managers have been piling into the FANG stocks which were the last stocks to work in the mature stages of this bull market I sold Twitter at because even if Im right about user growth Im going to be wrong about the stock Twitter is a highbeta tech stock so it must be avoided While I am satisfied with my recession call thus far it doesnt absolve my mistake in owning Twitter stock which has counteracted my gains in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>In this article I go over my thoughts on why I have been wrong Twitter in order to avoid making similar mistakes in the future I am going to melt this down into three points one of which I was right about and two of which I was wrong about The point I was right about was the popularity of Periscope I started writing about Periscope before it was released on the App Store Recently it hit million total Scopes But this article isnt about this topic because the points I have gotten wrong override that point and have caused me to lose money Periscope Has Not Helped Twitter Stock The first incorrect point I made is that Periscope would help Twitter stock go up Its clear that Twitters stock has gone down as Periscope has increased in popularity There are a few reasons for this First Periscope is difficult to value Investors in Twitter have already seen the popularity of Vine wane so giving Twitter the benefit of the doubt on this new app isnt rational Most investors who have tried Periscope probably liked it However the rationale could be that they also enjoy using Twitter and if Twitter couldnt become profitable with its own application which has over million users how will it monetize Periscope <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is given the benefit of the doubt with WhatsApp and Instagram because it has already successfully monetized its main platform Periscopes monetization is not obvious and Twitter has laid out no plans to do so Personally I think monetizing Periscope this early would be a mistake but other investors may not see it in this perspective I viewed my investment in Periscope through Twitter stock as I would if I were investing in a private earlystage company This was a mistake Public investors dont view investments in the same way as private investors as they are more oriented toward shortterm events and immediate profitability Even an established firm like Apple NASDAQ AAPL will see its stock fall if it misses estimates If Twitter had been firing on all cylinders then Periscope may have added it its momentum but it will never be the stocks savior in the immediate term I was too early to get excited about Periscope even though I still believe the app will become as popular among teens as Snapchat is in a few years I made the point numerous times that I believed Periscope could be a bigger opportunity than Twitter itself While bulls like myself may have viewed this transition through rosecolored glasses investors dont see it this way A comparison to this would be if Apple tried to cover up declining iPhone sales growth with the release of a car The car may be successful but a change in the firms business model would be viewed as risky If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had declining DAUMAU its stock would be hit even though Instagram may be able to gain back the lost users Twitters Growth Has Not ReAccelerated The second error I made was the belief in Twitters revival I was definitely biased toward believing Twitter would reinvigorate its user growth because of my enthusiasm about Periscope It would be wrong to say its impossible to see a turnaround but investors deal with the likelihood of events occurring Right now the chances of Twitter ever hitting one billion users is much lower than it was months ago The stocks performance doesnt help users become optimistic about the app Its not as if they check it everyday but hearing the stock hit its alltime lows doesnt help Its difficult to understand how possible changes would help or hurt a social network because there isnt much historical precedent I think most <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users have noticed that whenever it makes major changes users tend to complain about them but continue spending time on the app In this case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was trying to improve the performance for its users Whether or not they liked the measures is up for debate because sometimes angry users are louder than the satisfied ones What is not up for debate is Facebooks motivation to satisfy current users As I have mentioned in previous articles Periscope appears to be in a similar situation as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>When Periscopes cofounder and CEO Kayvon Beykpour talks to users he appears to be on the same page as them as he is working on features they are asking for This is not the case for Twitter Twitter is not trying to satisfy its current users It is trying to satisfy users who have used the app in the past and then deleted it This reminds me of how the NHL attempts to grow its viewership by increasing the amount of goals scored through trying gimmicks like shrinking goalie pads or increasing the size of the nets In doing so the NHL has not reached the size of the NFL and marginalized diehard fans Any growth it has seen is because of the excitement of the game not silly gimmicks Twitter should focus more on power users instead of those who already deleted the app If Twitter was able to grow the amount of time current users spent on the app even while total users stagnated the stock would have life Changes such as Moments character tweets and a timeline based on an algorithm instead of the current reversechronological timeline have been met with complaints from users Twitter doesnt care about its current users and is instead focused on future users Social apps grow based on satisfying their current users Maybe Jack Dorsey should apologize to users like he did to app developers and as a reward to users allow for the ability to edit tweets like thousands of users have been begging for for months Lets quickly go over these three changes Moments hasnt moved the needle as much as I thought it would The reason why I was wrong is because I was biased Going into the product launch I figured Periscope streams would be included in Moments at the onset When they werent included I should have changed my opinion Because I was already bullish on the initiative I was less likely to change my mind Without Periscope Moments isnt a differentiated experience If there werent enough Periscopes to fill Moments with content Twitter could have pushed for quicker growth Instead of paying people to sift through the best of Twitter it could have paid a few reporters to scope major events such as the Golden Globes Surely it would cost much less money to hire temporary reporters than it costs to have employees find the most popular tweets By the way since these tweets are already popular what is the point of highlighting them They are already highlighted by the inherent definition of what popularity is Periscopes should be the main content in Moments Before I go over the other two proposed changes let me mention the new initiative to have Periscopes autoplay in the timeline This is a great move that should boost viewers on Periscope and provide unique content to Twitter The only unique videos to Twitter previously were Vines which have a sixsecond lifespan This implies limited potential retention Twitter needs to do more to support Periscope Periscope should be highlighted in trending topics and Moments Currently the only way for a replay scope to go viral is to have Periscope highlight it as featured content The reason Vine became so popular is the ability for videos to go viral The higher the potential for virility the more effort users will put into their scopes Character Tweets Still Have Potential Even though there has been much blowback about the character tweets and I just mentioned that Twitter should focus on its current users I still think it should go through with the initiative character tweets could create more original content on the app It could make Twitter the YouTube of articles as users generate content and get paid through ad impressions This concept is somewhere between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>articles and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Instant Articles What I mean by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>articles is the ability to post an article instead of a status update There isnt much of a point to this since statuses can be any length <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Instant articles bring publishers content behind Facebooks gate and load quicker Since the product hasnt been announced yet we arent sure if this will be like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Instant Articles and Apple News or more focused on usergenerated content Both would keep users behind Twitters gate instead of pushing them to other websites The complaint that Twitter would change from its core message doesnt hold water because these tweets would only link to the longer pieces Some are arguing that we already have Medium for longer posts This is like saying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shouldnt have allowed native video because we already have YouTube As you can see from the chart below Twitter becoming like Medium wouldnt be a bad idea because of the growth the website has seen If Twitter accepted longform articles it would wipe out other blog sites because it has superior traffic and most journalists and amateur writers already have Twitter accounts With regards to the algorithm I think the firm should hold off on this change until it sees how successful word tweets are This is a change from my previous opinion but I have to change my stance because it seems changing the platform entirely is enraging existing users more than it is bringing on new users Although I have been wrong on the stock I still have to make a decision on what to do with it My macro opinion tells me to avoid all highbeta tech stocks There are only a few stocks to like in this market namely utilities and other defensive stocks such as Reynolds American NYSE RAI General Mills NYSE GIS and Colgate NYSE CL I will reevaluate my analysis after the recession I will still do articles on Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>from a neutral perspective but I wont consider buying either until the macro environment improves I will leave you with a chart from Hedgeye which shows SPX margins and corporate profits as a percentage of GDP As you can see a peak in this metric signaled the past two recessions It has now peaked which would signal another recession if this metric maintains its accuracy All of the metrics I mentioned in my article calling for a recession are worse than they were a few weeks ago Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
