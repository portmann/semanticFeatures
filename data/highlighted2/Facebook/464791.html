portfolio As we go higher and higher the risks grow and you need to know not just the rewards but what can go wrong after this historic run said Cramer To explain the concept he gave the example of Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN as these three stocks are varied and they offer different means of valuation Microsoft reported a strong quarter on Tuesday and is transforming itself from a legacy PC business to a cloud focused business which has seen growth It has over B in cash and trades at times next years earnings and times earnings It is cheaper than the average stock in the SP and it yields In an era where there are precious few ways to get decent income Microsoft after this incredible quarter represents a very strong opportunity added Cramer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>hit an alltime high when it confirmed that its Messenger app hit B users which mean that it added M users this year The stock is expensive as it trades at times earnings but it also offers growth rate which is accelerating Growth stocks tend to trade between times their growth rate and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trading at times its rate which makes it cheaper than other growth stocks I pronounce <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as being relatively inexpensive versus a ton of other growth stocks in this market suitable for those individuals willing to take on some risk in order to get a lot more reward than stocks like Microsoft can offer said Cramer Lastly there is Amazon which doesnt play by the rules It cannot be valued traditionally as it trades at times earnings This is a different growth company compared to all others and it is for investors who are willing to take on risk You really have to believe that it will do the same thing to every other retail category that it has already done to books and electronics and apparel You have to believe Amazon will destroy the mall said Cramer Lots of things have to go right for the stock to continue climbing Cramer continued reviewing stocks that play the pet care theme This theme is here to stay a fabulous place to invest on any scare whether it be from the Fed or overseas or certainly from the madness of the upcoming presidential election he said He reviewed Blue Buffalo Pet Products NASDAQ BUFF Freshpet NASDAQ FRPT JM Smucker NYSE SJM Henry Schein NASDAQ HSIC and Central Garden Pet NASDAQ CENT In the pet food space Blue Buffalo and Freshpet are the only two pure plays Blue Buffalo went public last year and its stock is up this year The company is seeing accelerating growth rate while Freshpets growth rate is declining although its stock is up for the year Other companies are not pure plays on pet products but have decent exposure to the category JM Smucker derives of its sales from pet food while the animal arm of Henry Schein accounts for of the total revenue Central Garden Pet also has exposure to animal food products Of these stocks Cramer likes Blue Buffalo as it is a pure play on the pet theme but the stock is up and trades at times earnings Smucker and Henry Schein are also good but they are not pure plays and should be bought on weakness only The SP has rallied for some time and it now trades at times earnings Based on history the valuations are near highs The good news is that either the stock market comes down to make it cheaper or the companies start earning more so that they can justify the valuations I believe the latter is happening that the SP will turn out to be cheaper than we thought and thus valuations will turn out to be less expensive allowing us to get out of this period without a major correction to lower levels said Cramer Case in point is the earnings from Microsoft Illinois Tool Works NYSE ITW and Cintas NASDAQ CTAS All the three companies rallied on better than expected growth numbers Microsoft reported super growth in its cloud business and all other categories including PCs grew Strength in all categories of business for a huge company like Microsoft is not possible unless there is worldwide economic growth Illinois Tool Works is a company that makes industrial fluids adhesives and tooling It not only reported better than expected growth numbers but also raised guidance This couldnt have happened unless the global economy is doing well as only of its revenue comes from the US Lastly Cintas is a global uniform supplier It reported good numbers and raised its revenue guidance sharply More uniforms are needed only when the global economy is expanding so growth in Cintas is good news for other companies too CEO interview Core Labs NYSE CLB Core Labs is the oil service company that utilizes technology to analyze rock and fluids in oil reservoirs to help clients make drilling efficient The company reported a good quarter on Wednesday and Cramer interviewed chairman and CEO David Demshur who believes that oil will have a Vshaped recovery One of the things that happens at is we do have a lot of small independent producers around the US that are going to hedge future production So at that is a good target to get through Once we get through there we are probably heading up to the range said Demshur They have projects on the coast of Africa that has proven reserves between mB barrels Those fields will be online in years and will be profitable at with new technology Demshur is also optimistic about US shale oil where Core Labs is helping companies churn out more in many cases Cramer thinks Core Labs is a wellrun company but thinks that it will take some time for oil to reach CEO interview XPO Logistics NYSE XPO XPO Logistics is the fast growing provider of transportation and logistics services The company had borrowed a lot of money to make big acquisitions in the last months I think this company has its pulse on global commerce and if it can do well then the whole stock market could continue to levitate said Cramer He interviewed chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs to hear how the acquisitions are helping them We are at an inflection point in the growth of the company So for the last five years we have purchased fantastic companies We built the company like a tank put the whole infrastructure in place the technology and now we are reaping the benefits of that said Jacobs He mentioned that the company is the leader on lastmile deliveries shipping heavy goods and appliances purchased online and in stores They are also a leader in the returns business getting unwanted items back to retailers He believes that Europe is better than many believe and their business in the UK is stable and hedged for currency fluctuations The company has B in Ebitda and projected earnings BP NYSE BP They had a good quarter but the environmental problems are not behind them yet Walgreens NASDAQ WBA or CVS NYSE CVS CVS is in the healthcare space which Cramer wants to avoid Walgreens is a better pick Ford NYSE F Auto industry is challenged but Ford has good overseas business and a nice yield Hold on to it Jim Cramers Action Alerts PLUS
