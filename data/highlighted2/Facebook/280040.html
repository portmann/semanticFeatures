this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Yahoo continues to drag its feet on laying out a plan to spinoff the core business One hedge fund would rather see the company do its own with a massive turnaround Others are pushing for an outright sale Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO appears to have a number of catalysts But for a company with so many options its still trading rather poorly First theres the option to sale or spin off the core business Then theres the page turnaround plan put together by hedge fund SpringOwl Asset Management All this comes after the company tried to spin off its Alibaba NYSE BABA stake Even with the new options of selling or spinning off the core business theres still no easy way to unlock value at Yahoo Activist hedge fund Starboard Value also is involved here which has pushed back on a potential spinoff of the core business Instead pushing for a sale of that business Hedge fund Canyon Capital is in the mix sending a letter to the company and asking for a sale Time is of the essence here Yahoo has said the spinoff would take more than a year to get done navigating contract negotiations and getting various approvals The company has been lackluster in communicating with shareholders which dates back to the botched Alibaba spinoff The new plan of spinning off the core business and the Yahoo Japan stake has come with no concrete plans or interim timeline for getting the deal done It appears that at least a year of exploring the options for a spinoff of the core business is unacceptable Sure everyone talks about the sumoftheparts and the fact that the market is putting a negative value on its core business The big reason is that business is in decline and theres no clear way of turning it around nor has there been a clear way to monetize whats left of the business The best option at this point is to do a last ditch effort to sell the core business other assets real estate IP andor its Yahoo Japan stake A sale of any of those assets could help close the discount that the market is placing on the Alibaba stake cash etc Yahoo would ideally like to spin off the core business which is its current plan taking another year to do so and giving Mayer time to cut costs and refocus the company to make it more attractive to a buyer But the unsuccessful turnaround under Mayer has already been painful enough Its growth lags peers and theres nothing no catalysts that will correct this SpringOwls turnaround plan is focused on costs but doesnt address the bigger issue Yahoos a melting ice cube Mayers big failure was in her MA strategy in particular not finding its YouTube or Instagram both of which have been big wins for Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB respectively Why wasnt Mayer more aggressive Why not buy Netflix NASDAQ NFLX back in the day In any case the time for big MA and turnarounds at Yahoo is in the past As mentioned Yahoo has been grossly inactive at laying out a plan A spinoff is going to take a bit longer than much of the market expects meaning its core biz will continue to deteriorate It generates a third of revenues from search and this business remains grossly disadvantaged in this market when it comes to competing with Google Look for Yahoo to come around to a sale whether it will be its own decision or not Theres a large consensus that Marissa Mayer has to go With a spinoff its likely Mayer stays in the saddle Under a sale its likely she goes There could be an uprising brewing in the boardroom where the deadline for director nominations is March and theyll have to let the board know by Jan look for Starboard to step up if theres not a sale in the next few months Theres likely plenty of support to overthrow Mayer whos also on maternity leave Two of Yahoos board members support Mayer two are against her and the others are swing votes at this stage Yahoo is set on going its own way defiling SpringOwls turnaround plan and StarboardCanyons push for a sale There is likely some interest in the core biz either from private equity or buyers like Verizon NYSE VZ However the company is turning away buyers When private equity buyers call up Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman about buying the core biz theyre being told its not for sale In the end Yahoo is placing a lot of weight on its plan to spin off the core biz without a plan B something they did with the Alibaba spin While the sale is the best case its still not worth being a shareholder here given that Yahoo is stringing along shareholders and we could be in store for another year of figuring out what to do next If there is some hard facts that hedge funds are going to take to task management in an upcoming proxy battle well have another look </div></body></html>
