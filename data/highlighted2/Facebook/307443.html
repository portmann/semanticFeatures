mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is nothing more than a digital billboard with a nondiversified revenue stream <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>admits there is wide latitude regarding how many users are truly engaged on a regular basis <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>must continually fight to maintain market share of finite ad dollars The market went crazy for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB again this past week as it allegedly delivered strong numbers across the board sending the stock soaring Yet when the data is really unpacked and we examine what Facebooks business and very existence is all about investors are crazy to be buying it at its present valuation If youve ever watched NBCs Shark Tank then you know Mark Cuban often asks entrepreneurs one very simple question What problem does your product solve He asks because sustainable businesses derive from solutions to common problems Now ask yourself what problem does <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>solve Answer Nothing If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>vanished tomorrow a solution to a common problem would not vanish with it Thats because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is nothing more than a bulletin board that allows advertisers to post along with people <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is nothing more than a pureplay digital advertiser So agrees private equity fund manager Ovadia Ovi Levy manager of KPL Capital in Naples Florida Levy is short <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and thinks investors should head for the exits Thats the dirty little secret that everybody knows but nobody wants to admit to In the history of the stock market show me one pureplay advertiser before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL that ever traded at x earnings and x sales Hes correct At its height worldclass pureplay advertising firm WPP was valued at billion on sales of billion or x sales <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is valued at x sales Levy says to concentrate on the only three things that matter about Facebooks business its active user base the size of the advertising market and how much of those advertising dollars it gets There have always been questions about how many people are truly using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>One analysis from suggested that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>accounts werent real Another suggests as many as million Now that we are in election season it is reasonable to consider that many accounts have been opened strictly for political purposes and will go dormant after the election <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself discloses on Page of its K that measurements of daily active users DAUs mobile DAUs monthly active users MAUs mobile MAUs and average revenue per user ARPU has its problems our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts Our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business For example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age Accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete Levy says This is not to suggest that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is stuffed to the gills with phonies but a healthy skepticism toward how many accounts are real is wise More to the point the question is how many of these accounts are of value to advertisers If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cant provide an accurate number on real accounts then advertisers cannot rely on any reporting Therefore they would be more likely to offer less money Levy makes a great point When we dig into the K we find that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself isnt so sure how many people are actually engaging with the platform Monthly Active Users MAUs We define a monthly active user as a registered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>user who logged in and visited <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>through our website or a mobile device or used our Messenger application and is also a registered <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>user in the last days as of the date of measurement MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community So all someone has to do in order to be counted is log in ONCE in a month and that may simply be by using Messenger and not the actual <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform Claiming they have billion MAUs is to me not terribly impressive since there is really no disclosure regarding if users are logging on once or times each month How can this be a useful metric without that information Levy asks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>tries to solve that problem by offering DAUs which is the same metric but measured if someone logs in once a day or more The same problem exists We dont know if it is just once or more on just Messenger or the platform or both <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt even know if these connections are even made by humans Levy asserts Hes right about that On Page of the K Some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offers no disclosures on how many minutes per day or how many page views the average user consumes Bottom line Neither <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>nor its advertisers actually know how many users are truly engaging with the platform at any given time Levy says that advertising is not a sector where there exists unlimited capital There is not an infinite amount of money allocated to the advertising market That amount is limited and only in did spending finally pass prerecession levels Moreover for every big YOY increase in a place like India a country like Russia sees a huge YOY decline China is irrelevant because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is restricted there Growth in the UK is strong but the US is pretty stagnant at only In short the maximum ad spend the world sees in any given year is about billion and thats a fairly static number The US accounts for about of that the giant Chinese market is unavailable and another of the market is search advertising which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt even have a presence in Worse the advertising market is linked to economic cycles Advertising pulls back heavily in recessions but returns slowly afterwards Levy points that out that Right now there are serious concerns about global or regional recessions Real GDP growth is forecasted to be weak in the US and even weaker in many developed countries Bottom line The advertising pie is finite and the trend seems more likely to call for reduced spending than increased spending The issue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is proving to the advertising community that it deserves more of that pie from one year to the next especially in years when overall spending is declining That in turn means providing advertisers with reliable data on Facebooks usage which as noted above is not reliable The shift in spending from other media to internet is not growing much anymore Advertisers have always diversified their spend across media and will continue to do so since other media are not going away Page tells another alarming story In compared to the average price per ad increased by and the number of ads delivered decreased by The increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain nonNews Feed ads during the third quarter of which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad Average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in News Feed The reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>says that of its ad revenue comes from mobile ads where fewer ads are shown Thus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is selling more expensive space to advertisers who want those mobile eyeballs Levy highlights the problem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not only reliant on advertising for of its revenue but of that revenue is coming from mobile That lack of diversification makes it exceptionally vulnerable should advertisers find some other platform to move those finite dollars to So given that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a finite set of dollars it must fight for further limited by geographic availability of its product with little diversification in the face of possible recession and no idea just how many people are actually engaging with its platform I think it is nuts to rely on revenue growth for much longermuch less net income growth to billion As for Levy he says definitively The market now puts a billion price tag on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock meaning it trades at a current PE ratio of This valuation is not deserved and Ill go one step further This valuation is impossible absolutely impossible to sustain Indeed all growth companies slow down The problem is that the market is valuing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as an internet stock instead of what it is an advertiser Inevitably a recession will hit spending will decline a new platform will tickle advertiser fancies and theyll shift money around Growth will decline to the mean <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will certainly have a share of global ad spend but not grow it at the rate it presently is That will push the stock price down significantly as the PE ratio inevitably contracts Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
