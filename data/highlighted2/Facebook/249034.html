clicks Nov AM ET About <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>FB by ARK Investment Management Instagram probably will not reach the billion users to which Mark Zuckerberg aspires but thats not necessarily a bad thing for Facebooks NASDAQ FB revenue prospects At full maturity the platform will be much larger than Twitter NYSE TWTR and a maturing growth profile should motivate Instagrams management to accelerate its monetization efforts Based on current growth rates as shown below Instagram will level off at roughly million monthly active users MAUs by This level would hardly constitute a failure as only a handful of social networks have hit more than million MAUs and only <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has crossed a billion With million young and engaged users Instagram would be one of the largest and most lucrative destinations for advertisers The logistic function depicted in the graph above plots out an Scurve capturing the three phases of technology diffusion exponential growth at the beginning linear growth in the middle and logarithmic growth toward the end Research analysts have used it to predict smartphone penetration in the US with good results Plotting a best fit curve for the six data points Instagram has released the logistic function suggests MAUs will reach million by the end of This projection is just that social networks are not obliged to follow a mathematical function Instagrams ultimate size will depend upon product innovation competition and numerous intangibles That said in our view the logistic function has a better than average track record in predicting the adoption of social networks Mark Zuckerberg has stated that social networks arent really interesting monetization opportunities until they reach a billion users Why then has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>opened Instagram to all advertisers this year It could be accelerating monetization precisely because it believes that Instagram wont hit the one billion MAU mark or the goal could be more aspirational <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself was monetized well before it reached million users With million users how much revenue would Instagram generate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>In the table below we lay out potential revenue as a function of MAUs and average annual revenue per user Twitter currently generates roughly per user per year At that level Instagram would generate between billion in revenue At Facebooks monetization rate of per user Instagrams revenue would be double or billion If Instagram were to outperform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>not an outlandish assumption given its substantially higher engagement it could generate revenue on the order of billion four times that of Twitter or of Facebooks trailing four quarter revenues of billion Compared to the projected size of the digital advertising market in billion would account for only of that market This analysis assumes that Instagram follows the growth curve predicted by the logistics function In reality growth may taper early or gain momentum Well be updating this model as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>releases new numbers Follow us on Twitter to stay up to speed ARK Investment Management LLC
