switch to an algorithmic feed from a chronological feed and to increase its max video length Both moves might have financial implications Brands could spend more on ads to be seen on an algorithmic feed and longer video ads could yield higher prices Instagrams willingness to make big changes in spite of seeing strong user and revenue growth fits with parent Facebooks philosophy and arguably contrasts with Twitters Mark Zuckerberg once declared <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has a Move Fast and Break Things development philosophy The idea being that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has to be willing to move quickly to build and change its products even if the new offerings are imperfect at first rather than miss opportunities by moving too slowly Zuck changed this motto in to Move fast with stable infrastructure to account for Facebooks growth and the ripple effects bugs can have on its platform but his companys willingness to make big changes to its core products regardless of how successful theyve been remains intact Facebooks recent willingness to replace its traditional Like button in favor of a Reactions feature containing six options with Like being one of them is an example as was its decision to remove messaging from its core apps And the same holds for two major changes recently unveiled by Instagram The first change is Instagrams switch currently in test mode from a chronological feed view to a feed in which an algorithm decides the order in which followed posts appear much as it does for core Facebooks news feed Instagram The order of photos and videos in your feed will be based on the likelihood youll be interested in the content your relationship with the person posting and the timeliness of the post Were going to take time to get this right and listen to your feedback along the way As one would expect the move has sparked a backlash among some Instagram users worried about a big change to a service they love It has also led the owners of many popular accounts who are afraid their material wont be seen as often to frantically urge their followers to enable push notifications for their posts But provided the algorithm is implemented well and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>deserves the benefit of the doubt here Instagrams reasoning for ditching the chronological view is solid Unlike Twitter whose users often rely on it to get a realtime pulse of whats going on in the world timeliness is just one of several factors that typically determines what posts a user wants to see first And with the number of accounts followed by many of Instagrams M active users having ballooned in Facebooklike fashion theres a clear need to prioritize the accounts a particular user really cares about At the same time there could be a major financial benefit to an algorithmic feed Many brands will likely have to buy ads to guarantee a user following their account sees their posts should Instagrams algorithm push down the location of a brands content This is exactly what happened as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>changed its algorithm to lower the rate at which posts from followed businesses appeared on news feeds The company insisted the move was strictly done to optimize the user experience Instagrams second change less dramatic but also noteworthy is its decision to increase the max length of a posted video to seconds Advertisers previously at seconds received the feature two months ago and Instagram began rolling it out to everyone else previously at seconds yesterday Instagram notes the amount of time spent watching video on its platform has risen by over over the last six months and proclaims longer videos mean more diverse stories from the accounts you love Longer videos could also mean more lucrative video ad sales as Instagram like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>proper YouTube and many others tries to get a bigger chunk of the video ad dollars moving from TV to digital channels No one can say Instagrams changes are being made out of desperation The service added M active users between Dec and Sep and soaring Instagram ad sales they follow the launch of many new ad options are believed to be a big reason Facebooks total ad sales rose YY in Q improved from Qs Rather the changes appear linked to a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>development philosophy that includes an openness to reshaping core products even after theyve seen tremendous growth The contrast with Twitter NYSE TWTR which continues taking a more cautious approach to overhauling core features even as its active user growth stalls is hard to ignore Disclosure
