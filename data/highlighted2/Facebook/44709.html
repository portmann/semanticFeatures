Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>reported strong earnings results last week but the stock has shed value ever since Opportunistic investors seeking breakout earnings performance bid up stocks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>into earnings and leave them if they do not get their intended event catalyst result But longterm investors should let that capital run off and not fret the temporary decline now being witnessed in FB shares down nearly in four days The companys quarterly performance indicates the stock is on track for at least average annual appreciation over the next five years FB could do even better as it leverages the social media assets it is currently investing heavily in and the stock also could benefit from valuation expansion in that case By now everyone should be aware of the fact that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NYSE FB reported excellent earnings results last week But the stock has come off its highs reached ahead of the report That is because its performance however excellent was not good enough to keep the scarce capital resources of less patient investors in the stock at its valuation Longterm holders patient and willing to achieve a better than annual appreciation rate in this stock will be rewarded but impatient speculative buyers who took positions into its earnings will seek more prospective pastures through earnings season I suggest investors let the trading capital run away for now It will return again at higher price levels to support even higher levels later on down the road Followers of my column are well aware at this point of my longterm favor of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares The stock is one of my favorite ideas for the next years because of the earnings leverage I see coming across the important membership bases of many of its social media businesses I have been on record with this view here at Seeking Alpha since the stock traded into the mids on its postIPO falloff Its also notable that I did not favor purchase of the shares at the IPO price on the IPO date Despite my long standing faith in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I can understand why the shares gave way after earnings last week It is because of the influence of the scarce but important capital resources of impatient investors traders may be a more appropriate term traversing from one stock to another through earnings season Its scarce capital because its a limited resource for investors on an individual basis who have many options to direct capital to Its important because there is a lot of it across many traders willing to chase event catalysts during earnings season That scarce yet important capital segment was bet on a blockbuster breakout for the stock on extraordinary and perhaps flawless performance But in the runup into the earnings release the result was not enough to drive the stock even higher Heres why longterm investors need not fret postearnings slippage On the key measures for longterm investors daily and mobile active users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>excelled again in gaining the market share of the digitally inclined public Daily Active Users DAU grew yeartoyear to million on average for March Mobile DAUs grew yeartoyear to million in March Monthly Active Users MAU and mobile MAUs increased and to billion and billion respectively Upon this rock of users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>builds its church so to speak and leverages revenue streams That process continues to be perfected and maximized but is already at this moment generating astounding results and more will come across some of Facebooks assets that it is just starting to monetize Revenue from advertising increased against the prior year quarter before currency impact to billion Mobile advertising revenue made up of total advertising revenue evidencing Facebooks successful transition to the clearly critical mobile platforms the world is using today Most of Facebooks success is solely on its namesake social media site but the company continues to grow memberships across its applications including WhatsApp and Messenger and is investing heavily in Oculus Revenues will continue to grow strongly as a result for years and may even gain pace something sellers of the stock this week simply do not care about FB shares are down from their close just four days ago and since the earnings release It is because of impatient trading capital flows now finding other stocks to seek big breakout gains from I think we are seeing a similar trend in the shares of Apple NASDAQ AAPL this week as it reacted well after hours to its strong results but still shed capital nonetheless since I do not make investment decisions based on technical analysis But I will refer to technical price data to complement my fundamental research FB shares are now testing their day moving average and the day and day averages are not far off Thus there is very strong technical support in the current vicinity to rest comfortably Yet longterm investors should not fret even despite that fact as the company continues to grow its top and bottom lines at great pace Revenue rose in the quarter and would have risen by if not for the transitory impact of currency fluctuation The bottom line increased at a pace of because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is smartly investing in its various assets As a result investors can expect the stock price to continue to rise at about a pace on an annual basis if the stock is to simply keep its current valuation But if as I expect <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>begins to speed that growth pace up with the leveraging of its other social media assets and also better leverages its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>namesake platform well then investors will do better on bottom line growth and also possibly on valuation expansion Estimates are seeing upward revision with the consensus for now showing a share vs days ago That trend is one I look for in growth stocks and I find reassuring to my thesis for this one FB trades at X estimates and X next years consensus EPS estimate at Given expectations for further upward adjustment to these estimates we must realize that this valuation is understating true value <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is expected to grow its bottom line by over the next five years and this might also be understated That means that its PEG value of X is likely understated reassuring me that at minimum annual price appreciation should be expected in FB shares Thats well worth some patience today as impatient trading money comes and goes Hold on to your FB shares for the longterm and I suggest new interests are wise starting here at the day line Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>LongTerm Investors Should Hold While Fleeting Capital Runs Disclosure The
