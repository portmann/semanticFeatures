class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Isnt A Social Network Its A Business Emporium <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha After listening to Facebooks Q earnings conference call it became crystal clear to me that the company doesnt run a social network but rather a business emporium While many of their products are front facing to users such as WhatsApp and Instagram there is a businesstobusiness backend <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be a businesstocustomer portal for users and a business emporium to those businesses seeking direct engagement of potential customers Ive been letting the dust settle from Facebooks NASDAQ FB Q earnings report before opining on the company and their future Ive read the bullish and bearish articles since earnings and many of them have rehashed a lot of the same points from the last year or two user growth has continued revenue growth is still there or the company is moatless and appears fraudulent regarding users and clicks There is no lack of opinion on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but the problem is these perspectives dont recognize <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for what it is or rather for what it is becoming The early <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>website was built as a way to connect with your friends and colleagues in college If anyone remembers those first years you needed to have a college email address in order to be connected to a network From there you saw everyone else who also was part of that network and you conducted your social interactions Eventually the website grew from a college directory to an allaccepting worldwide social network Connecting people from around the world who share who they are and what they like allows <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to have a database of very specific and actionable information This opens the door for businesses to target through advertising an audience who they think is their market But this is on the same level of rehash as the bullish and bearish examples I started with Since strategically acquiring several companies indifferent of your agreement of the word strategic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has created and continues to create several roads that lead to the same city In fact with the amount of users and engagement Ill go so far as to call them highways These highways are in the form of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself Messenger Instagram and WhatsApp What do all of these highways have in common To start they are all free to use Of course that isnt much of a differentiation to other apps or social media websites so we must dig deeper What is different is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>targets not the user for their revenue but the ones looking to spend money to make money This target is of course businesses and organizations Now at first look this is still a very nondifferentiating factor Twitter NYSE TWTR targets businesses too and so do many other popular apps and networks What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does better than any other is bring in businesses and that is because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the biggest network in the world not just <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the social media website but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the company Lets break that down for a quick moment Thats a collective total of B monthly active users on all of Facebooks platforms For those worried about spam and fraudulent accounts we can even cut this number in half B users and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still the largest network in the world Now naturally and without any hesitation of doubt there is overlap in these users But why exactly does that matter Overlap means that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>owns these users time during their day regardless of what medium they use Comparatively Twitter has M MAUs and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD has M MAUs M cumulative users Pinterest similarly has a little over M MAUs also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has quite the lead on any of these other social websites But I dont actually want to dwell on this because this isnt where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>dominates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is actually even better at making relationships and partnerships with businesses than it is with gaining users This is what really matters to bringing in revenue and as Ill get to soon new inroads to other opportunities Lets make another comparison with the amount of advertisers these social media websites have Whats interesting is that I could not find any other social media websites data of active advertisers Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has over M active advertisers but has been in existence and using advertising longer while also primarily being a search engine as opposed to a social media site What these numbers show is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is dominant in not only its category but is consistently creeping up to one of the most dominant online players altogether This yearold chart makes me think about how quickly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is catching up and becoming a marketers top choice In fact <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has increased their advertisers by in less than three years So what then Basically I have shown that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is dependent on businesses and their advertising for revenue That much is definitely true But do you think thats all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will do with the amount of users and amount of business relationships it has Why should businesses take <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>seriously and think that there is more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can do for them Theres one really good reason <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the best targeting and return on investment than any other website There is a basis for why this is true and its summed up in this thought paid search helps prospective customers find your business while paid social helps your business find prospective customers This is the difference between Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Going back to what I said at the beginning of this article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has such an enormous amount of users and data on those users that it allows businesses to target some of the most granular demographics in order to develop a sellthrough of their products This is something that Twitter cant compete with and is something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is closing in on with Google everyday But dont take my word for it there have been studies that have put <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter headtohead One of which shows that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>beats out Twitter on most metrics including active users bidding prices and costs reach average engagement traffic referrals and mobile optimization The only thing Twitter beat <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on is average clickthrough rates This was attributed mostly to Twitter having less ads compared to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>so users click on the ones they do see However this may be to the advantage of businessesadvertisers because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>obviously has not hurt its user growth judging by its B users and growing allowing businesses to reach more people with more ads Now that Ive shown <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the users the business and brand adoption as well as the ability to effectively give those businesses what they need it leads me to the point Ive been getting at That point is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is solidifying itself as the way for businesses to connect with customers both the ones they have as well as the ones they dont yet have As I said earlier businesses are the ones spending the money to make money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not a social network its a business emporium The reason why this is still the beginning for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and its income is because advertising is just the onramp to this next highway In fact I believe the recent changes for WhatsApp to no longer charge a subscription fee is going to benefit everyone the user first but also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>its businesses and ultimately the investor These changes also will include <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>evolving Messenger into a businesstouser platform as it makes it more and more useful to use Payments is just a start and M is another good step Another meaningful example along these lines is Live which is now available to all iPhone users in the US The reason I believe this is because Mark Zuckerberg stated something on the fourth quarter conference call that made a light bulb go off in my head We think this is an important step making it free towards creating an even more ubiquitous product without affecting our plans for building WhatsApp into important business in the coming years Later this year well be testing new ways for people to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that they want to hear from emphasis mine I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will use WhatsApp to connect businesses directly to users and allow the user to never leave the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>compound Businesses will require less overhead as they will operate directly on the platform that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>uses this for WhatsApp and Messenger as obvious initial choices It wont be commission it wont be subscriptions it will be a partnership just like they have established with their social advertising The user again gets the ability to access the business service for free The only thing the user will pay for of course is the provided service from that business Naturally some may be skeptical Why would businesses want to partner with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>when they have their own website to direct people to There is a pretty simple explanation the work is already done Theres no need to reinvent the wheel and work tirelessly for people to find your business website directly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>already has the people you want and so it becomes a matter of putting your name where they already are I would now be remiss not to mention valuation at this point I have seen many comments that have said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is well overvalued or is valued for perfection for the next X years This simply is not true The reason why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is valued the way it has been valued is due to the expansion the company has yet to tap into Much of which has to do with what Ive explained above it will be a businesstocustomer user portal and a business emporium to those seeking direct engagement of potential customers Advertising shows the effectiveness of how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can work for businesses Once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has those relationships these other doors will open at the right time Secondly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt partake in hardware as its main or even secondary driver of revenue obviously Oculus is hardware but a very minor player at this point Seemingly Im making a direct correlation to Apple NASDAQ AAPL which is dominantly a hardware player and suffers the effects of dealing with hardware margins and selling physical products Facebooks products are free to the ones that matter The ones that pay for Facebooks products are looking to make more money The many comparisons I see between market caps such as Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are simply not on the same baseball field Apple deals in hardware and a portion in services while <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>deals digitally on of its fronts and as Ive said gives away its products for free Therefore <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>should not be compared to hardware types of companies Facebooks margins its ability to expand those margins and the ability to expand its overall business are what make the market cap what it is today <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is currently an advertising social media company that much is true But the market doesnt work on what is current it looks forward to what the company will become and how its bottom line will be fed For now advertising and marketing will be a driver for some time This gives <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the opportunity to work on this connection of businesses to users Mark Zuckerberg has already said this much is true and by the end of the year WhatsApp will be testing this new onramp It is clear the company is going to capitalize on its established relationships with its revenue makers I mean advertisers to create this new vein in the highway system As one revenue stream continues to ramp advertising other revenue streams businesstocustomer connections will come online and contribute much more than what it is now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not simply a collection of social networks its continually building itself into a bigger and bigger business emporium I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged
