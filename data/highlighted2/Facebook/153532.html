Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is allegedly working on a Twitterlike mobile app that delivers personalized breaking news alerts to people I smell a revenue sharing deal between <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and content publishers over this breaking news app project Business Insider reported last week that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is working on a new breaking news mobile app It is allegedly a separate app much like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger The project is still in alpha stage of testing but Business Insider claimed users will be able to customize the breaking news alerts by letting them only subscribe from news publishers they like Some publishers have allegedly signed up for this new breaking news app They will be able to mass broadcast breaking news notifications to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users who signed up for their respective news alerts services Facebooks new app supposedly only has a character limit that publishers must abide Partner publishers must write their news alerts and the link to their websites within the character limit This is shorter than Twitters NYSE TWTR character limit but it will still work There are dozens of URL link shortening services online Even Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL has a free URL shortener that doesnt require you to login with a Gmail or Google account to use The benefit of having a having a standalone breaking news mobile app is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be fulfilling its role as a growing portal for news dissemination As per the recent report of Pew Research Center <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter are now bastions for news consumption in America Almost twothirds of active users on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Twitter get their news inside the websites or mobile apps from these two leading social networking companies Twitter users are more engaged or make followup views with breaking news events versus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users only On the other hand the much larger monthly active users of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>means more adult Americans use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>than Twitter to get their daily news fix In the US of adults use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Four out of ten Americans now enjoy reading news inside Facebooks core web and mobile apps As you can notice in the chart above eight percent of Americans also use a combination of Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to get news Zuckerberg could probably lessen this twotiming habit of some Americans once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>releases a dedicated mobile app for breaking news The addiction to news extends across Americas different sectors Regardless of age race gender or economic status more people now prefer to use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>andor Twitter for imbibing the latest newsinformation Global Web Index agrees with Pew Researchs findings that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users are truly voracious newsreaders Fifty percent of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users read news last month They also spent an average of minutes per day to read digital news Revenue Sharing From Traffic Referral News publishers will benefit from the increased traffic from Facebooks upcoming breaking news app The more people who visit articles the more chances that the advertisements on newscentric sites like CNN will be clicked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now provides of traffic referral to the webs biggest news websites This is higher than what Google provides The social site has outpaced search last year as the biggest source for traffic referrals for web content Content publishers who want to increase their ad income will have to follow where the most readers will likely come from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Consequently FB investors expect publishers to also throw some money to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in exchange <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can negotiate a fair deal with publishers thanks to its globalwide popularity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>not Twitter is the biggest opportunity for content publishers to better monetize the news hunger of mobile device users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has billion monthly active users while Twitter only has million Its a nobrainer decision for content publishers to really prioritize <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Aside from the billion people who access <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>through their mobile devices WhatsApp and Instagram users are also potential clients for a breaking news mobile app The Digital News Report of Reuters Institute also confirms the dominant presence of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>among mobile device owners Reuters chart below also says publishers will have to fully embrace phonestablets to maximize the monetization of their digital content I look forward to the official
