of Berkshire Hathaway investing in IBM suggested Apples growth days may be behind it Brooke Masters questioned whether Angela Ahrendts sprucing up of Apple stores wasnt merely hype given how her previous haunt Burberry has sagged recently And Marco Arment asked whether Apple was at risk of becoming the next BlackBerry as tech competitors lap it in developing AI assistants We elaborate on the three warnings and present a couple of hedges for those who want to stay long Apple but limit their risk Last month before Apple NASDAQ AAPL released earnings we noted that social data aggregator LikeFolio had put out a sell rating on the stock based on their analysis of social media data and we presented a couple ways for concerned shareholders to hedge if they wanted to stay long Hedging Apple Ahead Of Earnings As LikeFolio cofounder Andy Swan summarized it at the time Apples earnings a disappointment across the board as Seeking Alpha contributor Seth Golden put it supported LikeFolios bearish assessment and as we wrote near the end of April hedged Apple investors who wanted to exit were able to do so with less of a loss than they would have had otherwise Apple shareholders who didnt hedge or sell may be interested to know that three knowledgeable observers offered separate cautions about the company over the weekend Well review those below and offer a couple of updated hedges if youd like to stay long but limit your downside risk over the next several months Richard Waters who reports on Silicon Valley for the Financial Times presented the bearish interpretation of Apple being bought by one of Warren Buffetts deputies at Berkshire Hathaway NYSE BRKA NYSE BRKB The End Of An Era For Apple free registration with the FT will enable you to read the article here namely that it signifies Apples run as a growth company may be over One possible conclusion is that Berkshire Hathaways appearance on the scene is confirmation that Apple has now passed into a form of corporate seniority much dreaded by the growthaddicted denizens of Silicon Valley In the tech world where grow or die has been the mantra what is considered respectable maturity in other industries smacks of outright senility Yet it is a future Apples massive size has rendered inevitable At bn last year its gigantic revenues almost as much as Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT combined make significant sustained growth almost impossible Richard Waters Financial Times colleague companies editor Brooke Masters poured some cold water on Apples new stores Hope Collides With Hype As Apple Gives Stores A Makeover free registration with the FT will enable you to read the article here noting the result of former Burberry OTCPKBURBY CEO Angela Ahrendts twoyear rethink was underwhelming Mostly her vision seems to involve even bigger glass doors and lots of plants Every flagship store will have outdoor space in San Francisco the greenerylined square will feature free WiFi and acoustic musicians on weekends The Genius Bar where customers go for help with technical issues has been replaced by a Genius Grove stocked with trees and more space for people to sit while they wait Tart commentators suggested the tree money might have been better spent on more staff to keep delays down Masters doesnt say how Apple stores situated in shopping malls such as the one in Westfields OTCPKWEFIF Garden State Plaza in New Jersey will keep all the new trees alive To remind us why Apple hired Ahrendts from Burberry Masters retells the story of Ahrendts successful reopening of Burberrys flagship London store though readers familiar with Silicon Valleys concerns about gender and diversity may wonder if that played a role Angela Ahrendts is currently the only one of Apples person executive team who isnt a white man In any case Masters points out that the gains to Burberry from Ahrendts sprucingup have since faded Since then the news has not been so good Burberry has been hit hard by a fall in Chinese sales Shares have dropped per cent in months Burberrys current woes may have nothing to do with Ms Ahrendts But perhaps her highly vaunted effor to reimagine luxury shopping was more about hype than real transformation Apple is about to find out Marco Arment is a prominent software developer entrepreneur and commentator He was the lead developer of Tumblr which was acquired by Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO and the creator of the popular Instapaper app He raised the possibility of Apple going the way of BlackBerry BBRY If Googles Right About AI Thats A Problem For Apple Arment explained that BlackBerry didnt fail because it started to make worse smart phones but because Apple shifted the expectations of what a smart phone could be and BlackBerry didnt have the staff or expertise to catch up Arment wonders if Apple is now in a similarly precarious position with respect to artificial intelligence given investments by Amazon Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Today Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google are placing large bets on advanced AI ubiquitous assistants and voice interfaces hoping that these will become the next thing that our devices are for Amazon <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google especially Google have all invested heavily in bigdata web services and AI for many years prioritizing them highly iterating and advancing them constantly accumulating relevant data developing effective algorithms and attracting developing and retaining tons of specialized talent But if Googles right theres no quick fix It wont be enough to buy Siris creators again or partner with Yelp for another few years If Apple needs strong AI and bigdata services in the next decade to remain competitive they need to have already been developing that talent and those assets inhouse extensively for years They need to be a bigdataservices company Their bigdata AI services need to be far better smarter and more reliable than they are And I just dont see that happening Becoming a major bigdata AI services company doesnt happen completely in secret and suddenly get released to the world completed in a keynote Its a massive undertaking spanning many years many people and a lot of noticeable interaction with the world Its easier to conceal the development of an entire car than a major presence in AI and services For Apple shareholders who want to stay long while limiting their downside risk over the next several months but without capping their upside these were the optimal puts as of Mondays close to hedge shares against a greaterthan decline by late October screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iOS app As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value A few notes about this hedge To be conservative the cost was calculated using the ask price of the puts In practice an investor can often by the puts for less for some price between the bid and the ask If you are willing to risk a larger decline threshold in the apps terminology you can potentially lower the cost of hedging in this manner The threshold is based on the intrinsic value of the puts so they may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near term when the puts may still have significant time value For Apple shareholders looking to hedge with the same threshold but willing to cap their potential upside to by late October the potential upside implied by the current median month Wall Street price target this was the optimal collar to hedge shares as of Mondays close As you can see at the bottom of the first part of the collar above the cost of the put leg was or of position value But as you can see in the second part below the income generated from the call leg was or of position value So the net cost here was or of position value Two notes about this hedge Similar to the situation with the optimal puts to be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls In practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have collected more than when opening this collar As with the optimal puts above this hedge may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines in the near future due to time value for an example of this see our previous article on Apple However if the underlying security spikes in the near future time value can have the opposite effect making it costly to exit the position early for an example of this see this article on hedging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color:
