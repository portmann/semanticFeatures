class='textDiv'>The Bearish Case For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Inability to monetize non English speaking countries Six months ago in a somewhat criticized article I wrote that investing in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB carried a high opportunity cost and better investment options exist <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has since risen nearly after reporting a phenomenal earnings release in Q Im maintaining my longterm view that better investment options exist and Im adding three new arguments in support of this contrarian position During the Q earnings release <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced that billion people used the social network at least once a month during that quarter The company also disclosed that over of those users are outside the United States and Canada The global population today is slightly north of billion Who are the billion people that did not use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at least once a month in Q In according to the Pew Research Center of the worlds population was classified as low income day or poor day We can assume a similar percentage exists today This means billion people live on less than day Due to lack of telecommunications infrastructure and subsistence needs its safe to assume the majority of these people are not using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>If these individuals were able to join how attractive would they be to advertisers Their disposable income levels are miniscule Many likely live in rural areas in under developed or developing nations that lack access to transportation infrastructure for shipping or major commercial centers for shopping How much will advertisers be willing to spend to market to them Even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is able to connect the entire world through Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Project Loon or Facebooks Internetorg what is the economic value of these additional users Is the economic value high enough to sustain Facebooks rate of growth As disclosed in the Q results Facebooks user composition by geography is shown below The United States and Canada accounted for of all users and Europe added another The United States and Canada of users generated of revenue Europe of users which includes English speaking United Kingdom generated of revenue Over of Facebooks revenue is earned from English speaking countries that account for less than onethird of the companys users <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has not proven it can monetize non English speaking users This large outage is especially troublesome when considering where Facebooks future user growth is The developing nations referenced in the section above are more similar to Rest of the World of users of revenue than they are to the United States or Canada Even if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can connect the entire world it has not proven it can monetize the entire world The companys future growth will be in its least profitable geographies Any investor with knowledge of technology companies is aware that stock options are required to retain top talent Skilled software engineers are in high demand According to Google Finance over the past three years Facebooks shares outstanding have increased over to pay for these stock options and for acquisitions Investors interested in technology stocks do not have to put up with share dilution Alphabet still a growing company announced a minor buyback Billion last October Apple AAPL is repurchasing massive amounts of shares at now depressed prices In conclusion even with Facebooks continued growth I believe better investment options exist The advertising attractiveness of the remaining population is likely to be low The company has not yet proven it can monetize non English speaking users Unlike other tech companies notably Apple and Alphabet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is diluting current shareholders for option based compensation and acquisitions I am not stating that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>should be shorted Im stating that better investment options exist given Facebooks current valuation Each of the three thesis points above has an easy to identify contrarian case For the remaining population that is not on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>when they do climb the economic ladder they will join At that point advertisers will want to market to them The lack of monetization for non English speaking users can be overcome with better consumer understanding Issuance of new shares for acquisitions can be good if those acquisitions are sound Instagram continues to grow in popularity and WhatsApp which is very popular in the developing world can serve as a gateway to the main social networking site Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate
