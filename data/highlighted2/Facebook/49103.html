proved that it is good at leaving its acquisitions alone It wouldnt be buying Twitter for the revenue boost but rather as a network diversification play Twitter NYSE TWTR went public in November in a hugely successful IPO The company sold million shares at apiece but that was way below what the public was willing to pay the very first trade came at per share valuing the company at some billion Since then however Twitter hasnt fulfilled its promise Early hopes of rapid user growth were repeatedly dashed and in response the company decided to concentrate on other metrics like audience which would count not only people using the service directly but also nonusers and loggedout users who encounter tweets in any number of different contexts Like for instance seeing a tweet embedded in a news story If user growth wasnt going to drive revenue growth and profits then maybe other things might That doesnt seem to be working out too well either To be sure revenues have grown quite impressively from million in the third quarter of the last quarter before the company went public In the first quarter of Twitter brought in million Thats an increase of in just months On the other hand expenses are up even more which means that Twitters quarterly losses far from being eradicated are actually growing The company lost million in the third quarter of in the most recent quarter it managed to lose a whopping million So much for profitability in As for the share price well before those firstquarter earnings were released it was in the low s But now its cratering Twitters worth just a share which means that if you bought it on day one and held on youre significantly underwater at this point Thats not good for any public company Obviously every company rises and falls in value over time and many private companies neither know nor particularly care what their value might be on the open market But public companies are different the management answers to the board which is elected by the shareholders and the main thing that shareholders tend to want is a rising share price And its a particularly big problem for Twitter a muchloved service which is probably more valuable to its users than it is to its shareholders Twitter the stock needs to show growth thats the bargain it struck when the company went public Even if that growth comes at the expense of some of the characteristics which cause its most active users Im one of them to love and value it as much as we do As Mathew Ingram says a lot of Twitters decisions going back a good five years have been about maximizing the value of Twitter the company even if that comes at the expense of Twitter the social ecosystem Indeed theres a case to be made that Twitter the social ecosystem is actually declining in value Last year Jenna Wortham diagnosed a turning point saying that Twitter isnt really about the most important thing anymore it stopped being about relevancy a long time ago She added Increasingly Ive found myself retreating to smaller groups where the stakes are lower and people are more honest and less determined to prove a point freer to joke and experiment more trusting in one other and open to real conversation Twitter is starting to feel calcified slowed down by the weight of its own users cumbersome less exciting than exhausting It may be why less public forms of communication messaging applications like Snapchat GroupMe Instagram Direct and even oldfashioned email threads and Google groups are playing a bigger and bigger role in the most meaningful interactions during my day online Today of course she might add Slack to that list the place where much of Twitters more professional content has migrated Twitters big weakness as it stands is that its the least social of the social networks In the early years of Twitter new users would generally find themselves following their friends often the friends who introduced them to the service More recently however new users tend to find themselves following celebrities big corporate accounts and brands Heres a thought experiment take all the accounts you follow and estimate what the median number of followers is among those accounts Call that your Followee Reach Id wager two things that most peoples Followee Reach has been growing steadily for about as long as theyve been on Twitter and that in general the more recently you joined Twitter the higher your Followee Reach will be Neither of those two phenomena are particularly good things since Followee Reach is in large part a measure of how impersonal and corporate any given users Twitter experience has become Its worth noting that Followee Reach tends to rise in much the same way that an individuals follower count tends to rise over time one way in which the gamification of Twitter where people compete to get as many followers as they can can end up hurting the overall experience Twitter has always had a very skewed distribution of follower counts a tiny percentage of users have enormous numbers of followers while the majority of users have a few dozen followers at best and feel that they can more effectively reach their friends by using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or Instagram or Snapchat instead Thats bad for Twitters business because if youre not firing up Twitter to see what your friends are saying youre much less likely to notice any of the paid advertising it features Thats a problem which is not going to be solved by yet another management reshuffle If the CEO is ousted as Ben Thompson advocates then Twitter would simply be continuing its long history of seniormanagement chaos and little good is likely to come of that Rather the solution is acquisition Twitter needs to be bought With a market capitalization in the billion range Twitter is small enough that any of the Silicon Valley giants Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Apple NASDAQ AAPL could swallow it pretty easily And once its swallowed Twitter will no longer face the same bottomline pressures Look at the fate of Instagram and WhatsApp since they were bought by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>neither of them have faced anything like the kind of scrutiny and revenue pressures that have so preoccupied the top brass at Twitter As a result both of them have maintained rapid user growth even though their active user base is already much larger than Twitters As Herb Greenberg says getting bought by a larger company is the best shot of moving forward to create the strategy that ultimately will keep everybodys eye on Twitter the service as opposed to Twitter the stock No really <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has proved that it is good at leaving its acquisitions alone It wouldnt be buying Twitter for the revenue boost but rather as a network diversification play Twitter would be one more platform for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to sell to advertisers which could perform in ways that native <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ads cannot Twitter wouldnt diversify Facebooks business in the way that WhatsApp and Oculus Rift did or in the way that Snapchat would Instead it would do something more immediately valuable to Facebooks shareholders it would diversify Facebooks revenue streams <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has tried to buy Twitter in the past In late it reportedly offered million in cash plus million in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock which would today be worth around billion So Twitter was right to say no seven years ago But now that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has gone public stockbased acquisitions are much easier If Mark Zuckerberg acquired Twitter using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stock that could depending on the premium he had to pay turn out to be one of those rare deals where the share price of both the buyer and the target rose in value as a result A week ago such a deal would have looked out of reach But now that Twitter is trading at pretty much the same multiple of revenues that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is were in the realm where Silicon Valleys highlypaid bankers might actually be able to hammer something out One thing that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has wanted for many years is to be much more relevant when it comes to the news Its efforts along those lines havent gotten much traction but Twitter would at a stroke give <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>unequaled access to the worlds journalists and news junkies just part of a core user base which is generally incredibly loyal and influential And most importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could overnight make Twitter much more valuable as a service by providing the one thing that Twitter can never do as an independent company What Twitter needs if its going to remain relevant over the long term is a way to start turning around that Followee Reach trend It needs a way to make Twitter deeply personal for most of its users and especially its new users A small group of users like me who have been building and honing the list of people we follow for years get truly enormous amounts of value out of Twitter but building that kind of list has never been easy and most users dont bother As part of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>however everything would change Twitter would just need to encourage its users to link their Twitter account to their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account Twitter tried to implement this feature unilaterally in June but it was immediately shut down by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Thats it They wouldnt open up their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account to their Twitter followers or anything like that indeed the link need not even be public But at a stroke it would allow everybody on Twitter to easily start following all of their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>friends Or at least all of their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>friends with a Twitter account At that point Twitter would start being personal again It would allow you to see what your friends were up to without having to wonder how many of their personal updates had been hidden by the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>algorithm It would become a way to converse with your friends in a much less intermediated way than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>It would be everything that people loved about Twitter in the early days only with many years of product improvements built in and with vastly more scale Twitter could finally achieve its potential If only it were to embrace Mark Zuckerberg as its white knight Source Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Should Buy Twitter We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information We
