</span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has repositioned Notes in an effort to capture the entry level blogger as well as add overall functionality to its content creation engine Again another brilliant move by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in repurposing a tossed to the side but now useful tech I think this is meaningful to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>when you understand the platform comprehensiveness <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is working toward with Notes in addition to whats been rolled out the last six months <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is one of my favorite stories to follow and one of my favorite investments If you havent been following my coverage of the ticker here at Seeking Alpha I happened to have been lucky enough to pick up some longdated CALLS just prior to Facebooks last technical move past what at the time was some serious resistance You can imagine that might be shaping my view of the company in that the CALL options have returned more than I could have imagined in such a short window But thanks to the power of crowd sourced research and the springboard that is Seeking Alpha the community here has kept my investment honest and has tested the reality underlying my theses to which I have many for the company Thats actually whats prompting todays <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>article the idea of crowd sourcing something content in this instance <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has worked really really hard and dumped some serious RD efforts into reshaping its platform from user aggregator to content aggregator Theres a big difference in that and theres a big difference in making one the primary goal It should also be noted that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt halfway do strategic pivots it goes all in I think its become readily apparent that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has gone all in on the shift taking place and I think the shift is brilliant In the last six months alone <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has refined its core platform to include content curation tools like Instant Articles and Author Tags refined its algorithm to be more content friendly and attractive and it appears it has now brought back Notes Techcrunch has detailed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has revamped the tossed to the side microplatform which I thought had been outright replaced by Instant Articles and has apparently relaunched Notes as what Im calling a Wordpresslight This matters guys If this is true for which Techcrunch has provided screenshots so Im assuming it is even without a blog post from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to confirm this this would give the coreFacebook platform an almost completely verticalized content curation optionality that isnt available elsewhere Well it is but elsewhere in this instance would require multiplatform housing read combining a lowgrade Wordpress with a similarly low grade Medium or a sophisticated Wordpress or webpage housing unit Sophisticated varies by the user of course but for many using the out of people I know rule developing a Wordpress page on their own would require a level of sophistication that simply isnt there <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in its efforts to become all things to all people would like to be the substitute for this and I think it stands a great chance of pulling this off First sites like Wordpress Wix NASDAQ WIX and Squarespace are well known enough to tech enthusiasts and are easy enough to launch for those with some experience with operating nonperfectly user friendlynonperfectly user familiar interfaces But I can tell you right now my mother would not visit any of those sites to start up a recipe blog with her social circle Nor would she be able to convince her social circle to make the jump to any of those places nor do I believe any of those places could create a social loop effective enough to host a recipe sharing circuit This is just one example of course She does however have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page So do her friends And maybe most importantly shes proficient in using <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in creating content I think she could easily be taught or selflearn how to create a Note with some wellplaced Note advertisement by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>think workshop Thats really my point to be made in this article My point is that while Medium and Tumblr and insert hot bloggingmicro blogging websiteapp here are hot right now and are pulling in the tech savvy masses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with Notes will be able to pull in the masses in general If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can pull in my mother and her recipe collection which might not be perfectly useful for anybody outside her immediate circle she isnt going to become the next million unique visitor per day blogger that still means more time on the platform more dialed in advertising opportunities and likely more page likes for similar recipe bloggers creating Notes themselves But thats just the beginning Sure the fringe user of Notes is great for all the reasons just described above But what I think <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>stands to really gain here is in how comprehensive this dropin of Notes makes its content engine when paired with Instant Articles and offplatform Moments Live Mentions Instagram Messenger etc What this does when viewing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a total platform is create really inexpensive optionality and total platform comprehensiveness that flat out doesnt exist elsewhere That really matters I run a digital property thats Wordpressbased and that monetizes content I cant tell you the level of support necessary the plugins necessary the constant updating necessary the total stress on my MacBook necessary it takes quite a bit of backend work for the MacBook to even load the Wordpress architecture of the page itself and the headache involved with simply keeping the property running Oh by the way I have to use third party chat function I have to use third party forum function and I have to use nonintegrated well not perfectly customer support housing because Wordpress and this is just one platform isnt sophisticated enough I know I could use other platforms and coding to fix this to host all of these itself To the comments that Im sure are to come of why dont you use a more sophisticated coding base should I have to If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can prove out its integrations for the above described if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can create a seamless fluidity between what it just spent the last months working on likely much longer thats just the time its taken to announce all of the above you better believe Ill be making the jump to running my property on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>And thats the grand scheme I believe at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is trying to bring sophistication with ease Actually its trying to bring everything with ease <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt just want its core platform to be a social network it wants it to replace a large chunk of the internet It wants it to be the core platform of your entire web experience Think about if say the New York Times ran its platform on top of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>because it had better open architecture maybe discounted advertising as well using the platform Because it could pipe in live streaming interviews via Live to a massive user base that it had secondary access to via News Feed recommended social circles of its core users or via a promotional News Feed placement Because its just easier to click a second button Im hypothesizing at this point and autopost to Instagram a photo thats just been uploaded to an Instant Article Because its Zendesk NYSE ZEN customer service engine is already integrated into messenger and it doesnt have a plugin issue every third day of operation totally a hypothetical Because to load a Note takes seconds and comes with the ability to make the short fire post more than just text and it can do it at a speed that other platforms cant I mean doesnt that just make sense I think it does I also think that when the market finally digests exactly how huge the content curation monetization momentum potential is here that the market will reward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with much much higher pricing Theres still a large faction of the market that doesnt get it when it comes to the new normals that arent coming that have arrived <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>understood this a long time ago and it jumped on the vision of the future with everything from an optimized platform to secondary functionality like Mentions Instagram and Live built within mentions that could further verticalize and make comprehensive its vision <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is well on its way to becoming the platform of choice for content and content monetization I cant wait to see whats next Disclosure I amwe are long FB
