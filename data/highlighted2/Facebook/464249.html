#A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Some analysts suggest Apple could net billion in revenue from Pokmon Go over the next to years while the apps release in Japan is delayed Facebooks Messenger app tops billion users while Twitter comes out swinging against its most notorious troll The ACC will introduce its own network this fall and on cable in General Electric partners with Huawei in China Will Apple Win in Pokmon Go Windfall According to analysts at Needham Apple NASDAQ AAPL could be in line to score up to billion in revenue over the next to months thanks to Pokmon Go Could this really be For what its worth this figure would be more than what Candy Crush added in and At the time just of Candy Crush users were paying whereas of Pokmon Go users are paying at the moment in the US I actually do believe that Apple could generate that much in revenue from the augmented reality app assuming that the current craze continues for a meaningful amount of time From the looks of it theres no sign of it cooling down But honestly does it really matter Analysts expect the company to generate some billion in revenue for and While that number is surely to fluctuate the potential revenue from Pokmon Go would represent just of that total While billion will get sort of a meh shrug from many investors and will surely not impact the stock in any meaningful way money is still money and thats good for the tech titan Separately the company will reportedly gain access to put up its own retail stores in India At first glance this is great news considering the redhot growth in Indian smartphone sales and its population size that tops billion people And it is good news Im not trying to take away from that Im just hesitant to say its the next China iPhones are massively expensive for an emerging market such as India Plus its not as if Apple doesnt have sales in India it just doesnt do them through its own retail locations Refurbished models and the iPhone SE may give it some traction though something bulls will desperately be hoping for going forward Pokmon Go Stumbling in Its Hometown Parade Sticking with the Pokmon theme for a minute the developers have taken the Gotta catch em all mentality to worldwide proportions aiming for the app to run in some markets globally Some of the countries like China and South Korea have tougher restrictions than others But one region that many didnt expect the app to stumble in was Japan home to Nintendo OTCPKNTDOY Shares of Nintendo indicate as much falling Wednesday after an oopsiedaisies involving McDonalds NYSE MCD A leaked email between the fastfood king Pokmon Company and Niantic the developer revealed that McDonalds restaurants in Japan will be turned into Pokmon gyms according The Guardian Concerns of overdemand caused the games delayed release date which will have to wait until at least Thursday now While McDonalds is the first paying sponsor for the game my guess is that it wont be the last Also given how intensely people have been playing this game and based partially on this guys ramp in business Im thinking that McDonalds Japan stands to benefit as well Looks like Pokmon isnt the only one that will have to be ready for more traffic Facebooks Insane Growth Isnt Stopping Just Yet The social media juggernaut can add another One Billion Double Ultra Platinum certificate to its coffers as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB recently surpassed billion users for its Messenger app Five years ago the company launched Messenger a text messagingbased service that also has video calling and other features However the application hit a major user ramp starting in April after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>essentially forced its users to adopt the app How so Well it announced it would remove the chat feature from its platform basically pushing its users to download messenger as a replacement You may recall <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>took a similar tactic with Moments The move north of billion puts Messenger in some good company joining Googles YouTube <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>of course and Facebooks other property WhatsApp It also underscores just how damn dominating <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has become owning three of the four mobile properties that boast more than billion users even if a number of those users overlap Instagrams growth is no joke either However Messengers user growth is also noteworthy because of the companys chat bots and planned interaction between corporations and its users While the potential here may or may not lead to stunning results its still impressive to see the social media king continually find new levers to pull ACC College Football Comes to Streaming Before Cable The gap isnt just a few weeks either The ACC in conjunction with Disneys NYSE DIS ESPN will roll out its ACC Network later this year Like other powerhouse conference such as the SEC Pac and Big Ten the ACC is ready for its own network I can say that having grown up in a Big Ten region I can appreciate the occasional throwback classic game And given the amount of ad dollars flying around these days one can totally understand the ACCs decision In a show of the times we live in though the ACC will actually launch its digital network first The cable portion of the network wont come until Apparently this isnt because of any regulations or technical hurdles ESPN and the ACC are opting to do this in order to work out the kinks and judge the level of interest from each state Seems like an interesting tactic but considering that its for a year deal I guess its better to be safe than sorry Given that teams like Clemson and Florida State have highly relevant football programs while Duke North Carolina Virginia and others tote consistently winning basketball programs it seems likely that the ACC network will be able to find the end zone with its network aspirations Huawei Gets Surprising US Partnership Apple reports earnings next week and investors will anxiously be waiting to hear if the company has made any more progress in China or if companies like Huawei and Xiaomi Private XI continue to impede its growth It was announced on Wednesday that General Electric NYSE GE will partner with Huawei in China While GE may be reinventing its way toward growth it wont be taking on Apple any time soon Instead its teaming up with Huawei to develop smart machines designed to boost productivity according to Reuters So what does that mean boost productivity The company is looking for its internetconnected operations to lower costs and even reduce emissions as machines become smarter This seems like a wise and somewhat obvious move especially as GE continues to shift to higher growth businesses The company recently partnered with Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT showing that it is committed to this new GE business model Investors are still trying to decide how or if this new GE fits within their portfolio too Just pennies off its week high a dividend yield near its lowest level in five years and a valuation that continues to climb many are starting to wonder if its time to sell or if its a stock to hold because of faster expected growth Thoughts on this topic are welcomed below Twitter Bans Master Troll Milo Yiannopoulous Master Twitter Troll Level Yiannopoulous has been a notorious troll on Twitter NYSE TWTR plaguing users experiences and causing an overall lessfun time Now hes banned In fact trolling has been one of the main complaints among Twitter users who find the obnoxious keyboard warriors to be too frustrating to be worth their time Instead many abandon the service for large chunks of time or forever in some cases The most recent controversy came at the unnecessary expense of actress and comedian Leslie Jones after her timeline became littered with lets say nonPG themed content Twitter isnt saying users shouldnt have their own opinions But theres a difference between differing views and the relentless hate that many trolls sling at other users Perhaps Twitter management is taking a stance showing its users that it hears it complaints and is working on fixing those issues Its about time if thats the case One can only hope Not that I get much any trollhate but in general its just so stupid Theres no reason to have senselessness hurled around the internet especially for a platform that has so many obvious uses and benefits It just clogs up the experience and makes it harder for Twitter to retain let alone grow its stifled user base Perhaps a wideranging clearing of these trolls would be more beneficial Maybe though its just a lost cause at this point Just like its deal with the NBA Twitter is taking little step after little step that in the end management hopes will turn the company around and get its user growth trending back in the right direction I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking
