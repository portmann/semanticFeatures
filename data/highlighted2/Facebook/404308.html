share class proposal is troubling Effective split forces investors to make tough decisions In late April we got another strong quarterly report from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB The continued growth in both the user base and financial results have sent the stock to alltime highs with a market cap approaching billion While the company continues to fire on all cylinders there is one item regarding the stock that worries me the most detailed in the above press release We also announced today that our board of directors has approved a proposal to amend and restate our existing certificate of incorporation to create a new class of nonvoting capital stock known as the Class C capital stock If the proposal is approved we intend to issue two shares of Class C capital stock as a onetime stock dividend in respect of each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock This proposal is designed to create a capital structure that will among other things allow us to remain focused on Mr Zuckerbergs longterm vision for our company and encourage Mr Zuckerberg to remain in an active leadership role at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The adoption of the proposal is subject to the approval of our stockholders at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on June and the record date for the payment of the Class C stock dividend would be set by the board of directors at a later date If this sounds familiar to you it probably is When AlphabetGoogle NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL tried to do this the company faced lawsuits and eventually had to make a onetime payment because its Class C shares were trading at a discount In fact the gap between Googles two share classes grew so large that the company had to step in and start repurchasing shares to decrease the gap Buying a few billion in shares has helped the situation but currently Alphabets Class A shares still trade at about a premium Last month I warned investors that we would see a similar scenario when it came to Under Armour NYSE UA NYSE UAC Sure enough a wide gap has opened between the two trading classes more than as of Tuesday morning which is quite significant on a stock that trades for less than Today Under Armours Class A shares are also trading nearly times the amount of shares as Class C so there is virtually little interest in the nonvoting shares So if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does go through with this stock dividend perhaps after a legal battle that could take months or even years investors will again be put in a precarious scenario Do you hold both classes of shares and likely see the nonvoting shares trade at a discount that grows over time Or do you perhaps sell the nonvoting shares once they start trading or perhaps just sell <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>before the dividend and then rebuy the voting class shares afterwards In that case you are likely to face a tax bill perhaps a large one given how well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares have done in recent years Some investors may not have the necessary cash to do that and those who have held for a shorter time may not be eligible for the lower longterm capital gains tax rate Here we go again While Facebooks Q results were spectacular the company announced a new proposed trading share class that will not contain voting rights Following in the footsteps of AlphabetGoogle and Under Armour this is designed to protect the companys founders and early holders but it creates a messy situation for the everyday shareholder As weve seen so far these nonvoting shares end up trading at a discount and those stuck holding end up with significant
