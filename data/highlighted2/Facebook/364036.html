number of users are sharing original content While live video has the potential to reverse this trend it should not worry investors if the trend continues its path <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has created a diversified portfolio of value on its site enticing users to frequent its platform for numerous reasons Facebooks stock NASDAQ FB is seeing moderate declines after a report surfaced revealing that users are posting less original content The report shows that out of users who frequent the site in a given week share content and only share original content Right now this is flashing giant warning signs of failed sites Friendster and MySpace However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is different from these failed social networks because it has shown it can adapt to a growing user base and changing consumer <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>began out of a service called Facemash which compared students attractiveness It then matured into The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a trendy site for college students to communicate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>further grew to encompass a social network of all people and not just college students And in a sense <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now becoming the internet version of an early WalMart NYSE WMT What made WalMart so successful is that it was a onestop shop for everything people needed Where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was once known as a site where people would communicate with one another and share opinionsinformation about themselves it is changing into something much larger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a onestop shop for videos news information a directory entertainment and a convenient way to share all this content with peers The same way WalMart took revenues from grocery clothing convenience stores etc <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is doing the same to its peers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>video is quickly nabbing market share from YouTube Incredibly impressive yet under the radar is how powerful <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is as a news source for people A report in showed that of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users accredited the social website for being their source of news <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is so successful as a news website because it is the only site that has successfully allowed users to personally curate their news sources by following certain news syndicates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has more of a symbiotic with news sites driving traffic to their sites while hosting content on their platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been and will continue to be a site for people to get information about one another such as a birthday last name interests etc It has also been stealing market share from Yelp NYSE YELP as its restaurant and company review pages rival that of the formerly mentioned Furthermore its search abilities have grown immensely as it has recently added a search feature to its live videos section This addition is colossal in regards to search and news in my opinion Think about what people do now to learn about news theyve heard Lets say someone hears of a huge protest in Times Square Currently users may go on Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL to read an article about it but these usually take time to be written and uploaded Or they may go on Twitter NYSE TWTR and search a hashtag for the event With this new addition to the live videos section users can now experience the protest firsthand Once they hear about the protest they can enter the live videos section search Times Square Protest and then watch the action unfold in realtime This is much more exciting than reading tweets and much faster than reading articles about it hours later Entertainment is also a category seeing a noticeable change Whereas entertainment initially came from others original content it is now largely coming from third parties I dont see this as a major issue to Facebooks longterm success As one can infer from above live videos have huge potential to become a major sharing incentive for individual users If not original content sharing still doesnt ruin Facebooks model I personally havent posted a status in over a year and I still use the site as much if not more than I did a year ago Through its increased video content interesting third party material and other utilities <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>still offers enough value combination of Yelp Google YouTube Twitter messaging and every news website for consumers to spend time on the site Facebooks management team has seamlessly navigated the social networking conglomerate through many years of change and are well aware of issues that face the company They have created a team in London to address the issue of less original content being shared and I am confident that they will guide their company past this minor speed bump I encourage you to follow me as I cover a wide variety of
