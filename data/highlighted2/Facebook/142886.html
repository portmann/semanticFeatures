investment in US commercial real estate has changed over the past three years and this has caused changes in the ownership of US assets It has changed even more over the past six We would like to

problem with FICO scores or any other measure of creditworthiness where the model inputs are linked to payment history is that they dont end up being very high for people who arent good about making payments on time and thats bad news when youre trying to build a successful originate to sell model If youre a subprime auto lender for instance and you want to make as many loans as you can so that you can sell them to Wall Street where they will be put through the securitization doomsday machine you dont really care about the creditworthiness of the borrower but you have to base your decisions on something because if any annoying regulators ever come sniffing around your books trying to figure out why the entire market just disintegrated into a smoldering pile of subprime ashes you can point to a number and say see by this metric things should have been ok So what do you do Well one thing you can do is come up with an alternative way to measure creditworthiness and preferably one which is virtually guaranteed to come back with a happy result which is exactly what Fair Isaac decided to do Heres what WSJ said about the new unnamed score at the time The new score which isnt yet named will be calculated based on consumers payment history with their cable cellphone electric and gas bills as well as how often they change addresses and other factors according to Fair Isaac also known as FICO Traditional FICO scores that lenders use in the approval or rejection process are calculated based on the information in the credit reports from the three major creditreporting firms Equifax Inc Experian PLC and TransUnion The new score will instead pull data from a separate database of telecommunications and utilities providers maintained by Equifax Got that The new score will determine how creditworthy someone is by asking the utility company if the lights are still on and asking the phone company if the phone is still connected Now obviously some of the last things people will stop paying as they descend into abject poverty are the electric bill and the phone bill so if you wanted to engineer evidence of creditworthiness this is a good place to start as anyone who managed to keep electricity flowing to their home last month suddenly deserves a loan for a car But because that wasnt nearly absurd enough <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has a better idea Mark Zuckerberg will determine your creditworthiness based on your friend network No really Heres The Consumerist Earlier this year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced it would dip its toes into the pool of mobile payments by launching a system that allowed users to send money to friends via the Messenger app Now it appears the company may take things a bit farther after receiving approval for a patent this week that would allow creditors to determine whether or not someone is worthy of a loan based on their circle of friends on the social networking site The patent which was actually applied for by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>back in August is for a system of authorization and authentication based on an individuals social network It could have several uses including filtering out spam email and offensive content and improving searches on the site However its the use related to approving or denying a loan request based on the friends you keep that is a bit worrisome When an individual applies for a loan the lender examines the credit ratings of members of the individuals social network who are connected to the individual through authorized nodes connections the patent states If the average credit rating of these members is at least a minimum credit score the lender continues to process the loan application Otherwise the loan application is rejected According to the patent the lender would be able to access a potential borrowers social circle by submitting a request for information from Facebooks databases They would then receive a series of lists grey black and white that would be used to determine the average credit score for the wouldbe borrowers friends And while Bankratecoms Greg McBride assures us that this is nothing to lose sleep over for people with decent credit history its not the borrowers were concerned about The question is this what happens when billions in loans that were made based on Facebooks proprietary friend check end up packaged and sold to investors Or maybe more to the point how utterly insane will this one day look when everyone suddenly realizes that a wave of defaults all have one thing in common that the underlying loans were made based on borrowers social networks Fri Bloppy Go ahead and be a deadbeat make friends with rich people on FB get a loan to buy a Ferrari Sounds normal to me Fri OrangeJews No seriously load it up Why not The difference between being fucked totally fucked and totally and utterly fucked is that youve got friends you can rely on Id like to buy a central bank please it doesnt matter what it costs I can get it and Ive got a shit load of friends who just like me to death Fri froze Next stop will be since the credit scoring process is faulty the credit scorers will be put out of business by the goobermint then the goobermint will take over the business and improve upon it by just granting everybody a AAA A P etc and then releasing them from their debts if they live in certain fucked up zip codes are illegal immigrants Muslim black quadriplegic running backs I told one of my SF ers Progressive fans that they should get a quadriplegic running back since hes into diversity and equality but Oh fucking no Fans of Cait registered Democrats whatever Fri saints Fri saints Good deal You will be my first friend on facebook Our whole <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>motto can be built around buying the fucking dip Have stickers made saying I Love the Fed and do that share shit for some middle finger Every time market goes down we can ask Kevin or Janet on facebook is it time to BTFD If they do not respond we will just say they hate jews It will work Fri ThethDoctor I tell average joes all of the time that the easiest way to increase your FICO score is to simply request a credit limit increase once every seven months after having a payment history They look at me like I have two heads and then they argue with me telling me it isnt true Then they come up with all of these logical reasons why that wont work Hey if you think keeping your Capital One card at a limit and putting a balance on it every month works then keep doing it Thats why youre still in the low s and wont ever escape We have so many subprime borrowers in this country because we have so many economically illiterate people in this country The two go hand in hand Even when you explain how the flawed system works the average joe idiot argues with you instead of just accepting the system as flawed and gaming it with that knowlege They have this bias on how they think the way things should work instead of going off of the way things do work In the schools today the only exposure to finance is a half credit economics course for Seniors in high school The textbook mentions the existance of the FICO system but doesnt explain how it actually works Fri CrazyCooter Just another indicator that debtor prison er reeducation camps are coming to those who cant pay their bills Gotta keep those pensions solvent Fri Abitdodgie Fri ebworthen They also think the FED is the FBI and the NSA is protecting us from terrorists Fri metastar I swear if your credit score lowers my credit score Ill defriend you so quick youll be praying that your Obama phone can pair your credit Fri Lost My Shorts When people realize they need to think hard about who their friends are to safeguard their access to credit when people start getting rejected as friends because someone else thinks they might be a drag on credit scores that migh be when people realize how malignant this company has become and say screw it Im out Fri astoriajoe Fri ReasonForLife The credit based financial system is dying and Fair Isaacs desperate attempt to squeeze the last opportunity out of it is quite obvious But hey theres always the next lower tier you have arms and legs Youre approved Fri markovchainey I give up ND Im creating a new screen name TotalDebt Im gonna borrow my way into complete and insolvent hell You can drive my Ferrari as long as you get here before the repo man THE huge problem here is that your social network is now having their credit history investigated without their permission and without them directly applying for credit Am I wrong here Since when does FB or FICO have permission to crawl through my credit because Joe Blow applied for some car loan he is unable to afford Just face it youre nothing more than a little slave You were born a slave and you will die a slave Fri Zymurguy What happens if one of my FB friends defaults Does that impact my score See where this is going Ive had an account for some time I dont use it and mainly only have it as a way to keep track of some folks and maintain some contact info But this is as good incentive as any to quit FB altogether Fri nerfCash The next time you click OK TO UPDATE FACEBOOK that little credit consent nugget will be buried in there Frankly the entire illusionofcontrol dance has grown tiresome but apparently the Minions still enjoy listening to the music Fri rejected I dont vote in the election scam BUT if morning Joe doesnt care for Mr Trump then Trump goes up a couple of notches in my book Fri Herp and Derp Actually it is more for things like credit worthiness of potential roommates Myself and a couple of friends thought this up back in This was filed back during first to invent so I have a feeling we would have priority if it turns into something valuable It is an alternative to credit ratings for young people with little to no credit and about how honorable they are It was actually a derivative from an online payment sharingsplitting system complete with easy credit card programs and a rental bundling system Never got the capital together to launch Fri sun tzu FICO is an absurd and arbitrary measure of credit worthliness that cannot be improved through common sense measures For example as FICO stands if someone is incorrectly placed in collections there is at once a take down of ones score and no means aside from hiring a lawyer and suing the company of actually expunging the record even if paid Factoring in utilities seems like a pretty common sense measure to me Fri Dsyno For all of you that dont have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook
