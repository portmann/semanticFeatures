appearance February seems to be Amazons underperforming month After pointing out that last week was the time to buy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and being right so far to the tune of I received the following message The request for the same analysis on Amazon NASDAQ AMZN is one where we look for a strategy superior to buy and hold for this companys stock Interestingly enough Seeking Alpha contributor Dana Blankenhorn argued you should buy and hold AMZN on Wednesday While he got the fundamentals right cloud is the future of Amazon just as it is for Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT he didnt justify the buy and hold part In Danas defense the article is more of a long thesis than a reasoning for buy and hold So lets ask the question Should we buy and hold Is buy and hold really the best strategy for AMZN investors Or does AMZN like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>have seasonality you can leverage for extra gains Lets start by looking at AMZNs performance over the past years segmenting the stock by monthly performance The retail sector is a seasonal one so we should suspect Amazon to be seasonal as well We find a couple of interesting patterns AMZN seems to have the pattern of underperforming in February In addition its best months tend to be March and April much like the best months for Caterpillar NYSE CAT February has witnessed drawdowns close to whereas March and April show the lowest max drawdowns and respectively The months of March September and November seem to be the safest with over of those months showing positive returns September and November have the best average returns giving and respectively on average These monthly patterns give us the first possible strategy for an alternative to buy and hold Perhaps we should ensure we hold AMZN during March April September and November But as Ive found in the past much of these seasonal patterns relate to earnings So lets take a look at how AMZN responds to the companys earnings A quick look at AMZNs earnings reports show EPS tends to spike the most during Q In addition the most recent earnings report shows Amazon is back on the offensive Previously Amazon was in a negative EPS rut Amazon seems to have shaken off this rut in the last fiscal quarter pointing to an increasingly bullish AMZN We should note that the last earnings report was received negatively dropping the stock This was merely due to a failure to meet estimates not a failure in the fundamentals of the company We can deal with this in more depth in a future Exposing Earnings newsletter But for now note that Amazon is likely back on the offensive Therefore any long strategy that exceeds buy and hold should work moving forward The question is whether such a strategy exists Dropping one month per year from our AMZN position cuts our gains in half Cool right No Even when we hold AMZN during the two safest months per year we lose a disproportionate amount of gains Still this strategy beats the SPY so its not bad for an investor with a riskaversion tendency who still wants some exposure to AMZN This strategy is simply the previous strategy with the addition of holding through December Again we beat the SPY and see a more extreme riskreward profile Holding the month surrounding Q earnings If youre looking for a way to lose money by holding onto AMZN youve found it Holding the stock to capture Q earnings is a losing strategy In fact its probably a great short strategy on this otherwise ironplated stock This gives way to another possible strategy avoiding the month of Q earnings and there it is the holy grail of AMZN investing By avoiding the month around the Q earnings release you gain the yield of buyandhold which more than makes up for the potential tax losses in selling one month per year Why does AMZN struggle so much during Q earnings releases As we saw from the last earnings release it is likely a result of overly optimistic analysts In Exposing Earnings I frequently mention that most analyst estimates are consistently biased you should ignore EPS and revenue estimates in most cases Lets do one more thing before concluding Lets take a look at a trading strategy for a more daring investor Short AMZN around Q earnings long AMZN otherwise What youre looking at above is a exposure strategy that brings more profits than buy and hold But its not for the faint of heart as the short position puts you at a theoretically unlimited list I recommend the following instead Now your AMZN gains are not subject to income taxes and you still gain the upside from the short position Happy trading My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live here on Seeking Alpha In this newsletter we employ both
