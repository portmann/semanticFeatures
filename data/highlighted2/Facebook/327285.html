of hedging shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB by buying inverse ETFs such as the Direxion x Bear SP NYSEARCA SPXS or the ProShares SP NYSEARCA SH Although our hedged portfolio method sometimes includes levered inverse ETFs here is a recent example we generally prefer options over inverse ETFs for hedging Reasonable individuals can disagree on this as there are different tradeoffs involved but well offer two reasons why we prefer options for hedging Then well show a few ways of hedging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with options If you feel you may be a little rusty on options terms you may want to click over to our previous article on hedging Realty Income NYSE O and read the section titled Refresher on Hedging Terms One reason we prefer options for hedging is that often a small dollar amount allocated to them can protect a much larger position or portfolio This is due to the nonlinear way options react to movements in their underlying securities A comparison of how the levered inverse ETF SH and a particular put option on the SPDR SP ETF NYSEARCA SPY reacted to a market drop last summer illustrates the effect of that nonlinearity As we mentioned in a previous article How To Limit Your Market Risk when the SP dropped on August th SH rose An optimal put option we had shared a few days earlier as a way of hedging market risk was up nearly on the day That sort of nonlinearity enables you to get protection while allocating less money to options And all else equal the less money you need to allocate to a hedge the better because hedges can be a drag on your returns if whatever your hedging goes up in value Another reason we prefer options for hedging is that options on an individual stock can protect you against risk specific to that stock idiosyncratic risk whereas inverse ETFs will only protect you against broader market or sector risk depending on what benchmark they target In the case of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Dempsters focus on market risk makes some sense as the most likely scenario in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares might drop significantly in the nearterm would be if the market as a whole dropped significantly But if some event specific to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>knocked the stock down say an unexpectedly bad earnings release then an inverse ETF might not provide as much of a hedge With that in mind lets look at a few different ways of hedging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with options first with optimal puts Were going to use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge FB below but you dont need the app to do this You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if youre willing to take the time and do the work Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app an additional piece of information youll need to supply along with the number of shares youre looking to hedge when scanning for an optimal put is your threshold which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purpose of the examples below weve used a threshold of If you are more riskaverse you could use a smaller threshold And if you are less riskaverse you could use a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge Here are the optimal puts as of Mondays close to hedge shares of FB against a greaterthan drop by midSeptember As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value A couple of points about this cost To be conservative the cost was based on the ask price of the put In practice you can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and ask The threshold includes this cost ie in the worstcase scenario your FB position would be down not including the hedging cost When scanning for an optimal collar youll need one more figure in addition to your threshold your cap which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly One starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge For example if youre hedging over a sevenmonth period and you think a security wont appreciate more than over that time frame then it might make sense to use as a cap you dont think the security is going to do better than that anyway so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that We checked Portfolio Armors website to get an estimate of FBs potential return over the next several months Every trading day the site runs two screens to avoid bad investments on every hedgeable security in the US and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return Potential return in its terminology is a bullish estimate Unlike its fellow tech stocks Apple NASDAQ AAPL and IBM NYSE IBM recently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>passed those two screens and the site calculated a potential return for it of over the next six months This is percentage points higher than the sixmonth potential return implied by the median month Wall Street price target show below via Yahoo Finance As you can see above the median month price target there was which represented a increase over Mondays closing price of on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>implying a potential return over half that time As of Mondays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of FB against a greaterthan drop by midSeptember while not capping an investors upside at less than As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or as a percentage of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was slightly more or of position value So the net cost of this optimal collar was negative meaning an investor would have collected more from selling the call leg than he paid for the puts an amount equal to of his position value One note on this collar hedge Similar to the situation with the optimal put to be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls in practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask So in reality an investor would likely have collected more than when opening this collar Hedging FB With Another Optimal Collar Often when we post an optimal collar such as the one above where the cap is smaller than the threshold we get a comment from a reader saying that theyd rather have a higher possible upside than downside The collar below is for those readers to illustrate the tradeoff involved Below is the optimal collar as of Mondays close to hedge shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>against a drop by midSeptember while not capping an investors upside at less than As you can see above the app has had to go back to the same strike puts it used in our first optimal put hedge the cost of which is or as a percent of position value And as you can see the below the income generated from the call leg in this collar was or of position value So the net cost of this collar was or of position value The same note about the hedging cost being calculated conservatively for the first two hedges applies to this one too so in practice an investor could likely have opened this collar for less than Say for this examples sake he could have opened it for That would be his tradeoff for setting such an optimistic upside cap of on this collar Is it worth paying an extra in this case so that your cap is x your threshold Thats up to you but our view is that youre better off letting your risk tolerance determine your threshold and letting a plausible estimate of the stocks potential return over the time frame of your hedge determine your cap Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
