growing fast and trades at a valuation that does not reflect its growth nor its investments Thanks to a collapse in Chinese stock prices BABAs stock is a longterm gift even if it is a shortterm nightmare Alibaba NYSE BABA has lost more than of its valuation this year and now sits nearly off its postIPO high Granted Alibaba likely needed to give up some gains from its alltime high stock price late last year but still its degree of losses have been rather excessive So while continued selling pressure in Chinas equity markets and fears of an economic slowdown might keep Alibaba shares low and perhaps push it even lower longterm there arent many opportunities that are better Chinese regulators are doing everything in their power to stop the bleeding in its equity markets This includes a recent rate cut restrictions on trading and devaluing its currency in an attempt to boost economic growth Yet still the Shanghai Composite Index is currently off its high creating just about all of those losses during the last three months This performance is very similar to that of Alibaba one of Chinas largest companies As a result investors can confirm that a large percentage of Alibabas recent loss is macro and marketrelated not fundamentally created Earlier this month Alibaba announced what I consider to be very strong earnings with very few question marks Specifically I didnt consider Alibabas gross merchandise volume GMV growth to be a problem unlike many Wall Street analysts This is a company that had GMV of billion With it being so high it is unrealistic to expect growth every quarter Personally I was happy with its GMV growth excluding the effects of its lost lottery business Furthermore I liked that its mobile GMV increased yearoveryear and now accounts for well over half of total GMV with billion during the last quarter With that said if you are unfamiliar with Alibabas business model it does not report revenue from GMV but rather advertising and marketing In other words Alibaba monetizes its GMV by selling ads and marketing a designers storeproducts Albeit with billion of GMV and fast growth Alibaba has a great opportunity to monetize its business longterm much like advertisers whose average revenue per user increases In Alibabas last quarter its monetization or take rate of GMV sat at just a figure that I consider very low one with the potential for significant upside as the company shifts its focus from total GMV growth to improving monetization methods Specifically we saw <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB do the same thing a few years back as it became harder to grow monthly active users Like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the key with Alibaba is that it has an enormous network to monetize and that bodes well for the company All things considered the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>comparison to Alibaba is interesting to me because Alibaba reminds me a lot of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shortly after its IPO While it may be hard to remember there were many people placing big bets against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>south of per share I saw the value in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>buying it at per share and publicly criticizing Barrons when it later said that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares would fall to per share in a cover story Among the reasons that bears like Barrons were expecting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares to reach such a low level included the companys struggle to monetize mobile its limited MAU upside growth and last but not least a forward PE ratio of at the time Looking back those questions were answered and I expect Alibaba to do the same Specifically investors are concerned with Alibabas GMV upside its monetization of GMV and even after losing nearly half of its valuation there are some who still say Alibaba is too expensive However Alibaba is a company that is expected to grow revenue this year and then next year and trades at just times next years expected earnings which is considerably lower than Facebooks forward PE ratio back when everyone was screaming to sell or avoid it So while I still believe the markets could get worse before getting better I think that based on these things alone Alibaba is a company whose stock will trade significantly higher in the years to come perhaps following in the footsteps of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>On top of these noted things which I believe are more than enough reasons to invest in Alibaba there is a wildcard That wildcard is Alibabas emphasis on making investments all around the world and a large cash pile in a high margin business that will allow it to continue doing so Alibaba does not just invest in infrastructure for its core ecommerce business but also has large controlling stakes in worldwide education platforms highend apparel and brick and mortar retail messaging apps online taxi services online video content and streaming daily deals logistics and a sports team The internet browser UCWeb is one of Alibabas more infamous investments but others include Youku NYSE YOKU ChinaVision InTime Retail etc The key here is that Alibaba has essentially become a leading financial institution owning Alipay hedge fund private equity firm angel investor etc all camouflaged as a leading online retailer This is a company that has its hand in everything all around the world large and small companies and many speculative assets that might one day become the next Xiaomi Uber Twitter or Alibaba Hence Alibabas past investments might one day drive stock gains and given the fact that Alibaba has upwards of billion in cash equivalents and billion of free cash flow during the last year chances are those investments wont stop Therefore with a market capitalization of billion Alibaba may look expensive but when you consider its growth profits investments and the opportunity created by all its many assets Alibaba looks like a nobrainer We
