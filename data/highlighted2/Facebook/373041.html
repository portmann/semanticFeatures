The legal tugofwar over whether or not Apple can be forced to unlock a secure iPhone continued last night with the US Justice Department filing a sharp rebuke to Apples claims that it cant legally be compelled to rewrite its software and with Apple responding by accusing federal prosecutors of operating a smear campaign through the court system Last month a federal judge ordered Apple to aid the FBI in unlocking an iPhone found in the car of one of the terrorists who massacred people in San Bernardino CA on Dec The order was granted under a statute known as the All Writs Act which allows a judge to compel a person or group to assist enforcing a court order but only if that assistance is both necessary and agreeable to the usages and principles of law The iPhones builtin security system only allows a limited number of attempts at unlocking the device before running the risk of losing the data that the FBI is hoping to find The most likely way around this concern would be for Apple to rewrite its software and push out an update to the phone removing the limit on unlocking attempts On Feb Apple filed a motion to vacate PDF that order arguing that there is no precedent for this sort of action and that being compelled to create a backdoor to bypass iPhone encryption has the negative effect of making its users most confidential and personal information vulnerable to hackers identity thieves hostile foreign agents and unwarranted government surveillance Additionally supporters of Apples position on the matter contend that compelling the company to rewrite its code is a violation of its employees constitutional rights by forcing them to repudiate their belief regarding the value of their customers privacy and security In other contexts compelled speech and affirmations of belief that substantially hinder the speakers ability to communicate its desired message are clearly unconstitutional explains a supporting brief PDF filed by dozens of experts in the fields of computer science and encryption But yesterday in its response brief PDF the DOJ argues that there is no unreasonable burden on Apple pointing out that the company would only need to set aside as few as six of its employees for perhaps as little as two weeks and that the order allows Apple to decide the least burdensome means of complying As Apple well knows the Order does not compel it to unlock other iPhones or to give the government a universal master key or back door reads the filing which notes that the phone itself belongs to San Bernardino County where shooter Syed Rizwan Farook was employed Because as part of his employment hed previously consented to making his phone available to be searched the government contends that there is no Fourth Amendment issue Though it should be noted that Apple is not challenging the FBIs authority to search the phone Instead the company maintains that it cant be compelled to assist in that search Additionally while the government repeatedly insists that the order applies only to this phone Apple has pointed out in previous filings that there are currently multiple legal attempts to compel the company to aid in unlocking devices The government and the community need to know what is on the terrorists phone and the government needs Apples assistance to find out continues the DOJ which goes on to slam the company saying Apples rhetoric is not only false but also corrosive of the very institutions that are best able to safeguard our liberty and our rights the courts the Fourth Amendment longstanding precedent and venerable laws and the democratically elected branches of government The DOJ argues that biggerpicture concerns about privacy and network security are a diversion and that conscripting Apple into aiding the FBI is not lawless tyranny but rather it is ordered liberty vindicating the rule of law Speaking to the media to discuss the DOJ response Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell called the governments argument an unsubstantiated effort to vilify Apple a cheap shot and an act of desperation In my years Ive never seen a legal brief more intended to smear the other side with false innuendo said Sewell In the middle of the legal battle in California a federal judge in a similar case in New York recently ruled that the All Writs Act does not give the government the authority to force Apple to assist the FBI The judge in that case concluded that even if the Act did apply Apple was too far removed from the criminal conduct involved and that the company would be unduly burdened by the requirements of such an order However the government argues in its response in the California case that legal precedent shows that the All Writs Act is intended to be a fluid piece of legislation that evolves to cover new technologies The DOJ points to the Supreme Court ruling in United States v New York Telephone Co in which SCOTUS narrowly held that the All Writs Act could be used to force telephone companies to install pen registers devices that track all numbers called from a particular phone number if that phone company is in a position to frustrate the implementation of a court order or the proper administration of justice The government points out that years ago the company unsuccessfully made arguments similar to the ones being made by Apple now that Congress had not given courts the power to issue such an order in its prior legislation that the AWA could not be read so broadly that it was for Congress to decide whether to provide such authority and that relying on the AWA was a dangerous step down a slippery slope ending in arbitrary police powers The DOJ also makes the point that in SCOTUS held that police can not search a phones contents without a warrant Thus Apples privacy questions far from being unanswerable by any court have already been answered by the Supreme Court and the government complied by obtaining a warrant here writes the DOJ again potentially glossing over the fact that a warrant to search a phone does not mean that the phone will unlock itself Regardless of how the court rules on Apples motion to vacate the order the matter seems destined to ultimately be decided by a federal appeals court or by SCOTUS Dozens Of Tech Experts Ask Court To Not Force Apple To Unlock iPhone Apple Formally Objects To Court Order To Unlock San Bernardino Shooters iPhone Apple To FBI Keep Your Hands Off Our iPhone Encryption Previous Users Complain That This Night Cream Is Giving Them WeirdDreams The key difference between this Apple case now and the Phone Co Case is that the pen registers the government wanted the phone company to install were a thing that actually existed To extend the metaphor it would be like the government trying to compel the phone company to INVENT a device that records phone numbers where none existed before and then install it for them Its not as though Apple has a tool sitting in their offices that they just dont WANT to use for ethical reasons Theyd have to INVENT a new tool out of whole cloth for the FBI to use Even if they managed to do everything inhouse at Apple and only give the FBI an image of the phones data the fact that such a tool would henceforth exist to break or circumvent Apples encryption would make Apple a target for hackers thieves and the government for future cases like this Even the knowledge that it COULD be done gives neerdowells impetus for working towards creating such tools themselves Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience If you received an
