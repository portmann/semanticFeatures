and Messenger Publishers key to FBs engagement will find another new tool very useful Instant Articles Facebooks NASDAQ FB F conference has been dominating headlines from Zuckerbergs apparent shot at Donald Trumps wall to the free Samsung OTCSSNLF VR headsets attendees received on day one On Seeking Alpha article after article cites Messenger Chatbots for example as a gamechanger for the company For investors curious about Facebooks future a different catalyst has gone relatively unnoticed in the investment community One we believe will drive engagement average revenue per user ARPU and time spent on Facebooks platform the rollout of Facebooks Instant Articles to all publishers A problem <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has tried to ameliorate for users is the fact that thirdparty links offsite have slowed down the user experience Sharing links to articles specifically is something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has tried to address with Instant Articles and its features are sure to grow the publisher base on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and increase important metrics for the company An Instant Article is an HTML document optimized for fast mobile performance rich storytelling capabilities branded design and customized visual display On Facebooks most recent earnings conference call Sheryl Sandberg commented that it was the slowest upload experience you could have in newsfeed to link off to an outside article so we worked with publishers to upload more news articles natively to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and were seeing great engagement from that Well it would be great if the next earnings report adds some color to the great engagement comment especially in light of Instant Articles now being available for all publishers previously it was only a select few We expect several positives flowing from the widespread use of Instant Articles First time spent on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>should increase If indeed it is the case that the slowest upload experience on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is linking to outside articles the widespread adoption of Instant Articles where publishers can upload natively to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>should keep users on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>There would be no need for users to wait for a thirdparty publisher site to upload since the content will be native on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Areas with low connectivity should benefit because faster upload times will keep frustrated users on the platform longer Naturally publishers might be worried about diminishing site visits and advertising dollars of their own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cleverly addresses these concerns by its advertising revenue model on Instant Articles In short publishers can bring their own directsold ads and keep of the revenue while being able to track data through their existing ad measurement systems Also in the alternative they can use Facebooks Audience Network to reap revenue from ads <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>places through the AN in each Instant Article This allows publishers to maintain perhaps increase their advertising revenues and is a step in the right direction to attract publishers to the Instant Articles platform Secondly we would like to see how engagement metrics are improved by the rollout of Instant Articles We are already of the mind that Facebooks emphasis on video live video and premium content has helped the company keep its users engaged We have seen the rollout of second videos on Instagram as another step in Facebooks video strategy as well Now with Instant Articles if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is to be believed users are less likely to abandon the article In fact engagement stands to go higher with the adoption of Instant Articles because the fast immersive reading experience inspires people to share Instant Articles more often than mobile web articles on average Third we believe ARPU should continue its growth because of Instant Articles We believe a multitude of publishers will elect to participate in Facebooks revenue sharing through ad placement in the Audience Network This should help advertising revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in a nontrivial way but alas only time will tell Taking a look at the most recent look at ARPU from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>We see an acceleration in the most recent quarter and sincerely believe that tools like Live Video Instant Articles and yes even ChatBots will spur ARPU growth in the future We look forward to the next earnings report on how ARPU is trending especially in light of Instant Articles Driving engagement higher keeping users on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>longer and deriving more ad dollars are all likely outcomes if Facebooks Instant Articles is adopted widely by publishers We urge investors to focus on its rollout and how it will affect important metrics for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and we expect more attention to be paid to this excellent feature going forward Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours I wrote this article myself and
