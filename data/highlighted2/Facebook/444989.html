facebook privacy safety Update In a second statement to Fusion <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>retracted its original statement that location is one of the ways in which it suggests who you may wish to follow and now says Were not using location data such as device location and location information you add to your profile to suggest people you may know We may show you people based on mutual friends work and education information networks you are part of contacts youve imported and other factors Original storyFacebooks People You May Know feature has always been a little hitormiss and frankly inscrutable That woman from your high school class with mutual friends Yeah maybe you want to be connected to her Some guy you never heard of with one mutual friend in a city miles away Not so much But one of the things <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doesnt usually say about those suggestions is that they may be popping up because those people or at least their phones have been in the same room as you at some point As Fusion reports Facebbooks algorithms for determining which of its billion users should show up as people you may know are taking location into account and that may not be a good thing Sure its great for networking Meet someone at a conference or at a party and cant remember their last name <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>thinks you may know them and thats handy Now you know that Jen Jan maybe who you wanted to follow up with is actually Jane and you can connect Convenient But its really not uncommon to be someplace where you dont want to make that deep a connection with the other people in the room A step meeting for example is supposed to remain anonymous participants dont give surnames or detailed personal information but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>might provide it to other members as a suggestion Or perhaps the waiting room for a doctors office you dont want to know everyone else there and you dont want all of them to know you either And like many convenient technologies it opens the door to more danger for folks who are already targeted women LGBT individuals people of color who may be deliberately trying to avoid contact from hostile harassers who now have their full name and public <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>information available to them On top of all that of course theres the pure fact that location may not be a particularly useful metric at all Does it mean anything that other people were in line for the same ride as you for the same three hours at Disney World in July Are you badly in need of a digital relationship with your line buddy who happens also to come from the same general metro area as you <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users who have the app on their phones either iOS or Android can disable location features In the app under Account Settings not app settings there is a section for Location where you can allow or disallow location access You can also grant or block location permissions for the app in your phones settings Of course with location access disabled a number of other features <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users occasionally enjoy like the ability to tag into certain venues or many of the events options will no longer work So whats to do Well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could tell people that theyre using location data in this way Fusion spoke with a law professor at Stanford who told them Once <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users realize that the People you may know are the people who go to the same places you do this feature will inevitably start outing peoples intimate information without their knowledge and hes right The professor also said This is the kind of thing that people should be given explicit and multiple warnings about they should also be asked to affirmatively turn on the feature before their whereabouts are used to get them friends <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>already lets users opt in or out of having their location shared with nearby friends so letting you optout of sharing it with nearby strangers seems only fair Dont Go To ChickFilA On Friday Expecting Unlimited Nuggets
