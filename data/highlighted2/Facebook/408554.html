#A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg prepares to meet conservative leaders on Wednesday to discuss allegations about political bias at the social media website one thing he may not have to worry about is federal regulation Although the US Senate committee is investigating whether there is liberal bias in how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>employees select news stories for its trending topics there is little chance the government will try to regulate their practices said Republican Senator John Thune chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee I dont have any reason to believe that would be necessary Thune told reporters on Tuesday The editorial practices at the worlds largest social network came under scrutiny after a former <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>contractor accused editors there of deliberately suppressing conservative news The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo which did not identify the excontractor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>denied the allegations of bias and said it would conduct a full investigation into the matter Zuckerberg also agreed to meet with conservative leaders to share their points of view according to a post on his <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>page Attendees at the Wednesday afternoon meeting at Facebooks Silicon Valley headquarters are expected to include conservative talk show host Glenn Beck former White House press secretary Dana Perino and former Republican Senator Jim DeMint Thune sent a letter to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>last week to demand that it explain its editorial decisionmaking and how stories are chosen for the trending topics feature He said his primary concern was that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was potentially being deceptive about how the news curation algorithms work The company was criticized in for secretly manipulating what content appeared for a sample of users to research the psychological effects of social media <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>last week released its guidelines for choosing trending topics but the operations of the news feed algorithm remain closely guarded Thune said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been in communication with his staff in the week since he wrote the letter More than anything else its an opportunity for them to set the record straight he said Legal experts said the government has few tools to dictate how a private company makes news decisions As a legal matter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not required to be evenhanded said Eugene Volokh a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles Congress cant introduce something that tries to prohibit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>from making these kinds of choices Only percent of Americans said they thought the federal government should play a role in determining what users see on social media sites according to a poll of registered voters conducted by Morning Consult and released on Wednesday According to the poll percent of US voters said they get their news from social media sites such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook
