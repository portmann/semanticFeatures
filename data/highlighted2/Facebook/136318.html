style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>posted a very good quarter and issued more positive OPEX guidance range WhatsApp is the primary cause of the low earnings but this is not a permanent issue The market response to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB earnings surprised me The earnings beat estimates and yet the stock was down due to rising spending There are enough positive surprises in the Q earnings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>narrowed the expense guidance from growth to Also <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>beat analyst expectations and my own revenue estimates The narrowed guidance is just a reflection of serious cost control efforts by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>It seems like they are spending like theres no tomorrow but they are in fact doing the opposite Every of the four cost categories declined as a percentage of revenue over the quarter with marketing sales and cost of revue showing a major improvement with cost as a fraction of revenue declining a relative Table selected quarterly earnings data Source company quarterly income statements and authors own calculations The reason for the sharp yearoveryear increase in costs is WhatsApp acquired in October <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>tries to divert attention away from this by providing a range of explanations why operating expense is higher but the proforma net income including WhatsApp in the K p is telling From this we can estimate that WhatsApp is spending over bn a year on around m FY revenue On top of that Oculus is burning cash as well This is why it might be a good idea to estimate Facebooks income excluding these acquisitions that give the impression that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not as profitable as it really is Below are my earnings estimates of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The operating expenses are estimated by examining their development from Q to Q and comments in earnings calls regarding cost development Because price increases faster than volume this benefits the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue and SGA For example one assumption is that SGA keeps up with the rise in Monthly active users and cost of revenue trends to of revenue I think that the OPEX estimates of Facebooks website are still a bit high but this leaves room for investments Table <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>earnings estimates The figures in blue represent estimates for the coreoperations only social networks The historical numbers in black include acquisitions Source company annual income statements and authors own calculations The estimates in the table above show what <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can and probably will do on its own The network effect is very powerful and will spur revenue for years to come Earnings visibility will be weak over the next years but I look at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a website that acquired two cash burners These cash burners probably will payoff over time Charging each user per year would make WhatsApp cash flow positive Waiting for monetizing WhatsApp until it has more users is a wise move as the increased network effect makes switching harder for existing users For my own valuation Ive written down the Goodwill paid for WhatsApp to zero and regarded that to be the worstcase scenario Table above still lacks some explanation on revenue which is actually based on figures in the table below The table below shows estimates based on Monthly active users and ARPU average revenue per user An important foundation is that I expect the gap between US ARPU and ARPU in other regions to narrow Not much is needed for this to happen besides the USD weakening to its level Most notably I assume ARPU to continue to increase which is due to the continued investments in user experience and RD There is still a gap between ARPU of FB and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD while Facebooks users are much more active And in Twitters NYSE TWTR ARPU was of Facebooks while Twitters users are less active and less engaged In the long run the bn drag on earnings is not proportionate to revenue so earnings visibility will improve even if WhatsApp does not bring in revenue of any significance That said I do think that WhatsApp is worth more than nothing while in the meantime FB investors can enjoy the thought of fat cash flows from facebookcom Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Website Is Actually Doing Well On Costs Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans
