positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next hours MoreI wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Spending control impressive in high growth industry While earnings season is not close to over yet I think we can give the award for the best quarter to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB The companys fourth quarter results smashed expectations on the top and bottom line sending the stock to a new alltime high Most impressive <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been able to grow revenues at a strong clip while keeping expenses fairly in check With the stock now above my previous target Im raising my price target to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>had nearly billion in full year revenues despite a more than billion hit from currencies While Facebooks percentage growth may slow down as the company faces much higher base numbers the chart below shows the impressive growth picture that makes this name not only a technology sector leader but an overall market one The item that impressed me the most is Facebooks cost control After originally guiding for nonGAAP expense growth of the company came in around Most new tech firms arent known for keeping spending habits in check but <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has done a great job allowing earnings on both a GAAP and nonGAAP basis to soar At the Q report the company was projected for in nonGAAP EPS for and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>delivered As a result weve seen a dramatic increase in nonGAAP EPS estimates for this year seen below I believe that will be the year where Instagram really takes off for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Sheryl Sandberg mentioned that of Facebooks top advertisers are now also advertising on Instagram Brand Networks also believes that Instagram impressions could top billion per month by the end of Q which would be almost double what was seen in Q Instagram ads are also fetching more than they were in the prior year period Instagram could pass million monthly active users in which would give it a user base more than higher than Twitter NYSE TWTR It has also been reported that Twitters former VP of Product Kevin Weil is joining Instagram As the mass exodus of executives at Twitter continues <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is first in line to grab some top talent One item that didnt get a lot of attention was Facebooks balance sheet and cash flow generation Free cash flow for was more than billion so the company ended the year with more than billion in cash and equivalents In recent years <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>used a lot of stock when it made acquisitions but a strong cash position could limit how much equity is used in future deals While the companys share count is still rising by the quarter keeping the count as low as possible could have a meaningful impact to earnings per share figures Facebooks cash position is so strong currently that it could buy Twitter and GoPro NASDAQ GPRO for a decent sized premium and still have cash left over When looking at valuation Ive compared <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>against Twitter LinkedIn NYSE LNKD and Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>currently goes for times expected nonGAAP EPS while the average of the other three names is times <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is growing much faster than Alphabet and LinkedIn currently and has more impressive user base growth than Twitter A premium valuation of times seems appropriate and at in nonGAAP EPS Street average is currently you get a target It was certainly another strong quarter for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as the company smashed even the most bullish expectations You wont find many companies of this size growing at these rates while trading at a valuation comparable to many peers With Instagrams growth continuing to explode <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>should continue to see revenues and nonGAAP EPS soar to new highs While Im raising my price target to today the chart below shows how investors do best when buying the stock at or below the day moving average Those buying on the next pullback will likely be rewarded like those who bought prior to earnings during the recent market panic Tagged Investing Ideas Technology
