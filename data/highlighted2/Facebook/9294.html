class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Remains A High Conviction Long Idea <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebooks ad experience continues to improve as targeted advertising has improved conversions clickthroughrates and engagement This corresponds to the data points presented by thirdparty firms and is indicative of the potential growth in the business going forward Of all the ad formats that are currently being monitored the fastest growing format is programmatic ad buying ie adretargeting This all translates into an increasing likelihood of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>generating a beat on top line <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB seems extremely well positioned in the digital advertising space as indicated by the growth in ad dollars chasing the platform and commentary from various programmatic ad firms building the business model That being the case <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>still trades at a high valuation relative to peers as its valuation is contingent on the companys ability to deliver a considerable amount of growth and earnings in the foreseeable future Therefore investors are buying higher and selling even higher the very definition of what a growthmomentumoriented investor is looking for and anyone who finds this type of strategy unappealing should probably avoid investing into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The companys management team had some interesting comments to share at the Morgan Stanley Technology Media Telecom Conference But then they worked with our targeting systems and we were able to identify people that on basis of age and gender and location and characteristics and interest they look like their current customers but are not their current customers and able to show another whole set of ads to them and now were getting of their marketing budget because theyve never seen anything this effective While the first part is interesting the second set of comments attracted even more of my attention And so the ability to have the broad reach of a Super Bowl every day but to do this kind of micro targeting identify people who are like your customers do a different second spots for Lexus We think thats pretty unique and were working hard with our clients to ramp up their use of this proprietary targeting but it takes time and it takes investment and I think were still at the beginning of the process there Now remember <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>attracts much of the demographic which is where the lion share of consumer dollars are actually at According to Ipsos visited one of measured social networks in the previous week led by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which was visited by of Affluents for an average of hours So <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt just well positioned in comparison to other social platforms its extremely well positioned because its attracting all the people who actually have money to buy products via the native ad units that are displayed on the newsfeed Its not going to come as any surprise to anyone therefore that Facebooks business model continues to scale effectively as its able to target advertising and have a promising network model via Atlas which may allow for better ad targeting even on shared devices as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>becomes the new identifier to a persons identity and activity on the web As indicated by a thirdparty programmatic ad firm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>adds considerable value to their ad inventory as the added integration into <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has increased the amount of conversions by approximately This indicates that advertisers have to position ads on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offers a considerable advantage in comparison to other platforms Now for those who arent very familiar to the programmatic ad business I explain in greater detail in my prior article and retargeting in a different article But basically programmatic ad buying is where advertisers are able to standardize ad units using a consistent metric across all formats and are able to buy in bulk to target the same exact audience Eventually marketers are able to direct their intended audience down a sales funnel as theyre able to reposition an ad wherever the prospective customer is at on the web Now remember they also have the ability to adjust the frequency in which to display the same exact ad and are able to change the message depending on how a customer will likely respond to that same respective ad Currently retargeting ie programmatic ad buying is more effective than the individualized ad formats that many marketers have banked on in the past From my own experience email used to be the reigning king of advertising followed by search advertising but now its become obvious that to truly market a product to a consumer the same advertiser has to frequently market to the same customer regardless of website app and format The inclusion of Facebooks ad inventory has only added further momentum to the business model of various programmatic ad bidding models and quite frankly its likely that both the publisher and marketer ecosystem is likely to benefit as added efficiency is required in order to defray the rising cost of CPMs cost per thousand impressions Furthermore certain publishers like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>have a rapidly growing audience as ad pricing continues to trend higher as linearTV is starting to become a less desired adformat Also according to eMarketer much of the growth in programmatic ad bidding is coming from mobile and quite frankly its no surprise given the rapid growth and emergence of both tablet and smartphone devices which are fairly effective at content consumption despite being less desirable for worksituations I mean when was the last time your boss ever commended you for clicking on an ad while you were at work Jokes aside the growth in programmatic ad bidding has played favorably into Facebooks ARPU trends average revenue per user and assuming <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is able to translate more of that success onto Instagram highrates of growth are likely to stay intact Currently sellside analysts are optimistic on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as indicated by the current consensus estimate for sales growth of for FY Admittedly the sellside is pretty conservative on their expectations because its not exactly clear whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can drive the same kind of growth in CPMs as it did in the prior FY and whether a sizable increase in audience will defray a slower growth rate in CPMs Even so based on the points raised by management at the Morgan Stanley Conference and the commentary via programmatic platforms the stock is well positioned and could generate a meaningful beat on topline Its not exactly clear whether bottom line results will beat as the company is currently in an investment year where they have to rampup headcount and increase capital outlays for office space acquisitions and servers I continue to reiterate my positive stance on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as the company has built significant value into its ad business model as competing platforms are seen as less of a priority in comparison from the perspective of marketers Facebooks integration into realtime bidding platforms and the creation of its own RTB platform for a network of advertisers is indicative of where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could be five to ten years down the road While Im not modeling a forecast for longterm sales and earnings in this specific article Im fairly confident that the data and analysis presented will aid in the due diligence process <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook
