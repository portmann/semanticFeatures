class='textDiv'>How to Make Extra Money w Amazon Mechanical Turk Budgets Are Sexy Got a fresh new hustle to share with yall today My man Michael Naab walks us through the world of making extra money using Amazon Mechanical Turk or mTurk He makes a couple hundred a week and tells us how it all works Welcome to Hustle of our Side Hustle Series Make money by taking surveys online how many times have you seen that claim made in online ads pop ups or in your spam email folder Answer a few questions while sitting at a computer and make a few bucks sounds way too easy Ive researched a lot of sites that claim this Most of them are bogus Either they pay ridiculously low wages for the time spent rarely have any work that fits your demographic or will only pay you in gift cards or some other type of credit instead of cash I was days away from the birth of my first child and I started freaking out a little bit about money I started thinking about all of the new expenses we were going to start taking ondaycare diapers food etc and I decided that we were going to need some extra income to handle it all I began researching ways that I could make money online Already having full time jobs my wife and I were only interested in supplementing our income I came across an article on Yahoo that talked about ways to make money from home There were things like sell things on Ebay or babysit but the last item on the list was Amazon Mechanical Turk I figured since it was featured in a Yahoo article is was probably legit so I looked into it further and liked what I saw Amazon Mechanical Turk or mturk is a site hosted by Amazon that allows requesters to post tasks they want done by workers for a specific price Tasks can be from universities researchers consumer product groups or small business owners to name a few Tasks are called HITs human intelligence tasks and each HIT from each requester is listed with the price it pays and the time allotted to complete it At any given time there are typically hundreds of thousands of tasks that can be worked on You simply go through the list of available HITs accept the ones you want to work on then complete and submit them Current screenshot of Amazon HITs available right now HITs vary greatly from one another There are surveys on a wide range of subjects finance products emotions personality risk tolerance etc There are transcriptions from audio video or handwritten notes Some want spreadsheet work done in Excel Others are looking for things categorized into different groups Theres something for everyone on there Well that really depends on how much time you spend working on the site You can find work immediately after signing up but theres better paying work that opens up after youve completed more HITs Some of the better paying requesters put qualifications of HITs completed before you can work on their stuff Ive been working on Amazon Mechanical Turk for about and a half years with a full time job and make anywhere from week In total Ive made about in that time period simply working on tasks right from my computer Having worked on there for as long as I have I meet basically every qualification from a standpoint of previous work completed I have over HITs done However I have gotten a few friends of mine involved with it and theyve gotten up to week after weeks Realistically I would say that you can probably expect anywhere from hour on there Youll be on the low side initially getting the hang of things but your hourly rate definitely goes up once you learn the ropes UPDATE hour was the lowest Ive ever made Ive had some that go roughly hour with the absolute best being hour It also depends on the time of day that you work on there Work is always available but the best work is usually available on weekdays during normal working hours Do as much or as little work as you want to whenever you want to You can spend all day working on there or do something for minutes if you have a quick break in your day Do it from anywhere all you need is an internet connection Get paid in cash and transfer it right to your bank account No gift cards or credit no minimum amount to hit before you can cash out There are scripts that you can add to your internet browser that help you be more efficient with your time on there Youre not going to get rich doing this Its a nice supplement to your job but it wont replace it If your only availability to do this is nights and weekends you wont make as much as you would doing it during weekdays You can start on Amazon Mechanical Turk by registering at wwwmturkcom Once you sign up it will take a couple days to verify your social security number they need this for tax purposes when you sign up After that youre off and running Theres a day probation period where you must complete at least HIT for days During that period you have a cap of HITsday and you cant withdraw your money Once that period is over there are no restrictions on your withdrawals If you want to check it out I also wrote a book ebook on helping people get started Side Hustle From Home How To Make Money Online With Amazon Mechanical Turk It has all the tips and tricks that Ive learned in my time working on there including the best scripts forums requesters and resources My intention was to straighten out the learning curve for anyone looking to get started Plus its free with Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime through the lending library only if not Happy to answer any questions I find it a much better way to spend your time than checking <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or trying to beat level on Candy Crash And you get paid for it UPDATE For those asking about doing this outside of the country You can work on mturk outside of the US but you cant withdraw cash The money you earn would go toward gift cards on Amazon Some requesters may have qualifications that only allow workers from certain locations However there is work available on there in most countries Mike is an analyst writer and online entrepreneur His blog TopMoneyHabitscom shares ways to earn save and invest money You can also follow him on twitter TopMoneyHabits MedSchool Financial March at am This is an interesting post and as you mention could help as a supplemental side income Over time those small amounts add up you could end up subsidizing the cost of your utilities rent transportation or add to your investments If approach with intentional goals it may be something for people to look into as there appear to be more benefits than cons merely from the convenience of it all It also seems way less intrusive than some other options that make you either a walking or driving billboard as a side hustle Michael Naab March at am Its definitely very convenient because it can fit into anyones schedule at any time Ive had a couple people scoff at the small amounts when I first told them about it but you have to think about it from an hourly rate perspective Sure you might only be getting cents for filling out a quick survey but if it takes you minutes youre working at a hour pace Sarah Noelle The Yachtless March at am I used to post tasks on MTurk when I was working on research projects for my PhD we had words and images that we needed people to make judgments about and we paid about cents per HIT It never occurred to me to try it as a worker though I should check it out Michael Naab March at am You definitely should Theres a lot of interesting work on there and if you dont like one type maybe transcriptions then there might be something else you enjoy doing surveys Theres plenty of options J Money March at pm Thats cool Sarah I feel like youd have a better understanding of what posters want too out of people yeah Might give you a leg up on others This type of works does sound hyper convenient but your opportunity cost might be higher You might be better off investing that time in developing a new skill set that can be utilized down the road for more than hr Taking the average and total that means total time spent hours Given the higher rates occur during the workday when most people are at a job you might be spending closer to hours to make that While K is GREAT to earn you still work a very low paying job after all I used to work hoursday hourly based and earn about kmonth which is great And still earning this kind of money in hoursday of actual work is better I just found better paying jobs and increased my rates Ideally you shouldnt have to work a lot to earn money online If you focus on the services that give you the best payouts and grow your portfolioexperience youll earn this type of money in less time Michael Naab March at am Honestly the hour estimate is on the low end I didnt want to put higher numbers to give people a false sense of what they might earn right off the bat and have them be discouraged immediately if they dont reach that It really just depends on the requesters The worst I get is but Ive had some that go roughly hour The absolute best Ive earned is working at about an hour pace on batches of work that get put out once in a very rare whlie I honestly havent spent anywhere near hours to earn the amount Ive earned Michael Naab March at am That said youre certainly not wrong in saying that there is an opportunity cost where you could be learning a skill that would pay a higher rate down the road It is a very interesting article Can you tell me please this is an opportunity only for US people Can I work at tasks form MTurk if I am form Europe Romania Catwoman March at am Foreign workers can only transfer their earnings to an amazon gift card Thats not necessarily a bad thing I use my earnings to buy gifts at Christmas time Michael Naab March at am Catwoman is correct You can work on mturk outside of the US but you cant withdraw cash The money you earn would go toward gift cards on Amazon Some requesters may have qualifications that only allow workers from certain locations However there is work available on there in most countries Charlie March at am Great idea Michael I am definitely going to check this out today Ive been looking for another way to make another side hustle I can definitely relate to your story about freaking out before the birth of your child I freaked out and started clipping coupons Either way a side hustle or coupon clipping it just helps the family overall Michael Naab March at am That was my take on it Every little bit counts I went into it without any real expectations like I said so may things online are scams But once I started earning good money on there its like it became a game where I wanted to constantly outdo myself Its turned into a really nice source of side income kalie Pretend to Be Poor March at am I was not familiar with this thanks for covering it I like that its highly flexible and doesnt require a big upfront time commitment And that you actually make money regularly from it Michael Naab March at am I think thats the best part of it You can really put as much or as little time into it Before I found it I would waste so much time just surfing around the internet not really doing anything Now Ive taken all of my free time and monetized it which has been awesome Money Beagle March at am I never knew about this Definitely worth at least checking out And it bears reminding that even if it is low paying per hour if you do it during time that you would have otherwise made nothing youre still coming out ahead I think people need to sometime be realistic about opportunity cost and realize that theyre likely not able to earn actively at the same rate hours per week Michael Naab March at am Thats the way I looked at it as well My alternative was making no money so at least I was pulling in some kind of money And the more Ive worked on there the smarter Ive become about how to manage my time on there Ive become a lot more efficient spending less time but still making more money cherry picking the best paying work some of the topics I cover in the ebook J Money March at pm Yes TRUTH The same for hiring someone to mow your lawn to save money since youre worth more but all you ended up doing was sitting on your a watching TV the whole time Technically your time might be worth more but savings on earned is exactly worth haha Penny She Picks Up Pennies March at am Ive looked at MTurk a few times but never pulled the trigger Its nice to see that it really does work out well for people As for being able to find higher paying online jobs I would say it really depends on how much of a commitment youre willing to give It sounds like the flexibility offered here makes this a real winner Michael Naab March at am Thats exactly right Im sure this isnt the best paying thing out there but it offers a ton of flexibility Whether you dedicate a lot of time to it or just do some work here and there you can still make a nice little side income Even if you make like week very easy to do thats like a night out at a restaurant every month Michael Naab March at am You do have to pay taxes on the money you make at least you should be reporting it You wont receive a physical tax form from Amazon and Im honestly not sure ifhow theyre reporting it to the government I report the income I make on the misc as miscellaneous income After the year ends Amazon adds a show earnings detail link on your mturk dashboard which shows how much money you earned in that year J Money March at pm I second Mr Naab there you should report EVERYTHING regardless of whether someone reports it for you or not Better to get into the habit of it than wake up to a nasty surprise later of owing a bunch of money fines Jason B March at am I used to do used MTurk I made a few hundred off of it a few years ago Eventually I realized that the return wasnt worth and found other side hustles to work on Michael Naab March at am There are definitely ways to improve the return of your time on there Im making much more per hour now than I was when I first started out but youre right There are other side hustles that will pay more The advantage to this one is probably the flexibility it offers Josh MoneyBuffalo March at am I am definitely going to look into this Like others Ive never heard of it before but always find it amazing how companies like Google Amazon have all these small ventures in addition to their main marketing platform Michael Naab March at am Its a beautiful thing for Amazon They simply host the whole platform The requesters post the tasks the workers complete the tasks and Amazon takes a cut of every HIT completed paid for by the requester Amazon does literally nothing except host the whole thing and makes serious money from it So a better side hustle would probably be figuring out how to replicate that somewhere else haha Latoya Femme Frugality March at am I tried amazon turk before and always wondered why I had terrible results and others were raving about it The weekdays are a nogo for me Michael Naab March at am Ahh yeah weekdays are definitely the best times to get work Like I said theres always work available but weekends are notoriously slow Nights can be a little better and something that pays well can drop at any time one of the best ones Ive done was on a Saturday It was a batch of work asking you to write a paragraph about any place youve visited for You could do as many as you wanted That was my first day over But if youre looking for consistent good work its going to be on weekdays I never heard of anyone making more than around a month on a regular basis with Mturk A couple of times I have seen reports of to income a month It always seemed to be a lot of time and effort for very little return As with all things income is based on your skill level and amount of time invested Thanks for posting about this I might give it a whirl even a month will come to a year and would cover all my holiday expenses So wish me luck Michael Naab March at am Youre right It really does depend on the time you invest in it month is extremely doable Thats less than day Theres a HIT right now asking about preferences for smartwatch colors Its and took me minutes hour pay rate Ive steadily gotten better on there to the point that I went from ecstatic to disappointed making day on there Thanks Ill let you know how it goes should be a fun experiment The hits I looked at looked most entertaining Mortgage Free Mike March at am This is very interesting The pay seems quite low but the flexibility is key There are a lot of people looking for extra work but they cant commit to the demands of traditional employers like a set schedule I will give it a shot and see what happens Michael Naab March at am The hourly rate is about as low as you should see as long as you screen out the crappy paying requesters something I outline in the ebook That was mostly if youre going to sit there for an hour thats what you can expect to get including time waiting for another good HIT to pop up The HITs themselves may have much higher pay rates Ive had batches of work come out where its cents each and I can hammer out in a minute thats hour A lot of it depends on being on there at the right time but its certainly possible to make more than that The flexibility is also key though Theres always some work available and even a couple bucks a day adds up at the end of the year J Money March at pm I havent done mTurks in a few months but when I started I made about in a month I did do some of it during the normal business hours but with a fulltime job it wasnt always possible I spent most of my time doing it when I came home from work This was the time I spent making dinner and watching sports I figure hey why not fire up the laptop and do HITs while watching basketball or football I only do it for the extra money to put in my savings or if I need something on Amazon I take it as I am making money when I otherwise wouldnt be The most I made in one day was about bucks I might pick it up again J Money March at pm Michael Naab March at am It might be comparable to what youd make at McDonalds but most people that want to make a couple extra bucks arent going to pick up a job there If I have to fill out an application wear their lovely uniform work a hour shift and deal with angry customers at McDonalds or sit on your couch while watching TV to make some extra money its not a hard choice for me haha Michael Naab March at am The beauty of it is being able to do it whenever you want If youre trying to make a lot of money with it you probably need to do it during normal business hours but if youre just looking to make a few extra bucks on the side its perfect when youre just hanging out at random times of the day Even a couple bucks a day is a nice night out once a month I tried a local equivalent of this for a while but I couldnt get a reasonable pay out it compared to the hours I was putting in It felt really silly doing that so I stopped The only convenient thing was that you can indeed do it whenever wherever Michael Naab March at pm Of all of the survey sites I found this one was the best The others seemed like a waste of time getting screened out of stuff constantly and not getting compensated This one has worked a lot better for me Mrs CTC FromCostToCoast March at pm Janeen March at am I usually try to pour my efforts into actions that will result in long term more passive income but this is intriguing I think Ill dip my toes in today and see what happens Heading over to snag the book Michael Naab March at pm Im also trying some ways to build up income more passively passive income is actually the subject of my next ebook that Im working on but I look at mturk as a good way to kind of fill in the cracks so to speak Theres just a lot of flexibility so I try to be as efficient as possible while not taking away from the other things that I have going on Brad B March at am Michael Naab March at pm There are a number of scripts that you can add to your browser that automate certain things on there that allow you to use your time more efficiently I talk in more detail about this in the ebook There are also forums where people talk about all things mturk Some of those people are very hardcore turkers and write their own code or scripts that help automate some of the more repetitive work that some requesters put out there Looked at mturk years or so ago when we were using it to generate training data for some machine learning algorithms we were working on Its interesting and you get out what you put in but in the end youre earning around minimum wage basically trading time for money and at the lower end of the scale to get some schedule flexibility Great as a side hustle for someone who needs some flexible spending cash but its not going to make you rich Id rather invest my time working towards building a more passive income stream If I wanted to do this on Amazon Id look at setting up an Amazon FBA sideline or perhaps some retail arbitrage Michael Naab March at pm I definitely wouldnt recommend it as a primary source of income but I think its a useful side hustle for someone looking to put some extra cash in their pockets Michelle March at pm Michael Naab March at pm Yetisaurus March at pm I gave Mechanical Turk a whirl for a few weeks and earned a whopping It was really hard to find HITs that they would let newbies do and often it was transcribing a grocery store receipt a few mins work for literally a few pennies I tried to get more and more qualifications thinking that would open up more lucrative work possibilities I spent a few hours getting qualified to do transcribing and some other tasks But no HITs opened up for those things All I kept seeing was the tasks Also once I had a dispute about a task I signed up for a survey that was supposed to pay out a few bucks Hooray I thought I answered about questions and then it said I had to click this other link to answer a few more questions to get credit I clicked the link and it sent me to this other survey I finally answered about questions in total and then it said that based on my answers I wasnt in the demographic they were looking for to complete the real survey so they didnt have to pay me anything Give me a break They got real substantive answers from me not just prescreening answers I made a complaint through Amazon Turks customer service email and they basically said they dont resolve disputes between workers and the listing company So that company is free to continue posting and taking advantage of workers and Amazon doesnt really care That was the last straw Done Ive got better things to do than spend hours trying to qualify and find tasks to get paid a measly Im glad to hear that someones making money on that thing but I wouldnt give it another try I feel like the system is set up to take advantage of the workers Michael Naab March at pm There are definitely some scammy requesters on the site those grocery receipts are horrible and I would recommend that nobody ever do them One of the scripts that you can add to your browser is called Turkopticon which allows users to rate requesters on several metrics including pay Any requester that offers crappy pay or is known to have long screeners that eventually boot you out without compensation are typically always rated very low on pay allowing you to avoid these types of HITs and be more selective with what you work on That script is absolutely essential to effectively working on there How does posting tasks work Is this a good way to crowd source out work Have a huge range of global workers available at minimum wage looks like there is some opportunity in creating side hustles that pay significantly more and crowd source the work Michael Naab March at pm Its a great way to crowd source work out There are constantly people working at all hours on mturk so you should be able to get whatever work youre looking to have done quickly as long as the pay is fair enough to entice workers I cant speak to the specifics of posting tasks but mturk and other forums have plenty of resources to help requesters with what theyre trying to accomplish Aliyyah RichAndHappyBlog March at pm Ive used Amazon Mechanical Turk before but never thought of it as a serious money maker This is making me reconsider Michael Naab March at pm There are definitely tools that can help you make more serious money on there Its all just a matter of how much time you want to put into it Heather Simply Save March at pm I recently signed up for Mechanical Turk but havent actually done anything with it yet Thanks for giving the DL With my FT job I dont think Id make a ton with MTurk Glad to know some of this before I put a ton of time into it Michael Naab March at pm Youre welcome It wouldnt be bad to check out in your free time Even with full time work you can still find work on there at other times that will at least give you some extra income Thats how I looked at it when I first started out At least I was being more productive then just binging on netflix haha Dr Beard March at am Ha This is timely Weve been working up a survey to drop on Mechanical Turn for my research group Michael may be working for me soon and Ill be getting paid to travel all over the world presenting the results from his work Mwuhahahaevil laugh Michael Naab March at pm Hahaha Ill be on the look out for it so I can give you good results and help you make a lot of money off of it This sounds too good to be true I have worked on mturk for about years I make about or an hour I only work a little bit and make a few hundred dollars a year And the people that put jobs on there can be ruthless If you make a mistake you get blocked and if you get so many blocks you cannot work at all on mturk There is no negotiation or communication sometimes too with these problems Im sorry I posted before reading the comments I see he answers a lot of questions about this Feel free to delete all my comments Thanks Investment
