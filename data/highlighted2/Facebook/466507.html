class='textDiv'>Why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Will Keep Growing Digital Marketers Matter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Investors focus too much on user numbers when its actually Facebooks great ad products that will drive this growth story Marketers believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ads offer the best ROI the rollout of Dynamic Ads will make Instagram just as valuable too Facebooks biggest threat from another social media company comes in the form of Snapchat Partners and its Snap Ads Between Stories Even if Snapchat succeeds mobile digital ad spending wont be a zerosum game if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>keeps its users engaged and marketers happy it will keep growing Usually when a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB bear thesis emerges you can expect an argument centered around one or more of the following valuation concerns questionable moves by Zuckerberg or decline in popularity among teens I feel these concerns are overblown Worse the underlying bear thesis often misses the most important element of the story digital marketers or Facebooks actual customers My fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Alex Pitti argued that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is slowing again as its most trendy product Instagram is losing the popularity battle to Snapchat Private CHAT among teens He raises valid points but I have to respectfully disagree with his conclusion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is indeed slowing First to address concerns that changes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are alienating users With over billion monthly active users MAU on Facebookcom million monthly active users on Instagram billion users on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger and billion users on WhatsApp it is hard to say what user growth percentage is acceptable here for Facebooks growth story What isnt hard to say is that the connectedness of its properties combined with their enormous userbases form a powerful network effect And that network effect should keep users within the broader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>ecosystem The image below illustrates this effect as first described over years ago by Theodore Vail of Bell Telephone Each additional telephone increases the value of every individual telephone because more calls can be made By definition a byproduct of a network effect is switching costs from one product to a similar less popular one This network effect insulates <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>from the whims of teenagers And this actually may draw teenagers in one day as they look to expand their social networks with older generations While user numbers are of paramount importance to social media companies they do not tell the whole story That is why Twitter NYSE TWTR is worth less than of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>despite million monthly active users I wont argue that Facebooks properties will grow or shrink by an arbitrary number in the hundreds of millions because of some social trend Ive seen in my crystal ball Truth be told if I could accurately predict how billions of peoples will behave on social media in the coming years Mark Zuckerberg would probably be speed dialing me right now with an executive job offer What I will do is lay out how the mobile digital marketing industry responsible for over of Facebooks total revenue last quarter functions And I will explain why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will continue to successfully monetize its enormous platforms To do so I spoke with a friend who works in the space to provide more color on how the industry works He explained how there are ad marketplaces for all the different major platforms and mediums of digital advertising Lets say a major corporation wants to develop an ad campaign to achieve certain goals within a budget This corporation then decides that it wants to go with digital ads as its medium The next step for it would be to contract a digital marketing firm to develop and execute a strategy to decide which digital medium desktop or mobile to use Decide which platforms to use within that medium Place bids in the marketplace for the desired ad space And ensure all this is not only coming in under budget but also hitting the benchmarks set forth by the corporation As investors its our job to figure out how this digital marketing firm will decide where to spend the money According to eMarketer mobile digital ad spending is the fastest growing and eventually largest segment of all mediums in ad spending The future of social media stocks will be decided by which company will earn that spending The number marketers are concerned with isnt total monthly active users The most important number to them is return on investment ROI The graph below is from a Simply Measured research report survey released last month Measuring ROI came in first by a wide margin Similar challenges such as tying social to business goals and understanding performance across social channels show up big as well My takeaway from this is simple Demonstrating good ROI is the best way to win over marketers increase demand for your platforms ad space and grow revenue In this regard <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has distinguished itself over its peers The results shown below from another recent Simply Measured survey speaks volumes of social marketers responded that Facebookcom provided the best ROI and another responded that Instagram did Only a measly of respondents answered Snapchat When taking into account the actual products <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offers this makes a lot of sense <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offers great metrics such as Clicks to Website Mobile App Installs Website Conversions and Page Post Engagement to help measure ROI for customers Last year Facebookcom also rolled out Dynamic Product ads Dynamic Product ads allow a marketer to target specific audiences that may be more likely to buy a product due to their online activity likes and interests This leverages Facebooks biggest competitive advantage over other platforms Its a treasure trove of data on its users Dynamic Product ads put into practice the idea that users dont hate ads they hate bad ads A major opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to improve those Instagram numbers shown above will be the rollout of Dynamic Ads on Instagram in the coming months There will be a couple changes to the Instagram version There will be a unit dedicated to the Travel sector and a feature to be even more specific in which audiences a company can target This is a tremendous opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to fully monetize its Instagram platform and continue reaping the benefits of being the leader in a rapidly expanding digital advertising market A big threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>might be Snapchats rollout of Snapchat Partners Its a comprehensive advertising platform that will allow companies to work with third parties such as marketing firms to buy and develop enormous video advertising campaigns It could be a game changer as Snapchat video ads cover the entire screen and play sound two features <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has yet to figure out Snapchat generated million in revenue last year with its Sponsored Story Geofilter and Sponsored lenses ads We can expect this number to balloon as companies work with marketers to utilize Snapchats newest product Snap Ads Between Stories to create groundbreaking ad campaigns For those unfamiliar with Snapchat stories are video posts that users upload and display to all their friends for a hour window A lot of the fun in Snapchat is watching your friends stories to see what they are up too And this is usually followed by sending a snap to them if it looks interesting or you want to speak with them This shouldnt be too threatening to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>though Facebookcom and Instagram ads are fundamentally different from Snapchat With mobile digital ad spending growing at the rate it is expected to grow it will not be a zerosum game Snapchat also still faces many hurdles the least of which is demonstrating to marketers that these Snap Ads have good ROI The nature of Snapchat makes it difficult to measure actionable activity such as website visits app installs or purchases In fact clicking the ad will actually skip over it entirely Snapchat also still hasnt overcome what many said was Facebooks biggest threat in introducing ads Snapchat needs to be able to create meaningful ads for marketers that users dont find intrusive or raise privacy concerns <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has already shown with its native ads on Facebookcom and Instagram that it can successfully navigate these issues Snapchat will need to prove the same Many people focus too much on how new features will move the needle on user numbers for social media companies It is just as important to understand how the companies are actually generating revenue ie whats important to their customers Also Im not telling you that Snapchat isnt a threat to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>after all Mark Zuckerberg had a good reason to want to buy it Im just saying that taking out <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>wont be as simple as winning a popularity contest among teens Mobile digital ad spending is projected to catch up to TV ad spending in the United States at of total ad spending by for a total of billion from billion or right now If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>keeps developing new features that engage users and satisfy marketers it will be in prime position to capture increased mobile ad spending and generate great stock returns for years to come Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
