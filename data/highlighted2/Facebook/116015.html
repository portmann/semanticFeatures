The story broke recently that Twitter was toying with the idea of calling Project Lightning "Moments."This is an interesting tell for what the future holds.Obviously it has become the new buzzword for social media figures as of late.What I find interesting about this name is Twitter already has a product called Moments .It isn't a popular feature, but it must be analyzed to see what this new Moments will be like.Right now when you go to the 2014 Moments page it has the top events of the year.Each moment has a few correlated tweets.Overall, it is fairly barren.I know curation limits the amount of content per event, but there aren't many tweets even after you click 'Explore Now'.The other tab has Perspectives which shows the top five tweets of the year for some popular accounts along with the top five correlated accounts.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This tab may not be relevant for the new Moments feature. (Uncertainty) </span>The Moments which will be released in the late summer or fall will obviously be more integrated with mobile than this website.The content needs to be more extensive.What will set this bland website apart from the actual feature is the use of Periscope.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>I know the company may have been working on Project Lightning before it acquired Periscope, but I think it may have been a flop without it. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If you imagine what Moments could look like without Periscope, there is only a certain amount of improvement you can have with 140-character tweets and some pictures and videos. (Uncertainty) </span>I am expecting Moments to be the coming out party for Periscope.Even with the bland website, adding Periscope would instantly improve it.Seeing a few tweets about a topic will quickly inform you, preparing you for the Periscope event you are about to see.A lot of viewers watching Periscope are in the dark about what is going on in the stream when they initially click on it.Having additional information should clarify what is happening.It is the equivalent of having an article with a few sentences previewing a YouTube video, followed by the actual video posted at the bottom.It also correlates channels together making it easy to only look for 'scopes' about the specific event.Of course this whole process means that Twitter must allow 'scopes' to last more than 24 hours as I have mentioned in a previous article .<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>As an investor, I have been a long-term believer in Twitter's future for a while. (Uncertainty) </span>The problem with the stock in the near term is twofold.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>There is legitimate uncertainty regarding who the CEO will be. (Uncertainty) </span>There is also negative investor sentiment.This is not a good combination.Since I don't know who the CEO will be, it makes me lose my edge as to where the stock will go which motivates me to sit on the sidelines.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>More importantly, I am worried about the next quarter's results. (Uncertainty) </span>The MAU number actually came in line with what was expected by analysts last quarter; other metrics missing estimates caused the stock to collapse.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In Chris Sacca's blog post , he mentions the possibility of a MAU decline in the future. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #F5B7B1'>Since, none of the positive changes I have discussed have actually been implemented yet, the possibility of a MAU disappointment is possible. (Surprise & Uncertainty) </span>If this occurs, no matter what the Periscope downloads end up being the stock will go down.I'm positioning myself to buy the stock after the earnings report and before Project Lightning/Moments is released.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>The positivity from the launch may help the stock in the near term. (Uncertainty) </span>More importantly, it should increase engagement in the long term.If the stock does go down after earnings, I don't expect any CEO announcement to cause further pain.Even though I have been positive on the stock I have yet to initiate a long-term position.I wanted to purchase shares when it was at $29 last year, but I didn't have cash available.You can decide to follow my timing strategy for when to purchase it or you can choose to ignore it.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Either way I believe the stock will go higher in the long term and you should own it.
