yield and more check out the ETF Hub ETF Hub What I find most encouraging about FBs last quarter is what Wall Street criticized most This difference shows the shortsightedness of the market unable to realize what FB is doing now is necessary for longterm growth Because FB is focused on the future and not the present I bought more stock and believe its outlook is better than ever For a company as well covered as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and with as many users it has on a single platform the companys recent earnings release has by now been dissected from all angles Investors have already looked at the good and bad with one thing in particular being considered bad and thats the companys high RD Facebooks high spending was considered a big reason for the stocks postearnings decline The companys decision to spend over billion on RD during its last quarter had a negative impact on margins and is considered by many to be discouraging However Facebooks decision to spend so aggressively is the single greatest thing I liked about the quarter prompting me to buy more shares You might ask why I am so bullish on higher spending and the answer is simple <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a company with many moving parts it has an enormous user base and must figure how to monetize these things as effectively as possible It costs money to gain this knowledge to perform the research needed and to ensure that once a product is implemented it doesnt destroy the user experience <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>now has over billion monthly users on its core platform over million of which are daily active users We already know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the largest network in the world but the question is how to better monetize that network so it creates well over the billion in revenue from last quarter As explained in a Venture Beat article <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has invested in worldrenowned researchers and acquisitions of startups that could one day give it highly intelligent algorithms to more effectively pair ads with consumers of interest We have seen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>do this in recent years which is why the companys advertising prices have soared triple digits year after year In essence advertisers are more willing to pay when their ads result in site traffic higher placement or sold products and services With <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>reportedly testing a Buy button the opportunity to increase its appeal among site advertisers continues to rise but to keep the momentum RD spending is necessary Furthermore there are a lot of new opportunities to monetize within Facebooks core site The company has successfully become a legitimate player in the video space It now has more than four billion video views per day across its PC and mobile app Thats up from billion in the fourth quarter and just one billion in the third Once more RD was needed to determine how to make videos successful and now that volume has spiked the company has the opportunity to monetize that viewership Reportedly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is selling hour video advertising spots for north of million per day multiple slots days a year Thats one way to monetize because even with two slots sold per day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could earn an extra billion in annual revenue and this is revenue that doesnt even account for the four billion views of nonadvertised videos The bottom line is that with each new product <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>unveils the potential to monetize is created Video is one of these new servicesproducts for the company but with billion monthly users the opportunities to expand into new categories are seemingly endless For example <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also disclosed that it now has over one billion daily searches on its mobile app alone Eventually mobile search will become an monetization opportunity just like timeline ads but once more knowing how and when to monetize requires RD All things considered it costs money to make money and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a true testament to that old saying Personally I find it highly encouraging that the company spent nearly of its quarterly revenue on RD and honestly I wish it had spent more Particularly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not one of these cloud or big data tech companies spending of its revenue on marketing and lowering the prices on services It is spending on tangible items things that increase the value of its platform all the while raising ad prices instead of lowering That said <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may look like a mountain of opportunities based on the information presented thus far but we havent even scratched the surface of the many applications that it owns that have equally great monetization potential These include WhatsApp Messenger and Instagram which have million million and million users respectively While Messengers user base is the same as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it is an entirely different platform for the company to monetize Earlier this year the company unveiled the Messenger Platform which I explained could mean billions of annual revenue for the company longterm However for Messenger to reach this point it had to test source codes within the app hire David Marcus and find compatible partners all of which required RD As for WhatsApp and Instagram those two services still arent being monetized that well Given what the company is spending on RD my guess is that it wont be long though Were talking about enormous platforms where <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>not only owns the PC in many categories but also smartphones via applications While many investors sold shares in fear that higher RD and lower operating margins could become a trend I bought more stock as I am now more bullish than ever The reason I think higher RD will continue to translate into higher revenue and profits longterm as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has yet to give me one reason to doubt the direction in which it is headed
