<span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has seen shares fall as a result of recent macro volatility But what this has done is create an opening for a value buy when viewing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in relation to comparable peers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB shares just put in a brutal August after having a breakout July But with the entirety of the August selloff in my opinion being macrofear driven I think its important to remember that the core <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>bull thesis and all that it encompasses still holds firm A big part of that longterm bull thesis is in Facebooks superiority to peers when it comes to mobile user acquisition This superiority was just confirmed by a polling done by Venture Beat Insights VB Insights VB Insights states <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is outpacing every other available platform in user acquisition NYSE UA and not by a little Mobile publishers say that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is X better at UA than its closest rivals Obviously this matters now has mattered and will continue to matter going forward But I actually think the valueprop for Facebooks core platform the Facebookapp at this point although the polling is unclear as to whether it was directed at the app specifically or the comprehensive platform inclusive of Instagram etc is growing and that Facebooks positioning in relation from a spatial standpoint could drive its share price higher by sheer force of EPS multiple expansion When I look around tech in general and I see a super high velocity of MA for companies involved in mobile app consulting optimization and tailoring as detailed a bit in a recent Salesforcecom NYSE CRM note I think this lends itself well to the valuation for the platform for most effectively deploying mobile user acquisition strategies I mean if companies are getting frothy in buying companies that make the app experience catered towards user acquisitionretention once the user gets to the app what does that say about the value of the platform that directs the users in the first place I think it says theres no way that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>should trade in line to peers from an EPS multiple standpoint to which it does Now I put the words peers in quotations because frankly I dont view <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as having a peer Clearly neither do publishersmarketersadvertisers see polling sourced above But I dont need to hammer that point home I think were all pretty much aware of that So then why is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>trading at X PE when Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO trades at X PE and Weibo NASDAQ WB trades at X Is it a size issue Do investors think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cant grow into a billion market cap whereas the market thinks Yahoo can grow into its billion market cap Or is it a saturation issue Because that doesnt really make sense either Its way way more efficient to grow margin when you dont have customer acquisition costs to offset <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is largely working into its user base at this point The hard part is over I mean LinkedIn NYSE LNKD trades at X PE although I will concede its a much less mature overall model I think that theres a valuation bull case to be made for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and frankly I would be saying the same thing at FB at Apparently the analyst community agrees with me Analysts reporting to Thomson have a median price target for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>of or higher from the most recent close The high target on the Board is which is where I could really see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares settling in if the market wanted to fairly value the company based on its positioning in the space I just look at its PE being in line with a Yahoo and I have to disagree with that Theres no way this should be taking place <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also has nearterm growth and value prop drivers that are high visibility Instant Articles Mentions Moments Lite etc Maybe the worst part about Facebooks current valuation is that all of this is known and all of this is modeled in Guys the analyst community outside of pounding the table with price targets has modeled in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for sequential and rapid revenue EBITDA and EPS expansion for full year full year and full year Whats even more egregious when viewing Facebooks comp company EPS multiple is that these estimates have all doubled since initiation thanks to positive revisions Ill be clearer Analysts typically initiate a cohort year say estimates several years in advance Theyre sometimes lower at initiation than the actual results turn out to be as the actual calendar date moves closer to the cohort year being modeled theyre sometimes higher A lot of change can happen in a few years But rarely at least in my following of analyst modeling do you ever see estimates for such a highly followed company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>doubling from initiation to realization Thats incredibly rare But thats exactly whats taken place with this name For me that obviously speaks to the constant innovation taking place at <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and is maybe the single largest reason why the stock should be valued at a premium to peers from a valuation multiple standpoint It just should <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>until it proves that it no longer can should be valued at price plus premium to peers plus premium for forwardlooking innovation When viewing the company through that lens the current EPS discount to peers is embarrassing I think that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is an excellent value buy at current pricing I continue to recommend a long position and I continue to be long via longdated CALL options Disclosure I amwe are long FB MoreI
