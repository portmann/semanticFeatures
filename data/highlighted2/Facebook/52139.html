asset class performance yield and more check out the ETF Hub ETF Hub MGI would help add value to WU strengthening areas of concern However FB remains the biggest risk and acquiring MGI does not protect WU from these risks MoneyGram Internationals NASDAQ MGI stock soared over on a report that Western Union NYSE WU is in talks to acquire the company The deal would combine the number one and two money transfer providers but in a highly fragmented market the combined market share would equal just worldwide Still JPMorgan thinks the deal could result in EPS growth if under a share for MoneyGram and could also provide pricing power while also increasing Western Unions global footprint and adding to the growth seen in electronic transfer products However while MoneyGram would address several problems its still not a solution for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Just two months ago <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB unveiled the Messenger Platform at its f conference and immediately I explained how this platform could lead to billions of dollars in annual revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>While consumers remain focused on the user to business experience thats created from the Messenger Platform the real opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is in payments Among the many new services associated with Messenger <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>announced it would have payment and money transfer capabilities after months of speculation Right now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>only allows users to send money to one another usertouser and to pay retailers or service providers for goods However there is a vast opportunity for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to incorporate bill pay and to partner with retailers and other companies with a large brickandmortar presence to allow for instore money pickup of Messenger sent funds Most importantly <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is currently providing the service for free whereas competitors like Western Union and MoneyGram charge a fee Therefore Western Union has a big problem on its hand It faces a competitor with a network of million users plus Messenger that is offering its core service for free Specifically of Western Unions business is currently at risk that which offers consumertoconsumer services Albeit most investors realize that where Facebooks strongest is in the US where its revenue per user and user engagement is highest Chances are <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will have the highest volume of money transfers in the US at least initially That said if Western Union acquires MoneyGram it will bolster the companys exUS position MoneyGram earns of its revenue from nonUS and US outbound transfers a business that grew in the companys last quarter in constant currency This would at least provide a nice hedge against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>if its money sending services begin to experience rapid user adoption initially Furthermore a big risk facing Western Union is that Facebooks money service targets all of its growth products During Western Unions last quarter it had transaction growth from electronic channels like westernunioncom in its large consumertoconsumer business Thats down from transaction growth in Westernunioncom during the fourth quarter These electronic channels now account for of Western Unions total sales and are growing fast for a company whose overall revenue declined Meanwhile MoneyGrams growth comes from selfservice transfer products These include online channels but also doityourself kiosks at top retailers like CVS MoneyGrams selfservice transfer revenue jumped and now accounts for of the total Importantly the kiosks business is not directly targeted by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at the moment as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is yet to partner with a retailer where users can pick up sent funds The bottom line is that MoneyGram does strengthen Western Union in certain ways those markets where Western Union is at most risk But it still leaves Western Union at great risk depending on what moves <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>makes next In addition Western Union is about four times larger than MoneyGram by revenue meaning that its very large consumertoconsumer business is still at risk regardless of whether it acquires MoneyGram Also if <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does cause an accelerated decline in Western Unions revenue from the adoption of money transfers its stock is sure to fall and JPMorgan already noted that stock would likely be involved in any MoneyGram takeout because of its high debt load All things considered MoneyGram seems like a good fit for Western Union but it is not a fix and certainly not enough to feel good about a longterm investment with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>right around the corner in its core payments business Source Western Union Buying MoneyGram Doesnt Solve Potential <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Problem Disclosure The
