Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has launched a pilot program which will allow users to directly purchase tickets for events from its site and app This program will compete with other entrants in this field including Priceline which launched a similar initiative a few days back <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc NASDAQ FB has launched a pilot program in which Eventbrite and Ticketmaster are integrated within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which allows users to complete registration and book events on its platform Earlier users could select the events they wanted to visit but had to leave <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to complete the payment process on a third party platform The new program guarantees a seamless purchasing experience and also provides <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>additional information of which events are actually purchased and the buying pattern of individual users Currently the process for Eventbrite and Ticketmaster are slightly different Eventbrite is more closely integrated and it extracts user information like name email and payment information from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>After an event is selected by users Eventbrite provides them with a QR code quick response code which is used to gain entry to the event For Ticketmaster users have to click Buy Tickets which will redirect them to Ticketmasters site within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>where the purchase is completed It also does not provide a QR code to users but provides an online ticket which needs to be printed or the user can select mailing of tickets to their home Users can test this program on their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>desktop site or iOS and Android app A similar initiative was launched by Priceline NASDAQ PCLN a major player in online travel booking It has started using AI to provide personalized event booking options based on past user preferences and purchases However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is in a much better position to exploit this market due to higher customer engagement and wider use of the event platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has stated that within this program there is no revenue sharing with Eventbrite or Ticketmaster However it shows the commitment of the company to be an allinone platform for social commerce It also increases the ability of the company to keep users within its platform As more information is available about the final purchases the company can use them to display more targeted advertisement There is also a very high probability that the company will eventually move to revenue sharing once this program gains enough traction There is a general concern among investors about the slowing growth of monthly active users MAUs in North America and Europe which provide the major portion of Facebooks revenue In the past eight quarters the MAUs have increased from million to million in the US Canada showing a growth of per year Similarly Europe has seen an increase in MAUs from million to million a growth of per year These two regions have probably reached Peak <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>limit and might see low singledigit or flat growth in the future However the bigger story is the vast untapped monetization potential of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in different spheres including payments travel transportation ecommerce and more It is important to note the ARPU Average revenue per user growth in the US Canada as this market has reached maturity in terms of user growth It shows the monetization potential of the company in other markets in the future as the features of the domestic market are rolled out in other markets In the US Canada the ARPU grew from to in the past four quarters giving a growth rate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has launched a pilot program which will allow users to book events on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>without leaving the platform The company has partnered with Eventbrite and Ticketmaster for this program and is not involved in revenue sharing It should allow the company to deliver greater targeted advertisement to its users by gaining information about the purchasing preferences of its users Although the MAUs in the US Canada market have reached maturity the company has significant untapped monetization potential which can continue to deliver high revenue growth as new features are added This stock remains a strong buy for
