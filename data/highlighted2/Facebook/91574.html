Alpha FB recently began testing a News Feed feature called See First that allows users to set preferences on visibility This is a third News Feed option that will run in parallel with FriendUnfriend and FollowUnfollow FB is working to further refine the News Feed to make it more attractive to users but also to gather deeper analytics about users and what is important to them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is further dialingin its allimportant News Feed only this time the refining will be done by you instead of an algorithm Thats right This time it will be done by the user A new button was spotted today by a group of select users as first reported by techcrunchcom which offers the opportunity to prioritize the News Feed on a person by person or business by business basis This button See First is Facebooks latest testing of yet another method of collecting data that it will use to make more attractive its pitch to advertisers As Ive detailed in prior articles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is wellknown for testing forward looking initiatives in small sizes even if at a complete loss as was the case with Poke and Paper but always the testing is a means to an end for something much larger Poke eventually led to Messenger and the purchase of Whatsapp while Paper was the predecessor to Instant Articles See First in my opinion is a testing that will have several means to an end that will benefit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The first is it will help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>determine how restrictive to make its News Feed algorithm in regards to showing you what I call unrecognized content items like memes and other nonfriend generated content content that is shared or liked or commented but not actually generated by the organic friend tree <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been fairly transparent with its algorithm changes lately in evidencing that it wants to cap this type of material before it ruins the experience of the platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is no stranger to viral content farmers and viral content aggregators and knows the level of annoyance for users these can create The second is that in helping its algorithm determine each users tolerable level of unrecognized content because youre not going to follow somebody who constantly posts this type of content without enjoying what youre seeing in your News Feed See First will also identify key influencers in your News Feed In that and this is brilliant I believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will also be able to identify how to better advertise to the downchain News Feed Meaning the News Feed of the influencer Meaning me if Im electing to See First this friend Imagine a scenario where Im following and electing to See First say a fitness enthusiast friend who is also constantly promoting paid or unpaid a particular protein shake brand Does it stand to be more effective for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to advertise this brand in my News Feed or to auction off the rights to a competitor I think that this is the next natural step for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to test to see if at scale the preferred outcomes generated are at higher levels of efficacy based on the data gathered from See First Of course this is something <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will do If so See First is going to be huge If not well at least <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>got to dialin its algorithm My guess is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does in fact show a greater efficacy level in driving preferred outcomes based on what is already known about advertising in general That word of mouth is the single most influential driver to a purchase decision This is why Instagram has a purpose in the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc ecosystem greater than simply facilitating entertainment People taking photos of themselves are in essence visual endorsements of product often included are hashtags helping identify brands This is a subject discussed in detail in the linked article so I wont further elaborate The point to be made here is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has taken incredible strides the last days or so in making visible the ways that its advertising pitch is being refined If you dont think that Madison Avenue is taking notice if you dont think that companies and brands are taking notice Im betting being long
