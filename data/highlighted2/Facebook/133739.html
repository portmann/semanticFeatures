settings or contact your network administrator verizon landlines copper FIOS verizon fios fix it yourself While plenty of Americans rush to acquire the latest and greatest in new telecom technology there are some that only need the basic phone service theyve had for decades But as weve seen on multiple occasions recently a number of traditional landline users are being left out in the cold as Verizon tries to transition customers awy from copper line service and to fiberoptic phone lines And for one elderly New Yorker Verizons apparent inflexibility resulted in months of having absolutely no service at all Its no secret that Verizon wants out of the copperwire landline phone business Copper is expensive fiddly to maintain and highly limited in how much data it can carry in a bandwidthhungry era Consumer advocates and Verizons own workers have accused the company of deliberately neglecting copper lines in an effort to push customers to fiber and the FCC recently fined the telecom titan million for failing to investigate complaints about rural phone service which is still largely copper Meanwhile some customers who depend on their landlines are having their maintenance and repairs ignored to the point where upgrades are the only way Verizon will maintain their service Roosevelt Island is highlighted in pink Thats what happened to a Consumerist readers family over the past two years Roosevelt Island is exactly what the name suggests a small island in the East River between Manhattan and Queens running parallel from roughly E th St to E th The geography of it is important although Roosevelt Island is nominally a New York City neighborhood like any of a hundred others when it comes to infrastructure it shares the challenges of any other small island when the cables that run to it are cut service is gone There are no easy workarounds and repairs take time Thats where reader Ts father lives Her dad is in his late s with some health issues and lives alone Phone service is vital to him for reaching his doctors his adult children and if necessary And yet on two occasions totaling up to three solid months over the course of a yearandahalf Verizon left him hanging high and dry Section Permalink Bookmark Section Share on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Share on Twitter After years of stable phone service through Verizon and its predecessor businesses Ts father had two huge outages in the last two years that eventually led to the family canceling their service November During a construction project a number of cables providing telephone and cable service to Roosevelt Island residents are accidentally sliced through Within hours service to Time Warner Cable customers and to Verizon FiOS customers is restored However outages persist for traditional Verizon phone subscribers November Several days after the incident roughly Roosevelt Island residents are still waiting for Verizon to fix their copperwire landline service November T asks staff of her fathers apartment building when phone service will be restored noting a sign in the lobby confirming that the problem affects the entire building She is told it will be another week or two November Verizon confirms that four cable bundles two fiber and two copper providing service to a total customers were cut in the accident Of those connections about were fiber that was easily restored within a few days Service to the remaining copperwire customers a spokesperson says will continue to be restored over the next couple of days Verizon provides a wireless on wheels trailer with wifi phones and iPads that customers may drop by and use during business hours December After a month without updates T starts asking around Building staff are surprised to hear that her fathers connection is still out as some customers in the building are apparently already back up and running T speaks with Verizon customer service which credits her fathers account for the entire month of November They tell her they expect service to be restored by December After providing her contact information to Verizon T receives a text message confirming that a service ticket has been created and a service appointment is set for December between am and pm I didnt recall making a repair appointment T said but since my father would be home that day if they needed to send someone over to get him back up that would be fine December The tech shows up on time but hes not there to fix the copper hes there to say that Verizon cant repair the copper lines and the service will have to be upgraded to fiber Ts father refuses the tech says that someone will have to call Verizon to schedule a new repair appointment and leaves December A Verizon representative leaves a voicemail for T she calls back During their conversation the Verizon rep says the same thing the tech did that the copper service cant be repaired and Ts father will have to be upgraded to fiber to continue receiving service This sounds questionable to T who is pretty sure that other customers have had their old service restored T tells the Verizon rep that she is going to check with her fathers building to see if all the other customers had to be switched over to fiber too T then calls Verizons customer service again and speaks with another representative The second rep says that there is an external outage in the area that customers in Ts fathers building are still without service and that no repair tech will need to be sent to the apartment to restore service The second rep confirms that the outage will absolutely be fixed by January at pm T starts asking around on Twitter and hears that at least one other Roosevelt Island customer had their landline service fixed within a week of the outage without being swapped to fiber January Still no service T calls Verizon once again and receives an automated recording saying that service will be restored no later than January at pm T speaks with a representative who confirms the new deadline for repair is January and that Ts father is one of customers in the building still without service T asked to know why different Verizon employees kept telling her different things and if her elderly fathers repair could be expedited The rep told T he would put a note on her fathers account noting that her father is elderly and that someone would call her the next day to update her on the status Frustrated T blogs about the experience and starts emailing Verizons corporate communications team January A representative from Verizon calls T to tell her that there is a repair tech on the island to fix her fathers service as they speak T also notes that the rep called her by the nickname she blogs under not the full legal name she has been using with them so far Four hours later Ts fathers phone service is finally restored He has not been upgraded to fiber somehow Verizon managed to fix the copperwire service after all and ahead of their frequentlyrevised estimate T revises her blog post to include the update and two full months after the service outage began her father can once again finally call his family and his doctors Hallelujah July Roosevelt Island residents cant catch a break A second different construction project in the area also doesnt watch where theyre digging and cuts phone cables to Roosevelt Island Again The outage is widespread affecting residents businesses and public safety organizations in Roosevelt Island Verizon tells customers including T that they will have the outage resolved by July July T receives a voicemail from Verizon saying that a FiOS tech had tried to come by to restore service at her fathers apartment but that nobody was home Theres just one big problem Neither T nor her father had ever scheduled a FiOS service appointment He still did not want fiber phone service finding it more expensive and also less reliable especially during a power outage and there was no reason for FiOS to think there was a scheduled tech appointment for T and her father to miss T called Verizon to find out what was going on A representative told her that according to the information he had available the copperwire service could no longer be repaired and the only possible way to restore her dads service was to switch to fiber T asked the rep pointblank if Verizon had cut off her fathers service in order to force him to switch She writes suddenly he sounded nervous She says the customer service rep told her We havent cut it off we have to run a line test to assist Let me look more closely at the notes on the account There was an outage the outage was restored let me see what my line test says Current issue that Im getting is a voltage issue which is a network issue so I can put the ticket in here so they can work to restore that but there is a notation here that again there is a request to resolve the issue permanently by going to fiber optic T reiterated to Verizon that her father was not interested in fiber the rep responded with a long spiel about copper wire being too old and prone to failure After arguing the matter back and forth T pressed for a deadline by which she could see her fathers service restored the rep told her that if they were able to resolve the issue service should be restored by pm tomorrow July If not they would contact her to set up an appointment for a tech to come to the apartment July Service is not restored and Verizon does not call July T goes up the ladder at Verizon once again emailing corporate communications and threatening to take her fathers story to local media Within a few hours she had a response from Verizons corporate office in Brooklyn T reports that the Verizon representative told her that the bottom line is that the copper will not be restored They refuse to do it theyre trying to convert everyone to fiber because its more reliable etc The copper is kaput The rep told T that he could send someone over tomorrow to install fiber and get her fathers phone reconnected T responded that she was very upset with how Verizon had been handling the situation and that if Verizon was refusing to reconnect her fathers traditional landline service that she and he would rather switch to VoIP through Time Warner Cable since he already has television service through them anyway The Verizon employee told T he understood July The next business day was a Friday T receives another voicemail from Verizon explaining that the scheduled FiOS technician arrived for an appointment but was unable to get in Neither T nor her father scheduled any technician The phone service remains out T has had enough of dealing with Verizon and files a complaint with New Yorks Public Utilities Commission July The PUC responds telling T Since Verizon Communications LEC did not previously resolve this matter to your satisfaction we have escalated your concern to senior staff at the company We directed them to contact you and resolve the matter you brought to our attention In the next few days you will be contacted by a company representative to discuss your concerns and provide you with a resolution or a date by which the company expects to resolve your concern We have advised the company to reach a resolution with you as soon as possible The PUC also gives T a case number for her complaint and advises her to call them back if Verizon has not handled the matter to her satisfaction within two weeks July T receives five separate calls from various Verizon representatives all falling over themselves to explain to me why Dad had to switch to fiber T called one of them back to explain that her father would be switching carriers T had to specifically ask Verizon to stop sending unwanted technicians to her fathers apartment The Verizon employee she spoke with said The reason they keep coming is because theres a ticket in saying the only fix is to upgrade him to fiber T asked to have that notation removed from her fathers account so technicians would stop showing up at the door July The number for Ts fathers phone is successfully ported over to Time Warner Cable and the family cancels their Verizon service Section Permalink Bookmark Section Share on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Share on Twitter T and her dad are far from alone Its no secret that Verizon wants out of the copper wire business as soon as possible Theyve been trying to convert customers to fiber for years especially in the metro New York area Verizon has been asking their landline customers to upgrade since at least In recent months theyve gotten downright pushy telling customers from New Jersey to Virginia that they need to let Verizon upgrade them from copper to fiber ASAP or lose service altogether The company has also frequently chosen not to replace copper wire destroyed in disasters as in the miles of wiring wrecked during Hurricane Sandy in Customers in New York and New Jersey saw their service replaced with a wireless option first which didnt work very well and ended up replaced again with fiber optic cables Verizons tactics have not gone unnoticed the company has repeatedly faced accusations that they intentionally let their copperwire networks go to rot In a consumer advocacy group in California petitioned that states Public Utility Commission to investigate Verizons practices The group claimed that Verizon was deliberately neglecting the repair and maintenance of its copper network with the explicit goal of migrating basic telephone service customers who experience service problems and asked the commission to order Verizon to repair the service of copperbased landline telephone customers who have requested repair or wish to retain the copper services they were cut off of This year that accusation was echoed by a union representing Verizon employees In June the Communications Workers of America filed Freedom of Information Act requests with utility regulators in six midAtlantic and northeast states and DC claiming that the data would show that Verizon fails to meet their obligations for network maintenance and repair At the time the CWA said that the company abandons users particularly on legacy networks and customers across the country have noticed their service quality is plummeting Verizon responded at the time that the unions allegations were pure nonsense but the company is clearly unabashedly interested in retiring copper as quickly as they can We asked Verizon about Ts dads line and they confirmed that it suffered repeated problems affecting service However a representative told Consumerist Verizon no longer considers repairing that line which they confirmed doing in the past as the best solution for our customers The representative continued We want to make sure they have reliable and consistent service and the best way to provide that is over fiber optics a technology vs copper a s technology Verizon stressed repeatedly to Consumerist that the fiber upgrades they are pressuring Ts father and other landline customers to take are not the same as signing up for FiOS service nor is the change directly related to the broader IP transition All the services that are provided over copperfed telephone service are available and provided over fiber as well It is simply using a different method for simple telephone service Verizon told Consumerist We are not asking people to move to FiOS and subscribe to all TV Internet enhanced phone those services Telephone service over fiber goes though the same network as copperfed service It has nothing to do with the Internet FiOS Voice the enhanced telephone service offered as part of the FiOS package of services is IP But simple telephone service over fiber is not Several of the messages left for T specifically referenced FiOS service technicians as did some of the customer service representatives she spoke with They also referenced installing an optical network terminal in her fathers apartment a signal encodingdecoding device that Verizons support site explains as being part of FiOS service There is an irony in Verizon is pushing their fiber service on customers like Ts dad who dont want it even while tens of thousands of other New Yorkers are still waiting for their longpromised Verizon fiber to arrive Telecom Union Says Verizon Is Neglecting Landlines Verizon Tells Another Customer To Switch To Fiber Or Lose Landline Service FCC Proposal Phone Companies Need To Offer Backup Power Actually Notify You If They Kill Off Your CopperWire Landline I can see Verizon wanting to go to fibre optic I can also see reasons why some people want to remain with copper price and the availability of service during power outages Unfortunately copper is old technology and fibre is new The solution would seem to be how fibre is priced for those who want just basic telephone service If Verizon could price basic fibre at or near the cost of copper I think the dispute could be resolved Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience If you received an invitation to participate in the beta test
