by Alex Pitti IBM and the Federal Government are working on a centralized Bitcoin This is an oxymoron and will not work Intel will be hiring someone to do a similar project which will likely fail The use of the blockchain might help Samsung and IBM create products in the Internet of Things category Facebooks messenger payment system and Apple Pay will be disrupted by Bitcoin in the long run although they will succeed in the next few years I am bullish on the prospects for Bitcoin as its math is incredible The technology is decentralized and unhackable making it the future of money As a Bitcoin Pending COIN enthusiast I follow all of the news related to the cryptocurrency I have done two previous articles where Ive made stock indexes as a way to profit off of the adoption of Bitcoin as well as to track it in an innovative way I will be updating that index in a future article In this article I focus on the news about how IBM and the Federal Reserve are working on an alternative to Bitcoin My initial reaction was excitement but it quickly subdued as I looked into it more closely I will give you my analysis of the situation and how it affects Bitcoin and IBM NYSE IBM After this news came out another story was released that Intel NASDAQ INTC was also working on a Bitcoin alternative so Ill review that as well I will also look at how Apple NASDAQ AAPL Pay and Facebooks NASDAQ FB Messenger payment service will be disrupted by Bitcoin in the long term I have seen a few articles on Bitcoin on Seeking Alpha which state the currency will never amount to anything These writers likely are not involved with Bitcoin at all While I would not consider myself an expert on the matter I think I will be able to provide you with a more balanced discussion The reason why I got excited initially after I read these headlines is the Federal Government IBM and Intel were finally recognizing the gamechanging technology Bitcoin represents This is a compliment to the mathematics surrounding it as well as the potential for further expansion After looking at it more closely it seems as though IBM isnt enthralled with the decentralized nature of the currency It is trying to create a centralized government Bitcoin As others have Ill call it Govcoin The basic idea that I gleaned from the story is that IBM wants to use the blockchain and ignore Bitcoin Ill explain what the blockchain is for those who arent familiar with Bitcoin The blockchain is a public ledger that stores every transaction that has ever occurred using Bitcoin The blockchain has the list of transactions in chronological order with the most recent ones at the top Anyone with an internet connection can simply go to blockchaininfo to see the transactions occurring in real time It is important to understand that the entire Bitcoin network is anonymous This anonymity is the beauty of the blockchain The chart below attempts to convey the level of anonymity of Bitcoin compared to its level of privacy As you can see it is almost as anonymous as cash but is not private at all which puts it in the same league as campaign contributions The blockchain allows users that dont know each other to exchange funds For this scenario to work out trust needs to be eliminated between the two parties this is what the blockchain is able to do In a transaction using Bitcoin you are able to give the currency to another person without having them know any information about you you are pushing the Bitcoin to another party The way this works is through a proof of work function The nodes or miners in the chain solve these mathematical problems which allow a transaction to enter the ledger to form a block A group of linked blocks is called the blockchain The idea of the mathematical trapdoor is what allows Bitcoin to work because it is a way to make it so that Bitcoins cannot be reused This type of problem is easy to find a solution for but almost impossible to factor out meaning it cant be reversed If youre interested in this topic you can click here Getting back to IBM Govcoin will be a centralized form of Bitcoin It will be a public ledger that will be overseen by the Federal Government In my opinion this is the government trying to exploit the technology while still maintaining control of the money supply It was only a matter of time before the government tried to get involved with Bitcoin as it risks losing its power if Bitcoin takes off The Govcoin idea is akin to a year old man trying to be cool by taking a selfie He ends up failing miserably by putting his hand over the lens The Govcoin will not work out because the whole point of being decentralized is that it allows there to be no weak point that hackers can attack There is no central location that can be taken down this is why Bitcoin is unhackable A Govcoin will be easily hacked as a digital currency is the ultimate target for hackers IBM working on this project alone will not be able to defeat Bitcoin because it is opensourced IBM may have a lot of smart programmers employed but it cant beat the thousands working on Bitcoin The great thing for IBM is that the blockchain has many uses outside currencies Although it will fail to create Govcoin all opportunity is not lost The blockchain is like the internet The internet has many applications such as social and ecommerce The blockchains apps are mostly undiscovered This is where IBM can succeed IBM is working with Samsung OTCSSNLF in the Internet of Things area which will be supported by the blockchains proof of work technology This concept is known as ADEPT which stands for Autonomous Decentralized PeertoPeer Telemetry The firms are using BitTorrent Ethereum and TeleHash to work this project BitTorrent is a peertopeer file transfer protocol Ethereum is a decentralized opensource platform for applications to be developed You can watch this video to learn more about Ethereum TeleHash is a peertopeer messaging service This concept eliminates the middle man such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and allows people to communicate When you communicate on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>you are trusting that it wont be hacked or use your private data TeleHash eliminates this problem The Internet of Things use of blockchain technology is fascinating although it is in its early stages Intel is likely in an earlier stage as the new that was released this week was simply that it put out a job listing for a cryptographer with the description stating The Special Innovation Projects group within Intel Labs is looking for a researcher to investigate hardware and software capabilities that advance the performance robustness and scalability of open decentralized ledgers It will be interesting to see what Intel comes up with In other news it looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is attempting to use its messaging service as a peertopeer money transfer service that will disrupt the remittance and payments market This caused eBay stock to go down because the fees that PayPal charges may be squeezed It is important to recognize that even though this new payment system is being reported as a peertopeer system it is not one <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a third party in this situation so this not decentralized meaning it is vulnerable to an attack The concept is great for the medium term but will be crushed by Bitcoin in the long term An analogy for this is how Blackberry NASDAQ BBRY dominated the smartphone market in the early stages of mobile computing In the long term Apple and Android ended up defeating Blackberry It is possible that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>creates a way to integrate its technology of payments with Bitcoin The main point is that decentralized systems are superior to centralized ones It is difficult to see exactly how the future of Bitcoin will revolutionize the world in years but another product that will not exist or will be vastly different is Apple Pay Apple Pay is superior to credit cards but it is not as secure as Bitcoin because it is centralized Apple Pay still uses the dollar which has its money supply controlled by the whims of the Federal Reserve Bitcoins supply is controlled by math and cannot be changed The trust in Bitcoin is a trust in math Trust in Apple Pay is trust in man The reason why Apple and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>want control of our payment systems is to either collect a fee or have access to the users data Bitcoin has zero fees and has no privacy issues Personally I do not trust <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to control my data as it is in its interest to profit off of it In conclusion my opinion is that Govcoin will fail and Bitcoin will succeed Apple Pay and Facebooks messenger payment system will do well in the next to years but in the long run they will have to adapt to Bitcoin as it has far superior technology IBM is working on some interesting projects with Samsung regarding integrating blockchain technology with advancements in the internet of things These projects are very far off into the future so I would simply be happy as a shareholder of either of these companies that they are using resources to work on them I am bullish on Bitcoins future but I recognize that trading the currency is too risky for most investors Editors
