technology markets with many tech giants trying to penetrate it Google executes its strategy from another consumer electronic market in order to lead the market Virtual and Augmented Reality VRAR technologies are gaining traction and competition is getting more intense A number of tech giants have been mentioned as possible leaders for the evolving market However only one of them has a clear and proven strategy to win the market In this article I introduce the VRAR market Googles consumer electronics strategy and how it will be implemented in the VRAR case the competition and why Google is positioned to dominate that market Virtual and Augmented Reality Market In recent years many new technology trends attempted and some succeeded to change small parts of our lives Web and social media changed the way we use the internet instant messaging changed the way we interact with each other and mobile apps changed the amount of time we dedicate to personal technology devices New technological trends such as wearables the Internet of Things and autonomous cars are evolving and have not yet become widely adopted but we may assume they will become a part of our lives in the near future In the background of these trends another technology is rising that is expected to be used in the long run virtual and augmented reality Older readers may remember the virtual reality trend of the s and the poor experience it provided users Average display quality together with technological difficulties and high selling prices drove little unit demand to the market and the market disappeared slowly and quietly from our lives A number of companies saw the potential of the use of virtual and augmented reality in military healthcare personal interaction and of course gaming and decided to revive this industry The VRAR market became widely known once again when Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL introduced Project Glass in and received a big boost two years later when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB acquired virtual reality leader Oculus VR for B Facebooks acquisition ignited users and investors imaginations of how <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was going to implement that technology into the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>app Even though Google and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>attract most of the attention in the market other tech giants such as Sony NYSE SNE Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Samsung OTCSSNLF and HTC OTCHTCXF have also introduced VRAR headsets lately and have fueled the buzz around this technology trend Although so many tech giants have been involved in bringing up the VRAR market and ecosystem the industry still remembers the previous failure two decades ago and has provided cautious estimations for a potential market size range between B and B by As the ecosystem is currently evolving and general public acceptance is still unknown the conservative estimations present an impressive revenue potential that the tech companies cannot overlook To lead this evolving market in the future companies need to take the right steps now to position themselves ahead of the competition I believe that by executing its consumer electronics strategy adjusted to the VRAR market Google is positioned to dominate that market Before everything else Google is a software developer however to bring a comprehensive Google solution to the market Google has to deliver not only a remarkable software solution but also a world class hardware solution The best way for a software developer to release a combined softwarehardware solution is by focusing its strengths to deliver the best software it can and partnering with other technology leaders to deliver the best hardware solution to accompany it Lets take Googles strategy in the smartphone market as an example The company distributes Android for free or almost free and collects revenue from purchases made in the Play store At the same time Google designed a device optimized for Android that is manufactured and sold by a leading hardware vendor ie Nexus by LG and Nexus by LenovoMotorola Mobility Google compromises on razorthin margins from hardware sales to expand its Android ecosystem Google applied the same strategy to PCs through Chromebook to smart TVs through LG Google TV and to smartwatches through Android Wear Googles strategy for the VRAR market is not different As it did in other consumer electronics markets Google is reportedly developing a dedicated Android OS version for VRAR headsets This version of Android completes the software part of Googles VRAR offering The hardware part will be based on the first generation of Google Glass which was recently discontinued In Gen of Glass Google worked directly with Foxconn to manufacture the device with no OEM partners in between At this point Google has two alternatives regarding the hardware part Independent Development Google could continue to develop design and manufacture next generations of Glass by itself using the vast experience it has gained in other consumer electronics markets This alternative will bypass the OEMs and improve the product margin of Glass but will put Google in direct competition with companies that are Googles customers and partners in other markets such as Samsung HTC and Sony This alternative may drive slightly better financials but may risk Googles strategic partnerships in other markets that maintain the Android ecosystem I believe this is the least probable alternative OEM CoDevelopment Google could partner with a major OEM to bring the Glass to market as it does in the smartphone market for example with Motorola Mobility In this alternative Google keeps its strategic alliances intact and reduces its involvement in the manufacturing process in which Google has no addedvalue over the lead OEMs Google may have some experience with driving the Glass development and manufacturing processes but Glass was only a beta version produced in small volume and in mass production Google will need an experienced OEM to lead the process flawlessly and efficiently I believe this is the feasible and probable alternative Google has not only gained considerable experience in hardware development and manufacturing but it also collected a significant amount of feedback provided by Glass users This feedback is a great advantage for Google over the competition as its headset was already publicly used and feedback received will be used to produce a better end product that meets the customers requirements needs and wishes As mentioned above Google competitors in the VRAR market include prominent players like Sony Microsoft Samsung and HTC However the biggest competition as it appears right now is expected from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>thanks to its Oculus VR acquisition that was mentioned above Oculus is the VRAR market leader in regard to technology and user experience and it is also used to power the Samsung Gear VR headset In the latest <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>F conference Mark Zuckerberg introduced the companys vision for the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger app which included VRAR content sharing based on the Oculus technology Facebooks strength in social media together with the Oculus technology and its viable VRAR usages for gaming chatting and video sharing puts the company in the front line of competitors against Google However Facebooks biggest disadvantage is its lack of experience in the consumer electronics market that even the Oculus acquisition cannot compensate for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a pure software developer and unlike Google it had never released a consumer electronic device Oculus Rift is its first attempt in this area Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Oculus have no experience in the consumer electronics market in trying to dominate the VRAR market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>faces a dilemma of whether to license the Oculus technology to other OEMs to create an ecosystem around its solution or to try and release the Oculus Rift independently <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has no experience in either scenario and may risk the strength Oculus has in the VRAR market if it delivers an inadequate end product <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>seems to take a big bet with Oculus on the VRAR market than could either be a huge success or a devastating failure Other competitors include Microsoft HoloLens a VRAR headset powered by Windows Sony Morpheus targeted for the gaming industry and Samsung Gear VR which uses Oculus technology and is powered by Samsung Note On the operating system side there are only two main alternatives currently available Microsoft Windows or Android As it is hard to imagine Microsoft licenses Windows for other vendors to use Android is expected to gain a large market share in the VRAR market as it did in the smartphone smart watch and smart TV markets This is a big win for Google on the OS front Together with its headset advantage Google is positioned for success in the VRAR market Google has a clear strategy for penetrating the new consumer electronics market Google dominates the markets software with a dedicated OS version and offers a device that is designed by the company and manufactured by a wellknown hardware vendor In the VRAR Google is executing the same strategy with the next generation of Google Glass and Android VR The companys significant experience with Glass will allow it to release a better device to the market that has good chances of being widely accepted Also like what happened in the other market and as long as there is no real alternative Android is expected to dominate the VRAR market Googles leading position in the OS and headset fronts makes it the best candidate for a market leader position in this evolving market As exciting as it is Google will not generate revenues from the VRAR market anytime soon that should trigger a buy decision However in the longer term probably around when VRAR becomes widely accepted technology Google is expected to lead the market and benefit from increased revenues Source Google Is Positioned To Dominate The VRAR Market Disclosure The author is long GOOG MoreThe
