growth since it went public has averaged over per year From through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has averaged earnings growth of You can overpay for a hyper growth stock and still generate high future returns This article is directed to the individual investor concerned with achieving the highest possible total return The highest total return will typically come from a true growth stock simply because a faster growing company is worth more than a slower growing company past present and future On the other hand for that statement to be true a high rate of earnings growth must be consistently achieved Generating and sustaining a high rate of earnings growth is the tricky part because although there are a few companies capable of generating higher earnings growth rates they are rare Additionally there is one undeniable fact about true growth stocks that is nevertheless hotly debated and argued about In truth and fact a pure unadulterated growth stock under the strictest definition is capable of dramatically outperforming most bluechip dividend paying stocks The total return differences are not subtle they are significant and profound However I contend it is also an undeniable fact that the risk differential between investing in true growth stocks and bluechip dividend paying stocks is equally as significant and profound More simply stated investing for high growth is risky As a result it logically follows that highgrowth stocks are much more research due diligence and continuous monitoring intensive Consequently when investing in growth stocks I suggest you be prepared to put in the necessary work and effort to keep up with the company its industry and the competition In a free market competitors wont let a highgrowth company keep the market to itself Therefore if the investor is not willing to put in that effort then investing in growth stocks may not be appropriate Nevertheless even though I readily acknowledge that investing in highgrowth stocks is undoubtedly riskier than investing in bluechip dividend growth stocks their rapid growth can effectively mitigate some of the risk Thanks to the power of compounding the company that is growing its earnings very fast can bail investors out even if they overpay for the stock at purchase Of course this assumes that the company continues growing earnings at aboveaverage rates And more importantly assumes that the investor stays the course which admittedly is an aggressive assumption The Power and Protection Of Higher Earnings Growth With the above said this article is primarily about the power protection and return potential that can occur when investing in growth stocks Although I will be referencing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as a quintessential example of a true unadulterated growth stock I contend that an analysis of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>past present and future also offers important investing lessons about growth stock investing in general Moreover I consider myself a dedicated value investor Regular readers of my work will attest to the fact that I consider fair valuation the most important metric to consider before investing in any stock Not only do I write about the importance of valuation in virtually every article I publish I have even been given the name MisterValuation and also operate a website under that name In the same vein I consider fair valuation a critical metric to consider and evaluate when selecting high growth stocks just as I do any other stock However as I previously alluded to you can be more liberal with valuation when a companys earnings growth rate is as high as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has achieved In other words as I will later illustrate you can actually overpay when initially investing in a highgrowth stock and still make an aboveaverage longterm total return You do take on more risk by doing that but due to the power of compounding a high rate of earnings growth can still generate a significant and aboveaverage total rate of return This is possible because thanks to the power of compounding investing in growth stocks can in effect compress time In other words instead of taking a decade or more to double your earnings in a slower growing bluechip dividend growth stock you can double your earnings much quicker in a true growth stock To illustrate my point I will turn to the widely recognized Rule of This rule states that you can calculate the number of years it takes to double your earnings or your money at a given compound return by dividing it into the number I have often utilized the following illustration to demonstrate the point I am making about the power of compounding and how it compresses time First I will make the assumption that the average person has a working lifespan of years In modern times this may be a conservative assumption but as I will soon illustrate it facilitates the math Next I will assume two different compound rates of earnings growth as they apply to the average dividend growth stock and then to the pure growth stock For the dividend growth stock I will assume a generous and above average rate of earnings growth of per annum For the pure growth stock I will assume the appropriately higher rate of earnings growth of per annum The math then looks like this With the dividend growth stock If I divide into I calculate that it will take years to double my earnings years With the pure growth stock if I divide into I calculate it will take only years to double my earnings years In other words earnings will double in half the time If I apply this math to my assumed average working life of years I get the following results If my earnings double every years at a rate of growth I will get doubles in years If my earnings double every years at a rate of earnings growth I will get doubles in years The net effect is that by doubling my average rate of earnings growth from to per annum I do not generate two times the earnings by growing at twice the rate Instead I get double the doubles Looked at from the perspective of the first dollar of earnings the power of compounding compressing time becomes vividly clear Doubling my first dollars worth of earnings times at the growth rate results in the following doubles times to and finally to However at the growth rate I get additional doubles over the same year time frame as follows To put this into perspective over my assumed year working lifetime I generate times more earnings by growing at than I would have if my earnings grew at Doubling the number of doubles over the same time frame shows the incredible power of compounding that true growth stocks are capable of offering However it should be noted that successfully growing earnings at the rate of per annum over a working lifetime is a rare and difficult feat Eventually the law of large numbers comes into play and a companys earnings growth rate will surely slow down as a result Nevertheless the above exercise is valuable for the insights it provides into the power of compounding Additionally this knowledge about compounding also ties in nicely to rate of return expectations I have evaluated and analyzed thousands of companies in my lifetime This experience has led me to what I consider an undeniable conclusion In the long run earnings determine market price Moreover as this relates to achieving a high total return when a stock is purchased at a sound valuation your total return will be highly correlated to a companys earnings growth achievement To be more precise your capital appreciation component specifically will be generated based on earnings growth Additionally this is also true for dividend paying stocks Capital appreciation will relate to earnings growth and so will the income component from dividends In other words a dividend paying stocks rate of dividend growth will also highly correlate to its earnings growth The Power of Diversification When Investing In Growth Stocks Regardless of your investing strategy diversification should always play an important role Nevertheless diversifying a growth stock portfolio offers a different dynamic than is found with more conservative investing strategies Due to the power of compounding at a high growth rate a diversified growth stock portfolio can produce strong results even when the portfolio contains a significant percentage of failures The following table presented for illustration purposes assumes a million portfolio invested in highgrowth stocks with approximately invested in each The assumptions presented in the table are extreme For example the first column assumes that out of of the growth stocks go completely bankrupt and only achieve the return objective over years Even under this extreme and highly unlikely circumstance the portfolio would still achieve a positive total return of annualized Of course if you batted the portfolio would generate a total return of per annum The point of this exercise is to illustrate that you only need a few successful growth stocks in a portfolio to make an attractive rate of return This is what I meant when I stated earlier that a high rate of earnings growth can mitigate risk especially when the growth stock portfolio is even moderately diversified Note Before I continue on I want it to be clear that this article is not intended to provide a comprehensive analysis of the business or fundamentals supporting <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Instead this article is presented on the thesis that that analysis and due diligence had already been completed The primary premise and objective of this article is to present evaluate and discuss the mathematics behind what drives longterm returns and how to calculate them However here are two articles here and here that provide interesting insights into Facebooks future growth potential Therefore the above discussion about the mathematics behind investing in growth stocks was offered to provide a clear perspective towards answering the question posed in the title of this article Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a screaming buy or sell The answer to this question is debatable and I am certain there will be readers that take both sides Nevertheless the correct answer for each individual investor will be related to their own personal risk tolerances and typical investing behaviors My definition of a growth stock is straightforward and precise First of all a growth stock represents the common stock of a company whose business is consistently growing earnings and cash flow at a significantly aboveaverage rate More precisely my definition of a growth stock is a company whose earnings are consistently increasing at a minimum rate of change of earnings growth of or better However a hyper growth stock is one that I define as growing earnings at a rate of change of or better Admittedly although both categories are rare there are more growers than there are companies growing earnings at or higher In between these broader gradations of growth are additional growth categories such as a high grower at etc Consequently as I will next illustrate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>represents a quintessential example of a hyper growth stock Additionally the above discussion was also offered to illustrate that all investing is ultimately about the math To be clear historical performance will be a function of how fast the company has grown its business which is a preciselymeasurable set of historical facts The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs clearly illustrates how Facebooks stock price the black line has tracked its earnings the orange line since The graph also illustrates that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has grown its earnings at the incredible rate of per year Since <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has grown earnings above the formula utilized to draw the orange valuation reference line is PE ratio to earnings growth rate Note the formula is depicted in the orange rectangle in the FAST FACTS box as PEG Therefore the orange line on the graph represents a PE ratio or earnings multiple of The following historical performance results for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>over this time frame clearly validate my thesis that earnings drive market price Had you invested in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on December that investment would now be worth That calculates to an annual rate of return of which closely correlates to the companys earnings growth rate of At the end of the day investing in common stocks is all about the mathematics behind the companys operating achievements Estimating Facebooks Future Performance Is Also All About the Math Thus far I have illustrated how longterm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shareholders have been rewarded in almost direct proportion to its business results However as I alluded to earlier historical performance is measurable because it has already occurred On the other hand the future performance of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>remains an unknown Nevertheless my argument is that Facebooks future performance will also be a function of the math behind its future earnings growth Additionally at least over the intermediateterm I continue to believe that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will not be paying a dividend anytime soon Therefore Facebooks future total return will also be a direct function of capital appreciation generated by future earnings growth Of course since the future is always unknown it can only be forecast or estimated My suggestion is that investors should run numerous forecasts based on reasonable assumptions regarding Facebooks future growth In other words several what if scenarios should be calculated with the objective of running conservative optimistic moderate or even worst case scenarios But most importantly current or prospective investors should do the math based on each of those scenarios in order to calculate specific future return possibilities As previously stated the endgame of all successful investing is always about the math Doing the math does not need to be hard if you have the right tools at your disposal Spreadsheets or financial calculators can do the trick Regardless I believe it is imperative that investors do the math in order to have reasonably precise calculations about what their future returns might be Therefore I offer the following video utilizing the various FAST Graphs Forecasting Calculators where I will run various what if scenarios and calculations on Facebooks potential future returns over the next to years The key benefit behind this process is to gain as clear of a view and understanding of Facebooks future return possibilities based on various scenarios In my opinion this is far superior to simply investing in a stock with the hope that it will go up or that you will make money Moreover this exercise is designed to provide a reasonable range of probabilities and possibilities regarding future returns I consider this analogous to investing with your eyes wide open <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is clearly one of the most dominant hyper growth stocks of modern times Its historical earnings growth achievements have been nothing short of spectacular Consequently the company has already grown to a market cap in excess of billion over a very short period of time This may be the biggest challenge the company faces regarding its future growth potential Nevertheless the company continues to exceed consensus analyst earnings estimates almost like clockwork Based on historical earnings achievements <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>appears fairly valued in spite of its lofty current blended PE ratio over When looking to the future it appears that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>might continue to grow earnings at plus rates at least for the next few years Therefore due to the power of compounding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could be a rewarding future investment even if the stock experiences PE ratio contraction The key of course is future earnings growth At current valuations the company will have to continue to grow very fast to support its stock price Is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a
