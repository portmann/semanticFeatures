class='textDiv'>The Most Expensive Real Estate Market Ever Digital Turbine Ignites Carriers App Strategy Digital Turbine Inc NASDAQAPPS Seeking Alpha Thousands of new apps created every month Carriers control coveted screen space Carriers like Verizon by partnering with Digital Turbine seek to claim their piece of the pie Thesis The screen on your smartphone is the most highly prized six inches of real estate in history More apps are created per month than consumers can possibly find <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is generating billions through ads that generate app installations yet carriers which control the phones at point of sale get no revenue from this market By using Digital Turbines NASDAQ APPS Ignite software Verizon NYSE VZ and other carriers are looking to stake their claim to this revenue stream The first three rules in real estate investing are the following location location and location This truth has been evident for many years However until the creation of the smartphone the applicability of this axiom hasnt extended beyond physical real estate That has now changed The growth in the market for apps on smartphones has been nothing short of spectacular There are now over a million apps available for Android phones And with the incredible success of some apps such as Candy Crush Uber Snapchat etc combined with the low barriers to entry for creating an app the number of apps is increasing at an accelerating pace Users of smartphones obviously have a smorgasbord of options available to them in terms of apps Yet the average number of apps on a smartphone in the US is around This creates a problem for the other or more app creators as they have been left off your phone Think about the implications for several of these companies If you dont have their app installed you will never use Snapchat Uber Spotify Shazam Whatsapp etc These companies have all garnered multibillion dollar valuations in the private marketplace Investors have put billions into these companies They NEED to have their apps on millions of phones to justify the investments made in them Thus theres competition to get your app installed on a smartphone This is so intense that an app developer would gladly pay many millions to be preinstalled on a smartphone when it is sold As a result the approximately square inches of your smartphone is now the most highly prized real estate in history The carriers control that real estate up until the point of sale They would like to sell app space However dont have the knowledge of the app market nor the customer demand profile to do so in an effective manner Now with Digital Turbines help they are looking to populate and monetize cell phone screens with apps that are specifically targeted for the audiences that are purchasing the smartphones App install advertising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>demonstrates profit potential After <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>went public the stock went down From an IPO price of in May of the stock traded almost straight down for the next few months finally bottoming below The weakness in the stock was due to concern about their online strategy Well as we now know <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>figured out their strategy And in a big way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>currently takes in ad revenue from mobile devices at a run rate of over billion per quarter Where did Facebooks mobile success come from They realized that people werent exactly shopping for clothes or cars on their phones But they were buying apps for their phones Check out the figures from Gartner The app market has absolutely exploded and the marketing and app install advertising is a large growing and profitable business <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>got in on this early and outside of the app stores themselves profits more from app install ads than any other company App creators have spent millions of dollars to develop their apps Its a key to their strategy sometimes the only strategy for making money They will pay for downloads Verizon and the other cell phone service providers have noticed Facebooks success And I dont mean just success in selling apps I mean Facebooks success in having people pay them for installing an app on a cell phone that at one point in time Verizon owned controlled and populated with its initial set of apps As it is today the competition in the wireless industry is intense and anything a carrier can do to bring about additional revenue opportunities is well needed <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>alone takes in over a billion dollars in app install advertising revenue per quarter The carriers want access to this revenue stream Could you imagine airing the Super Bowl with no commercials Youre talking billions of viewers and the most highly prized and expensive advertising slots that exist Yet by delivering cell phones without apps carriers are basically passing up on an audience the size of the Super Bowl or larger every year Thus the smartphone is the most coveted real estate in the world App developers will pay through the teeth to get on your screen Carriers need additional revenue streams And the carriers can dictate what apps get preinstalled when they first sell the phone Can you see where Im going with this Digital Turbine will Ignite Verizons app revenue So Verizon would like to sell the real estate on their phones to app developers It sounds like an easy thing to do but its a little more difficult than appears at first blush Carriers need to have relationships with the developers figure out a payment structure and understand which apps are the most appropriate for each customer If they can get all this right its a gold mine If not they risk upsetting customers by preloading a bunch of unwanted apps To make sure that they are approaching this correctly Verizon has engaged Digital Turbine Digital Turbine along with its recently acquired unit Appia has developed proprietary software for this called Ignite which works with all smartphones that run the Android operating system According to CraigHallum which rates APPS a buy with a target Heres how it works Ignite enables wireless providers to instantly dynamically and remotely install customized apps on smartphones postproduction This gives them the ability to get paid by developers who want their apps preloaded onto the phone we estimate up to per slot For carriers Ignite enables them to customize preloading of software based on specific geographies and save time and money by being able to ship phones without worrying about new or updated apps becoming available postshipping Selling real estate on the smartphone also creates a welcome Mplus high margin incremental revenue opportunity for a Tier carrier at a time when commoditization is putting pricing pressure on service and data plans For app developers the M apps available on the Android platform make it difficult and expensive to catch users attention Ignite does just that since developers deal directly with carriers as opposed to end users thus making sure the app is displayed on the phone Verizon announced their relationship with Digital Turbine in early Since then they have taken their time rolling out the relationship test marketing a program using Ignite to install apps on new phones However the program has recently been deemed a success and Verizon has more clearly defined the strategy and rollout Its happening here and now As of April Digital Turbine announced the rollout of Ignite with Verizon and other carriers in this press release here As detailed in the release among other phones Ignite is operational across all Samsung Galaxy S and S Edge phones with Verizon and several other carriers This is the hottest phone in the market expected to get million in unit sales in This is very big news and shows the importance of this program to Verizon trusting it enough to install on their latest and greatest phone In terms of revenue what can be expected here Well the typical installation is four paid apps per phone Users have to click on the apps just once for revenue to be generated if deleted no revenue I assume of the apps are opened Expecting an average fee of per app and a split between Verizon and Digital Turbine Verizon stands to make an average of per phone in app install ad revenue Verizon sells around million Android smartphones company guidance per year Thus by using Ignite across their whole product line Verizon has a potential opportunity to make up to M in additional high margin revenue each year based on my uptake rate assumptions This is not huge but meaningful nonetheless for Verizon The creation of apps is in its heyday Im not sure that well see a time where more apps per day are created but with low barriers to entry there will always be entrepreneurs creating new and unique apps On the other hand the market for advertising dollars spent to attract users to apps is very nascent and different marketing avenues are developing in real time The land grab is on for share of your cellphones screen <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was the early adopter in developing advertising for apps With their immense reach and marketing muscle they will remain a player in this space for years They garner over B in app install advertising revenue per quarter and frankly without app install ad revenue it would have been a very different transition to mobile for FB Verizon is the first US carrier to start preinstalling apps but expect other carriers to rapidly catch on to the ability to make money off of configuring a phone prior to sale This is easy money for the carriers and will certainly benefit them over time with minimal downside risk Carriers are large companies however APPS on the other hand is a small cap pure play on the growth of advertising revenue from app installations If the ad market for app installations maintains its growth APPS is well positioned to be a significant player in this market Their software is best in class as evidenced by their contracts announced with Verizon US Cellular Cellcom Israel Globe Philippines and Vodafone Australia And its a very high margin business We can expect more contract announcements or expansion of current contracts for APPs in the near future For example it is believed that they will announce deals with both ATT and TMobile in the US In Europe Deutsche Telecom is working with APPS and if the rollout in Australia goes well expect Vodafone to use them broadly over their network Finally expect wins in Latin America as well The company has announced guidance of million in I believe this to be very conservative since Digital Turbine books of the revenue on the carrier deals before sharing it with the carriers Thus the Verizon deal alone could be million annually in revenue for APPS With a market cap of only million as of April the company is priced at around x sales Look for that to change in the near future as with rollouts of their product happening in real time with major carriers APPS will start putting up some large numbers beginning with the June quarter Source The
