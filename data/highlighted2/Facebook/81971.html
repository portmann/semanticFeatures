Potential Risks For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in my opinion is vastly overvalued at almost times net income Add in dilution and the investment doesnt look attractive Risk doesnt outweigh reward here <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has problems with regulators presently in Europe Regulators are going to be a constant headache for the social media giant There are some sectors outperforming the general stock market in the US by some distance However the stock market desperately needs a correction of at least points <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc NASDAQ FB still seems to be a popular choice among investors as the stock is up year to date and over the last months This trend is backed up by many analysts who are bullish on the stock over the long term So what merits the excessive bullishness Well its user base is growing and will definitely continue to grow in the near term but will this be enough to increase the share price What investors like about the company is that it is investing back into the business through products such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Lite and Internetorg Initiatives such as these should definitely increase Facebooks users especially in developing countries Furthermore Facebooks other products Instagram WhatsApp and Messenger are not really monetized yet and definitely provide substantial upside from here However I believe the potential risks in going long here outweigh the reward Lets discuss why First we need to look at where the stock price is valued In Q of this year revenues rose to billion which was well up from the billion reported in Q Net income came in lower at million but I project this will increase in the next few quarters which will give the company an annual net income of around billion for fiscal Now the current market cap of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is approximately billion This means that the stock is approximately trading at times its net income When you break down the figures and you see the stock with this valuation you start to question if the future profits and growth that have already been priced in are far too high Yes I have no doubt that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will increase its user base from billion users last year to probably over billion in the years ahead but the question remains will advertising revenue increase on a similar scale <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>bulls think there is far more upside to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>story Their arguments are the following The smartphone global boom is just getting underway especially in developing countries Facebooks new app <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Lite and its Internetorg initiative will definitely grow users Instagram is growing rapidly and will go from its current user base of million to millionplus in the next to years Huge potential for advertising here WhatsApp has more than million active users and again is ripe for advertising considering that this form of communication is replacing the SMS business model throughout the world However I think traditional adds may be difficult on this network Applications and value added content may be the way forward here Similar tools to Atlas LiveRail and Audience Network will ensure the cost of advertising will rise in the next few years which should grow the companys profits Whereas all of the above outline points for going long this stock I still feel the pros dont outweigh the cons when you consider that the stock is trading at nearly times its net income I just dont see net income chart below growing that sharply in the years to come The second potential risk I see with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the way it collects its information Fundamentally advertisers are attracted to this platform because the advertising can be extremely targeted <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the ability to provide advertisers with demographics likes and interests of users behavioral activity etc of all of its users This information is extremely valuable to advertisers as they have the ability to only advertise to extremely targeted users Essentially the more <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>digs and knows about you the more valuable the platform is to advertisers However the company is encountering stiff resistance to the way it is currently doing business in Europe Regulators are clamping down and undergoing privacy investigations to ensure the social media giant is not doing anything untoward Five EU countries France Germany Holland Spain and Belgium are currently in talks about this matter which will probably result in fines or new privacy regulations that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will have to adhere to in order to avoid a fallout in Europe Either way regulators are going to be an increasing headwind for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>going forward The information age has brought information to our fingertips but the use and collection of that information will remain a very controversial issue in the world Less information about its users means a less valuable platform for its advertisers <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will have to be intelligent and nimble in this area to keep both advertisers and regulators happy in the future Finally on the US economy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a large multinational but many investors overlook that the US market accounts for more the of the companys global revenue Personally I feel that the US economy is not in good shape Yes we got an optimistic jobs number last week where it was reported that jobs were added for the month of May I just dont buy it especially when you really do your research on the numbers Personal spending levels are still very low as Americans are opting to save rather than spend Labour participation rates are still near record lows and the economy is currently contracting If the US reports lower GDP in the second quarter of this year then it will officially be in recession The Fed wont be raising interest rates Its ironic that stocks have gone from in March of to currently just under but in the same time period the economy has had three quarters of declining GDP Q Q Q Where will it all end My opinion is that investors should look outside the general stock market SPDR SP ETF Trust NYSEARCA SPY and observe whats happening in other sectors where bubble symptoms may be noticeable Whereas the general market is up since the March lows there are other sectors which are up substantially more than this in the last six years The fact of the matter is that when the Fed prints too much money and keeps interest rates too low bubbles are invariably formed This happened in the year with tech stocks and in with real estate I believe we could be on the brink of another bubble One thing is sure The market needs to correct If the Fed will not allow it the stock market but even more some certain sectors will scream to even higher levels The higher they go the more risk there will be Regarding <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in scenarios like these I prefer to stay on the sidelines considering the stock is selling for almost times net income Source Potential Risks
