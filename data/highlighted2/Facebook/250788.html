class='textDiv'>Why Southeast Asia Is Important To Facebooks Instant Articles <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha After launching Instant Articles in India <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now also implementing it in Southeast Asian countries Localized versions of Instant Articles are necessary because of Facebooks growing number of users in Southeast Asia The Wall Street Journal published a report saying that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is actively hiring positions in its AsiaPacific office These new job requirements is to help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>create localfriendly versions of its Instant Articles service for Vietnam and Thailand <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>obviously wants Vietnamese and Thaispeaking employees to help it recruit local publishers to sign up for Instant Articles I strongly agree with this move of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The growth of the adsdependent Instant Articles service is better off when it can offer local content that is published only in native Asian languages Instant Articles rival Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Google Play Newsstands Android and iOS versions here in the Philippines offer localized newsarticle content The Google Newsstand app has partner publishers that only publish content in the Filipino language and in the local regional dialects Cebuano and Ilocano Instant Articles will be in great disadvantage against Google Play Newsstand if it cannot be used by domestic publishers whose contentnews are nonEnglish Investors know that Facebooks core web and mobile apps are still banned in China <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is also not the most popular social network in Japan The next best thing therefore is for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to find growth in Japan and Chinas neighboring Southeast Asian countries The Southeast Asian expansion of Instant Articles is only more than a week after <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>launched Instant Articles in India The Think Global Act Local expansion strategy of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>includes disseminating its services to Southeast Asian countries Investors should care that Southeast Asian countries represents one the most active population of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users As we can see from eMarketers chart Facebooks estimated users in Vietnam is now more than million Thailand now also has million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users India only has million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users Southeast Asian countries presents a bigger combined population of advertising eyeballs for Facebooks Instant Articles Facebooks popularity is in spite of the fact that Southeast Asian countries still have low internet penetration rate Thailand only has internet penetration rate while Vietnam only has Facebooks decision to push Instant Articles in those two emerging markets is an earlybird advantage move Southeast Asia represents a huge growth opportunity and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is wisely being proactive Once more people get access to internet and more affordable smartphonesdata plans Facebooks number of users in Southeast Asia will likely grow proportionately Looking at the chart above its surprising that Indonesia has almost million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users That country of million still has less than internet penetration rate I expect that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will also soon be recruiting employees that speak Bahasa Indonesia to help it implement Instant Articles in Indonesia The most important thing now is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is exploiting early its brands popularity among Southeast Asian social network users The appbased and adsladen newsinformation dissemination program of Instant Articles cannot afford to ignore the huge popularity of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in all Southeast Asian markets Furthermore there are now sub Android phones available which are perfect for pricesensitive Southeast Asians The more people in this region that gets access to affordable mobile phones the more chances that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and its partner publishers will have bigger audience for localized Instant Articles content Instant Articles future success will also depend on how fast people in this region gets access to cheap mobile web too Southeast Asian Carriers Offer Cheap Unlimited <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Mobile Access International and domestic content publishers should be more willing to sign up for Instant Articles intended for Southeast Asian news readers In my country the Philippines Smart Communications and Globe Telecom offers unlimited prepaid mobile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>access Globes cellular Pday unlimited callSMS promo also includes free full <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>mobile app access for hours Talk N Text the budget wireless brand of Smart Communications offers day unlimited callSMS and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>access for only Pday For Filipinos who are betteroff they could also avail of the day SurfMax unlimited GG LTE mobile internet for only P My point is that Southeast Asian carriers provide very affordable mobile web access Cheap mobile web access combined with sub Android or Windows phones is a growth catalyst for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instant Articles The more people there are that gets access to Instant Articles content the better it is for Facebooks partner publishers Publishers need everincreasing population of mobile users to better monetize their content via Instant Articles As of now <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is still allowing its partner publishers to get of the ads they directly sell via their content published through Instant Articles Of course publishers who only want to push their own direct advertisements through Instant Articles will not get access to Facebooks hypertargeted ads delivery platform Meaning freeloading publishers of Instant Articles will have to eventually pay <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to access that social networks huge database of personal user data and location <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and its investors are the ultimate longterm winners if Instant Articles become a major channel for content dissemination Mobile appbased news distribution is a great way for content publishers to reduce the impact of browserbased ad blocking Publishers needs Instant Articles to grow in all markets not just in India North America or Europe Southeast Asian countries where sub phonestablets and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>mobile usage are popular are also obvious growth opportunities for
