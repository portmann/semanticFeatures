maker did not buy back shares Boeing NYSE BA might be facing a bn charge related to its accounting practices on the Dreamliner program In earlier pieces I already looked at how Boeings accounting practice affects the reported profits and I had a look at the remaining costs that need to be recouped at the end of the Dreamliners accounting block Dreamliners Will Not Be Enough For Boeing One important conclusion I drew is that the bn charge is not a random figure My calculations show that remaining costs to be recouped by the last unit in the accounting block are bn On the other hand I think the most important conclusion is that claims that Boeing will never be able to recoup the costs are far from the truth In this article I will explain why I think investors should take notice of the charge but why there is no reason to panic Figure Operating Cash Flow Source wwwAeroAnalysisnet What can be seen from Figure is that the cash flow pattern is rock solid Since cash flow has more than doubled Since the operating cash flow grew by annually If we use this figure to estimate the operating cash flow we get to bn in cash flows Using the same growth patterns as last year I calculated an operating cash flow of bn Both figures are close to the guidance of approximately bn but I tend towards a figure slightly below bn since the jet maker has guided lower on commercial deliveries for Figure Free Cash Flow Source AeroAnalysis Capital expenditures are expected to grow by roughly this year indicating capital expenditures of around bn This means that the free cash flow for should be around bn per my calculations When Boeing reported Q and fullyear results for it had roughly million shares outstanding This means that Boeing generated per share Using the closing price of the earnings date it had a free cash multiple of Currently Boeing trades around or times its cash multiple If Boeing would have done no buybacks since reporting its fullyear earnings it would generate in cash per share for Applying a cash multiple of and would give a price range of rounded Taking the last quarters the generated cash flow was around bn and dividing by the million shares outstanding gives per share When applying a cash multiple of we get a price in the range of Based on this estimate one would say Boeing is undervalued by at least and at most What needs to be noted is that the expected free cash flow for is lower than the current twelvemonth trailing figure This means that any rise in share prices based on free cash flow per share has to come from stock buyback In million shares were bought back Given the weakness in share prices so far in I think Boeing will be buying back more shares than it did in Assuming that there will be million shares outstanding we get a cash flow per share of Applying a cash multiple of on this per share cash flow figure gives a price range of Figure Wall Street Horizon WallStHorizon Create your own custom event calendar today Boeings yearoveryear growth profile of free cash flow is still intact despite the challenges it is facing and I think that is worth something Earlier I marked Boeing as an unattractive riskreward play due to a potential multibillion charge which will affect the companys earnings Looking at Boeings cash generation coupled with its buyback program I think Boeing is currently undervalued Boeing is currently valued as if it has not repurchased shares since reporting its fullyear earnings Based on its free cash flow growth I think Boeing shares should be trading around the level This article serves purposes The first is to have a look at a fair value based on cash flow multiples The second is to explain why investors should not worry about a bn charge As I outlined in one of my previous articles the charge is not certain yet Boeing could have an aggressive costcutting process in place to avoid a charge Additionally it could increase the accounting block size Even if there will be a charge related to its accounting practice Boeing shares should be able to hold firmly as the cash flow profile remains unchanged For investors that like the Boeing dividends and stock repurchases the cash flow growth is more interesting Additionally the cash Boeing possesses allows the company to work on developments Therefore I deem cash and growing cash flows more important than profits or charges If you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles please click the Follow text at the top of this page next to my profile If you enjoyed reading this article please consider
