Apple reported Q earnings AAPL shares have been down by as much as Looking ahead AAPL volatility will continue as the market continues to worry about slowing revenue growth in China With billion of share repurchase authorization remaining Apple is in prime position to take advantage of stock market volatility and buy back its stock at a discount to alltime highs resulting in up to billion of savings over the next six months Stock valuation is a complicated subject While finance textbooks explain how to take a series of numbers and assumptions and arrive at a stocks intrinsic value the truth is market participants determine a stocks true worth A stock price is merely the point at which a buyer and seller agree to exchange shares Emotion and psychology play just as important of a role in determining a stock price as sales earnings and growth potential Apple is currently trading at a x forward earnings multiple EPS growth a discount to the overall markets x forward earnings multiple If excluding of cash per share Apple is trading at a x forward earnings multiple a discount to the overall market If Apple traded with a x forward earnings multiple excash shares would trade at a premium to the current market price Many look at the valuation discrepancy as evidence that Apple is being penalized by Wall Street due to the lack of confidence in its ability to grow However nearly every sellside Apple analyst is relying on higher earnings multiples despite slowing operating income growth to arrive at target prices that are well above the current market price This doesnt strike me as overly pessimistic Instead Apple continues to suffer from a lack of confidence and conviction on the part of current and prospective shareholders Since growth concerns are a bit generic more specific issues plaguing Apple continue to include doubt that strong Apple customer loyalty will continue and a business model that makes it difficult to forecast earnings Apple Customer Loyalty Doubt It is no secret that Apple is the iPhone company With the product representing of revenue and of operating income the iPhone deserves the attention it is receiving on Wall Street However there continues to be a general lack of understanding over the dynamics underlying iPhones sales including the impact that Apple customer loyalty has on sales Approximately of iPhones sold each year are to previous iPhone owners Many on Wall Street look at the fact that Apple is relying on its existing user base to drive sales as a negative Not only do repeat customers make up a significant amount of iPhone sales but this actually describes Apples business model A company that sells not just products but experiences relies on repeat customers to offset any negative implications from the decision to not chase market share This is one reason why Apple management has a tendency to focus on customer satisfaction rates whenever possible High satisfaction is suspected to eventually turn into loyalty and repeat customers When thinking about iPhone sales growth in having approximately of unit sales come from the million iPhone user base is an indication that the Apple machine is functioning properly The iPhone upgrade cycle is dependent on evolutionary features that do not over serve the customer base but instead entice upgrades A high percentage of repeat iPhone customers is actually a strength for Apple not a weakness Apple would then need to focus on bringing in approximately million new users to the iOS ecosystem annually in order to report ongoing iPhone growth When considering the large market opportunity in China and ongoing troubles with Samsung this million new user target is achievable One of the concerns Wall Street has with Apples customer loyalty is questions about how long the trend can continue The ongoing debate over smartphone subsidies going away they arent not to mention cheaper smartphone alternatives from China are continuously positioned as factors that may cause iPhone owners to look elsewhere for their next smartphone A few Apple analysts have attempted to tackle this customer loyalty issue indirectly by coming at it from an ecosystem angle By attaching a certain amount of revenue and profit to each iOS user over time one can start to look at the iOS user base as a large annuity that will kick off profits each year While the idea doesnt exactly rely on the most politicallycorrect analogy the general idea is a fair one to make The problem is that it does little to drive increased confidence that Apples high customer loyalty will continue in the future Difficult Business Model to Forecast Trends Apple has a business model that makes it very difficult to forecast financial trends years out While some of this is born from the companys thoughts on secrecy and surprise the reasoning actually goes much deeper Apples business model is built on the belief that things will not remain steady over the longrun Management is constantly looking to break itself only enjoying key sales milestones for a short while before looking to do something else In recent years that may have meant cannibalizing existing products while in the future it may be moving from its comfort zone into new industries Compare this to something like Googles search business which had never been thought of to be in trouble by many on Wall Street until only recently or Facebooks recent announcement that billion people went to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in a single day These businesses while inherently more complex and confusing than Apple are thought of as more sustainable over the longrun while Apples business comes across as more susceptible to market forces This lack of business model visibility boils all the way down to granular features found in Apple products When Apple introduces a new user interface for iPhones next week it will be difficult for many to envision such a feature becoming a crucial feature across the iPhone line one day opening the door to significant design changes Apple is well aware of the year plan with features and products often introducing certain features just to serve as a stepping stone to future revisions Extend this exercise to nearly every Apple action and the end result is Wall Street placing heavy reliance on shortterm actions with little to no value attached to the longterm It is tough to value something that will happen in the future when it is not obvious it will occur Even though this model of constantly looking to change the equation plays a key role in Apples goal of remaining relevant over the longterm what if Apple never moved past the iPod from Wall Streets perspective such neverending change is difficult to measure and value Moving from counting iPod profits to iPhone margins and soon financials behind monthly automobile leases is not easy and results in low conviction The end result is lower valuation multiples to compensate for this unknown I suspect this has been one of the primary reasons over the years for Apples valuation discount to the market Google and Amazon continue to stand out to investors as both companies share some similarities with Apple in terms of unknown futures The difference is that while Apple is reporting strong profits on very disciplined expense management Google and Amazon are considered founderled companies that keep profits artificially low due to excess expenses and investment As a result Google and Amazon are rewarded with higher valuation multiples on what appear to be more mediocre profit and growth trends compared to Apple Some may disagree with this treatment but the thing to keep in mind is Wall Street will continue to think a certain way until it no longer wants to It is impossible to predict when that moment will arrive I continue to view Apple buying back its shares as the most appropriate use of excess cash that is not needed for organic growth and MA As of June Apple had billion of share buyback authorization remaining out of a total of billion of authorization Theoretically Apple could repurchase of itself without any additional authorization from the board of directors However when looking at cash available for buyback it becomes clear that Apple is not in a position to buy back that many shares at this time Apple is only able to use US cash on hand to repurchase shares and as of June Apple had billion of domestic cash billion is held offshore When forecasting earnings through the second half of CY and taking into consideration debt issuance and US free cash flow generation Apple will have approximately billion of domestic cash available by yearend After adjusting for routine cash needs including cash dividends as well as the need for a cash buffer Apple will likely be in a position to spend billion on buyback over the next six months July to December Apple management can make a dollar worth of share buyback go much further when Apples stock price is depressed With shares down from alltime highs Apple could theoretically buy back additional Apple shares with the same amount of cash resulting in a savings of close to billion over the next six months There are three likely strategies Apple can take in regards to its buyback Scheduled Share Repurchases Apple could follow a very strict schedule as to when excess cash is spent on buyback It would be equivalent to an investor buying an index fund the same day each month to gain market exposure regardless of whether the market was up or down As each quarter comes and goes Apple will spend the same amount on buyback resulting in additional shares being bought if the share price decreases There is evidence of Apple following this type of repurchase schedule with billion spend on share buyback in Q Q Q and Q Opportunistic Share Repurchases Instead of simply following a schedule Tim Cook and Luca Maestri could take stock valuation and timing into greater consideration resulting in an ebb and flow to the pace of buyback Apple has shown the tendency of being opportunistic such as in February when Tim Cook announced Apple had repurchased close billion of shares over the span of two weeks shares were trading around at the time Beginning in Q Apple initiated a new accelerated share repurchase arrangement NYSE ASR The mechanics of such a program may at first seem a bit opaque but they are actually relatively straightforward The investment banks handling the ASR borrow AAPL shares in order to deliver a large number of shares to Apple upfront The banks then proceed to buy back shares over the span of weeks and months to cover their borrow With AAPL shares having been weak since Q earnings Apple will actually be able to take full advantage of its lower stock price by receiving cash back from the investment banks in charge of the ASR Hybrid Strategy Apple can combine the two strategies and have both a scheduled buyback plan in place in addition to buying more shares during times of market weakness Judging from historical trends Apple management is following this strategy suggesting there may be increased motivation to increase the pace of buyback during times of market weakness In reality few companies take aggressive bold moves with buyback programs during periods of market turmoil Instead capital management strategies tend to become more conservative as companies prepare for adverse capital market conditions There had been a noticeable decline in the pace of Apple buyback recently but its difficult to know if it was due to a rising stock price depleted US cash reserves or a combination of the two factors Yeartodate Apple spent billion on buyback less than the billion spent during the same time period in It will be important to see if this pace changes in the face of market volatility and lower share prices There is no evidence to suggest that AAPL volatility will decline anytime soon The market will focus on slowing EPS growth in while in reality there will be much deeper issues at play Customer loyalty and Apples eventual embrace of new product categories will likely continue to be ignored by Wall Street One of the primary ways for a billion market cap company to grow in terms of valuation multiples is for current shareholders to become more comfortable owning a greater share of the company As long as there are still basic misunderstandings about how Apple thinks about the future valuation multiples will remain range bound and management will rely on the share buyback program to take advantage of
