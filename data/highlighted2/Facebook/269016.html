High Growth Stocks Best Positioned For Seeking Alpha We evaluate growth from a nondividend high growth asset model The investment community has long implemented the rational investor theory paired with the capital asset pricing model Within the nondividend high growth space a core constant within the CAPM breaks down The CAPM assumes investors are risk averse as Fama and French stated in The very nature of nondividend high growth asset investing violates this key principle As such the CAPM has certain limitations within the nondividend high growth asset space considering this class of investments is inherently associated with risk Does this mean the CAPM should simply be discarded for this asset class Most certainly not However it should lead investors and analysts alike to evaluate the accuracy of these pricing models with greater veracity The constant within high or hyper growth spaces is innovation As levels of innovation rise the greater the growth within the space As innovation falls the subsequent rate of growth falls as well This explains why industries and the subsequent companies within shift from infancy stage high or hyper growth of innovation to a mature nature lesser levels of innovation The three companies poised to succeed in have maintained andor increased their respective levels of innovation in providing room for equity price appreciation in A bullish theme for each of the companies we discuss is a rising interest rate environment which will draw investors attention in an attempt to identify alpha for their respective portfolios Tesla NASDAQ TSLA In September of we published a piece using a more primitive form of the innovation model more centrally focused on the macro model of innovation We have since discovered that not unlike the cyclical nature of the equity markets while the macro market must be conducive to innovation the micro model must also be appropriately positioned for innovation The conclusion of the article provided a bullish outlook for Tesla More than months removed from the original piece Tesla is positioned to have a strong Strictly viewing the fundamentals of Tesla however provides a very different outlook Tesla has a Forward PE of an PS and a PEG ratio Most investors would run the opposite direction after reading these metrics The bullish nature we hold on Tesla is derived from its innovation score TSLA currently resides in a macro innovation environment of which categorizes Tesla as residing in a mature industry On a micro scale Tesla holds an innovation score of Akin to comparing commonly accepted metrics of PE PS PEG et al of a single entity against the industrys average we use the same approach with regard to the micro innovation score single entity and macro innovation score industry average The narrative of Tesla supports the quantitative metrics Elon Musk stated the Model will be unveiled in with production beginning in Additionally Teslas gigafactory in Nevada will begin producing in spring of and anticipates reaching full operating capacity by The same source highlights that the gigafactory was originally expected to begin production in effectively expediting the Nevada plant by a full year Tesla also rolled out their Autopilot program in October of again being at the forefront of technological capabilities within the automotive space Netflix NASDAQ NFLX September of saw us use the same pricing methodology on the streaming juggernaut Since that bullish outlook was provided NFLX has enjoyed an incredible amount of price appreciation with more than appreciation when split adjusted What holds in store for NFLX is the key point of contention for the investment community Netflix has a current PE of a Forward PE of PS a PEG and billion in cash and cash equivalents Excluding the cash stockpile NFLXs fundamental metrics are atrocious The current valuation simply isnt sustainable when viewed only through fundamentals When using the innovation metrics however we see a very different opinion The macro innovation environment Netflix resides in is a mere if an investor views NFLX as a pure media company which illustrates a fully matured industry If an investor views Netflix as residing in the technology sector NFLX holds a macro innovation rate of categorized as a developing industry by a rate above The proper categorization of the streaming giant is somewhere in between with a bias or skew towards the technology curve The micro innovation rate for Netflix is easier to discern as the metric is derived purely by Netflixs financials NFLX holds a micro innovation rate This is exceptionally bullish as the micro rate is more than double the industry average or the macro innovation rate The superior rate of innovation compared to the industry average indicates a greater demand for the Netflix product than competition Without belittling you as a reader this is obviously bullish for Netflix looking forward The narrative for Netflix fully supports the bullishness provided by the innovation indicators Netflix received Emmy Nominations the most recent award season nearly tying traditional content providing Fox Meanwhile NFLXs domestic growth has begun to slow at a marginal rate Whereas the overseas growth for Netflix has exceeded expectations at a rate more than offsetting the slowing of domestic growth Additionally Netflix continues to develop and deliver popular exclusive content such as House of Cards Orange is the New Black High Profits and Bill Murrays incredibly popular Christmas special Cord cutting has also increased as more and more users cut ties with pay television models and opt for streaming services Planned cord cutting rose again in from in to in As additional consumers switch to streaming NFLX is well positioned to capitalize on that audience going forward <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Another September piece we provided held significant

innovation rate Meanwhile <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>holds an astonishing micro innovation rate Again the micro innovation rate is derived purely from Facebooks financials whereas the macro innovation rate is derived by using the industrys averages The macro innovation rate accurately describes a rapidly evolving social media industry The micro innovation rate

associated with the social media industry and the exemplary level of innovation illustrated by FB superseding the already high requirement of the sector this is a very bullish signal The narrative for
