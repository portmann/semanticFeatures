still believe a mature Instagram business will bring in more than billion in annual revenue and affirm that Instagram should continue to drive ARPU growth in We believe that continued YY MAU growth in the US and Canada speaks to our thesis that Facebooks popularity domestically is being assisted by Twitter weakness With marketchanging catalysts on the horizon we believe the <span

style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB reported Q and fullyear results Wednesday As we expected the report was very strong with revenues and earnings easily topping estimates and this has sent shares up more than in trading today We believe the true growth story of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is just beginning and that will be a revolutionary year for the company as it attempts multipleapp consolidation Even at the current valuation there remains room for multiple expansion on LTM cash flow metrics and we further believe shares will continue to trend higher throughout The company performed well across all metrics during the quarter ARPU and MAU were up in every geography with ARPU growth coming in especially strong The ARPU boost especially domestically where ARPU jumped YY can be seen partially as a result of highdemand for Instagram adspace According to management of the top advertisers on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also advertised on Instagram during the quarter We still believe a mature Instagram business will bring in more than billion in annual revenue and affirm that Instagram should continue to drive ARPU growth in We believe the other driving force of higher ARPU will be video ads as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>continues to focus on feeding videos to its users From a monetary standpoint we see this as an attempt to take away video advertising market share from YouTube On the MAU growth front we are impressed that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>only lost basis points of YY MAU growth in US Canada in Q relative to Q The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform in US Canada is growing its user base faster this year than it was last year and this is impressive in what many view as a nearing saturated market We believe this speaks to our thesis that Facebooks popularity domestically is being assisted by Twitters NYSE TWTR weakness Also during the quarter margins expanded with GAAP operating margins expanding basis points sequentially and basis points YY Earnings increased dramatically and free cash flow doubled relative to Q We believe the quarter strengthens the secular growth story of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>becoming a consolidated app marketplace We have written several times on why we feel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is strongly leveraged in creating an allinone multipleapp ecosystem due to the size of its userbase Despite the strength of the quarter we still believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is only touching the surface of its full potential as a consolidated app marketplace With marketchanging catalysts on the horizon such as transforming Messenger and WhatsApp into commerce marketplaces coupling Services and Places to create a Yelp NYSE YELP substitute and fleshing out Sports Stadium to be a goto mobile sports information application we believe the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>growth story is far from over At a quote the toughest thing to understand about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is its valuation Many investors will see the earnings or sales multiples and say the stock is overvalued We contest that even after this pop the multiples still have room to expand We are paying specific attention to the cash flow multiples because we believe cash flow is a true measure of the companys profitability Looking at these cash flow multiples we can see that FB is actually trading at a discount to its growth LTM operating cash flow of billion means the stock is trading around x cash EPS This x multiple is on operating cash flow growth of The same story is true for free cash flow The stock is trading around x LTM free cash flow on free cash flow growth of YY We believe these multiples can expand so that the stock is trading more at a parity to its cash flow growth In sum we believe the pop in shares following what was an exceptional quarter is warranted We also believe the growth story is far from over for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with several marketchanging catalysts on the horizon We think the stock is actually undervalued relative to its cash flow growth and so we believe there remains upside both in the near and long term windows Tagged Investing Ideas Technology </div></body></html>
