build more server farms Google will remain dependent on x server chips from Intel for many years to come Altera fortified Intels position in artificial intelligence Alteras FPGA chips could neutralize the advantages of using GPUs inside deeplearning machines Alphabets NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL IO event revealed its plans over app streaming and alwayson connected artificial intelligence services This grand ambition of Alphabet is a longterm tailwind for Intel NASDAQ INTC The massive compute power needed to host millions of people using streamed apps will require Google to build more server farms Its going to be pricey Xeon processors again for Alphabets data center servers and deeplearning machines Google is and will remain the biggest buyer of Intelmade server chips This will not change any time soon Google buys around Intel processors quarterly for its server needs At an average discounted price of k per Xeon I guesstimate that Googles annual contribution to Intels coffers is around billion But I expect this business from Google to increase by Google has urgent need to accelerate its server deployments The servers need to cope up with the added load from its new services involving app streaming deeplearning virtual reality video calling Google Home and Google Assistant Below is a location map of some identified Googleowned data centers All of which are no doubt Intelpowered Big Data Customers of Google would love the performance bump from Intels upcoming core Xeon Phi Android device sales are still surging so Google also needs more data centers to track and gather personal data of more people Serving and analyzing targeted hyperlocal ads to more people further increases server load Intel truly has a fastgrowing fat milking cow in Alphabet Im dismissive of the rumor that Google will use ARMbased server chips Qualcomms NASDAQ QCOM bit serverclass never got any official note of approval from Alphabet ARMbased server chips have been available since but Intel still supplies of data center processors Google flaunted its Power server design two years ago and yet the best thing it could achieve was to demo another IBM NYSE IBM Powerbased server prototype last month Years have passed and Alphabet never made any official confirmation that it is actually using nonx server racks in its data centers They remain experimental projects that are speculative Googles massive success is due to its ultrareliable x servers Theres also twodecades worth of x server code thats preventing Google from abandoning Intelmade processors The required recompiling of legacy x software to ARM architecture is a deadly minefield with risks of server downtime A failed server is devastating to an internet company like Google Like it or not Alphabet is a captured client of Intel My own view over these moonshotlike server designs from Google is that they are just clever attempts to extract discounts from Intel Server chips are Intels biggest moneymakers Intel owning of the server market gave it the prerogative to price Xeons like superexpensive Louboutin shoes I am using shoes as an example because without Intels processors Google will stumble and fall flat on its face Google with tens of billions of dollars at stake is unlikely to ever entrust its servers to a bunch of Power or bit ARMbased microservers ARMbased processors are unfit for ultra massivescale computing Even the shrewd Chinese did not license the ARMbased Seattle server chip design of Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD or the Power of IBM Governmentowned Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co opted instead to license the xrelated processor IP of AMD They likely share my view that ARMbased chips are fit only for mobile devices not for selflearning server machines Yes Googles TensorFlow opensource artificial intelligence framework is flexible enough to use any CPU or GPU configurations However commercial vendors of TensorFlowbased deeplearning computers like Alluviate are selling Xeon Phioptimized machines An alternative to TensorFlow Caffe is also being optimized for Xeon Phi My point is that Intel already has battletested Xeon processors that work well with deeplearning frameworks The only thing that could rival Xeon Phis deep learning efficiency is Nvidias NASDAQ NVDA GPUs However Nvidias GPU advantage is not a longterm threat to Intel Let us not forget that Intel already owns Altera the top vendor of Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGA The superior GPUrelated activities like Facebooks NASDAQ FB facial recognition of deep learning machines could soon be replaced by FPGAs Alteras FPGAs could be programmed efficiently for specific deeplearning tasks Microsofts NASDAQ MSFT Project Catapult found out that FPGAs can deliver x the speed of traditional CPUs when it comes to processing some Bing algorithms Project Catapult was a supersearch Bing engine network of servers of Intel Xeon processors equipped with Altera FPGA chips Intel paid billion for Altera precisely because of FPGAs potential to neutralize the speed advantage of GPUs in some deeplearning activities It was a big bet for Intel to get involved in the future trillion market for artificial intelligence Intel currently has no inhouse discreet GPU products The crosslicensing deal with Nvidias GPU patents will also expire next year Intel has everything that Google needs Google is doing well using x processors There is no reason to endanger this profitable relationship The ever present threat from Amazon NASDAQ AMZN <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Microsoft requires Google to keep its servers always online and optimized I remain long INTC As of today there is nothing that can challenge the market share of Intel on server processors Intel is the pound champion that will fight tooth and nail to preserve his crown Even Qualcomm is intimidated saying it will take a gradual approach for its ARMbased server products Qualcomm doesnt want the embarrassment of failed products like those from knockedout ARM server vendors The Chinese will also still spend years of research to improve AMDs outdated Opteron design AMD got killed on the x server market because megacap firms like Alphabet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Microsoft found the Xeon inherently superior I wrote this article
