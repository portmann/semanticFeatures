class='textDiv'>Earnings Watch <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>And The US Dollar <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Facebooks Instagram Mobile strategy and Oculus typically dominate interest in the stock The weakening US Dollar however may positively impact FBs EPS <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has been riding some positive momentum of late and with earnings in two weeks there is a one wild card that could beat out the rest and take the company higher the abatement of currency headwinds Investors who are familiar with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are no doubt knowledgeable about how the company reports MAUs and DAUs monthlydaily active users are mightily trumpeted as the market seems obsessed with user growth for social media companies like FB Of course you have revenue growth mobile and ARPU average revenue per user as well But for this impending earnings report we believe currency could be front and center We previously discussed the impact of a weakening dollar on another multinational company Netflix Importantly we also believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will benefit from an easing of the dollar against international currencies We point to this chart by LPL Research for some context on the drag the dollar had been on the SP in and the forecasted impact on its weakness going forward In the most recent quarter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cited currency headwinds impacting revenue growth abroad Specifically Dave Wehner explained In Q total revenue was billion up or on a constant currency basis Q ad revenue was billion up over billion from last year yearoveryear growth was or on a constant currency basis The strengthening of the US dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the fourth quarter Had exchange rates remained constant with Q levels our total revenue would have been approximately million higher Our rest of world and Europe regions grew at and respectively as they were more heavily impacted by currency headwinds In fact the company believes its strong growth in given the dollars strength throughout the year will be tough to compare with results At the time of the last earnings report in January Wehner went on to explain that we expect to continue to face foreign exchange headwinds especially early in the year as we will be lapping periods where the dollar was relatively weaker than it is today But what to make of a quarter where the dollar did not continue higher but instead retreated That is exactly what happened in the first three months of The dollar fell against the Euro against the Japanese Yen and was weaker against many others So when Wehner mentioned that the way foreign exchange headwinds relate to the revenues and costs of the business indeed that a substantial majority of our expenses are US dollar base the market should be prepared to understand how the stress to FBs expenses may be letting up With the aforementioned mn at stake with those currency headwinds we believe the dollars abatement in the first quarter will be a strong positive for a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The impact is anyones guess but we could speculate using managements own numbers that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can stand to benefit tens to hundreds of millions of dollars We believe live video to be a highlycoveted area for social media networks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Twitter NYSE TWTR and Instagram Already over mn hours of video are watched daily on the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platforms and we expect this to continue to grow as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>rolls out its Live Video offerings Now on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users can broadcast live streams for Groups and Events discover live videos view maps like Twitters Periscope and use emojis filters etc during the streams We are looking for management to give us some details on how these new developments have impacted engagement average revenue per user and even user growth Mobile ad revenue continues to be the story behind <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>It currently represents a whopping of revenue up from last year FB most recently reported bn in revenue from mobile Characterized by a strong holiday season <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>saw impressive yearoveryear numbers as well The tiein with Instagram here is strong Over million monthly actives on Instagram is quite a benchmark so when FB reports soon we should be cognizant of where this number is going next Finally Oculus is another lurking revenue stream that investors can expect will receive some attention on the conference call Oculus was only mentioned times in the most recent earnings report We expect this to change dramatically as the launch and shipping of Oculus has begun in earnest Although it is not expected to impact Facebooks earnings meaningfully it could provide an impetus for growth going forward as well as unit sales benchmarks for investors to unpack Indeed next weeks F conference held in San Francisco has solid time earmarked for Oculus and investors should watch the conference with interest All in all <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>seems to be lining up some positive pieces of news ahead of the earnings report Mobile Virtual Reality and the rollout of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live Video all can underpin a great <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>quarter However we believe it is the abatement of the dollar that will really be the story of the day
