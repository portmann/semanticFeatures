Alpha <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is addressing video piracy complaints from YouTube content creators Rabbit TV has released a free <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>app with channels with prerecorded content and live streaming TVMovies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB was previously accused of tolerating video piracy Slate writer Will Oremus proposed that plagiarized video content from YouTube helped propel the growth of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as an online video platform A professional YouTube Creator also ranted that out of the top mostviewed videos on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for Q were reuploaded videos stolen from other sites The alleged stolen videos were responsible for billion views a major part of Facebooks total video traffic Oremus did admit that reuploaded videos from YouTube actually go viral faster and get substantially more views on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Unfortunately video creators hate the illegal upload of their content on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>they do make a living out of YouTube views Unlike Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL which gives share of YouTube ad revenue to content creators <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has not yet implemented any revenue sharing program for video creators Fortunately <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is aware of the problem and has addressed this issue of freebooting of online videos The new video matching tool that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is offering to video creators will help accurately identify freebooted videos for takedown purposes Publishers who use this new tool will also be able to detect stolen even small parts of their videos that get usedmixeddown with videos uploaded on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>itself will run the video matching tool to evaluate the millions of videos uploaded to its site If the algorithm detects an illegal copy <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will notify the rightful owner and ask them if they want the pirated video taken down <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is now also tempting topearning YouTube creators with its new offer of ad revenue sharing Video publishers will be missing a lot if they continue to ignore the billions of eyeballs inside Facebooks website The Wall Street Journal claims <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users now watch billion videos every day <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is also estimated to generate billion on video ads next year The new antipiracy efforts should further convince content publishers that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>deserves to be a real alternative to YouTube <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Wins The Backing of Rabbit TV No top YouTube video publisher has defected to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>yet However <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has won the support of Rabbit TV Rabbit TV has released a freemium streaming video app for Facebooks almost billionstrong users Rabbit TV is an aggregator of videos available online It also offer subscriptiononly access to new movies and latest TV shows The Rabbit TV Lite app for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>comes with free access to channels that offer live streaming radio news TV shows and prerecorded content from YouTube and other online video sites Since Rabbit TV itself is providing the YouTube content to people <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is likely no longer subject to complaints from YouTube video publishers Rabbit TV is a legal US entity that competes with Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and Roku It is a joint venture of FreeCast Inc and TeleBrands Corp the multinational company who popularized the As Seen On TV direct response marketing business model <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>therefore has found a worthy partner in Rabbit TV that will help the social network giant offer a Netflixforthepoor service Unlike Netflix the Rabbit TV Lite app works here in the Philippines The potential revenue from billion users possibly upgrading to Rabbit TV Plus or annual subscription is worthy of serious contemplation Rabbit TV Plus offers over streaming channels hundreds of thousands of past and present TV episodes and an ondemand library of over k movies Rabbit TV Plus also offers payperview for new movies and has tiein subscription deals with Hulu and Showtime If you want to watch a recentlyreleased movie Rabbit TV Plus will charge you I opine that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would not have approved the Rabbit TV Lite app if there wasnt a revenue sharing deal involved The massive longterm referral traffic from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could lead to millions of subscriptions to Rabbit TV Plus Implementing the freemium video streaming app for people outside America is a brilliant move Asians like me would likely consider cancelling their subscriptions to HOOQ and just pay to get one year of Facebookpowered Rabbit TV Plus The basic monthly fee of HOOQ in the Philippines is around or year As you can see from the screenshot below theres an advertisement on the streaming movie from Rabbit TV Lite It let me watch Tom Cruises Oblivion movie in exchange for the possibility that I will click the ad This is classic <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>freemium strategy Even without the premium subscription Rabbit TVs free streaming video app is still valuable because it is a new avenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to deliver targeted ads I also speculate that Rabbit TV andor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are likely to introduce preroll video ads in the future to freeloaders who are lazy in clicking inbanner or intext video ads Licensing fees from streaming premium Hollywood movies like Oblivion is not cheap Highermargin ads are required to recoup content licensing fees <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has already announced its intention to do preroll video ads last July Rabbit TVs free app might also get covered by Facebooks autoplay preroll video ads The future economic benefits from the partnership with Rabbit TV is likely to improve even more once the Rabbit TV Lite app is also integrated inside Facebooks mobile app and the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger Platform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>deserves to get a bigger pie from video streaming ads Rabbit TV is a valuable partner that could help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>profit from popularizing an affordable NetFlixlike service in emerging markets The year Rabbit TV Plus subscription service is cheap enough for most <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users FB is a Buy This advertisingdependent company is slowly diversifying itself to include freemium video streaming The threat of adblockers on online advertising is now also weakened by the emergence of
