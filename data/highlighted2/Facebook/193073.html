class='textDiv'>Twitter It Might Be Too Late For Jack Dorsey Twitter Inc NYSETWTR Seeking Alpha Twitter investors reacted positively to the news that Twitter was rehiring former CEO and cofounder Jack Dorsey So far there isnt much clarity on how he plans to turn things around Twitter NYSE TWTR has been making waves this year following a precipitous decline in its stock price which has left investors shell shocked Indeed the company finds itself in a tough spot as it struggles to grow its user base and is seemingly incapable of keeping up with Facebooks NASDAQ FB mass appeal Shares saw some relief when the announcement was made that Jack Dorsey would be returning to the company as CEO Yet with few tangible plans on the table and a user base increasingly frustrated with the websites interface the leadership change may be too little too late Few have over the last year or so disagreed with the notion that Twitter needed a change of direction User growth languished under CEO Dick Costolos lead as the platform simply did not offer users the simplicity and range of functions offered by competitors most notably <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Twitter investors would perhaps like to imagine the return of Jack Dorsey to the company he cofounded as similar to Steve Jobs return to Apple turning the company into the worlds highestcapitalized stock under his leadership Yet Dorsey faces many challenges as he assumes the driver seat Several things are currently limiting user interest in the platform First of all the GUI has barely seen any changes since the system was launched and is by now looking a bit dated to many Secondly the user interface is regarded as clunky and complicated according to some even challenging sophisticated users At the moment the service seems to appeal more to celebrities and other highprofile figures than the average Joe which is a huge problem in terms of growing the user base it needs to sustain revenue growth So what can Jack Dorsey do According to Twitters board the previously ousted CEO is a productdriven and passionate leader who has the creativity and insight to freshen up Twitters user experience and give it a more broadbased appeal Not everyone is convinced some commentators arguing that bringing back old leadership does not signal the kind of change the company needs in order to become competitive So far he has indeed announced a few new measures including the removal of the character limit for private messages and a Buy Now button but without much clarity on the ambitious road map for product changes in investors still dont have much insight into the companys future Another issue worrying investors is that he will simultaneously be CEO of Square a highgrowth tech company that will presumably require quite a bit of his attention <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>isnt currently eating Twitters lunch it is eating Twitters three main meals of the day as well as its snacks in between Twitter as of June th counted MAUs eking out a sequential gain Compare this to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The social media titan at the end of the same period counted some billion MAUs up sequentially and yearoveryear Twitter is currently simply not playing in the same league as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Two main factors seem to distinguish <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>as the social media platform of choice over Twitter its userfriendly interface and constantly expanding range of features <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>offers users more things to do and does these in an easier more streamlined way Twitter will thus have to come up with something similar in order to remain relevant simultaneously giving its platform a facelift and introducing new futures in order to attract and retain users At the moment its simply not clear whether Jack Dorsey will be able to make these changes in time and to the necessary degree Until he outlines a clearer plan for product development and we see the numbers coming out on engagement with this updated platform I remain bearish on Twitter in the near term Twitters change in leadership sent stocks up around investors cheering any kind of change at the moment However this enthusiasm may prove to be short lived Twitter is currently being outmaneuvered by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on all sides and many wonder if he has the time in his dualCEO role to put through the changes necessary in order to remain relevant Without more information on what exactly he plans to do with the platform and we see these updates in practice I see little reason to be bullish on the
