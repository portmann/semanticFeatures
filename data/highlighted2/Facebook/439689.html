class='textDiv'>Facebooks Oculus Rift To Benefit From Virtual Reality Advertising <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha As Facebooks Oculus Rift applications advance advertising is likely to be the best way to monetize the use of virtual reality Facebooks strength is its ability to effectively incorporate advertising into its apps We are used to seeing advertising everywhere in the real world As we drive we see ads on billboards trucks buses and some cars There are real estate signs on every property that is for sale or rent Businesses have signs and promotions on their buildings and properties We even see small planes with advertising banners as we sit on the beach Since we are used to seeing this is the real world I think that it makes sense for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB to implement ads within Oculus Rifts virtual reality apps Incorporating ads into Oculus Rifts virtual reality apps seems natural to me Advertising is Facebooks expertise as a business Advertising within virtual reality apps will be a larger source of revenue growth than from the sales of the Oculus headsets in my opinion You may buy a VR headset only once but advertising will keep coming to you with every use of the devices apps <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is already incorporating degree ads within its newsfeed This could provide a preview of how ads may work within Oculus apps Ads within Oculus apps could have multiple dimensions For example viewers may initially see billboards in the background or advertising on certain objects Users could then activate the objects to show more advertising details Once the ads are activated they could be displayed as degree ads Suppose a user was playing virtual reality baseball There could be advertising on the bat and advertising throughout the stadium in a similar way it is displayed in actual stadiums If the user chooses to activate the ads more info could be displayed perhaps incorporating a degree virtual reality ad that can be deactivated after viewing You could easily imagine a virtual reality race car driving game with ads on cars and the surrounding scenery Advertising is already on actual race cars and throughout actual racing venues So it would be natural to incorporate ads within games and other apps Users could take a virtual reality vacation to a tropical island There could be ads embedded in that scene for real vacationrelated productsservices The initial ads could be subtle such as a plane with an ad banner flying by Users can activate the ads to get more information and a degree tour of an actual resort hotel restaurant etc The ads could be targeted to the users based on their interests according to their FacebookInstagram interests and according to information in their computers cookies file The ads could also be related to the games or apps that the users participate in The ability to opt out of ads could be made available for a monthly fee This would keep revenue coming in while offering premium users an adfree experience Some investors have dismissed Facebooks move into virtual reality as a distraction that wont lead to material growth for the company However I disagree with that viewpoint Although there are kinks to be ironed out with the technology and many more apps to develop I think that the Oculus Rift will produce significant revenue for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>over the longterm I dont expect this to be immediate Significant revenue might not be produced from Oculus until five or ten years down the road Currently Oculus is primarily for gaming However more apps are likely to be developed over the longterm <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>tends to ease into monetization of its businesses after careful thought This is evident with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Instagram It is evident with WhatsApp since the company is waiting for the user count to grow before monetizing The cautious movement into monetization is also likely to happen with Oculus <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will probably wait for more apps to be developed and the technology to be refined before adding advertising to Oculus apps Although significant advertising dollars from the Oculus Rift are likely to be many years into the future the technology represents a strong future source of revenue It is good to know that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has something strong in the pipeline for future years I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from
