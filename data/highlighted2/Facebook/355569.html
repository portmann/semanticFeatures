threat from the recently launched <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live that is already preferred by media companies As everybody knows the constraining investment issue with Twitter NYSE TWTR is the lack of user growth Despite over million users the market fears that stagnant user growth will lead to an eventual downfall One hope for growing users is the explosive growth in livestreaming video via the Periscope service the company bought last year Unfortunately though the service only has a small lead if any over <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB that recently started a new streaming service Can Twitter use livestreaming video as a catalyst for higher stock prices this year The latest move by the livestreaming service bought by Twitter is to focus the market on a metric called Time Watched The company used the YearOne mark for a blog post about this and other Periscope metrics The Time Watched metric reflects the usage amount and not the level of users but the company needs to stick to the metric and portray the value in order to impress Wall Street One of the problems with the previous management team at Twitter was a constant shift in metrics used to direct investors As Periscope turned one over the weekend the company finally provided some updated metrics on the livestreaming service According to the blog post users are now watching LIVE years worth of broadcasts each day The number is an impressive leap above the years of video watched per day back in August when the service had million accounts The reported number has numerous flaws that underreport the actual time watched The number only represents the time spent watching live via the Periscope app whether iOS or Android The number doesnt include the following views The general assumption is that the Time Watched metric is growing at roughly years per month on average The number though is far from perfect as the latest ability to watch within Twitter likely diverts a lot of usage As well the number sounds impressive though it only adds up to roughly one million people watching an hour a day The big downside is that the service appears overly focused on watching live video as opposed to creating the video in a live manner that can be watched at any time in the future The biggest frustration with the service now is that the inability to record and watch videos beyond hours is preventing the building of broadcast type services that will capture the large user volumes and compel people to download the app While fully understanding that the Time Watched metric better reflects the usage levels of Periscope the market and advertisers are fully invested in the DAU and MAU metrics The heavy users sometimes skew the metrics and advertisers prefer the ability to address the whole market and not only a small market of big users In this regard Twitter and Periscope are making a dangerous shift away from the metric that works so well for driving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>FB to a market valuation of over billion The socialmedia giant focuses obsessively on the user metrics desired by marketers Of course the main platforms of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Instagram and WhatsApp primarily require volumes of users for success and the company hopes to parlay those volumes into success with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live In the case of those platforms it doesnt matter whether billion users have accounts to any individual user The only thing that matters is how many friends are on the platform to connect with In the case of Twitter and Periscope the more compelling metric is the amount of users with similar interests In that regard these services need fewer users to survive and thrive At the end of the day it still comes down to the amount of people using the service According to this New York Times article media companies are embracing <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live as the service draws more raw numbers than Periscope The relatively new service already has E Huffington Post and TMZ creating broadcastquality live shows The market for the broadcast shows appear wide open due to a lack of details regarding monetizing the services whether via subscriptions or sharing advertising Twitters Periscope has an opportunity to grow users by locking in some high profile media companies but the company needs to move fast or it risks losing out to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Ultimately the value of any social media service is representative of the combination of the amount of users and the time spent on the service The market prefers the amount of users so Twitter and Periscope are fighting the trends most used by the market Periscope is highly addictive but the company needs to develop a service for true broadcasters that will provide the large amount of users and eventually the ad dollars Large media broadcasts would naturally drive more users to Twitter and exponentially grow the value of the brand The company needs to move fast or <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Live will steal the market away Twitter remains the best way to play the livestreaming concept as Periscope sees exponential growth Live will only make a small impact on Facebooks value while Twitter has an enterprise value of around only billion The company still has a long way to go but the opportunity is large I wrote this article myself
