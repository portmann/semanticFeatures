network effect is a welldocumented competitive advantage The company however has something much bigger going for it human nature Say what you want about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>cash is king and it has a lot of it and is generating a lot of it with each passing quarter Valuentum Securities Our thesis on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is one grounded on the firm foundation that the company holds one of the strongest competitive advantages of any business model the network effect What a network effect creates is quite simple to define but extremely difficult to replicate Said differently as more users become engaged with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>more businesses want to interact with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and as more businesses interact with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>more users may want to engage within <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and so on It is a virtuous cycle of proliferating advertising revenue growth and optionality much like weve witnessed with eBays NASDAQ EBAY auction business in the early days of the Internet and with the likes of MasterCards NYSE MA and Visas NYSE V credit card processing network today But <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has another very very big thing going for it that arguably other networkeffect driven equities dont even Twitter NYSE TWTR and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD dont have it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is all about the vanity of the user and the company allows this to come through better than any other social media giant On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>its all about me and people love that Whether <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is good for generating a balanced perspective on issues or life in general may not matter People love seeing what they want to see in their own personalized feeds They love showing off all of their favorite looks putting their best selves forward in every respect Its some blend of Toby Keiths I Wanna Talk About Me and Brad Paisleys Online The beauty about <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is that it is everything that anyone could ask for online and whats more its all about me There is no authority on opinion in many ways one can argue that its not that frequent that the right opinion is the most popular in the comments section Sometimes facts dont matter on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The social media giant has brought society back to the days of high school When it comes to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>its not about how happy one is in hisher life its about how many likes one picture gets Have you seen this one Let Me Take A Selfie Nobody is going to post their latenight adventures on LinkedIn and Twitter makes it so difficult to find other acquaintances on the platform that it has become more of a news site than a social media platform Millions of people may not like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for whatever reason but the billions of others that do is what matters to our thesis on the company <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>captures the vanity of society at its core More than million likes for Kim Kardashian West Almost million for Taylor Swift Nearly million for Justin Bieber Over million likes for Cristiano Ronaldo the first athlete to break the million barrier Now anyone and everyone can follow their favorite celebrity and keep up with them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has hit at the very essence of human nature the need for belonging and social acceptance and perhaps it takes advantage of peoples insecurities monetarily How many likes does my business need before we acquire social acceptance How much will it cost What about my personal page How many likes do I need there And how much will that cost The measure of success on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is no longer happiness in life but how many likes one can showcase on a fan or business page <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has become the popularity contest in the days of high school but it allows individuals and businesses to pay to become more popular What a tremendous facet to add to its mission to connect the world For <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to fail human nature must change humankind in some ways must cease to exist Facebooks stock continues to soar following a strong first quarter report
