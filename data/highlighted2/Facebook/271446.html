class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Has The Potential To Replace Yelp <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha LF Capital Management LF Capital clicks We believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is gearing up to take on Yelp and Angies List We see <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Services and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Places as Facebooks initial attempts to leverage the vast network of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>review data to create a service review and discovery platform We believe Facebooks final product in this space will synergize the best parts of Places and Services in one consolidated application Consolidation in this space makes sense and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has all the usergenerated information in the world so we see Facebooks finalized business search service being the market leader upon launch With the recent announcement that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is prepping a local services site we believe the worlds largest social platform is gearing up to take on Yelp NYSE YELP and Angies List NASDAQ ANGI Given Facebooks scale and access to perhaps the worlds largest pool of usergenerated information we believe Facebooks service discovery and review platform when finalized will ultimately takeover current market leaders like Yelp and Angies List While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Services is an earlytest and it doesnt look like the company is ready to promote it yet it does come on top of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Places The company now has two features of the social media platform which have been kept relatively quiet but separately address the local business search market <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Services still in test mode has been live for about a month and is moreorless a searchable directory that looks like an overlap of Yelp and Angies List <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Services allows the user to search through local businesses <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Pages so this encompasses both professional services like plumbers photographers and painters and more leisure services like restaurants and bars As it currently stands though <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Services is not anywhere close to being an Angies List or Yelpsubstitute <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Places on the other hand allows users to explore things to do in a certain place It is essentially a travel book for a certain location complete with recommended places to eat drink and shop For example say you were looking for things to do in Sydney Australia You would go to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Places type in Sydney and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would return a page full of things to do in Sydney including popular dining and accommodation Clicking on one of these Recommended Places refers you to the places <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Page Perhaps more unique is <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Places allows you to see posts from your friends who have been to Sydney or checkedin as well as view current and upcoming events in and around the Sydney area <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Services and Places are two separate features on the vast social platform and neither have been strongly promoted by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>management Services is a very unfinished product still in testmode with the results section still omitting several businesses and lacking a sort button Services is currently desktoponly Places meanwhile is more fleshed out on desktop and accessible on mobile but is buried beneath the Friends Events Groups Instagram and Pages icons in the More section on your phone In essence both Places and Services are Beta versions and neither on their own without Facebookmanagement promotion are much of a threat to Yelp or Angies List This though doesnt mean Yelp and Angies List should be unconcerned with Facebooks Beta versions We are of the firm opinion that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can and will unseat both of these market leaders in time It certainly looks like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is staying mostly quiet on this side of its social platform until it can perfect a way to appropriately leverage its extensive network of service review data We have no doubts that this is the way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is headed as according to a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>spokesperson Were in the early stages of testing a way for people to easily find more pages for the services theyre interested in We take from this quote that Places and Services are Facebooks initial attempts to leverage the vast network of review data <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has we think of Places and Services as testruns at different angles We believe Facebooks final product in this space will synergize the best parts of Places and Services in one consolidated application as well as add missing features such as the ability to sort results an order from home book now feature on all pages where applicable and a cleaner and more complete results interface There will also likely be some integration with Messenger as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>took steps earlier this year to turn Messenger into a BC communication tool We are not sure when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will launch this Yelpsubstitute It could take a great deal of time to figure out all the logistics involved and appropriately leverage all the usergenerated data on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but we do believe that when <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>does launch a local business search and directory ads service this service will takeover current market leaders like Yelp and Angies List In our opinion consolidation here makes sense <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is the worlds largest social media platform with billion mobile monthly active users and roughly out of every people in the world interact with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>on a daily basis through desktop or mobile Yelps monthly mobile audience meanwhile hovers around million <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has access to more than x as many people as Yelp which also means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has access to more than x as many potential reviewers Individuals on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>post about everything from what they eat to where they shop to how they feel <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>posts cover the gamut of options and service review is no exception <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>recently announced that it has more than million active business pages that collectively receive billion comments each month Our research browsing through different companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Pages and Yelp pages suggests that Yelp on average currently offers more reviews than <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but this is to be expected Yelp is after all the servicereview platform On <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>though you can see how many likes the place has how many people have checkedin there and which of your friends have been there Perhaps most importantly you can browse through all of the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>posts related to the location This is all in addition to the reviews of the service There is plenty of data on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>that platforms like Yelp cannot offer In essence a local business search and directory ads service fits perfectly into Facebooks platform which is simply a collection of more a than billion peoples thoughts about everything Along that train of thought we believe perhaps the best way to get a mass sentiment on something is to go through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>because it is a collection of opinions of more than billion people If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>establishes itself as a servicereview platform then the participation of these billion people in both discovering and reviewing services through <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will likely skyrocket If customer participation increases then businesses will more actively manage their <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Pages This brings <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>one step closer to converting its million business page owners into advertisers There are many ways in which <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can fully leverage its userbase for service review and discovery One way is to do something like Facebooks Trending feature Using the Trending feature <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>users can select a trending news story and see what people on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are saying about it <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Pages could be reorganized to look more like these Trending pages where you can sort by things like top post and latest post relevant to the selected topic and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could add a feature that would be something like trending servicesplaces in your area <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>could also add a Recommended For You and Our Picks section It should be noted that advertising space in these areas could be a huge revenue driver Whichever way <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>chooses to leverage its userbase for service review and discovery <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has the potential given its userbase to takeover current market leaders like Yelp and Angies List Again consolidation here makes sense From the consumer standpoint one application for both posting opinions and collecting opinions seems ideal <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has all the usergenerated information in the world inclusive of likes posts pictures checkins and reviews It only makes sense that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>develops a local business search service and it looks like they are in the works of doing so We believe that when this finalized service launches it will become the market leader We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information
