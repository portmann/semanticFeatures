Minister Narendra Modi arrives for a town hall at Facebooks headquarters in Menlo Park California September MUMBAI India has become a battleground over the right to unrestricted Internet access with local tech startups joining the front line against <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc FBO founder Mark Zuckerberg and his plan to roll out free Internet to the countrys masses The Indian government has ordered Facebooks Free Basics plan on hold while it decides what to do The program launched in more than developing countries around the world offers pareddown web services on mobile phones along with access to the companys own social network and messaging services without charge But critics say the program launched months ago in India in collaboration with mobile operator Reliance Communications RLCMNS violates principles of net neutrality the concept that all websites on the internet are treated equally It would put small content providers and startups that dont participate in it at a disadvantage they say India is a test case for a company like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and what happens here will affect the roll out of this service in other smaller countries where perhaps there is not so much awareness at present said Mishi Choudhary a New Yorkbased lawyer who works on technology and Internet advocacy issues Also at stake is Facebooks ambition to expand in its largest market outside the United States Only million out of Indias billion people have Internet access making it a growth market for firms including Google GOOGLO and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>In a letter seen by Reuters the heads of nine startup including Paytm backed by Chinas Alibaba Group BABAN and dining app Zomato have written to the watchdog Telecom Regulatory Authority of India TRAI urging it to ensure Internet access was allowed without differential pricing The executives said in the letter dated Tuesday that differential pricing for Internet access would lead to a few players like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>with its Free Basics platform acting as gatekeepers There is no reason to create a digital divide by offering a walled garden of limited services in the name of providing access to the poor they wrote Zuckerberg has got personally involved We know that for every people connected to the Internet roughly one is lifted out of poverty he wrote in The Times of India newspaper this week We know that for India to make progress more than billion people need to be connected to the Internet What reason is there for denying people free access to vital services for communication education healthcare employment farming and womens rights A company spokesman said the aim of Facebooks Free Basics initiative was to give people a taste of what the internet can offer And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has issued a series of fullpage newspaper advertisements and set up billboard banners in an unusual and aggressive campaign to counter the protests Free Basics is at risk of being banned slowing progress towards digital equality in India said an advertisement published in Mumbai newspapers on Wednesday urging Internet users to support the initiative Launched last year in Zambia Free Basics earlier known as internetorg has run in to trouble elsewhere on grounds that it infringes with the principle of net neutrality Authorities in Egypt effectively suspended the service when a required permit was not renewed after it lapsed on Wednesday The regulator TRAI has asked <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Reliance Communications to suspend Free Basics until a final policy decision is made next month In a democracy you have both sides you have <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>spending so much on the campaign and on the other side you have internet activists making their own efforts TRAI chairman Ram Sevak Sharma told Reuters Our job is to make a policy that is in the interest of telecom operators and end users in India Whats Next Tomorrows Digital Life Thomson Reuters is
