class='textDiv'><span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Ignore The Noise <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha Its that season again where metrics are hyped up to show <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is failing and ready to go the way of technology giants past This noise is simply that and should be ignored as Facebooks financials are detached from the conclusions these data points intend to build My advice Ignore the noise and continue to watch the companys financials as it has had and still has impressive growth Right around this time before <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB issues its quarterly earnings investors are hit with news of how either Facebooks user base is falling apart or they have hit a road bump in ad load You name it and it is called out in the weeks leading up to earnings Its a fascinating trend that has repeated itself several times over with the same results <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>delivers and the stock responds in kind Remember when reports in were saying teens we re leaving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in droves Yeah I dont either Thats because <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>grew revenue by and earnings by between that report and the full year earnings release Undoubtedly in your weekly investing homework on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>you have seen the latest reports that publishers on <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are seeing a drop in traffic and original content being shared is down dramatically This kind of negativity is nothing new and just another episode in a series of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will fail eventually First of all has anyone stopped to consider the numbers these negative reports produce are actually because of a very positive back end reason Probably not so let me first share with you my thoughts which have yet to cross the tape If you have many users sharing information and it starts out with no other products such as messaging a sharing button or even pictures of your vacation albums you have one very small medium of which you can share your status and personal updates If this content makes up of the platform it is clear everything on it is original As you add new products you begin to have more mediums for original content like pictures but you also add a sharing button for that funny post you saw somewhere else on the web or that meme that is making the rounds Now some of the original content is mixed with some nonoriginal content Lets say it becomes original to nonoriginal Thats a decrease in original content but no one went anywhere What happened was more information was added and more products kept users on the platform It comes down not to the percentage of content from measured period to measured period but the stickiness of the platform Other opinionated writers will tell you that a lack of original content is the beginning of the end simply because you can find this information anywhere on the internet Aside from the fact that this is an affirmation of the obvious you mean I can Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL search that image too it leaves out one key point users are not leaving <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>to get the information they want The metric of original content as a percentage of overall content is irrelevant on its own because if users are still sharing original content they are also not turning to outside websites for nonoriginal content Instead those outside sources are shared within the walls of the platform This is exactly what Seeking Alpha editors and staff want us as contributors to do share links that originate on this platform so you dont leave the confines of where you read this exact text If this were <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>then some of my above links to fortunecom or timecom would have already been shared within the platform and using the example here I would link to the article that appears on SA showing the Fortune article content But I dont intend to inundate you with original thinking see what I did there which tries to make sense of the garbage and random numbers thrown at you on a weekly basis My point here is that none of that matters as long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>delivers Nothing weve seen from teenagers fleeing to original content has affected Facebooks top and bottom line Heres my advice to you ignore the noise all of it Because thats all it is noise But if youre feeling uneasy about simply ignoring it on my word let me give you some reassurance Lets go back to the fleeing teenagers I opened the article with It appears a January time frame is where the numbers became real to those with data Financially <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>in Q of reported revenue of billion and net income of million If teenagers were a problem that affected the investment thesis we would certainly see some kind of wavering in the financials Lets fast forward to Q of to see how it compares Revenue grew to billion while net income rose to billion good for a yearoveryear increase of and respectively Looks pretty good to me The stock price between that time Up nearly Sounds really good to me Lets jump to this most recent perilous indication of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>failing on the user activity front Since Ive already indicated what Q of last year looked like Ill just convert it to EPS to better compare to estimates for this quarter This year estimates are for per share on billion in revenue This compares to last years in earnings per share which would be good for a growth in earnings on a growth in revenue If this were to be accurate and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>either delivers or over delivers then this again is a case of more noise more annoying irrelevant noise You can read and listen to other authors and analysts about how all of these user metrics falling which as I covered probably debunks their own conclusion means something to <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>but until they can show you it is actually affecting Facebooks financials which is all that matters to those of us investing it can continue being blocked out The metrics and numbers spit out by detractors of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are relevant if put in the correct context and with the correct backdrop But they are meaningless if they have no relevance on how much money <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>takes in and how much drops to the bottom line The stock price does not move on user metrics ever The only reason the stock price moves in reaction to this kind of news is because of the worry that it may actually affect the revenue and cash flow What Ive concluded here is that this information hasnt affected the financials <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has produced cash at anything but a worrisome pace that would caution me to stop holding onto the stock While others may take victory in small battles of shorting the stock for insignificant daily fluctuation gains I continue to extend massive gains from predictable consistent growth all while ignoring the noise I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company
