class='textDiv'>Is Not Using The Product Reason Not To Own The Stock Seeking Alpha Time and again I see investors and colleagues writing and talking about not owning stock in a company simply because they dont use or own the product If this is their final reason for not investing in a company I believe they are making a serious mistake and are using an emotional excuse to deny themselves profits There are plenty of companies whose products you may not use or agree with but are growing fast and are highly profitable Why challenge the majority opinion Living in a highly connected technical world means we have the ability to buy a product and have it in our hands literally overnight Amazon NASDAQ AMZN has taken control on this front and it doesnt take but a small fee to indulge in an unlimited capacity Other products reach are even easier in that its only a matter of signing up to use them Of course Im talking about social media apps like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Twitter NYSE TWTR or Snapchat Private CHAT but this can extend to any Web website or app which provides a service There of course is more to this since not everyone has an Amazon Prime account or a Twitter account Even further there are likely less people in this focus group as we build out subsets that are combinations of any of the above and more or even all of them I cant talk to someone about their Amazon Prime experience if theyve never signed up for the trial Likewise I cant give someone my experience with Snapchat as I dont use the app If I did Id be quite the liar or accidentally the inventor of the next idea I personally have an Amazon Prime account but dont have a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account In fact I deleted my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>profile over two and half years ago At the same time its no secret I hold stock in this very same company Most investors wouldnt pass judgment about using a product but not owning the stock Many of us follow this philosophy just because we dont have unlimited funds to put towards every company whose products we use Or is it really because we know a product could be good but the company or stock not If thats so does the reverse hold true Should you not own stock in a company whose product you dont use I think thats silly While I believe one should understand what they are investing in both the product and the company alike I dont think its necessary to possess or use the product to pull the trigger If the product is doing well and the company is subsequently doing well then what difference does it make if you use it or not Most investors dont think twice about investing in cigarette companies but yet like myself have never touched a cigarette in their life If the companys income and if applicable dividends are doing well and growing then I certainly dont have to light one up in order to put my portfolio in that direction Going back to my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>example should I have sold when I deleted my account If I did I would have only made a profit Instead Ive continued to hold <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and currently have a paper profit Without my <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>account I garnered an additional gain What Im saying is the profits to be made are real whether you use the product or not Personally I think its a poor excuse not to invest in something simply because you either dont use the companys product often or because youve never signed up for it Its one thing if you want to research and mess with the product to get an understanding for what the company does but its another thing if you say its crap and wont invest in it based on that principle This backwards thinking is really no different than emotional investing Sure its difficult to separate emotion from finances and more so with a stock you love or hate see what I did there but that shouldnt get in the way of you profiting from what the majority of users or clients are saying with their wallet This is all a pretty simple thought but the reason why I bring it up is I see time and again people commenting about how they dont own a stock because they either dont use it often never have used it or simply think the product is a waste of time or is garbage Investing is not about your personal opinion of the product its about how the product does on the market how the company profits from that product and if the longterm viability of that product holds up andor leads to other viable products Your use or opinion of the product is typically not a majority opinion if the company continues to thrive I use <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>again as an example because many investors see it as a waste of time Thats perfectly fine I tend to agree actually The problem is when this gets in the way of profiting from the other people who dont care about wasting their time which allows eyes to be used for advertisers purposes Basically why fight the wave when its profitable My closing example is a personal one I dont use Apple NASDAQ AAPL products The only Apple product I owned was given to me as a gift back when iPods were in I have never spent money on a physical Apple product Ive bought songs from iTunes when I had the gifted iPod and furthermore I dont care for them for many reasons Now even though I might have a disdain for the product I could consider investing in Apple if I think the valuation is right the company is continuing to grow and I know profits are possible with my investment But Ill be honest its not easy separating my product philosophy with my investment analysis but if I want to make profits I must It would be a wise thing for investors of any type and any age to remove their product opinion as a driving emotional force in their investment and look at how it does from a majority standpoint Only then can you look at the company more objectively to determine if the product is being profitable and if there is a longterm horizon for it or related products Its not about your personal opinion of the product but rather your research of how the product performs and creates profits today and in the future Why let your personal product opinions stand in the way of financial success Invest in what is working and profitable not necessarily what you think is a good or bad product I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Macro View Market Outlook
