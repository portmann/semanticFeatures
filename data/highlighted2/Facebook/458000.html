Apple Watch Fitbit ranks low for both smartwatches and fitness trackers Apple ranks highest among manufacturers of smartwatches and Samsung ranks highest among manufacturers of fitness band devices according to the JD Power Fitness Band Device Satisfaction Report and JD Power Smartwatch Device Satisfaction Report both released today That was the news overnight delivered most favorably to Apple NASDAQ AAPL the Apple Watch fans and Apple shareholders While this is obviously not earthshattering news for the Apple Watch Fitbits NYSE FIT Blaze or Samsungs OTCSSNLF Gear Fit it certainly speaks favorably for the Apple Watch device in terms of consumer satisfaction Investors should also recognize the survey conducted by JD Power on behalf of their constituency has nothing to do with sales and everything to do with consumer satisfaction But that was likely designed by the survey The problem with most surveys lay within the human element and the intended or unintended bias created through the interaction with the survey I sometimes find it comical when Im asked the question as to what the margin of error is within the survey Its comical because the margin of error based on human engagement is literally infinite Any surveyor can construct a survey to elicit any outcome they desire Moreover lets take a look at the survey results from JD Power Associates keeping in mind of course that these are the same guys that gave Volkswagen OTCPKVLKAY numerous customer satisfaction awards over the years and through the scandal that broke back in regarding Volkswagen emissions falsification WolfsburgFrankfurt am Main September The respected American market research institute JD Power named the Volkswagen up the winner in the Supermini category of this years customer satisfaction survey Thomas Zahn Head of Sales and Marketing Germany of the Volkswagen passenger cars brand accepted the prize this evening at the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt I dont even desire to get into JD Power Associates awards and recognition offered to General Motors NYSE GM over the years and through the companys many failures pertaining to safety and overall quality No more digression onto the firms survey as noted in the first chart of statistical findings The surveys first consideration was with regards to fitness bands which by and large have demonstrated greater market adoption than has the smartwatch While Fitbit dominates this segment of the wearables category garnering of sales in Q according to NPD Group data the companys devices rate among the least favorite with regards to customer satisfaction I had alerted investors of this issue in the past and as it pertains to Fitbit device users In addition to a lack of differentiated revenue streams Fitbit products continue to exhibit elevated return rates at existing retail chains The Fitbit business has witnessed increasing return to vendors RTV as new products enter the marketplace as is to be expected and presently of limited concern due in part to consistent expansion efforts that generate revenue growth However at a current warranty reserve rate equal to of revenues Capital Ladder Advisory Group expects this metric to increase over the next month period and impact profits to a greater degree As defined by many warranty claims tracked through RTV receipts most replacement issues are due to band breakage andor connectivity failures For the everyday tracking of warranty related issues the Fitbit <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>social media community identifies this subject of concern with a near Visitor Post rate Rate not including promotion content Unfortunately while Fitbit does sell a great many fitness trackers and smart fitness watches the numerous returns have already forced the company to increase their warranty reserve rate The signs of things to come for Fitbit or any consumercentric company are always available for investors to discover its just a matter of experience and devoting the time to discovery As one can clearly identify in the results for fitness band customer satisfaction Apples Apple Watch doesnt participate Even though the watch does have fitness capabilities and in great quantity the surveyors decided the device should only participate in the smartwatch segment of the survey hence the discovery of initial bias Not so relevant in my opinion however and for this particular consideration In the chart above we see where the Apple Watch shines with regards to customer satisfaction and against the competition customers were surveyed who owned an Apple Watch over the last months In doing so JD Power Associates created the parameters for the survey or the intended sample size bias Also identifiable in the survey for smartwatch customer satisfaction and like with fitness bands Fitbit ranked near the bottom for customer satisfaction The point differential from top to bottom isnt all that much on the surface as it represents a small number of survey questions Think of it in terms of the public school grading scale If you miss questions out of you already find yourself with a grade of B The takeaway from the survey and subsequent Apple Watch award is well quite meaningless other than the surveys ability to drive public relations for Apple In discussing the survey results with a member of JD Power I had the following dialogue Seth Golden What was the return rate you guys found in your survey JD Power That wasnt part of the survey Seth Golden What were the search results for the various products surveyed JD Power Also not something we developed in the survey But here is the biggest issue with the JD Power Associates survey be it this particular one or any of them For JD Power Associates the surveys are not about knowledge but about money The surveys arent conducted so the results exists for the sake of existing they are conducted for the money that it brings JD Power Associates Companies pay JD Power upwards of for this customer survey exercise and data compiling If companies like Apple Samsung General Motors Ford NYSE F etc didnt pay for these surveys they would not take place The survey results help manufacturers design and sell products that consumers want and shows them how consumers feel about products already being sold to consumers Apple Samsung Sony NYSE SNE have all paid for this data for years Fitbit nor Jawbone pay JD Power Associates for this data Fitbit has another source of customer sales and satisfaction survey data the NPD Group Earlier in this publication I offered that of wearable sales for Q were for Fitbit devices percent Most recently NPD Group offered a new surveyreport that positioned fitness trackers as a more favorable device among the activity tracker community when compared to smartwatch users Seventynine percent of activity tracker users exercise on a regular basis compared to percent of smartwatch users according to NPD Connected Intelligence So Fitbit pays NPD Group for sales and customer data and NPD Group delivers a favorable sales picture for Fitbit activity tracker products Apple pays for surveys produced by JD Power Associates as well as other data providers and receives top ratings in customer satisfaction surveys even with declining sales for the device after less than months of Apple Watch existence Im not saying that a bias is being exhibited from either of these data and survey operators Im simply identifying relationships and juxtaposing them with survey outcomes Having said all of that if we look at realtime customer ratings on Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN we come to find that with or without an assumed surveyor bias the consumer still rates the Apple Watch higher than Fitbits Blaze product for customer satisfaction However where it is likely more relevant to AAPL and FIT investors Fitbit is leading in unit sales through the ecommerce channel at least This is of course a fact and easily reviewable The Fitbit Blaze has more than twice the number of reviews as the Apple Watch and is ranked as the best seller in the smartwatch category The Fitbit Blaze has only been on the market for months as well Lastly the Fitbit Blaze overtook Apple Watch as the sales leader on Amazoncom after only two weeks of sales This is black and white direct consumer reaction to these products in the market for every given day and without bias For more understanding of just how poorly the Apple Watch or any smartwatch has actually sold through retailers take a look at Targets NYSE TGT Q and Q earnings call transcript which specifically speaks to any strength in its electronics sales being tied directly to fitness tracker sales Nothing stated about the Apple Watch or any smartwatch Again this is from an unbiased party that simply desires to sell what sells These surveys offer the companies more data to play with than they offer investors anything of relevance The Apple Watch has been recognized very widely as offering less potential to the whole of Apples reporting metrics than originally assumed More importantly Capital Ladder Advisory Group point of sale and return to vendor data offers that the Apple Watch has the highest rate of return for any Apple consumer electronics product In previous articles I have also showed how appalling the Apple Watch sales had been Again real time sales data is without the existence of bias whereas surveys can and often do have intrinsic bias whether we desire it to exist or not To reiterate the JD Power survey results are noteworthy with regards to customer satisfaction but unfortunately have no bearing on sales and offer no construct for identifying returns of product to the vendor Its quite easy to look at headlines and judge them for efficacy or truth I hardly ever assume the validity of a headline and always dive deeper into the subject matter For those who read my analysis on the potential iPhone curved glass subject matter this is well understood The article received great readership and even found itself to be quoted and recommended in a recent Forbes publication In short initial headlines for the iPhone curved glass positioned the product to be the next great iPhone but none of the coverage offered the complexities of utilizing curved glass or the fact that this was already pulled back by Apple in years past Akin to my deeper dive into the iPhone possibilities I hope investors and readers have a better understanding of not only the survey process but what is being gathered in the survey and to whom it possibly benefits As we head into earnings season investors should better consider that the Apple Watch has been contributing the majority of Other category sales since the product launched in In Q of the Other category generated billion in revenues for Apple growing almost YOY and sequentially In the most recently reported quarter Other sales generated billion growing YOY but declining sequentially With Apple Watch launching in the coming months well have to see how the Other category sales have performed since the last reporting cycle Apple has continued to keep unit sales of the Apple Watch from the investor public The companys actions concerning the watch however indicate sales have been less than anticipated This sentiment is supported with price cuts for the device and improvements that better align the product to support greater utility among the health and wellness community The Apple Watch will likely show itself to have greater utility and improve Other category sales sequentially when the product launches With the incorporation of WiFi in Apple Watch the device should appeal to a broader demographic of consumers and retailers Having said that it still lacks the utility that would find it to be a replacement to the iPhone As such iPhone sales will still contribute to the bulk of Apples sales and earnings for the foreseeable future I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in
