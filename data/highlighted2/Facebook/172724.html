boost the health of the socalled app economy while undermining arch rival Google Inc GOOGLO which dominates the billion online advertising market The new version of the iPhone operating system to be released Wednesday will for the first time allow customers to download thirdparty software that strips out marketing messages such as banner and video ads when people surf the web via the Safari browser A slew of adblocking apps for iPhones are expected to launch this week But Apples new approach will not affect advertising inside applications such as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>FBO casual games like those from Supercell or King KINGN or even Apples own apps Apple is in effect nudging big brands to shift spending to apps rather than traditional online ads where Google leads Adblocking software has been growing rapidly on desktop computers led by early adopters among techsavvy young people but until now was rare on mobiles Some million people used ad blockers last year up percent from a year earlier resulting in billion in lost advertising revenue according to a study by Adobe and PageFair an anti adblocking tech company Although only about percent of Internet users globally use the tools they are especially popular in Europe In Germany and Poland for instance the figure is above percent Broad adoption of adblocking would bring a new set of headaches for online publishers many of whom are already struggling with plummeting ad prices In a nod to publishers concerns Apple will also on Wednesday launch a new app called News which will allow media companies to bypass blockers to serve their own ads or let Apple sell ads and share the revenue Google too could take a hit from Apples making adblocking mainstream if its own search advertising as well as the banner ads it manages for publishers through its DoubleClick unit were regularly blocked by a significant portion of web surfers Apple has not publicly explained why it decided to allow ad blockers on its mobile phones but Chief Executive Tim Cook gave a hint in June when he criticized internet companies for violating peoples privacy to boost ad revenue Theyre gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it Cook said in a speech We think thats wrong And its not the kind of company that Apple wants to be Adblocking tools should help web pages load much faster on mobiles as they strip out socalled scripts and trackers that are used to serve up the ads Some early pilots have shown media outlets like Vice and the New York Times loading twice as fast Surfing the web with fewer ads will also mean people will consume fewer megabytes of their mobile data plans Ultimately Apple wants there to be a better consumer experience on mobile and lots of ads on smartphones are really intrusive said Danielle Levitas of research firm App Annie Media companies are groping for answers sparking an arms race between adblocking companies and antiad blocking companies such as PageFair and Sourcepoint that try to disarm the systems for website owners Some like US broadcaster NBC will not allow people using ad blockers to watch videos on their sites while newspapers the Guardian and the Washington Post are prodding people using ad blockers to sign up for subscriptions Apples new policy could also force publishers who dont already have them to develop dedicated iPhone apps rather than relying on mobilefriendly websites German broadcasters ProSieben PSMGnDE and RTL RRTLDE and newspaper publisher Axel Springer have filed lawsuits against Eyeo the German company that makes Adblock Plus the most popular adblocker for desktops They have lost two early court cases although appeals are pending Apples move will open a new front in the fight Eyeo put its free iOS and Android apps on the market last Tuesday and others include Blocker Blockr and Crystal A spokesman for ProSieben declined comment on Apples move but said the TV company was looking into several technical alternatives to bypass AdBlocker software Roi Carthy chief marketing officer for Shine an Israeli startup that sells adblocking technology to telecom carriers said that over time Apple could even try to play an enforcement role by setting standards for advertising in apps Since Apple controls what appears in the App Store it could try to push developers to clean up the ad formats to make them lighter or smaller Carthy said But Apple will not cripple ads in apps they have an interest in maintaining theecosystem where the bread and butter is
