(Uncertainty) </span>The console war is over, and Sony (NYSE: SNE ) has come out the runaway winner over Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ).According to the June NPD numbers , the PS4 beat the Xbox One for the fifth time in six months, despite Microsoft gaining a temporary sales boost during E3 week where new consoles were sold at a discount.Nevertheless, with a near 8 million console advantage, the gap is too large to make up for this generation.With games like Activision's (NASDAQ: ATVI ) Call of Duty moving to a PS4 first model along with other multi-platform developers like Batman Arkham Knight, it's clear which company the industry and consumer base favors.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>But maybe it's not all bad for Microsoft. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With Windows 10 set to launch July 29 that will enable Xbox One streaming on PCs , and with a well-regarded E3 showcase featuring HoloLens and Oculus Rift technology, perhaps the Xbox One doesn't need to win the console war to be successful. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In fact, with a little help from Microsoft in the form of technological integration and strategic investment, it might stage a comeback in 2016, when virtual and augmented reality will get its due. (Uncertainty) </span>The headlines for the June NPD numbers were bad for the company, more PS4s were sold and the top selling game of the month was best sold as a PS4 bundle rather than as an Xbox One standalone.However, once one digs a little deeper into the numbers, there are figures that should encourage Microsoft investors and loyalists.Xbox One saw a 51% increase in sales compared to June 2014, and Xbox Live accounts increased by 22% over the same timeframe.This is likely due to the E3 week sale that did sell more consoles over those seven days compared to PS4, but also because major upcoming titles will not be Xbox 360 compatible.The problem with this strategy though is that the only time Microsoft can generate any sales momentum is when it knocks down the price.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>Sure, the Xbox One came under criticism early on for being nearly $100 more expensive than a PS4, which was one of the many faults people had with the console, but consistently relying on sales for stripped-down versions (which mostly were about getting rid of the unpopular Kinect and TV integrations anyway) leaves a dent in Microsoft's wallet in terms of lost sales and millions in R&D for additions that few actually wanted. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>This might change with the arrival of HoloLens and Oculus Rift , the latter being primarily financed by Oculus ' parent company <b>Facebook</b> , but for the present , it 's an example of why Sony has been able to put the console war to bed . (Facebook: Uncertainty) </span>In terms of games, Minecraft came in at #6 in physical sales according to the NPD figures, with Xbox 360 and Xbox One the lead consoles in each generation.This is especially important because it was Minecraft that served as the company's test game for the new HoloLens at E3 and at Minecon 2015.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>With a game that remains popular to consumers, as well as a strong PC following that largely preceded console adaptations, it gives Microsoft a strong platform to test out its new augmented reality technology, as well as how PC and console gaming can exist in the same universe with very little risk to the company brand. (Uncertainty) </span>Minecraft is a perennially popular title for gamers, which means Microsoft has something to play around with headed into 2016.According to NPD, bundle sales in June made up over 82% of hardware sales, up from 35% the year prior.With widely expected titles such as Halo 5 and EA's (NASDAQ: EA ) Star Wars Battlefront set to become Xbox One exclusives and first-launch respectively (the latter part of EA's subscription service EAAccess), Microsoft will likely be offering bundle packages around the holiday season to gin up sales.<span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>In light of how Xbox has become dependent on discounts and packages to move product, and how it's not getting them closer to recapturing the high ground in the console wars, Microsoft will hopefully look to adjust its sales strategy, focusing more on game quality and selling the Xbox One to Xbox 360 hangers-on rather than trying to win over the few neutral observers left. (Uncertainty) </span><span style='background-color: #ABEBC6'>If Microsoft can sell the Xbox One as a gamer-friendly console rather than the unfocused entertainment omnibus it was originally, it could win over future developers to make exclusive and premiere content for them instead of the PS4, especially since Microsoft is increasing its investment in independent developers. (Uncertainty) </span>Also, with increasing PC integration upon release of Windows 10, it will mean the Xbox will become an area of increased importance for the company, as the fate of its gaming division will become intertwined with its core PC business.This will become especially important as the attention of the gaming world shifts to virtual reality in 2016, and the coming battle between Oculus Rift and Sony's Project Morpheus, with HoloLens standing alone in the augmented reality business.Microsoft lost the 8th generation console war due to self-inflicted injuries.With more resources plowing into virtual and augmented reality, the next battle is not a fight Microsoft can afford to lose.Source: Is It Good That Microsoft Lost The Console War?Disclosure: I am/we are long ATVI.(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you shortly for a conversation.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO Our PRO subscription service was created for fund managers, and the cost of the product is prohibitive for most individual investors.If you are an investment professional with over $1M AUM and received this message in error, click here and you will be contacted shortly.Thank you for your interest in Seeking Alpha PRO We look forward to contacting you when we have an individual investor product ready!</div></body></html>
