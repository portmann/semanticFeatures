Creation <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQFB Seeking Alpha FB has announced that it will now track time spent viewing a post or article Facebooks algorithm will now score higher any post that you view for a longer than patter duration viewing this as more relevant content I believe this is yet another obvious step in the direction of optimizing FB its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform for Inbound Marketing and content creation Continue to be long FB as a Core Position as the company should be able to play any success with this into a huge adspend market share <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB has altered its algorithm to begin scoring posts that you spend more time looking at higher Thats right if you stop on a post to read it Facebooks allpowerful algorithm will know Again it wont just know itll make sure that the content youre viewing that more content like it will be presented and visible For me this is a huge shot fired in Facebooks future relevancy and long term viability The goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you The actions people take on Facebookliking commenting or sharing a postare historically some of the main factors weve considered to determine what to show at the top of your News Feed But these factors dont always tell us the whole story of what is most meaningful to you Recently as part of our ongoing effort to improve News Feed we asked people to rate their experience and tell us how we can improve the content they see when they check <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>From this research we learned that in many cases just because someone didnt like comment or share a story in their News Feed doesnt mean it wasnt meaningful to them There are times when for example people want to see information about a serious current event but dont necessarily want to like or comment on it Based on this finding we are updating News Feeds ranking to factor in a new signalhow much time you spend viewing a story in your News Feed SOURCE newsroomfbcom Ive spent the last few weeks detailing how I think the socialplatformecosystem providers of Apple NASDAQ AAPL and FB are in an arms race to acquire optimize and position themselves to be the single most important providers of content in a world that is slowly actually rapidly seeing advertising dollars shift into Inbound Marketing Content Marketing and Growthhacking I believe FBs algorithm shift is another example of an Easter Egg helping support my thesis So as Ive written in the recent past I believe Facebooks Instant Articles are going to be the central focus of FBs overall adspend capture strategy The idea that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>can not only make visible an inbound marketing effort but actually present the content to a person in which the content will resonate is a huge differentiator and value add Now it should be noted that FB is already showing it can do this via the international markets albeit in small size and not via Instant Articles But the early results of FBs Creative Accelerator program are no doubt a big push forward in the right direction FBs ability to dial in its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>algorithm are going to be paramount in furthering this early momentum and in establishing a market share leadership spot longer term FB has watched its <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>platform at least anecdotally and the company has acknowledged this in the past briefly become more and more the playground of content farms like Upworthy Gawker and Buzzfeed who are simply interested in click baiting an open and a share from users This in my opinion cheapens the overall nonrecognized content stream read my friends didnt post this and also makes users more reluctant to give a nonrecognized content piece a read Again at least in my opinion If FB can optimize the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>algorithm to eliminate this content altogether or to greatly reduce its occurrence users might be willing to give nonrecognized content an open and a read to completion Both metrics that FB can track and that it can sell Also both metrics that will lead to other metric improvements metrics like time on platform page views bounce rate etc What that means is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>only shows users the largest collection of users in the history of technology what it thinks the user wants to see Instagram on the other hand is an unfiltered stream of content that shows any and all comers Sure owning a roadside billboard is better than nothing but being able to advertise in a cinema about a fashion product to a group of movie patrons about to watch Sex and the City is an entirely different valueadd <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>again has the largest cinema in the world with the largest audience to stick with our analogy Maybe sometime soon FB will be able to announce that its top platform can tell what movie the audience bought a ticket for a very powerful statement Alone this update from FB would have been meaningful but when taken in with consideration for all the other recent updates Instant Articles Creative Accelerator Lite etc it becomes something much more For me this is FB securing heavy artillery for what should be the battle of the century The battle for Inbound Marketing spend that will shape the next century of wealth in the entire technology space Were seeing the confluence of marketing social and technology If FB can dial in its algorithm it should be able to create generational wealth for those invested Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Altering The <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook
