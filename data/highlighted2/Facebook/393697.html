However if margin debt trends lower and continues lower I would expect the untouchable companys shares to suffer a worse fate than the broader SP SPDR Trust For a number of real estate speculators financial leverage is a path to riches Why buy one property with when you can buy five properties with down on each After all the in mortgage obligations are little more than a nuisance particularly when the inflationadjusted cost of borrowing is free And the five homes should be worth a piece in four years Heck the shrewd financier would double hisher initial to Naturally leverage does not always work out so well Plenty of folks learned this fact the hard way in the real estate collapse In the example above where the speculator had been leveraged to homes that began at and fell to severe consequences came to pass The initial did not simply fall to rather it left the individual with negative equity and in outstanding obligations Thats what it means to be underwater The world of stocks is in actuality quite similar Many marketbased investors set up margin accounts to buy their favorite stocks with less than the full amount necessary For instance lets say that you believe <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB is unassailable unbeatable and the best thing since skinny lattes You want shares of FB but at roughly per share the youve got to your name wont cut it So you decide to acquire the shares on margin meaning that you borrow an additional from your custodial firm and place your existing FB shares up as collateral Your loan This initial amount is what the investment world dubs margin debt If <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>goes from to as youve projected the price jump would net you a gain of on your investment You only put down and borrowed the other half but the to leverage would give you in gains or pop On the other hand what if FB actually nosedived to I know I know Thats impossible It may even be sacrilegious to imagine Just for kicks though lets say that FB did shed per share and hit a maintenance requirement of or per share You would receive a margin call such that youd be required to come up with cash or liquidate existing shares of FB to deposit the into the margin account Forced liquidation of your golden egg That would leave you with roughly shares of FB worth about of which only is yours alone Thats right The decline at to leverage resulted in a loss It is conceivable one may suppose that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>would never suffer a normal bear market decline of Indeed the haircut back in may have been a fluke for the social media giant Then again if a retreat were in the cards a player in the the margin debt game would see the entirety of hisher principal evaporate Like most people I have plenty of good things to say about the social media megastar I suppose I have some qualms about a pricetosales NYSE TTM premium that is x greater than the SP at large versus and where virtually all of the revenue comes from advertising alone Nevertheless what troubles me more about buying into the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>story in is the universal belief that the shares are untouchable and that the price can only go higher Read Wall Street Thinks <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Is Perfect Didnt we see hear the same stories about Apple NASDAQ AAPL Didnt we hear some of the same talk about the New Economy in The universal belief system on FB that currently exists will be played out in margin debt In particular the correlation between NYSE margin debt and the movement of the NASDAQ index is exceptionally tight Margin debt up NASDAQ up Margin debt down NASDAQ down That has been the pattern Why is this vexing For one thing yeartodate the Fidelity NASDAQ Composite ETF NASDAQ ONEQ is significantly underperforming the SP SPDR Trust NYSEARCA SPY That might suggest an investment community that is more wary than ever about momentum stocks in the social media biotech or dotcom space More critically the most adored stocks are the ones with the most margin debt attached to them While that helps them rise rapidly in bull markets it causes them to unravel even faster in bearish downtrends In other words margin calls that might someday force the liquidation of beloved FB shares would punish those shares mercilessly irrespective of fundamental value balance sheet strength growth prospects yearoveryear mobile ad revenue or Zucks charm In essence margin debt may tell you more about whats in store for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>FB in the next few years than any other factor If margin debt is trending higher in a sustainable fashion I would expect FB to outperform the competition However if margin debt trends lower and continues lower I would expect the untouchable companys shares to suffer a worse fate than the broader SP SPDR Trust SPY To be frank neither the benchmarktracking ETF for the SP nor shares of the largest social network would do well if margin debt began tanking Take a look at the chart below NYSE margin debt peaked before the dotcom disaster as well as the financial collapse Margin debt is currently showing similar deterioration since its pinnacle in April of Not surprisingly both the Dow and the SP hit their respective peaks in May of and have yet to reclaim those record highs Keep in mind outside of the eurozone crisis when the SP descended from toptobottom closing prices margin debt has been on a steady upward trajectory As of March margin debt is roughly below its April record Either margin debt begins recovering the way that it did after the eurozone crisis providing a muchneeded tailwind for stock assets or the pattern witnessed in the previous bear markets is likely to destroy a great deal of wealth And that includes the market capitalization of <span

correlated with year forward returns for US stocks In particular when margin debt has ascended to of GDP forward threeyear returns were negative and abysmal when margin debt descended to of GDP in both ans forward threeyear returns were positive and outstanding Heres the simple takehome <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is not immune to the adverse effects of financial speculation If financial speculation via margin debt as a percentage of overall economic activity continues to contract from the record high set in April of stocks will suffer If speculators step
