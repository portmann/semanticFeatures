style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has been losing its cool for three years but the stock has quadrupled while the user base has grown in that time frame What <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is losing in coolness it is gaining in necessity <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has successfully transformed from an entertainment platform to a utility The stock is trading at a deep discount to its inherent growth Shares of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB are sinking in trading today amid news that notorious shortseller Andrew Left is short the stock According to Left the platform is losing relevancy He says <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is losing share to Snapchat and overstaying its welcome in other niches I am not saying <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a bad company it just will not be a billion company in a year We have heard this argument before We have actually heard it several times before In we heard that FB was losing its cool among teenagers as they opted for Snapchat instead The story repeated in with people saying FBs penetration of the young adult market decreased as the demographic shifted to Snapchat Throughout we heard the same story in articles such as this this and this Yet despite the story of FB losing its cool being around since the stock price has more than quadrupled in that time while the user base grew more than from billion to billion We arent saying that FB isnt losing its cool FB is losing its cool among teens and young adults simply because it is quite hard for teens and young adults to look cool on a platform their parents grandparents aunts and uncles use The party isnt cool when your mom and dad are there What we are saying though is it doesnt matter In other words this loss of coolness is not a valid reason to short the stock The fading of coolness has been a trend for years but the stock has quadrupled and the user base has grown Why Because although the platform isnt cool anymore everyone still uses it While teens and young adults are flocking to Snapchat to post their ephemeral pictures and videos the cool stuff they still remain on FB for other reasons FB has successfully transformed from an entertainment platform to a utility a place where users can access the latest news stories Trending get reviews on services Services discover things to do Places check the scores of games Sports Stadium message essentially anyone on the platform if you know their name Messenger create and organize groups Groups and tap into the biggest network of social selling Pages among a multitude of other things Further consolidation with attempting to make Messenger an ecommerce marketplace and creating a Yelp NYSE YELP killer will only serve to boost FBs functionality and crossgenerational appeal In essence the number of features available on FB means that it is wholly distinct from Snapchat It doesnt need to be cool to grow It needs to be necessary For all the reasons already listed we argue the platforms necessity is only growing Relating the discussion back to young adults and teens FB for them is essentially a cross between LinkedIn NYSE LNKD and Snapchat To young adults LNKD is pure business no play while Snapchat is all play no business FB is a little bit of both It is still social media site so not a LNKD comp but it retains a semiserious semimature feel that is far different than the secondsanditsgone vibe Snapchat embodies All three platforms are necessary all three are unique and all three will grow concurrently at rapid rates over the next several years Back to the investment thesis we disagree with Left that the stock isnt worth billion We actually think it is worth much more The stock is trading right around x operating cash flow and x free cash flow on an EV basis These multiples are discounts to trailing growth which has persisted at high levels for several quarters Operating cash flow grew YY in Q and has grown YY in each of the past quarters Meanwhile free cash flow grew YY in Q and has grown in each of the past quarters It is similar story on the bottomline With LTM NonGAAP EPS of FB is trading at x trailing earnings While this is not cheap in a traditional sense it is a major discount to the companys MRQ earnings growth of The x trailing PE multiple is also a discount to what MSFT just offered for LNKD A takeover price of per share and LTM nonGAAP EPS of means MSFT offered x trailing earnings for LNKD We think it is a strategic move at this point in time to buy FB at a discount to LNKD x versus x given FBs stronger position more growth potential and less economic sensitivity We are adding to our FB position here despite being fully aware that FBs coolness has worn off While coolness is fading necessity is growing and we think the worlds most necessary social platform is worth much more than billion Disclosure I amwe are long FB LNKD I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Tagged Investing Ideas Long Ideas Technology Internet Information Providers </div></body></html>
