Streets estimate by cents In contrast Seeking Alpha premium author J Mintzmyer is bearish on Disney due in part to its valuation and recommends investors short the stock For Disney longs who remain bullish but want to hedge their downside risk over the next several months in light of Mintzmyers short call we present two hedges If guests have the nerve to die they wait like unwanted calories until theyve crossed the line and can do so safely off the property With Disney NYSE DIS reporting earnings after the close the nearly Disney analysts reporting to Estimize collectively predict the company will beat Wall Streets consensus earnings estimate as the graph below shows The Estimize consensus earnings estimate shown above is cents ahead of the Wall Street consensus of Since its analysts include private investors as well as those from independent research shops buy side firms and sell side firms Estimize says its estimates tend to be more accurate than those from Wall Street analysts alone On the bearish side is Seeking Alpha premium author J Mintzmyer who runs the Seeking Alpha Marketplace service Value Investors Edge In a recent Pro Research column Time To Short Disney Mintzmyer argued the stock was horribly expensive For Disney longs boosted by the bullish Estimize earnings prediction but looking to hedge their downside risk in the event Mintzmyers short call gets validated over the next several months well look at a couple of ways of doing so below the refresher on hedging terms Recall that puts short for put options are contracts that give an investor the right to sell a security for a specified price the strike price before a specified date the expiration date And calls short for call options are contracts that give an investor the right to buy a security for a specified price before a specified date Optimal puts are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest cost A collar is a type of hedge in which you buy a put option for protection and at the same time sell a call option which gives another investor the right to buy the security from you at a higher strike price by the same expiration date The proceeds from selling the call option can offset at least part of the cost of buying the put option An optimal collar is a collar that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest cost while not capping your possible upside by the expiration date of the hedge by more than you specify In a nutshell with a collar you may be able to reduce the cost of hedging in return for giving up some possible upside Were going to use Portfolio Armors iOS app to find an optimal put and an optimal collar to hedge Disney but you dont need the app to do this You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if youre willing to take the time and do the work Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app an additional piece of information youll need to supply along with the number of shares youre looking to hedge when scanning for an optimal put is your threshold which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk This will vary depending on your risk tolerance For the purpose of the examples below weve used a threshold of If you are more riskaverse you could use a smaller threshold And if you are less riskaverse you could use a larger one All else equal though the higher the threshold the cheaper it will be to hedge Here are the optimal puts as of Mondays close to hedge shares of DIS against a greaterthan drop by late October As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above the cost of this protection was or of position value A few points about this hedge To be conservative the cost was based on the ask price of the put In practice you can often buy puts for less at some price between the bid and ask The threshold includes this cost ie in the worstcase scenario your DIS position would be down not including the hedging cost The threshold is based on the intrinsic value of the puts so they may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security declines significantly in the near term when the puts may still have significant time value When searching for an optimal collar youll need one more number in addition to your threshold your cap which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge For example if youre hedging over a month period and you think a security wont appreciate more than over that time frame then it might make sense to use as a cap You dont think the security is going to do better than that anyway so youre willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that We checked Portfolio Armors website to get an estimate of Disneys potential return over the time frame of the hedge Every trading day the site runs screens to avoid riskier investments on every hedgeable security in the US and then ranks the ones that pass by their potential return Disney didnt pass the two screens do the site didnt calculate a potential return for it So we looked at Wall Streets price targets for the stock via Yahoo Finance pictured below We usually work with the median target but in this case its pretty low relative to the price of the stock The month price target represents about a potential return between now and late October On the other hand the high target of implies a return of about over that time frame By using a cap of we were able to eliminate the cost of the hedge in this case so we used that As of Mondays close this was the optimal collar to hedge shares of DIS against a greaterthan drop by late October while not capping an investors upside at less than by the end of that time period As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above the cost of the put leg was or of position value But if you look at the second part of the collar below youll see the income generated by selling the call leg was a bit higher or of position value So the net cost was negative meaning an investor opening this collar would have collected an amount equal to or of position value Two notes on this hedge Similar to the situation with the optimal puts to be conservative the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls In practice an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more again at some price between the bid and the ask so in reality an investor would likely have collected more than when opening this collar As with the optimal puts above this hedge may provide more protection than promised if the underlying security plummets in the near future due to time value for an example of this see this recent article on hedging Apple NASDAQ AAPL Hedging Apple However if the underlying security spikes in the near future time value can have the opposite effect making it costly
