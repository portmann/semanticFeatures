produced EPS beat despite currency issues Last week was not a pretty one for shareholders in the social media space Shares of Twitter NYSE TWTR and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD both dropped after their earnings reports As a result social media leader <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB saw its shares drop back into the s despite a fairly decent report from <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>a week earlier In this article I detail why <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has extended its social media dominance meaning investors should take advantage of this pullback Facebooks first quarter headline numbers were mixed primarily thanks to the strong rise in the US dollar You can review those headline numbers in the Seeking Alpha transcript of the companys earnings conference call Even though revenues were hurt by currencies and this is a tremendous investment year for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>the company still managed to produce a quarterly GAAP profit of million You dont see that happening at Twitter or LinkedIn There were three important items when it came to the <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>report First the company reported tremendous growth in its video traffic which FBN notes as extremely important because video ad prices can be substantially higher The second item is that the company reduced the top end of its spending guidance for on the conference call NonGAAP expenses important for looking at analyst estimates are now forecast to rise down from previous guidance of The third item is that <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>showed strong growth in its average revenue per user metric in its largest region the US and Canada Yearoveryear growth topped as seen in the chart below The currency issue is something all names are dealing with Right now analysts are looking for just over billion in revenues this year That number would be a lot closer to billion if not for the stronger dollar so well see how the rest of the year plays out It is good though that expense guidance was trimmed so <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>may be able to top in nonGAAP EPS this year Because of its decent profits <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>maintains a much better valuation than its social media peers The company trades for about times expected nonGAAP EPS this year Twitter goes for more than times its expected EPS and thats after shares plunged last week thanks to a revenue miss and forecast cut LinkedIn currently fetches about times its expected earnings and thats after that names huge postearnings drop and EPS forecast cut Why would investors want to hold names that are disappointing when they can own <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>which is doing quite well <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares were close to an alltime high into this earnings season The slight revenue miss and bad reports from Twitter and LinkedIn has resulted in a decent pullback <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>shares are now below their day moving average as seen in the chart below This has usually been a good time to buy After the latest set of quarterly results investors should be even more confident in <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>While the company did miss on revenues thanks to a stronger dollar the bottom line result was strong and the yearly expense forecast was reduced While other social media names are reducing yearly numbers and seeing their shares plunge <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is producing solid results A recent pullback makes the name even more attractive and investors should seize the opportunity Source <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Extends Its Social Media
