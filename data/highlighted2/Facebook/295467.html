it expresses my own opinions I am not receiving compensation for it other than from Seeking Alpha I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article Dreamworks Animation cut costs and released just one feature Home in The studio will release Kung Fu Panda in January in time for Chinese New Year Near the end of it plans to release Trolls a musicalcomedy starring Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake The company has been growing revenues from nonfeature segments including content appearing on Netflix YouTube and a newlylaunched Verizon video service Hollywood film and television producer Dreamworks Animation NASDAQ DWA began with a rough start On January it announced a major restructuring of its film business Specifically in an effort to improve profits it reduced its production target from three feature films a year to two The company also announced layoffs shuttering of one of its California production locations and completed a saleleaseback of its iconic Glendale California headquarters The company took these measures after writing down four of its features released in about a twoyear period from November to November Including writedowns the company reported a net loss for fiscal of per diluted share That compared to net income of per share for fiscal and a net loss of for fiscal The company released just one movie in the successful Home which grossed about million worldwide and million domestically according to Box Office Mojo Despite Homes success the company including charges has reported a loss of per diluted share for the first nine months of including negative in the most recent quarter ending September Adjusted reported net loss for the first nine months of was per share Adjusted net income for the most recent quarter was per share Despite the bad start to as of December DWA stock has increased about since the start of the year I think this is because investors are beginning to realize that this company is successfully executing its strategy to diversify beyond the feature film business as its other segments revenues and contributions to gross profits are growing As approaches DWA will start the new year with a sequel to its globally popular Kung Fu Panda franchise In November it plans to release a musicalcomedy Trolls featuring the voices of Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake As the company works to continue its successful growth in its nontheatrical segments I believe these two films will act as catalysts for the stock at the beginning and end of the year Obviously whether they are positive or negative catalysts depend on expectations at the time the films are released and whether results exceed expectations However based on current analyst expectations for DWAs earnings I believe these films will achieve better results than currently expected by the market For these reasons which I explain in greater depth below Dreamworks Animation is my favorite pick for stock of As the company still relies heavily on its feature film business through theatrical releases digital releases and pay television releases see table based on the most recent Q below with numbers rounded I will first look at the prospects of its two feature films set for release in Then I will discuss the significance of Dreamworks growing nontheatrical content provided to companies such as Netflix NASDAQ NFLX and Verizon NYSE VZ Kung Fu Panda is set for release on January just before Chinese New Year on February The first Kung Fu Panda movie grossed about million in theaters worldwide according to Box Office Mojo of which about million was domestic Kung Fu Panda reportedly grossed million in theaters worldwide of which million was domestic There are many reasons to get excited about Kung Fu Panda from an investing standpoint First it is the first coproduction between Dreamworks and Oriental Dreamworks a jointventure between Dreamworks and its Chinese media partners As Apple NASDAQ AAPL CEO Tim Cook has often pointed out China is projected to have the fastest growing middle class in the history of the world Second unlike other animated movies in which the characters are drawn speaking English and dubbed into other languages this movie will be released with Englishspeaking animation and Mandarinsynced animation Third as noted above as Kung Fu Panda progressed worldwide receipts increased The international portion of the worldwide receipts grew from about twothirds to seventyfive percent As investors tend to focus on domestic results especially in movies investors who listen to box office reports in the media may be overlooking this upcoming films international prospects According to Deadline Journey To The West Conquering The Demons which was released in the New YearSpring Festival season went on to be the top grossing film of the year in China at about million Deadline also reported in the rd and eighth highest grossing movies were released during that season In Box Office Mojo reported that the Man from Macau II released on Chinese New Year was the eighthhighest box office grossing movie in China at a million In contrast Kung Fu Panda grossed million in China according to Box Office Mojo This was up significantly from the first installment reportedly grossing million in China The increasing popularity of the franchise along with the New Year release date and Chinese coproducer improving the experience for Chinese viewers are reasons to be optimistic about this movies prospects in China As mentioned above KFPs domestic gross declined for the second installment from million to million despite international growth Following the movies release during a conference call DWA CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg attributed the decline to the unexpected box office winning opening weekend of the RRated The Hangover Part II At a reported opening longweekend gross of almost million The Hangover trounced the Panda sequel which grossed about million when they both opened on Memorial Day Weekend in Perhaps investors may not be considering how the last movie in the franchise was up against the Hangover sequel This time around according to the IMDB there are currently no blockbuster Hangoveresque sequels being released on the weekend KFP is released I suspect that the Marlon Wayans parody Fifty Shades Of Black scheduled to be released at the same time as KFP will not be competing for family audience dollars All three KFP movies were written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger and star the voices of Jack Black and Angelina Jolie so I dont expect the quality to decline in the third installment boding well given the lack of family or sequel blockbuster opening weekend competition Investors may want to look at the other competition being released that weekend and come to their own conclusions DWAs second release will be the musical Trolls DWA owns the rights to the Danishcreated dolls with crazy hair that were once popular as penciltoppers years ago The movie features the voices of Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake which I believe is a dream team of comedic musical voice talent Kendricks musicalcomedy Pitch Perfect was one of the top movies of the past days grossing about million domestically Justin Timberlake has proven himself to be a comedicmusical genius through his popular songs with the Lonely Island featured on Saturday Night Live that went viral on YouTube The movie features the same writing team as the Kung Fu Panda movies so their historical work combined with Kendricks and Timberlakes strong aptitude to musical comedy could lead to a big new franchise for Dreamworks As consumer products produced of DWAs revenue in its most recent quarter success of a film based on historically previously popular dolls could be promising for that segment While DWA has written off some of its recent movies that is in the past The company will start the year releasing a popular sequel catering to the Chinese market while avoiding prior headaches created by the Hangover sequel It will end the year releasing a movie starring two of the best musicalcomedy talents These movies will certainly be catalysts for the stock depending on their success versus expectations With of users wanting to see Kung Fu Panda according to Rotten Tomatoes I suspect Wall Streets expectations may improve as investors forget about some of DWAs pre results Forbes reported several days ago that Netflix was the topperforming nonbiotech stock in America in increasing In order for Netflix to keep selling and maintaining subscriptions around the world it needs content Dreamworks Animation provides its feature films to Netflix and also provides animated TV series to Netflix According to DWAs most recent K in it entered into an agreement with Netflix to provide over episodes of content based on DWAs intellectual properties According to DWAs most recent Q for the quarter ended September of DWAs revenue came from Netflix For the ninemonth period ended September of DWAs revenues came from Netflix The previous statistics provide an example of how the Street could have difficulty valuing this company The percentage of revenue for any quarter will depend on whether the company releases a feature film in theaters or on DVD and digital download We see that the percentage of revenue from Netflix seems to have declined in the most recent quarter relative to the ninemonth period However if we do the math we see for the threemonth period company revenues were million for the company and million for the ninemonth period That means Netflix contributed about million per month on average for the most recent quarter versus million on average for the past nine months Perhaps some of the most recent quarterly average increase can be due to the reported July Netflix release of DWAs feature The Penguins of Madagascar So DWA has an ongoing stream of revenue from Netflix Will this stream increase in the future In DWAs recent Q conference call when discussing Netflix Katzenberg stated we see a greater opportunity first and foremost with our partners at Netflix We continue to have conversations with them about new opportunities and we do think that television is going to continue to be a meaningful expansion place for us and our business in the coming months and years meaningful Netflix isnt the only company buying programming from Dreamworks As indicated in the table above for the three months ended September DWA had about million in revenues from selling television content Dreamworks Also Active In New Media On YouTube Dreamworks also produces content for its majorityowned AwesomenessTV YouTube channel As indicated in the table above new media revenues which include AwesomenessTV were about million on the quarter So while investors in cable companies may fear cordcutting due to YouTube and Netflix Dreamworks Animation is earning revenues from content consumed by cordcutters By doing so Dreamworks has shown an ability to adapt to everchanging trends in media consumption In March Verizon announced it would launch two channels featuring over hours of DWA content In October Verizon launched Go a mobile video service designed for smartphones featuring content from the AwesomenessTV and Dreamworks brands One of the most telling comments about the future of content makers came from Verizon earlier this month When discussing a potential acquisition of Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO Verizon EVP Marni Walden was quoted by Recode as saying What I would tell you is we didnt get into the media company business just to be a singledigit market share player Thats not why we did the deal with AOL We have much bigger aspirations of how we want to grow that business A leading telecom company has ended the year telling us that it has big media aspirations Part of those include Dreamworks Animation content I believe that as consumers realize that much of what they currently do on their smartphones can be done via WiFi thanks to Apple FaceTime Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT Skype <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB messenger and other similar apps that companies that transmit communications will want exclusive content to differentiate their brands from their competition We have seen media stocks punished recently due to cordcutting concerns Dreamworks agreement with Verizon is another example of how companies that produce popular content can grow through new media As of December DWA has a market capitalization of about billion according to Yahoo Finance Last year Dreamworks Animation was the subject of mediareported takeover discussions that never materialized with Hasbro NASDAQ HAS and Sprint NYSE S majorityowner Softbank OTCPKSFTBY Jeffrey Katzenberg controls Dreamworks Animation so it cannot be taken over without his approval As mentioned throughout this piece investors may find this company difficult to evaluate due to the companys history of relying upon the success of two or three theatrical releases in a year As the company reduces these risks by diversification we can look at the companys valuation the last year it released two successful movies as a potential predictor of how it may fare in In as mentioned DWA released the globally successful but domestically disappointing Kung Fu Panda on Memorial Day weekend The companys only other feature that year was the Shrek spinoff Puss in Boots released at the end of October That film grossed about million worldwide and million domestically according to Box Office Mojo On a worldwide basis KFP was reportedly the sixth highest grossing film worldwide and Puss in Boots ranked eleventh for that year DWA earned a diluted share in According to Yahoo Finance analysts on average estimate DWA will earn in So if DWA can match its results it will beat analyst expectations by about Its film lineup costcutting and diversification suggest to me the company has the potential to beat analyst consensus Unlike Po of Kung Fu Panda wont have to bow to The Hangover and DWA has taken serious steps to build on the Chinese growth of that franchise Looking at s second release while Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayek are talented stars Anna Kendrick is coming off the musicalcomedic success of Pitch Perfect and the Lonely Island comedic music videos featuring Justin Timberlake have exceeded million YouTube views on more than one occasion According to DWAs K for fiscal year of DWAs profit that year came from feature and television productions At that time television was included in a segment called Film LibraryOther so one can speculate television was not a meaningful contributor in In the most recent quarter television accounted for about of revenues whereas feature films accounted for about of revenues Feature films also accounted for about of gross profits in the most recent quarter As calculated from the most recent Q and table above in the most recent quarter the company has accomplished the following Quarterly revenue from TV Series and Specials increased by about times yearoveryear Quarterly revenue from Consumer Products increased about times yearoveryear Quarterly revenue from New Media increased times yearoveryear and the company reported that adjusted New Media revenue increased over times Gross profit from the above segments was about million for the most recent quarter If the above three segments didnt grow but remained consistent for four quarters that would equal over million in annualized gross profit In total gross profit for the company was million So while the company earned in it has since cut costs and grown in nonfeature segments that on an annualized basis could equal in excess of million in gross profits If one wants to be more pessimistic one can look at another twoDWAfilm release year That year saw a release of the successful movie The Croods and a movie resulting in a writedown Turbo The former reportedly grossed worldwide while the latter only grossed about million worldwide As mentioned above DWA earned a share in So a analyst earnings estimate of a share seems to expect another flop Dreamworks Animation has cut costs and grown nonfeature segments in an effort to diversify its earnings Based on Dreamworks historical earnings analysts seem to expect its two releases this year to not perform well Analysts also dont seem to be giving much credit to DWAs nonfeature growing segments which have the potential to offset any feature disappointments That said recent DWA writedowns serve as a reminder to readers of the risky nature of the entertainment industry Companies that deliver content including traditional TV providers Netflix other internet and mobile video providers appear ready to differentiate themselves by obtaining exclusive content Dreamworks has navigated the evolving mediaconsumption environment to provide content to such companies Readers looking for a stock for may want to look closer at Dreamworks Animations strategy along with the potential of its January and November film releases which if successful may be catalysts to draw closer attention on this companys strategy and stock in the year ahead Editors Note This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major US
