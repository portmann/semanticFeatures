class='textDiv'>Twitter The Undervalued Social Giant Twitter Inc NYSETWTR Seeking Alpha Price per Monthly Active User lower than Facebooks lower than LinkedIns valuations Project Lightning will turn Twitter into Media hub and increase MAUs Twitters NYSE TWTR stock price has been very turbulent since its IPO in January The stock has undulated between highs of a share and has reached lows of under a share recently Ive been doing some analysis of the social giants Twitter <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB and LinkedIn NYSE LNKD Relatively speaking Twitter is very undervalued Social networks play any kind of hybrid role of recruiting grounds dating agencies media platforms newspapers advertising battlegrounds and email replacements Also who knows what roles and innovations these companies will develop in future Twitters financials vs <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and LinkedIn What Ive taken here in the revenue and user figures from the latest quarterly reports from LNKD FB and TWTR Please point out in the comments if there are any errors Then Ive taken the market capitalization of the respective networks Ive created some new ratios Price to revenue price per user and revenue per user What I think is most important is the PriceUser figure As a stockholder this is what youre paying for Youre buying users attention and expecting the network to generate revenue from this through advertising or other means Twitters price per MAU is compared to Facebooks and LinkedIns This represents a discount from Facebooks valuations and from LinkedIns Why have these valuations become as they are Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>are very similar in nature I believe People write statuses brands interact and advertise funny pictures and videos are shared And the real commodity here is attention that is being sold to advertisers While <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has grown very quickly and monetized features very well since IPOing shareholders have suddenly become very bullish Maybe over bullish Meanwhile Twitters growth has been a little slower and monetization has been slower too However both figures are still growing significantly What I think has happened is investors has become overzealous with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and overcautious on Twitter Ive included LKNDs figures for reference only I believe LinkedIn is a different kettle of fish to Twitter and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>It has huge value to recruiters salespeople and marketers because of the niche targeting and professional information base Therefore I think LKNDs higher valuation per user is justified Whats weighing on Twitters share price Recent controversy surrounding the leadership of Jack Dorsey has worried investors The founder sharing the job does worry some investors But Twitter can stand on its own two feet without Dorseys fulltime influence And I believe that when these management worries pass Twitters stock price will carry less ballast and rise The announcement for Project Lightning is exciting By rearranging tweets around events and stories Twitter has the chance to take more attention away from traditional media notably TV newspapers online media AND <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>I expect this to increase user numbers ad spending and Twitters revenue <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a saturated social giant with nearly a quarter of the worlds population on board Whereas Twitter has only a fifth of Facebooks numbers Facebooks expectations of revenue growth are very high while Twitters are very low If Twitter had the same valuation per user as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it would be at per share And if it grew to half the user base of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at the same valuation per user it would be share In fact Twitter would be a great acquisition target for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>at its current valuation If we add that into the equation that increases the expected value of Twitter significantly On many fronts I see Twitter as comparatively undervalued And as the market cools down from its selloff and readjusts I expect significant upside from Twitter over the coming months and years We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more
