Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant ISIL waves an ISIL flag in Raqqa Syria on June in a still image taken from video produced by the student group Strong WASHINGTON The US government acknowledging its limited success in combating Islamic extremist messaging is recruiting tech companies community organizations and educational groups to take the lead in disrupting online radicalization The change in strategy which took a step forward on Wednesday when the Justice Department convened a meeting with social media firms including <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Inc Twitter and Alphabet Incs Google comes despite what critics say is scant evidence on the effectiveness of such efforts The meeting was a recognition that the government is illpositioned and illequipped to counter ISIS online Seamus Hughes deputy director of George Washington Universitys Program on Extremism said after attending the event using an acronym for the Islamic State group The federal government is not best placed to counter extremist online recruitment efforts with messaging of its own said George Selim director of the Department of Homeland Security DHS office that coordinates the governments countering violent extremism CVE activities The goal now he said is to help communities and young people to amplify their own messages Those messages stem from socalled counternarrative programs underway at schools and community groups that have varying degrees of government support according to government officials and private sector experts Past campaigns by the administration of US President Barack Obama to thwart extremist propaganda globally were widely regarded as too reliant on fearbased rhetoric and graphic imagery to be effective But whether the new joint effort with the private sector will fare better remains unclear say experts in countering extremism The Obama administration has had an uneasy relationship with Silicon Valley in recent years Twitter and other tech firms have been reticent to appear too cozy with authorities on how they manage their content though most have cautiously drifted toward being more compliant over the past year <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>last year partnered with British research group Demos to examine the impact of countermessaging against hate speech in four European countries The study released in October concluded it was extremely difficult to calculate with any degree of precision whether such efforts have a real impact on longterm attitudes or offline behavior You dont necessarily know if something is going to change the way someone thinks offline but we can measure whether somebody shares that content or interacts with it Monica Bickert Facebooks head of global policy management told Reuters One of the new programs funded partly by <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and multiple government agencies underwrites peertopeer PP college courses that teach students to create their own antimilitant messaging <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>declined to say how much it was investing in the program though Selim described Facebooks overall investment in CVE initiatives as very significant Fatemah Yousef a student at Kuwait Gulf University for Science and Technology student flew to Washington this month to join a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>event showcasing countermessaging projects created by students Yousef exhibited a blog that encourages Kuwaiti students to denounce violent extremism on social media Another PP finalist a group from the University of Arkansas produced a video showing graphic Islamic State executions set to heavy metal band Black Sabbaths War Pigs Half way through the video switched to Bob Dylans The Times They Are AChangin as captions urged viewers to raise a flag against extremism After viewing the video a judge in the contest told the students that probably about to percent of the images in the video had been used in violent extremist recruitment videos Weve had this problem in other places where people try to instill fear in target audiences by showing all this mayhem but it actually does the reverse with some said the judge Quintan Wiktorowicz a former White House director for community partnerships Another effort is underway at WORDE a Muslim educational organization in Maryland which last week launched a campaign that aims to refute Islamic State messages through catchy videos and live broadcasts of discussions about mainstream Islam WORDE plans to use software or survey questions to gauge the impact of its new countermessaging campaign said Hedieh Mirahmadi the groups president Everybody creates stuff but doesnt really care about whether its connected to the science of evaluations Mirahmadi told Reuters Democratic New Jersey Senator Cory Booker told Reuters that he is working on two bills one of which has already passed committee in the Senate that would give DHS the authority to fund more college classes and research on how to best counter Islamic States slick propaganda campaigns Government messages do not prove to have that type of virality Booker said The PP program is the only private sector countermessaging initiative that acknowledges receiving training from the Federal Bureau of Investigation but a senior FBI official said the agency provides information to other nongovernmental groups whose CVErelated work may include countermessaging Some efforts avoid federal funding altogether Mohamed Magid a Virginia imam who has counseled several youth targeted by Islamic State recruiters leads an Islamic foundation soliciting donations to create a online operation that would answer each Islamic State video with peaceful messages If we say this is a government thing it might not have legitimacy Magid said Were challenging the Muslim community to say on this yourself
