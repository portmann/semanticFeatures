multipleaxises Its not only the potential to sell more to conventional vendors but now the discussion has been centered around CRAN cloud radio access network silicon opportunities Since we already know that cloud will grow gangbusters and Intel has a ton of new products to add to that effort the focus then shifts to incremental upside The good news theres even more growth potential than I had initially anticipated given the rapid adoption of major telecoms for CRAN As such I believe Intel will emerge as the largest vendor for network silicon in a relatively short period of time My price target could end up being too conservative Diane Bryant Senior VP and General Manager of the Data Center Group made a fairly compelling presentation at this years Intel NASDAQ INTC shareholder conference Of course to be fair this is the shining symbol of light for Intel as the consumer business is slowly transitioning into a GDPcomparable growth rate business whereas the Data Center continues to sprout additional legs for growth Of course Im not saying that growth rates will accelerate but I do believe the longterm CAGR assumptions could potentially accelerate After all Diane makes some wellsupported claims in her most recent presentation The adoption of cloud computing is starting to happen across all of the enduser segments for Intel However the most interesting takeaway from her presentation when pertaining specifically to the enterprise was the rapid deployment of the cloud in all of the segments Communications HPC and Enterprise IT In the next shareholder meeting next year in theyre not going to break out HPC revenue separately but rather redistribute HPC into the three main categories of cloud enterprise and communications The communication component ie the network virtualization of base stations is absolutely critical for ascertaining the momentum of the segment which I will get into a little later But basically the stagnation of revenue which weve witnessed over the past three years will no longer continue Intel is starting to push the pedal down on volume growth within the enterprise segment which has way better margins than the consumer group Theyve also observed trends in which their big cloud vendors are moving up the XeonSKU stack which implies improvement to the ASPs of just the enterprisecloud segment So while workloads are transitioning away from the enterprise into the cloud the cloud offsets this impact through pricing and usage increases Much of the growth in IaaS is through consumerfacing applications which they believe will compose an even larger percentage of the total workload mix going forward From my perspective this makes sense as mobile apps have grown at a torrid pace and quick implementation of updates and new software offerings rely on a pure cloud or hybrid cloud implementation However a lot of these startups dont have their own IT department when theyre in the initial growth phase and are often locked into a vendor at some later point Hence startups that had to build their own IT like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL Yahoo NASDAQ YHOO and Twitter NYSE TWTR are becoming increasingly less common In a sense this pattern of rapid application mobile deployment will likely continue without the need of having IT resources on hand and as such its also worth noting that the growth of cloud applications is how Intel directly benefits from mobile without having meaningful market share in the baseband modemCPU space After all servers are what communicate to clients on mobile so if mobile grows so does the enterprise The growth in consumer versus business applications will continue Hence some of the larger name software vendors that are positioned in front of commercial end users have become a smaller component of aggregated software revenue I think this dynamic creates unique opportunities for those more interested in software However theres a more predictable path to benefiting directly from consumer apps via a direct ownership position in the only major hardware provider in the space In fact Intel might as well be labeled a monopolist in this segment except they dont charge so much at the toll booth that it creates competitive pressure from wannabe market entrants So whats different with this presentation when compared to the data center day earlier in Well a lot actually Because at the prior datacenter day Intel didnt dive into much detail on which base stations would eventually migrate over into its hardware ecosystem Well now we know and its not just China Mobile NYSE CHL attempting to integrate virtual networks to save on base station space footprint But now Verizon NYSE VZ ATT NYSE T SK Telecom and Vodafone NASDAQ VOD also are jumping on the boat In the United States that represents around of the telecom market transitioning away from ASICsbased packet processing over into Intelbased hardware ie million subscribers Vodafone has a global subscriber base that spans from Europe Asia Australia Africa and small parts of South America Its like the Dutch East India company crazy stuff But basically Vodafone has million mobile subscribers as of their most recent quarterly conference Furthermore this is distributed across the entire world which million come from just India alone SK Telecom China Mobile and Telefonica NYSE TEF have million million and million subscribers respectively In total deployment of networkbased cloud should reach billionplus mobile subscribers globally over the next fiveyear timeframe According to Statista there were billion mobile subscribers in the world and of that amount Intels base station footprint will likely reach billion of those subscribers Of course this is based on figures and is not inclusive of forecast assumptions or partnerships with more telecoms down the road As of right now it seems Intel will penetrate into about of the base station TAM over the next five years which puts it on path to generate billion of the base station silicon revenue of the billion addressable market when based on their earlier datacenter presentation Of course Sandra Rivera GM of Network Platform Group mentions that this growth opportunity in the network silicon space is not included in the consolidated DCG CAGR assumption for the next five years Given the fact that the DCG composes approximately of consolidated revenue and I project it will grow to billion by FY the incremental billion in annual revenue adds upside to the outlook Furthermore billion when distributed over five years could add an incremental billion to the DCG growth This implies that the DCG alone could accelerate its growth to if we assume a rapid deployment phase in the FY timeframe However I think the ramp up of CRAN cloud radio access network will happen more substantially in the timeframe based on commentary from China Mobile at a recent conference hosted by the DellOro Group In other words worstcase scenario Intel has a phenomenal year But the best case scenario equals a Hallyuwood blockbuster year a bit of Korean humor to lighten the mood Anyhow I continue to reiterate my high conviction buy recommendation and price target However if the DCG produces blockbuster results as a result of CRAN I could see the stock
