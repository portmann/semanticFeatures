said Amazon has no competition and will easily be worth billion one day I think Mr Miller has had too many glasses of KoolAid and should open up a stand After buying cups consumers can earn one share of Amazon On October the great Bill Miller appeared on CNBC During his interview the topic of Amazon NASDAQ AMZN was raised for discussion Anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Mr Miller to explain how he valued AMZN Although I included the hyperlink to the video above I will paraphrase Mr Miller comments Mr Miller said that when AMZN came public I checked the precise date and it was May it then had a million valuation Today the valuation is billion He said since it came public AMZN has hardly sold any shares This implies that there has been no dilution Well that isnt exactly true as Amazon split its stock three times during the late s so I took a snapshot of AMZNs share count on January from its K Fast forward to June and lo and behold there are million fully diluted shares So technically Mr Miller is right that AMZN hasnt diluted equity holders by issuing shares in a large secondary offering But it has diluted share holders through the issuance of stock options million shares is nothing to sneeze at So I dont get Mr Millers point here Also Mr Bezos has a huge stake so he doesnt want to dilute his ownership percentage Moving along Mr Miller then goes on to compare AMZN to John Malones TCI and he spouts off that original shareholders who invested with John Malone made X their money and TCI never made a profit I think this is another disingenuous and hyperbolic comment as media companies are valued on EBITDA and theres also huge upfront capex and therefore DA that runs through the income statement I highly doubt TCI generated a X for investors without generating free cash flow at some point Next he says GAAP earnings dont matter and that AMZN has no competition as far as the eye can see When pressed for a specific valuation he said the following AWS is now a billion business Its growing revenues at a to clip and it deserves a X sales multiple given its lead over Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB He also said the president of AWS stated that revenues could reach billion or equal to the size of AMZNs current day web business revenues Finally he said AMZN is worth more Andrew says how much more Bill Miller said easily billion So there we have from Bill Millers mouth to Gods ears Refinance your house and bet it all on Amazon as surely it will easily be a billion company and you will get rich as a shareholder As Navy saying goes loose lips sink ships Perhaps Mr Miller just rang the bell at the top Lets spend some time on AMZNs valuation Amazons enterprise value as of Friday was as follows million fully diluted shares x billion plus billion of net debt so lets round up to billion Forget the fact that Amazon is trading at upwards of X this years cash flows from operations Lets look at how other companies are valued by the market Oracle NYSE ORCL arguably the most dominant and important software company of the old world sports an enterprise value of billion Now lets think about Bill Millers comment that Amazon has no competition Check out this article from San Jose Mercury News written October discussing The Cloud Heres an important excerpt from the article Oracle HP Cisco embrace the cloud Wait a second the great Bill Miller said Amazon has no competition Well I guess Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Oracle ORCL and HP dont count Then theres Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT that already has a cloud business and sports a billion market capitalization Oh yes and MSFT has billion in net cash I guess Bill Miller doesnt see Google Microsoft Oracle or Cisco as credible threats So we see that CRM is resting at a week high and its market cap is billion Lets look at how the market is valuing CRM on a sophisticated multiple to sales the way Mr Miller thinks HmmSalesforcecom is trading at X revenue not the X Mr Miller suggested Salesforcecom is a pure play vehicle too Perhaps AWS is only really worth X So if we split hairs and drink some more KoolAid and concede the point that AWS is valuable lets value it at billion to split the difference whats billion between friends This leaves Amazons web business and its prime membership So the market is then valuing this set of businesses at billion if we agree on the billion figure which I dont but will play along with for now Source Amazoncom FY Q As we can see Amazon is very granular in how it breaks out its sales NOT as there is media and the catch all electronics and general merchandise and of course Prime that creates the positive feedback loop Alternatively for billion I could do the following I could pay a buyout premium for the following three businesses and vertically integrate them So Ill pay billion for FedEx NYSE FDX billion for Best Buy NYSE BBY and billion enterprise value for Macys NYSE M I would then have billion to spare With the extra billion I could buy other businesses that specialize in other categories Im half kidding but trying to establish a point here Concluding Thoughts Anyway you slice it an investor needs to be five or six cups of KoolAid deep in order to comprehend Amazons valuation Perhaps Mr Bezos is the worlds greatest salesman because investors led by Bill Miller are coming up with utterly fantastic ways to justify Amazons valuation Lastly I love how die hard capitalists simply dismiss the NYTs August piece about Amazons back stabbing culture This is will end in tears I just cant tell you will any precise when the music will stop PS Here is a good article from the The Atlantic for people to understand Amazons AWS business We only use your contact details to reply to your
