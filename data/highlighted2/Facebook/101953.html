EXPE FB NFLX TRIP by Charles Lewis Sizemore CFA Running a mutual fund is a fantastic highpaying job but it is also a precarious one Most managers become closet indexers who overweight a handful of stocks and hope to beat the market by a percent or two Two of the biggest names in tech <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google are massively underowned by institutional investors relative to what their weightings in the SP Big institutional money managers tend to be the conventional sort though Im not talking about their blue power suits or country club memberships Im talking about their stock holdings Managers tend to pile into the same set of large megacap stocks because deviating from the crowd comes with major career risk Let me explain Running a mutual fund is a fantastic highpaying job but it is also a precarious one The funds success and thus the managers paycheck is directly tied to its assets under management This creates tremendous pressure to conform to a benchmark which is often the SP A managers thinking goes like this If I bet big and beat the benchmark by going outside the mainstream my investors are happy for a day or two But if I bet big and lose I might be out of a job So the result is that most managers become closet indexers who overweight a handful of stocks and hope to beat the market by a percent or two Imagine how surprised I was when I saw the following chart in the Financial Times which tracks institutional ownership of nine major tech companies Google makes the list twice so its ten stocks but just nine companies The large overweightings in Expedia EXPE and Trip Advisor TRIP arent that surprising Expedia and Trip Advisor account for just and of the SP respectively so even a small amount of institutional buying will put these stocks out of proportion to the rest And the overweighting of Netflix NFLX is also pretty understandable given that it is one of the best performing stocks in the SP this year Its near the tail end of the chart that the numbers get interesting Two of the biggest names in tech <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>FB and Google GOOGL are massively underowned by institutional investors relative to what their weightings in the SP And where it gets even stranger institutional ownership of the less favorable of Googles two traded share classes the nonvoting Class C shares GOOG is where it should be relative to its weighting in the SP Its the A shares GOOGL which actually have voting rights that are underowned Whats going on here Why are big money investors shunning <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and Google Lets look at Google first There are two issues The discrepancy between the share classes and the overall underweighting of Google stock by institutional investors The latter is the easier of the two to explain Managers dont care about the lack of voting rights because they know their votes dont matter For would be activists or corporate raiders Google is an unassailable company Its founders hold nontraded super voting class B shares that make any sort of proxy battle a virtual impossibility GOOGs consistent discount to GOOGL which has actually widened recently really makes no sense in this context so its perfectly logical for an institutional manager to overweight the cheaper GOOG relative to GOOGL As for the issue of Google being underweighted overall well it might come back to that point I made about Google being unassailable Google is not known for being particularly friendly to its shareholders see Hey Google Stop Being Such a Baby and Pay a Dividend Google is a profitable company that mints money yet its developed a reputation for being the plaything of its founders rather than a profitmaximizing business And the same goes for <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Zuckerberg is a ruthless competitor and one of the few people that seems to know how to actually make money in social media Yet <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has also burned through shareholder money on expensive acquisitions of dubious economic value Oculus Whatsapp etc and expenses grew at twice the rate of revenues last quarter Maybe While I dont see an immediate catalyst to change big money minds neither Google nor <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will be paying a dividend anytime soon sigh you could view the underownership as a contrarian value signal The safest move however might be a pair trade Short GOOGL and go long GOOG and eke out an arbitrage profit as the discount closes Source Google And <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Getting No Love From The Big Money We only use your contact
