CAGR of Intels IoT Group had a decrease in profits from to Intels NASDAQ INTC stock hit a month high of on Dec Since then it has been range bound between about and The reason for this is the sluggish sales of desktops integrating the Altera acquisition the miniscule or nonexistent sales of D NAND and the lack of growth in the highly touted IoT Products Group IoT has continued to flounder for two reasons First on the hardware side Intel is competing with companies that have been in the IoT business since before there was any IoT such as Texas Instruments NASDAQ TXN GE NYSE GE and Cisco NASDAQ CSCO Secondly and more importantly the largest profits in the IoT business going forward is in software services and data analytics none of which are Intel strong points I have described my reasoning here Intel Internet Of Things Will Not Provide Significant Sales For The Foreseeable Future and here Reasons Why General Electric Has Much Bigger IoT Potential Than Intel Does On April th Intels CEO Brian Krzanich announced Doug Davis Senior Vice President of IoT has decided to retire from Intel to devote more of his time to family friends and other interests Sounds suspiciously like he was pushed since the dreaded and wellworn devote more time to usually indicates an involuntary exit I mean the guy is and looks even younger than that Now if devote more time to was followed by his dogs his golf game and his local bartender I might believe it And it certainly wasnt Davis fault that the IoT Group has stumbled along with low growth rates I think that is directly attributable to Intels lack of meaningful IoT products and the fact that they are far down the IoT food chain I predict before long hell have another important job maybe with a company that actually has a viable product catalog to sell into the IoT market Intels IoT effort has been mediocre at best growing revenue in by a measly in an IoT devices market growing at a CAGR I use the devices segment because as of now that is the market Intel competes in The following chart is worth a thousand words and describes why I think Intels IoT future is limited What Intel sells is towards the left of this chart while the big IoT money is on the right of the chart Unless Intel buys a relatively big company that services the right side of the chart IoT will be a relatively minor source of sales and profits for the foreseeable future Or to put it more bluntly Intels IoT Group cannot come anywhere close to replacing losses which may occur in desktops or servers IoT Groups profits are a measly of desktop and server profits For better or for worse Intels intermediate future depends upon the success they have with their old warhorses desktop and server chips Between now and nothing else matters much certainly not IoT Unlike other IoT companies like GE NYSE GE Siemens OTCPKSIEGY Cisco NASDAQ CSCO and Samsung OTCSSNLF which have huge customer lists to sell to Intel has a few very large customers most of whom will be developing their own IoT approach For example in Intels latest K they list their largest customers representing of revenue HP NYSE HPQ at Dell at and Lenovo OTCPKLNVGY at Add large direct customers like Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Amazon NASDAQ AMZN and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT and you can see that Intel is not in a position to sell IoT directly to end users And unlike desktop and servers requiring x the big customers are free to choose competitive alternatives And those large IoT companies also have a huge market inside their own products This gives them a huge volume and cost advantage over Intel And commodity IoT chip margins will be lower than the legacy x products Many argue that Intel has the far superior silicon production capability and thus will always have plus gross margins I would argue that the huge impressive margins are due to the monopoly nature of the x products that represent of their revenue In the IoT chip market competition is fierce and the pricing power of Intel will be limited by the margins competitors are willing to take to move products through their fabs One only has to think of Intels mobile chip contra revenue fiasco to know that pricing and ultimately margins are not determined by Intel but by the level and intensity of the competition it faces in a given market Another example was Intels abandonment of the memory market because of low margins Intel has bid adieu to their IoT Groups manager and maybe it was voluntary and maybe it was not But regardless of that issue the fact is the IoT Groups results are disappointing with sales up only in and profits actually falling by IoT is a miniscule part of Intels revenue less than and is in a competitive market segment with low margins large wellfunded competitors and few prospects going forward Getting rid of the manager is not going to solve Intels IoT problem Intel is at this point a hold I would remain on the sidelines until I can see a more certain source of sales and especially profits falling to the bottom line But dont expect it to come from IoT Disclosure Iwe have no positions in any
