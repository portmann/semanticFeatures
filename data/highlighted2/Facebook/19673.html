INTC Includes AMD AMZN CAVM FB GOOGL MSFT QCOM by Alcaraz Research <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>has again opted to use the new Intel Xeon D server processors for its server farms Its already but the ARMy of bit server processors have yet to make any serious design wins from major data center operators The Chipzilla Intel NASDAQ INTC remains the favored processor supplier of mega server farm operators like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>NASDAQ FB Unlike the bit ARMbased server processors of Cavium NASDAQ CAVM and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD Intels x Xeon chips are getting bigbudget design wins from major hyperscale data center operators Chipzillas latest lowpower nm Xeon D SystemonChip SoC is once again inside Facebooks new Yosemite server rack design Cavium AMD and other ARMbased server processor vendors have yet to announce a major collaboration with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>The Open Compute Projects only verified winner is Intels Xeon D Yosemite microserver board design Facebooks engineers still opted to use the Xeon D in spite of the touted power savings of ARMbased server processors It is a strong hint that major server farms and data center operators rely on x server architecture The missioncritical network that serves more than billion users of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is something the ARMy cannot dream of invading this year Intel will continue to thrive in the server farms of other major data center operators like Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Google NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT These firms spent decades building their x server architecture and have custom software runningmanaging their networks Porting custom enterprise software from x code to ARM would not be cheap Even cashrich Apple NASDAQ AAPL which now designs bit ARM processors would not dare abandon the x architecture The Intel Xeon D and Xeon SoCs are less energy efficient than the Avoton Atom C Series of processors for microservers However the new W Xeon D family offers greatly enhanced performance which should help <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>meet its growing server load The issue of the higher power consumption made by Xeon serverclass chips is not a priority Performance and reliability is always the top priority of IT administrators The obvious risk is that Facebooks advertising cash cow will die if its global network goes offline due to probable errors from x code being ported to ARMbased microservers The energy efficiency of ARMbased processors is a weak reason to buy them Server farms and data centers are tapping solar power to feed the hunger of their servers Google is also using wind power for its server farms in Europe My point is that existing users of Intel Xeon server processors will continue to use them because they are reliable and proven moneymakers Fifty data centers and firms have signed up to use the new Xeon D server processors On a performance per watt basis these server farm operators apparently still believe that Intels lowpower Xeon D products offer the better deal than Caviums or AMDs ARMbased server processors As long as <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and other data center companies can find cheap solar and wind power supplies there is no compelling reason for them to experiment with servercentric ARMbased processors Sure there would be a market for cheaper ARMbased microservers from AMD or Cavium However those ARMbased products would probably cater only to small data center players <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is expanding its empire beyond social networking and advertising The new money transfer feature of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Messenger means Zuckerberg wants to transform <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>into a digital wallet and ecommerce player The increased server load and web traffic from processing digital payments and online shopping means <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>needs to build more and more server farms <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is also expanding into virtual reality games and social experience Streaming virtual reality worlds into millions of gamers will again require lots of server power <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>also wants to host news content on its site and mobile apps Hosting news content that updates every minute also exerts pressure on data center servers Facebooks ambitious empire building is great for Intel The more highermargin Xeon D chips that get sold the more money that Intel can earn to help offset the companys contra revenue on mobile chips Intels Chipzilla dominance in data centers and servers will continue for many years The chart above says the server market is a multibillion annual industry that is hugely dependent on Intels products As of Q Intels x processors accounted for of global server value in Sales of Intels x server processors have steadily increased since The RISCbased ARMy of bit ARMbased processor vendor wannabes are midgets that will take years to develop before they can hurt Intels server business Cavium AMD and other small ARM licensees do not have the marketing muscle or OEM support to challenge Intel on custom server or microserver design Qualcomm NASDAQ QCOM is the only challenger rich enough to challenge Intel on server processors However Qualcomm has yet to offer real evidence to support the rumors that it will release serverclass Snapdragon processors Qualcomm if ever it decides to engage in the server processor arena will likely fight a bloody battle Intel already showed it is willing to lose billions of dollars in mobile chips contra revenue I expect Intel to fight tooth and nail to protect its server processor sales Intel has <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and other major server farm operators in its pocket INTC therefore remains a longterm great investment My bullish outlook for Intel is supported by the predictive algorithm of I Know First INTC has doubledigit positive day and day scores on I Know Firsts forecast engine The chart below says INTC might be underpriced right now and has strong
