class='textDiv'>The Young Investors Mature Gifted Portfolio First Steps Seeking Alpha Tagging onto my previous article about receiving a gifted portfolio and initiating your finger print on it the next step is to take a hard look at the goals First I will outline my thesis and strategy that I look to enact in order to achieve the goals I have set forth By adding growth stocks to my portfolio I can use their performance to take profits and fund my dividend stocks that I wish to accumulate After receiving some great feedback and encouragement from readers within my last article titled What To Do With The Best Gift Youve Been Given about being gifted a portfolio I decided to continue the theme of detailing my portfolio changes and inner workings What prompted me to continue on this subject the most was the realization that both younger investors like myself as well as older investors near retirement can potentially benefit from my investment decisions I am happy to realize that even the older generation would like to see what I invest in and what drives my portfolio as a young investor Typically the investing world says if youre young go aggressive and subsequently be risk tolerant while the older investor should move toward conservative steady gains with dividend income I am learning that this doesnt have to be the case Theres nothing wrong with the young investor being invested into businesses with histories of steady growth steady dividends and dividend growth while the older investor doesnt need to avoid all young high growth companies that can supercharge their portfolio capital wise While I am interested in adding high growth and technology driven stocks to my portfolio I am also interested in compounding my dividend growth and long dividend history companies with more of the same My intention is to use the rapid growth stock investments to fuel the underlying steady dividend paying companies With the profits from the growth centered investments I seek to buy more of what has worked for me namely well run profitable blue chip companies The strategy I plan to use and have already begun to deploy begins with a small amount of new cash along with profits I took on my overweight stocks to initiate the growth stock investments This capital will begin the high growth investments that will hopefully grow at a faster pace than slow yet well established companies which can be used to siphon profits into new dividend producing positions For some of my growth stock additions I have zeroed in on businesses that are closer to my direct understanding as a mid to late s investor as well as in my field of technology expertise as a professional Why Because it is good to know what you are investing in It is especially helpful when you have the knowledge of the product workings or the way the company operates in order to better understand the underlying business and the companys profit potential Furthermore with the higher risk involved with newer still rapidly growing companies it requires a keen understanding of where they are headed and what their product means to the current generation in order to fully understand the risk or lack of risk Now with all of that said have I and will I always follow my own advice Probably not Thats because as a young investor I havent experienced absolutely everything the market or the businesses that are public have to offer or not offer me I may stray from my thesis above at times but my foundation and my goal still remains the same I may go about achieving that goal in a varying manner than the sound strategy I laid out above but I hope to maintain that line of thought throughout my younger years Knowing my goals and strategy we can move onto seeing some of my first decisions and my overall portfolio Even though I was of legal age to invest I had not immediately moved my gifted holdings to a brokerage account Instead I decided to keep them where they were still in their DRIP accounts and open a brokerage account to initiate my first of age investment That first investment was <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>when it IPOd in May of I decided this was my first investment with new cash and in something that I knew well and related to me as a something as well as a technology focused graduate <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>was something that you could say I grew up with I technically grew up in the Myspace days but during high school that came to rise and then fell pretty quickly as far as popularity goes <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>gained traction in my late high school years and became an invaluable tool for someone going away to college a place where I knew absolutely no one I understood how it worked what it did for my peers and me and what it could do given the time and expansion of its services When I heard about their plans to IPO in early I decided to take a closer look at their business aspect because I knew they had entire generations in their ecosystem I needed to understand how they will benefit and what can they do to generate profits Without turning this into a <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>analysis I realized that they had the information of many many people around the world and it was all given to them <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>for free The story behind Mark Zuckerberg and how he developed this product allowed me to have confidence that he could lead the company into profitability and expansion of their offerings I decided to put some new money into this IPO and bought shares on IPO day Fortunately or unfortunately I was part of that NASDAQ debacle but eventually got my shares not quite at the price I was looking for but as the price went down shortly after the IPO I averaged down some more and had an average I could live with Looking back the investment has paid off by returning over roughly recently as FB overcame the mark I still maintain all of my originally purchased shares and have not siphoned any profits off yet I still see a hefty amount of growth in the companys future and do not plan on taking any off the top as of now Hilton Worldwide Holdings NYSE HLT Straying from the technology and youthful theme that I purchased above I came across an opportunity in Hilton Hotels You might notice in your own research that Hilton IPOd in December of This is an over month period between my first purchase of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>and this purchase of Hilton My strategy is not to overdo the new cash infusion especially if I cannot afford it Being a college graduate and paying off my student loan debt does not allow me to have the cash flow to put thousands of dollars into each purchase let alone doing it every other month But my young investor friends you have something on your side time You can be patient dont feel like you need to invest every week or every month Take the time to research each of your investments for as long as you need in order to make an educated and responsible investing decision When I found out in November of that Hilton had filed their IPO after being brought private by Blackstone Group NYSE BX I decided to take a deeper look To start Hilton is a world renowned company even if one is not very familiar with the hotel or lodging industry While the company had a lot of debt on the books I felt like the management that was coming out of private holding and the growth that was projected for the company was solid and worth an investment So far that has proved right and continues to grow at a solid pace Since my investment on the day of IPO I am up in that short amount of time This one falls in my midgrowth and not my highgrowth category like <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>Ill be looking for this growth stock to maybe transform itself into a dividend payer down the road and let it do its own morphing within my portfolio My next investment comes back to technology but in a different way Perceptron makes noncontact measurement devices used to scan large objects such as cars during the manufacturing process They also make the software to control the devices and create quality control solutions for these industrial applications When this first crossed my radar in early I was intrigued by the small market cap but still long history of the company After digging deeper I found that there was a management change that had happened several months prior I read what the new CEO Jeff Armstrong had to say and it sounded like a solid plan to move the company into a more diversified business as well as grow their top line Since PRCP has such a small market cap and small revenues the stock has been volatile between its earnings reports Their backlog and deployment of orders varied quarter by quarter because their main customers were not ready to take receipt of their orders when the company expected them to The new CEOs plan was still being implemented so I knew this would take time to diversify themselves away from a few customers in only a select few industries Additionally I wanted to diversify my portfolio with small cap holdings as they could do well for my growth strategy Just this year the company announced the acquisition of two companies that will further their diversification plans The acquisition includes Coord Industries which makes coordinate measurement machines and Next Metrology Software which develops CMM software According to Perceptrons CEO Coord is a leading innovative supplier of a full range of CMMs with a growing global customer base Notably it is one of only two companies in the world able to design and manufacture gantrystyle CMMs used to measure very large equipment such as aircraft wings complete car bodies and railcar frames By combining the full range of Coords CMMs with Perceptrons laser scanners and Next Metrology easytouse TouchDMIS CMM operating software Perceptron moves into a market leadership position able to offer pricecompetitive fully integrated CMM solutions worldwide This to me seems like solid execution on their multifaceted plan to diversify and bring in revenues from other sources I believe once their plan is fully in place their revenues will not only even out but also increase dramatically As for my holding I initiated a purchase at the end of January of and decided this would be a multipurchase holding in order to average down my cost basis Knowing that the stock would fluctuate significantly every quarter I initiated a investment first and then waited till March to initiate another while in June I initiated the remaining to fill out my position I also received a small dividend from the company in the meantime which was used in part to purchase the remaining Now nine months later Im at breakeven but patiently waiting for the company and stock to begin its upward movement following more good news in the next earnings report At this point I decided to move my gifted holdings into my brokerage account with the above three holdings already sitting there I think an assessment at this point in the process is prudent and necessary I will stop short of showing the transaction of selling the portion of Johnson Controls NYSE JCI that I outlined in the previous article though This will allow me to continue explaining the rest of my investments in a later article starting with that transaction Since Im rearward looking up to this point I can define checkpoints in my investment process to better explain it to my readers Now let me show you what my holdings looked like in my portfolio at the time of bringing in those gifted holdings using the below table As you can see its starting to build out to higher growth and more technology related stocks While still small in their overall percentage of my portfolio they had only just begun to make their impact in my hands Keep in mind that I havent even rebalanced the portfolio by selling a portion of the JCI holding that I mentioned above Once this occurs it will allow the portfolio to equalize and allow for new holdings to have more of an impact As you can see I favored some IPOs here in these beginning investments You may be asking why though if you are still conscious about risk Its actually a good question and a question that will keep me in check with my thesis Since I am able to better relate to some of these companies <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>is a good example I can assess the risk more solidly and get a better understanding than say someone near retirement who may not understand the impact of <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>or saw it grow and build through its early years The other side is that companies looking to IPO are primed for growth which is why they file to IPO and raise funds to launch their next capital intensive move Obviously a company that IPOes is new to the public market and puts a lot of weight on the management to perform This is the risk that I take but have taken an educated investment into them and will allow the opportunity for their growth and subsequently my investment As with <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>it has paid off handsomely by doubling my investment with still plenty of growth left Hilton while having an IPO is not in an industry that is young and primed for growth However their own company history has allowed for them to work on coming out of debt and has raised new capital to both pay it down and to grow their presence around the world thus still having room for growth and growth potential This is setting me up for a staggered growth portfolio In other words <span style='background-color: #A9E2F3'>Facebook </span>will reach the point of taking profits sooner than Hilton but Hilton has allowed me to stagger those profits out over a longer period of time Perceptron will be a wild card in this equation as being a small cap stock it has the potential to take off much faster than the others or not at all Therefore I must play this one by ear and watch it closely Overall I can stick with my strategy to skim profits and put them aside to invest in those solid dividend companies that I talked about at the beginning However at this stage I am not ready to do that with these investments But as I said earlier I will discuss the cash from my JCI transaction along with where that will be invested in my next article Source The Young Investors Mature Gifted Portfolio First Steps Disclosure The author is long FB HLT PRCP JCI
